I have 3 cards, all at 80% utilization. I have enough cash to pay down one card completely, or I could spread out the payment on all 3 and decrease the utilization for each card. Which method would raise my credit score the most?

EDIT: I should have mentioned that all 3 cards are on zero % intro apr periods, so interest rate isn't really a factor here.",finance

personalfinance,"Looking to take back control on credit card interest and build a stronger financial future faster. Currently thinking a debt consolidation loan is best, but open to advice.","Alright, I don't have a ton of time, so let me try to be quick.  Due to a combination of being a bit careless with money when younger, but mostly due to me being unemployed for a stretch (and still underemployed, but I'm still looking for a better position, in line with what I used to make), credit card debt has piled up.  I'm married, I have one card in only my name with about 20k on it, my wife and I have a join card with close to 20k on it, and my wife has a personal card with about 15k on it.  We also owe about 20k more on our vehicle, and my wife still has a fair amount of college debt left (but that's very low interest, so it's not a priority).  Grand total of 75k in \[Edit: high interest\] debt.  Our yearly income is around 90k.

Despite all this, we are still doing alright (thanks to me having a full time job again, for the past year).  But we're mostly treading water.  I keep getting mail saying I'm pre-approved for loan consolidation, sometimes even offering very low interest rates (about 4 percent or so).  Is this a good option?  Obviously, finding a job in line with what I used to make (about 35k more per year than my current position) would help immensely, but that could take a while, or (gulp) maybe even never happen again.  In the meanwhile, assuming I pay off these high interest credit card with the loan consolidation, and don't maintain a balance on the cards again, we should be saving a fair amount of money per month.We can split the savings between boosting our small emergency fund, and paying off her credit card faster.

Advice welcome.  I can post more details about the companies offering the loans tomorrow, I'm curious (assuming the debt consolidation loan is my best bet) what companies are reputable.  I qualify for USAA, and I've generally heard good things about them, but I haven't spoken with a rep yet (from them, or any of the other companies that have mailed me).

Thanks in advance everyone.",finance
btc,I don't like Avalanche because...,"(Not because I am the most knowledgeable technical expert, but because...)

1. I want no deviation at all from the principle of hashpower deciding, also known as nakamoto consensus. This is really the invention that made cryptomoney possible.

2. We don't need absolutely safe 0-conf transactions. What we have is better than any non crypto payment system in this regard. Finality starts out fairly good with 0-conf for small transactions, increases in 10 minute intervals (never reaches mathematical 100% finality but who cares)

Bitcoin doesn't record ordering for 0-conf or not even for 1 or 2 confirmations, bad but that is what we have.

If you got a million from the IRS in error, they don't wait for you to send it back, they reverse it.

Currently only 1 conf is needed in bitcoin, a few more in bitcoin cash to be faily safe for most transactions. Card payments 3 months, checque until you cash it or find out it bounces, maybe even more if the bank regard the cheque to be fraudulent, inter bank transfer minutes or hours (unless the bank changes its mind), international bank transfer days, even fiat paper notes are worse with travel time (you have to meet), and counting takes time, danger of counterfeit notes. Apparently the federal reserve has a real time payment system that is immediately final, but only for bank customers.

If someone really needs immediately final small transactions, I want them to rely on a third party service, like an insurance agency, and maybe we already have it in Bitpay and their likes. Heck, even lightning could be useful!

An avalanche without orphaning, just the advice to miners would not be dangerous, but then it would also not completely solve the problem.

So TLDR; please don't implement Avalanche",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,"Someone mistyped two numbers, my credit score dropped over 100 points, and now I don't qualify for the mortgage I want...","I'm in the process of buying a house (closing March 21). I've planned for this for about 5 years now. I've worked to improve my credit dramatically (was considered *excellent* as of a week ago), I've saved over 20% for a down payment and I qualified for an excellent interest rate. I was pre-approved for my loan, and was in the process of locking in the interest rate. They checked my credit one last time and found a new credit issue - an unpaid medical bill of some sort.

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, I was able to track down the source of this issue: I went to the doctors in 2018 and had some lab work done. The bill for this work was sent to my insurance, who were unable to verify my account and refused to pay it. A bill for $500 was sent out to me, I never received it, and as a result never paid the bill and it was promptly sent to collections. My credit rating dropped over 100 points. I no longer qualify for that fantastic interest rate.

&amp;#x200B;

I have since discovered that the doctor's office has my address wrong. They provided this address to the lab, which used it to try and bill me for the service - but I never got it. I live in Example St. Unit 123, however they sent the bill to Example St. Unit 213. Someone, somewhere, flipped two numbers...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I reached out to the collections. I negotiated with them to remove this from my credit report if I paid it. It's $500, so I paid it outright. However, I don't think this will be removed from my credit in time for closing (if it's actually *that* easy) . The loan officer basically gave me two options: take the higher interest rate (as a result of my dropped credit scores), or go for the 15 year fixed at an even lower interest rate (3.75%). I think I can afford the 15 year, however I'd really like the 30 year (paying off at a 15 year rate) just for the flexibility (what happens if my employment changes?)

&amp;#x200B;

So, any ideas what I should do next? Closing was supposed to be in about 30 days. This all sort of puts me in a bind, just because someone typed two wrong numbers...

personalfinance,Can we afford to buy? Should we pay student loans off? Thoughts?,"My husband (24) and I (22) are considering purchasing a home this summer. We currently rent a 2bd/2ba apartment at $600.00/month in a low cost of living area in Missouri. While living in this cheap apartment has provided us with an incredible opportunity to save, we're getting *really* tired of the place. I miss having a yard, I miss being able to hang things on walls, I miss being able to host a party, and I miss the times where I didn't have to hear our snoring neighbor through paper thin walls (ugh!).

I know it'd be possible to find a nice place in the $150K range, but our max budget is ~$200,000.00. With no kids and no pets, I don't see the need for a massive house.

**Here's our primary assets/debts:**

Item|Amount
:--|:--                                  
Combined income before taxes|$104,000.00/yr ($53K + $51K)

Car Loan|$15,000.00 at @ 1.90% (2018 Honda Civic, not underwater)
Credit Card Debt|$0.00

No other debt obligations. Both credit scores are 740+. We've been going to open houses and daydreaming, but haven't gotten a realtor or spoken with any lenders. We've been told that there's generally more inventory in the spring and summer months in our area, so we've just been sort of waiting a bit while we save more money.

We're also really indecisive about the student loans. At 3.50%, I'm not sure we should be in a rush to pay them off with mortgage rates being a full percentage point higher. It seems better to use this money towards the home purchase. What do you think? Should we try to put 20% down, or go with less and have a bit more padding?",finance
personalfinance,Getting my finances straight.,"I would like to get some input from a few other people on what my next moves should be. So heres a brief overview of my current financial situation.

I'm a 24 year old college student

&amp;#x200B;

I have a credit score of +/- 742

I have a few credit cards with varying rates and balances.

Card 1 has a balance of  $2650 at a rate of 17.1% - $50 minimum

Card 2 has a balance of $350 at a rate of 23% - $35 minimum

Card 3 has a balance of $2500 at a rate of 20% but no interest for 15 months - Haven't received first bill, not sure the exact minimum.

Card 4 has no balance or annual fees.

I have a car loan of $10,000 at 3.75% $210/mo for 4.5 years

I have student loans of $20,250 varying from 3.8-5% on deferment (about half of these are subsidized)

&amp;#x200B;

I have a life insurance policy with a guaranteed interest rate of 3% with a balance of $1400 and I put in $100 monthly

I have a CB&amp;T Cust Roth IRA with a balance of $2000 in a combination of mutual funds/bonds

I have approximately $2700 in cash to start paying some of these bills

I have an income of +/- $10,000 annually

Where would you rate my financial health

What would you guys recommend that I do with the current cash on hand?

personalfinance,Purchasing a home in NorCal,"I recently moved to the SF Bay Area for a new job. As everyone knows, housing prices are nuts here so I wanted to hear other viewpoints on this topic.

I’ll be purchasing a home in the next 6 months for certain (part of my benefits package).

I can either buy a home that I can see myself and family for 20 years at the very limit of what we can afford or go into a starter home and stay for 5-7 years until my kids have grown up a bit.

If I choose the former, I would do a 30 year mortgage.  I can still save about 25k a year in cash. My company also contributes about 30k a year to my retirement fund.  Both numbers should grow 3-5% yearly.

 If I do the latter, I would buy a house roughly 60% of the former and do a 15 year mortgage. I can save about 50-60k a year in cash.

By my estimation, I could have about 100k more in cash plus whatever additional amount in home equity after ~5 years if I go into the cheaper home. 

This is very enticing except we would have to move in 5 years. At that time seller fees would be roughly 50k.

Also complicating the situation is that this next mortgage will have very low interest rates (company helps on first mortgage after move). I would not get this 0.5 to 0.75% interest discount on my next mortgage.",finance

investing,CDS on bonds with negative intrest,"Intrest rate of several government bonds from Europe has been pushed to negative territory by monetary policy of ECB.  These bonds are in bilance of Central banks, life insurance companies, speculators expecting that ECB will lower yield in negative theritory or are just used as a bet for currency movement. So... 

Basic principe of CDS is that I buy insurance for a bond and iam also paying commission on level near the intrest rate of that bond. 

So my hypothesis is, if i would buy CDS on negative interest bond, shouldn't the seller pay me commission? Also if ECB intrest would rise in future and price of these bonds fall, the price of CDS should be in negative correlation. The only risk should be, ECB will set interest rate to negative territory, and price of this bond will raise, then value of my CDS would be lower. 

My questions are.. 

It is working like that or I have to pay commission for negative yields as for the normal?

MachineLearning,[D] Is there any algorithm that can find signals between two or more time series trends that correlate to a change in another time series trend,"If I have many time series trends (call them the x values) relating to some other trend (y value), and there is some theory that certain combinations of the values in the x's cause a change to y, is there any model I can train that will then produce more informative, descriptive features of when these occurrences occur.

An example would be Technical Analysis in Stock Market Trading. Can I build a model that will take in many Technical Indicators of a given stock, and learn to produce features from combinations of these indicators that correlate to the stock price changing? It would be useful to train a model to create new features based on how these signals in the technical indicators effect the stock price, and then feed these produced features into another model that would learn to use them to predict the stock price.

Secondly, is all of this unnecessary? If I just fed all of this data into a neural net, for example, it should theoretically learn these signals anyway. However, I just have some intuition that my described method would be more effective as it would force the second model to focus on these signals.",technology

personalfinance,"30-Day Challenge #3: Prepare your tax return accurately and file early (March, 2019)","# 30-day challenges

We are pleased to continue our 30-day challenge series. Past challenges can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/30daychallenges).

This month's 30-day challenge is to **Prepare your Tax Return Accurately, and File Early**. 

You've successfully completed this challenge once you've filed your US federal income tax return by March 31st.

Recommended Steps:

###Plan
1. **Learn how US income taxes work:**
* Watch [Basics of US income tax rate schedule](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/core-finance/taxes-topic/taxes/v/basics-of-us-income-tax-rate-schedule)
* Watch [Tax deductions introduction](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/core-finance/taxes-topic/taxes/v/tax-deductions-introduction)
* Read /r/personalfinances's very own [wiki page on income tax](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/taxes)
* *Understand* what exactly your tax return is: A form you fill out, telling the government how much money you made, calculating how much taxes you owe on that money (your ""tax liability""), and ""squaring-up"" with the government: Figuring out if you already paid more than your actual tax liability throughout the year with paycheck withholdings (in which case you will get a tax *refund*), or if you haven't paid enough throughout the year, and owe a balance to the government.
2. [Determine your filing status](https://www.irs.gov/uac/what-is-my-filing-status) and determine whether you can be claimed as a dependent by anyone (for example, your parents), or can claim any dependents. ([IRS Dependent Tool](https://www.irs.gov/uac/who-can-i-claim-as-a-dependent))
3. **Prepare a ""map"" for what documentation you will need to fill out your tax return**, then go through the list and make sure you have the documentation for each. **Don't worry if you forget something.** The software you use to fill out your tax return (or the tax return form itself) will remind you of things you might have forgotten.
* Jot down every possible way you made money this year (remember, even if you don't get a form, you still need to report it):
    * paycheck from my job (W-2 form)
    * interest on my bank account (personal records like your December account statement, or a 1099 form)
    * dividends from my stock (1099-Div)
    * income from my small business or self employment (personal records, or 1099 form)
* Make a list of all the possible deductions you might think you are eligible for, and make sure you have documentation:
    * mortgage interest you paid (1098)
    * student loan interest you paid (1098-E)
    * education expenses (1098-T)
    * state or local income taxes (W-2)
    * charitable contributions (personal records)

### Prepare and file your Tax Return
**Using one of the following methods**

1. See if you are eligible for [completely free tax return preparation software](https://www.irs.gov/uac/free-file-do-your-federal-taxes-for-free) sponsored by the IRS
2. Use paid (or free) tax return preparation software. Examples: TaxAct, TurboTax, CreditKarma, AARP, FreeTaxUSA, TaxSlayer. [See our megathread for discussion.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/search?q=title%3A%28Tax+Filing+Software+Megathread%29&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=year)
3. ""Manually"" fill out the tax return form online using [IRS Free Fillable Forms](https://www.irs.gov/uac/free-file-do-your-federal-taxes-for-free)

By starting early, it allows you more time to deal with unanticipated questions about your tax return. ""Wait, can I claim my girlfriend as a dependent""? ""Do I have to report income from renting out the spare room in my house to a friend?"". When these come up, feel free to create [a new post](https://old.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/submit?selftext=true) asking for help with as much details as you can provide.",finance

I have found a vehicle I would really enjoy to purchase, a 2015 with 65k miles for $9000. My current financial situation worries me that I will be unable to obtain any type of loan.

I am a senior in college, I have not worked in college due to savings from before, help from parents, and student loans. I will be going to graduate school next year and will be a salaried employee. I am looking for a job now to save up for an apartment and to pay rent during the summer. 

I recently began refereeing hockey during weekends, earning about $250 each weekend. I have paid my rent all the way through June so I have $0 monthly expenses until then. My girlfriend will be contributing $80 towards the car monthly, bringing my expected monthly payment to $120, which is easily doable using my money made from refereeing. 

My main concerns are that I have not received my first check from reffing yet. We are paid every 6 weeks and I will not receive it for another 3 weeks. I could provide proof in my online schedule of past games reffed and games scheduled for over the next 2 weeks with the pay rates. Even with that my income is just a few hundred over my rent, even though I have paid it for the next few months already.

** NOTE**
I wouldn't buy IFF today.

**HOW I USE THIS:** 


1) All the stocks identified in the table are qualified as “BUY” opportunities.

2) I focus in the column “Success Rate(3m)” which shows the precision of the agents in the last 3 calendar months. I personally feel most comfortable with Rates 0.8 or higher. 

3) Then, I see the number in “Tx(3m)” which represents the number of transactions that the agents predicted for this stock in the last 3 months. I prefer stocks that have had at least two transactions during this period. 

4) Finally, I look at Growth(3m), if the agents have had a considerable growth (&gt;5% in 3 months) then I follow that trade. 

5) If a row in the table is colored green then it means that stock has been on the rise today so I purchase it immediately in order to ride the wave up. On the other hand, if the row is colored red, then I wait out until very close to market close to purchase the stock and let the price bottom out before climbing up again tomorrow.


6) After I purchase the stocks, I ALWAYS set a stop loss order at -2.5% from my buying price valid for the day. I think this is good hygiene, no matter how confident I am of my system, I still want to make sure that my losses are capped. I update this stop loss order every day. 


**BACKGROUND**

I am not a financier or economist. I am electrical engineer with equal passion in artificial intelligence and financial markets. For the past 2 years I have been working on a system that would make short term predictions of stocks. The system is rather complex, I use multiple layers which include: Convolutional Neural Networks, LSTMs and Genetic Algorithms. All bulked together produce an output like in this image. The way to interpret the image is a follows: Symbol and Date columns are self explanatory, Quorum refers to autonomous agents that decide whether to BUY/NOT BUY or SELL/HOLD a stock. Each symbol has 9 agents, and the Quorum column, counts the number of agents that recommend Buy, Selling or Holding the stock. The “Not Owned” column means: if you don’t own this stock then you should … The “Owned” column means: if you own this stock you should HOLD or SELL. The column “Growth(1 Year)” refers to what what has been the growth of this system of Agents in the past calendar year. The column “Tx(1Yr)” shows the number of full transactions that these agents recommended in the last calendar year. “Factor” is just the division of Growth divided by Transactions to get the average growth per transaction. Finally “Success Rate” shows how successful these agents have been in their recommendations in the past calendar year, success 1 means 100% successful, 0.5 means 50% successful, and so on.

Many people have been curious about the actual process that the system follows, so here it is: for every symbol (600 stocks are analyzed daily), we get the full stock data (open,close,high,low,volume) for the past 4 months. Each stock is associated with another set of “lookalike” stocks as well as major ETF’s. This initial dataset is run through a convolutional layer that extracts an undisclosed number of features. These features are then passed onto a recurrent neural network (LSTM) where sequences and patterns are extracted. The LSTM then spits out probabilities for the likelihood that this stock will have a positive, negative and neutral tendency in the next N days. These probabilities are then fed to a genetic evolution system (GES). This system essentially checks the predictions for the past N days and compares them with reality, following that the systems knows which predictions are performing the best. Once the system knows which stocks are being simulated the best, then the system automatically finds which of these best performing stocks have the biggest potential for the next few days. The system does not output explanations, unfortunately us humans are not capable of understanding (or visualizing) a problem of this dimensionality, for example the LSTM part alone works with over 10 million dimensions, not features but dimensions.

personalfinance,Extra withholding for Fed AND State taxes?,"Hi everyone! Need some advice.

I'm going through a divorce, have custody of my 3 kids and next year will be the first year i'm filing taxes on my own as head of household.

I make about $60K a year at my full time job, where i'm doing Married filing single, with 3 deductions.

I have a part time job making about $800/month in cash (Paypal pmts).

I'd like to change my withholding at my full time job to cover the taxes on my part time job. 

Two questions:

1. How much extra to withhold per week? I was thinking $75 to be safe
2. Do I need to withhold for Federal and State? And how much for each? (I'm in MD) i.e. $45/Fed and $30 State?

personalfinance,[xpost tax] ISO exercise - check my math,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

I've been involved with startups for years without much luck in terms of exits, but it looks like we may make it out of the IPO gates this year and I've been researching the tax implications.  I'll probably end up consulting a tax professional ( referrals appreciated for the SF area ) but I wanted to check my basic understanding.

&amp;#x200B;

**Assumptions:**

Options granted +4 years ago

ISO Options: 100,000

Strike Price: $1

Fair Market Value: $5

Assumed Value at IPO + 6 mo ( lock up ): $20

Est Fed Tax Rate: 37%

Long Term Cap Gains: 20%

&amp;#x200B;

**Scenario 1**: Exercise/Sell on same day after IPO + lockup

Cost to purchase options: $100,000

Federal Tax: (value - strike) \* options \* tax rate = ( 20 - 1 ) \* 100000 \* .37 = $703,000

Net amt: 2,000,000 - ( 100,000 + 703,000 ) = **$1,197,000**

&amp;#x200B;

**Scenario 2**: Exercise and hold.  Sell after lockup

Cost to purchase options: $100,000

AMT: ( FMV - strike ) \* options \* est tax rate = ( 5 -1 ) \* 100000 \* .37 = $148,000

Long term cap gain tax: ( Value - FMV ) \* options \* ltcg rate = ( 20 - 5 ) \* 100000 \* .20 = $300,000

Net amt: 2,000,000 - (100,000 + 148,000 + 300,000) = **$1,452,000**

&amp;#x200B;

Does that look about right, and if so are there any general strategies for reducing my tax burden?  I've heard of some people looking into crazy options like moving to London for a year to avoid the taxes but I'm assuming for now that this is too good to be true.",finance
personalfinance,"How much sooner can I payoff my Mortgage my adding extra monthly, or a one time payment?","I used on online calculator to compute the effect of adding extra money to each payment.

Current balance is 94.4K. The interest rate is 3.125. I have 9 years remaining on a 15 year loan.

Extra payment scenarios (as per a online calculator):  

* If we added 500/month, it would be paid off  in 6.1 years.
* If we added 1000/month, it would be paid off in 4.6 years.

* If we made a one time payment of $25k, when would it be paid off?

personalfinance,Am I wrong in not taking debt consolidation offer.,"Long story short I am about 10k in credit card debt, down from over 20k. I am making leaps of progress, but I’m tired of paying the interest. So I started looking into getting a personal loan to pay of the debt and keep the interest low. 

A lot of people recommended lending club so I checked them out, applied for a loan and got approved for 10k but at a 30.33% interest rate plus a $600 origination. 


Right now I am paying an interest rate of 18.99% on my credit card. 

It seems like keeping the debt on the card would be better, right? I’m just having a hard time wrapping my mind around a personal loan with a higher interest rate than credit cards. am I missing something? 

I’m also looking into getting a zero interest balance transfer card but my credit score is not quite there yet to make that happen. Hoping to do that soon though.

personalfinance,Is my paycheck amount wrong?,"I recently started a new job. Today is my first payday and I think my check amount is incorrect.

My check today was for $200, and the check stub is showing $100 deducted for state and federal taxes.

To me, the offer letter clearly states that I would receive $300 (example) **after** (net) all taxes. So either my check is short, or my offer letter was incorrect from the start.

Throwaway to stay safe.  
Start off with saying I am in Europe and in my twenties. Today a member of my familiy approached my with an offer, they own an appartement and are thinking about selling it so they approached me and asked me if I would be interested.  
Let's get some rough numbers in first. Rent is around 350€, expenses including insurance and utilities is around 150€, my income is roughly 1300€ per month of which I am able to safe up on average 200€. The appartement is probably worth roughly 30000€ and they are offering it to me for 26000 at an interest rate of 2.7%. I would pay around 200€ a month as down-payment for the appartement with the option to pay more if I want to. All of this sound extremely good and enticing but I am quite a catious person and it would be putting all my eggs in one basket. In the future I am however projected to make a lot more money, I am currently debt free, have a 5-month emergency fund and around 10.000€ stored away in a long time investment set up by my parents. I would really like to hear some opinions on this whole thing, it is a really good offer and it's not fishy or anything they are just not in the mood to handle a property anymore and would be glad to give it away to someone they know. I still don't really earn a lot and am not experienced with real estate so before I step into bad traps I am asking you all for help! Thank you in advance.",finance

Here's my situation. I'm 44 with 28,000 in debt on an income of 52,000 a year. I'm trying to get my finances in order. $25000 of the debt is a personal loan and the other $3000 is a credit card.

Loan 2: Balance of 14,709.54 at an interest rate of 8.890% - Payoff date in 2032

Any clever things I can say to a service rep to reduce the interest I owe?","I put every expense I possibly can on my credit card, and pay it off at the end of the month. It's great - I use a no-annual-fee cash-back card, and by paying off monthly I never pay interest.

But, back in December I wasn't quite able to pay off the whole thing (holidays + travel), so I decided to just pay most of it. I did so by monkeying with the auto payment settings on my account (changed the ""pay full statement balance"" to ""pay $X"")

I thought that was for just the one month, but apparently I screwed it up, and I'm now in my 4th month of a dramatically growing CC balance. (I was actually pretty proud of my increasing bank account balance. I thought I was being frugal! Nope, just not paying the credit card bill)

Anyway, the amount of interest I accrued was shocking. Like 5x what I would have expected. It turns out my interest rate is 27% - which I'd never really noticed since I pay off every month. I called customer service, and they lowered my interest rate to 24% (still seems crazy high), and more or less laughed at me when I asked for some forgiveness on the interest payments.

Anyone out there ever have any success getting a CC company to forgive interest payments? How about getting lower interest rates?

I had only 3 weeks PTO and 3 weeks of short-term disability and used up my 3k I had set aside for maternity expenses. I came back to work in December and I’m just starting to catch up financially. I have been living paycheck to paycheck for a long time but with working overtime and my tax return coming in soon I am trying to tackle my debts. 

Here is a general estimate of my monthly expenses and it’s obviously not complete because I have no idea what I spend on food and misc. I have made big strides by no longer wasting money on things like renting or buying movies, buying random new clothes, video games etc. I hope in March to create more of a list/spreadsheet to track my spending. 

Income:

* Average weekly take home income $1100 
* (this changes depending on the amt of patients I take from 950 to 1300 dollars per week) 
* 200$ per month from SO 
* = $4600 per month 
* Tax return ~5k with child tax credit 

Expenses: 

* Rent $950
* Utilities $70
* Internet $40
* Renters Ins $12 
* Hulu $12.90
* Plated 43$ per week
* Amazon HBO $15.76
* Gas ~25$ per week 
* Baby food $170
* Diapers $50
* Misc baby items $200
* Car Payment $ 475
* Food? $300
* = ~$2550
 


My parents are currently paying for a family plan for phone and car insurance so I’m not sure at some point that will probably change to me getting my own plan but I do not pay that at the moment. 


Debts:
 
* Visa $916 APR 13.15% minimum payment $28.00
* Autoloan $25,507 APR 2.9% minimum payment $457.39
* Chase Southwest Rapid Rewards $4,800 25.24% minimum payment $162.00
* Medical debt $400 – Just paid ✓

I have been prioritizing paying my Chase card since it is the highest interest rate and been putting about 2-300 dollars on it per week. It used to be close to 7 grand. Everything else I have been doing minimum payments. My goal is to eliminate my debt and save 30k to put down on a townhome. 

My car expenses are related to my work – I provide home health care and my car is my office. I need something reliable, compatible with Bluetooth/apple maps, safe, secure, AWD capable etc. I bought a Subaru crosstrek last year and plan to keep it for at least 10 years. I’m not sure if I could write anything off on taxes for work expenses? They already pay me my miles I travel for work as tax-free income. 

Any insights on how much money I should be putting down on these debts and in what order would be great and a plan for amount of money I could be putting into savings per month.

I call again and this time they wernt so eager to refund me the money and I was on the phone for an hour and kept getting transferred. They kept claiming were were accessing and using the subscription, which we weren't. It turns out there's an option on your account to auto-renew subscriptions which I had no idea about and don't believe I ever turned it on. They kept blaming me. Anyways I kept telling them that if we cancel a subscription there shouldnt be any subscriptions to auto-renew. Still they kept blaming me. Eventually I got transfered to someone who took my claims of fraud seriously and they refunded my prime membership and I closed my account. Immediately I filed a fraud claim with the Federal Trade Comission. This whole process seemed scammy and I feel there may be tons of people out there who aren't checking their accounts closely. Is there anything else I can do to prevent others from dealing with this situation? Oh, and please check your accounts if you've ever subscribed to anything on Amazon.
Thanks.

personalfinance,Here is what I have learned tracking on net-worth on a monthly basis for the past 13 months.,"I have been tracking my net-worth for on a monthly basis for the past thirteen, and I have learned a lot through out the process. With hindsight, almost everything that I learned was obvious, but it was only apparent after I tracking my net-worth. Here is what I have learned

1. Unless you inherit a large sum of money, or stumble upon a huge financial windfall, your net worth increases slowly on a monthly basis. It will feel like your  net-worth barely changes on a month by month, but you will notice it after a year.

2. It is best to live within your means, and do not wait to invest or save until you get a better job, or a raise. Start today.

3. If you over spend in a month, it takes a long time to make up for it.

4. My net worth is negative due to student loans.  If you have a lot of debt, try to minimize your interest rate. A lower interest rate will save you a ton of money in the long term, and it will help you pay off your loan faster. I was able to reduce my interest rate from around 6% to 3.25% and I am almost excited to pay my loans because almost all of my payment goes to principal.

5.  Debt really hurts your ability to invest and grow a nest egg. Only take on good debt, do not take on too much debt, and avoid bad debt.

6.  Unless you have a lot capital, changes in the market barely effect your net worth, or your day to day life. People spend way to long worrying about the best time to invest, so they never do it. Use your retirement plan to cost average over your life time.

7. I just started tracking my spending, and I realized that I spent a lot of money on stuff that did not improve the quality of my life. If you cut out your wasteful spending, you will be able to save a lot more.

8.  Set up your 401K, so it increases when you get a raise. It will help save for retirement, and you will not notice it in your pay check.

9. Reinvest your dividends.

stocks,"Get ready for the trading week of March 4th, 2019!","Hey what's happening r/stocks! Good morning and happy Saturday to all of you on this subreddit. I hope everyone made out pretty nicely in the market last week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead! :)

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 4th, 2019.

# **The week ahead: Jobs report needs to silence rising worries about the economy  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/01/the-week-ahead-jobs-report-needs-to-silence-rising-worries-about-the-economy.html)**
*****
&gt; Job growth has remained vibrant despite the slow-growing economy,and that's a trend investors are anxious to see confirmed in the February employment report on Friday.
*****
&gt; Even with some economists expecting growth around 1 percent for the first quarter, the labor market has been strong, and economists expect to see 185,000 jobs added in February. The economy is widely expected to bounce back in the second quarter to a pace well above 2 percent, after the temporary headwinds from the government shutdown and polar vortex abate.
*****
&gt; The jobs data tops the list of important economic news in the week ahead, particularly after a string of disappointing reports showing that both consumers and businesses have pulled back.
*****
&gt; The stock market will pass a major milestone on Wednesday—the tenth anniversary of the day the market bottomed in 2009, when the S&amp;P 500 hit 666. The S&amp;P has gained more than 312 percent since that low of the financial crisis, and some analysts see the bull market continuing for at least another year.
*****
&gt; ""We think there's further upside for this bull market to go. The age of the bull does not matter. What really matters is how healthy it is,"" said Patrick Palfrey, U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse. ""Whatever the concerns, around trade tariffs, or decelerating corporate profits, we believe this bull market remains very healthy.""
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 is taking aim at the 2,800 level, an important milestone that it has struggled to surpass in the past week. The 2,800 marker was an important level for the stock market four times in past several months, and holding above it could signal the rally could drive stocks to fresh highs.
*****
&gt; Palfrey said investors first and foremost are looking at any information that can help them gauge how the economy is doing. ""We're looking for confirmation in the jobs report. We think the economy is doing okay. Labor participation is improving. We're going to see that continuing to inch back up,"" he said.
*****
&gt; The Citigroup economic surprise index fell to a new 18-month low Friday, following a recent rash of disappointing reports. When economic reports come in below economists' expectations, the surprise index falls and a low number for the index is reflecting the economic slowdown.
*****
&gt; Source: Citigroup
*****
&gt; Goldman Sachs economists Friday said they were expecting first quarter growth of just 0.9 percent, but they raised second quarter growth to 2.9 percent.
*****
&gt; #New home sales
&gt; In addition to the jobs report, there is the Fed's beige book on the economy Wednesday and new home sales Tuesday. But after delayed and weaker data, it's the jobs report that matters most. The employment report is one data point that has been released as normal through the shutdown, and in the January data, there was a huge upside surprise of 304,000 nonfarm payrolls.
*****
&gt; ""All eyes are on the job market. If businesses lose faith and they stop hiring, and job growth starts slowing, then we do have problems,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. Economists expect wages to rise by 0.3 percent and unemployment to fall a tenth to 3.9 percent, according to Refinitiv.
*****
&gt; ""I think companies should stay steadfast in their hiring,"" Zandi said. He expects job growth of about 200,000 but notes there could be a payback for the huge amount of hires in January.
*****
&gt; ""I think the economy is fragile, growth is below trend. It's very vulnerable. The only thing that will keep it together is if businesses keep hiring and the job market holds up, and I think it will unless the president doesn't settle with the Chinese on trade, or there's a hard Brexit or some other geopolitical event,"" said Zandi.
*****
&gt; The Federal Reserve has paused in its interest rate hiking because of the slowing economy and concerns about financial conditions. But the Fed could move forward on rates again, if inflation begins to pick up, and for that reason the wage data in the jobs report would also be key were it to show new wage pressures.
*****
&gt; There are a few speeches by Fed officials, including Fed Chairman Jerome Powell who speaks at Stanford University Friday night at an economic conference.
*****
&gt; Market focus will also be on the European Central Bank which meets Thursday.
*****
&gt; ""I think people are expecting some detail about a long-term loan operation,"" said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex. The ECB is expected to allow European banks to extend the duration of some short-term loans. Chandler said the ECB could also push back on its time frame on raising interest rates, which it has said would not be until after the summer.

# Typical March Trading: Mid-Month Surge and Flat

&gt; Over the recent 21 years March has been a solid performing month for the market. Average gains over the period range from a low of 1.29% by NASDAQ to a respectable 2.0% by Russell 2000. March has also been the #1 performing month by average performance for S&amp;P 500 and Russell 2000 over the last 21 years. First trading day of March gains typically kick of the month, followed by choppy to slightly higher trading until around the tenth or eleventh trading day when the market tends to surge higher until around the fifteenth trading day. At this point the market tends to cool and can succumb to some end-of-quarter selling pressure.

# Bad Q4 Not A Bad Sign

&gt; Now that the 4th quarter market debacle is behind us and solid gains have been logged in 2019 year-to-date we have taken a deeper dive into market action following Q4 losses for the three main U.S. market indices. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have been solid over the next for the next four quarters and the next year when Q1 is positive, but also good following all but three subsequent Q1 losses. On average up about 80% of the time for the full year with average gains around 8%. NASDAQ’s record is choppier.

personalfinance,"[Advice] Is it a good idea to invest the money in my HSA, if I might need to use it soon?","I'm looking for advice on what to do with the money in my HSA - whether it's a good idea to invest it, and if so what sorts of investments to make.

I'm 32, single with no dependents, and making $57k in a reasonably stable job. I'm getting closer and closer to the end of the ""green"" part of the PF flowchart. I've finished paying off my high interest debts, and my emergency fund is at 2 months of expenses and climbing up towards 6 months. At the same time, I'm aggressively paying off my more moderate interest debt (5.3% interest rate). Once my emergency fund is built up and my debts are paid down (not all the way to zero yet, but a lot closer, and with interest rates under 4%), I'll focus on saving more for retirement. But right now I'm just contributing the minimum to get my employer's match, and putting it all in a target date 2050 fund.

I know HSAs are all the way down in step 6 of the [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics), but to me they deserve a mention in the vicinity of steps 2-4 if you can swing it from a cash flow standpoint. Because why pay medical costs with taxable income if you can pay them with tax-free money instead. So I've been contributing almost the maximum amount to my HSA.

I've read about the strategy of using your HSA as a retirement fund, paying medical costs with your regular taxable income, and saving up your medical receipts for years and years and not reimbursing yourself out of your HSA until way later. This is a really cool idea that I may take advantage of in the future, but I don't think I'm really there yet. For now, I've been reimbursing myself for all medical costs shortly after I incur them.

Right now my HSA balance is around $5500 because I haven't had much in the way of medical costs lately. But it's likely that I'll use up at least a few thousand of this within the next year or two for some expected medical costs, and it's possible that my balance could drop close to zero if I have a lot of unexpected medical costs on top of the expected ones.

My HSA is with Optum Bank, so I'm required to keep at least $2000 uninvested, and whatever I keep as cash earns a measly 0.05% interest. It pains me to keep the whole HSA earning basically nothing, so I'd like to invest a large chunk of it, maybe even everything but $2000. I'm not looking to maximize long-term performance, and I'm definitely not looking to day trade. I'm just looking for a modest return while minimizing the risk of needing to sell low to pay for a big medical emergency.

My annual out-of-pocket maximum for my health insurance is $4000, and I do have more than that in the bank. So if I were to have a huge unexpected medical bill all at once, I wouldn't necessarily need to reimburse myself out of the HSA right away... but I would probably want to do it within a few months or so.

So, I think bonds are the answer, and I'm leaning towards short-term bonds. Or I guess I could set up a mini three-fund portfolio if that would make sense here? But I'm an investing newbie, so feel free to tell me if I've got it all wrong. I have over 50 mutual funds to choose from, including a handful of different bond options. (I can post a list of all the mutual fund options if you guys want to see them.)


**TL;DR since I ended up writing a novel:** I have an HSA I'm using as (1) a short-term savings account for medical costs within the next few years, and (2) a backup emergency fund for any unexpected medical costs. Is it crazy to invest a big chunk of my HSA in my financial situation? Should I invest it all in short-term bonds like VFSIX, or what?",finance
personalfinance,Buying a home from my dad and he wants to finance,"I'm buying my dad's childhood home, which he bought when his parents passed away. My dad said he's interested in consistent retirement income so he wants to seller-finance. The terms of the deal would be identical to a bank: 30 year fixed at whatever we agree is a market interest rate.

Some questions:

- Will I still be able to write off interest (assuming he isn't giving me 1098's)

- Will this hurt or help my credit? Sounds like it won't even be reported to credit agencies.

- Are there any things I should be aware of that make this a worse option than just getting a bank loan?",finance
personalfinance,"Claiming 0, owe more than last year claiming 2 - why?","So, I got married in 2016, and neither of us changed our W4 in 2017. Filing taxes last year and owing about $2k, we both changed our W4 to married. I know NOW that we should have changed it to Married but withhold single. In 2017 I was claiming 2 for federal on my returns - I believe my wife may have been claiming 1 - so in 2018 we both changed ours to married claiming $0. When I enter in my wife's W-2 it shows we're getting a $1700 refund, but as soon as I enter mine we now owe **$3600**. What? 

  
My wife makes about $20k more than I make, and we're both Married claiming 0 on our W4.

&amp;#x200B;

I looked over my W2 from 2017 and compared it to 2018. I made $3500 more in 2018, but my federal tax withholding (even with the change to claiming 0 on my W4) is ***$370 less than 2017.*** Why did this happen? Is this all because we chose ""Married"" instead of ""Married, withhold as single""? 

&amp;#x200B;

It's absolutely stupid that it has to be done that way. We shouldn't have to go to the IRS to figure this shit out - if you're married and you both select married, that should be the end of it. There should be other options for other situations, it shouldn't assume only one earner if you're married. And if you are married, what sense does that make to have to file as withholding as a single person to have taxes withheld appropriately?",finance

I verified that I didnt input anything different between the two. My mom suggested I try yet a different program to see what it came up with. Tax Slayer was almost identical to Turbo Tax.

personalfinance,Should I Refinance My Car?,"I bought our car a year ago on a 72 month term at a really high interest rate. We needed to do it and our credit sucked and we went with who would finance us. Well, it's been a year of moderate improvement on our credit and Credit Karma recommended a refinance. I clicked through the Pre-Screen with Capital One Auto (we are currently financing through Bridgecrest) and it'd drop my interest by more than half. I can't think of why this could be bad but I didn't see anything in the wiki so I wanted to ask.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, should I keep the term at 60 mo (what I currently have remaining) and save less per month but save about $700 on ~~insurance~~ INTEREST (this is the numbers they gave me on a 60mo vs 72mo) or should I go with another 72mo, lose the $700 on the interest over the life of the loan but the bill is $50 less than the 60mo offer?

&amp;#x200B;

Lower interest saves you money long term but any way we can cut cost feels like I should look at it.

&amp;#x200B;

Any thoughts and advice you have would be deeply appreciated!

personalfinance,Balance Transfer Card vs. Personal Loan To Payoff ~10k,"I have about 10k in credit card debt that I am actively working on paying off after a couple years of reckless spending and not paying much more than the minimums (very stupid decisions and lack of financial intelligence). 

I have made some serious lifestyle changes that are allowing me to pay some large chunks of money towards my debt each month. So far I have gotten in a position where I have 1k in emergency savings and about 800-1000 per month in budgeted money to pay off my debt without using either card at all anymore.

I am looking at trying to consolidate my debt because the two credit cards that are carrying my balance both have an interest rate of \~25% APR and the interest alone is killing me (\~300 per month).

\~3k (Discover) / \~7k (Chase Freedom Unlimited)

&amp;#x200B;

The two choices that I have been looking at to try and make a bigger dent and give myself a better opportunity to pay off my debt with less interest/faster are:

1. Opening a new card with a generous intro balance transfer/interest free period (ex. Citi Double Cash - 0% for 9 months and no balance transfer fees or Amex Blue Cash Everyday - 0% for 15 months and 3% balance transfer fee)

2. Taking a personal loan (Prosper - 10k - 17.5% interest/21.23% APR - 36month term)

&amp;#x200B;

My other choice is sticking with keeping my balance on my two cards and snowballing the Discover first in 5-6 months and then tackling the Chase with everything I have after.

personalfinance,Do my parents have any right to my tax refund?,"As of right now,  my taxes i will be getting back will be around 2500 federal and around 308 for Indiana state. I claimed my mom and my little sister as my dependents since they do not generate any income and live with me full time. My mom said that without me claiming them as dependents, i would've only gotten around 600 dollars back fully from both. My mom states that since i'm getting around 2500 for taxes, and because i claimed them as my dependents, she should get half, and i should get half, even though she doesn't work and has been unemployed for years. 

Her reason for unemployment is she is trying to get disability for her mental issues, but because of that, she cant get a job, otherwise her case would go through the window. She is saying that the 1000 dollars would go to pay our house mortgage that my grandma is paying right now.

The money is going to an account that we both own, because i am only 17 until May. Could she just legally take half or all of my refund because it's going into our account? Or does the IRS have something that only I could take THAT money out?",finance

I am currently taking the lead in handling everything financial and guiding her on how to properly prepare for her future. She is on board and willing do to what it takes as a team.

The APY/APR on these cards are ridiculously high and I see interest charges of $300 or more occur. This is basically a monthly payment for either of these cards.

Our goal at this point is to tackle all the debt and return to a clean slate and move forward to finding a house in the future. As of current, I've assessed all neccesitities and downsized our extra expenses (insurance, eating out, negotiating phone bills, Netflix etc:) to the best of my abilities to limit the outflow of cash.

To my knowledge a 0% interest card for 12months or more would negate the interest that's bearing on these accounts but what I would like to know is if there are any other avenues that can be taken to better handle this? If not, what credit unions or banks offer the most amount of time at a 0% interest rate?

The 2018 Tesla Model 3 was reportedly headed  southbound at the time that a tractor-trailer, pulling out of a driveway  leading to Pero Family Farms after stopping at a stop sign, attempted  to turn left onto the highway headed northbound. 

At that time the tractor-trailer entered the path of the Tesla, and  the latter hit the driver’s side of the trailer, “resulting in the roof  being sheared off as it passed underneath the trailer,” the report said.  The 50-year-old Tesla driver died on the scene, per Reuters. It is not  clear whether the Tesla’s Autopilot mode was active at the time of the  collision.

Per the police report, the Tesla Model 3 continued for  nearly a third of a mile before coming to a complete stop. As several  reports have noted, the incident bears remarkable similarities to [another fatal crash](https://gizmodo.com/fatal-tesla-crash-proves-full-autonomy-is-the-only-solu-1782923424) involving a Tesla Model S that occurred in Florida in 2016.""

personalfinance,Student Loan Refinance,"I'm currently carrying a large amount of student debt (\~$250k, don't go to vet school kids), interest for the different loans varies between 4-7%.  For the first few years out of school, I was making a pittance as I worked through my internships but over the last couple years, I've had a great job that pays well above average and has allowed my wife and I to buy a house, start a family, and meet a lot of our other financial goals.  I'm still on an income-based repayment plan for my loans because the monthly payment for a regular repayment plan would be greater than our mortgage.  However, over the last couple years, I have been paying an additional $500 a month against the principle which as helped.

Recently, I have been getting a lot of offers to refinance my loans, not only from my current loan company but also from a variety of other companies that I've never heard of.  My professional organization has also provided contact information for a few companies that offer student loan refinancing. My credit is really good and the interest rates I've been offered are significantly lower than what I currently have.  On the surface, this seems like a good deal; I would have to roll the unpaid interest from my first couple years in practice (\~$50k) into the principle but lower interest rate would likely save me quite a bit in the long run.  However, I'm always a bit anxious when dealing with dollar amounts this high.  I'm wary of getting trapped into a loan that looks good on the surface but has terms that will bite me later on.

Has anyone been through refinancing a large student loan? Is there anything I should be aware of before I call a company for more specifics?",finance

personalfinance,Finishing up a big savings goal (yay!) - where to put my “extra” money next?,"Hi PF! Thanks to your excellent advice over the years, I’m in a great spot financially. The best advice for me has been “pay yourself first”, so over the years I’ve automated a ton of my savings so I don’t spend what’s not in my budget. Here’s my current setup:

* I fully fund both 401k and IRA every year.
* I already have a healthy emergency fund in a high-yeild savings account. 
* I have no debts other than my mortgage. I’m currently putting $150 extra per month toward mortgage principle, with an interest rate of 5%.
* Currently putting $175 each paycheck (biweekly) into a taxable investment account.
* Currently putting $375 each paycheck (biweekly) into a money market account for my next car (likely buying within the next 2-3 years). I don’t have any other major expenses planned: no kids, not looking to move, etc. 
* HSA is partially funded through insurance premiums, but I’m not contributing any extra now. I don’t think the insurance premiums count against my annual contribution limit.

The good news is, in March I’ll be hitting my new car savings goal (yay!) so I’ll now have $375 per paycheck (about $750 per month) to allocate somewhere else. The clear first choice is to fully fund my HSA but that won’t use all the extra money. 

Looking at the [spending flowchart](https://i.imgur.com/lSoUQr2.png), paying down a mortgage is specifically excluded from the “pay down moderate interest debt” step, but the mortgage interest tax deduction isn’t as beneficial to me any more with the increase in the standard deduction. (I think I’ll get to itemize this year, but maybe not in two or three years, and definitely not if I start paying the mortgage down really aggressively.)

So, should I send the rest toward the taxable investment account, or toward extra mortgage principle payment?  And for whichever one I *don’t* choose, should I still keep setting aside what I currently do ($150/month to mortgage, $175/biweekly to investments) or roll that up with my other “extra” money and put it all toward one thing?",finance
personalfinance,"Very small windfall, what to do with the cash?","I've been doing my best to follow through with the flowchart and I think I'm in a very decent spot with my personal finance. I'm getting my first bonus from my job and I've never had any sort of non-budgeted cash drop in my lap before. I have family in finance and they all suggest I should put it directly into a money market or an IRA/Roth.

I'm really curious on some second/third opinions if what my gut is telling me to do makes any sense.

I have the following debt and assets:

\- House (owe 215k of 230k, so nowhere near PMI where a 5-10k windfall would make much difference, 3.75% rate)

\- Car (owe 19k of 23k, dropping 5 to 10k into the loan isn't going to save much on interest, rate is 2.9%)

\- 20k cash

\- 20k employer 401k

My expenses are about 2500 a month and I'm able to put away about 1500/2000 a month into savings. Currently building an emergency fund just a tiny bit more, and starting to save for the next house which is planned for 5-7 years from now. All raises and (hopefully soon) promotions are going to go into the 401k while the monthly 2000 continues to go into cash until I have the down payment for the new house.

Family is suggesting I put all of it into money market or IRA/Roth, and do that with any cash windfall I may get at any point in the future. My gut is telling me to put it toward the car (2018, 14k mi) which I intend to drive into the ground so I can free up another $400 of car payments to put towards savings to start investing more heavily, sooner.

Is putting 5-10-15k directly into the car a bad idea? Putting it into the house feels like putting out a burning bush in a city on fire, and I plan on moving house relatively soon anyway. Leaving it in savings feels like a waste because I'll get more out of the car, house or market than my sub 2% savings account.

I don't know why I'm feeling so market-averse right now. I'm contributing 6%, maxing employer contributions still. I'm just really curious for some outside input. My friends suggest I buy mods for my car or a new computer, so I can't go to them lol",finance

personalfinance,Help post Art Institute: applying for Borrower’s Defense Against Repayment program,"I attended the Art Institute my freshman year of college (2009-2010). After I left for a more ethical university, the company that owns the Art Institutes (Educational Management Corporation) was accused of violating US consumer protection laws and sued by the federal government. In 2015, they agreed to forgive up to $103 million in student loan debt and another $95.5 million for engaging in a student recruitment strategy that violated US federal law. I was a low-income high school student who was heavily targeted by recruiters with shady tactics, and shady practices from the financial aid department continued while I was a college student.

My understanding is that I may be eligible to apply for the Borrower's Defense Against Repayment program, but I've had a hard time finding the information I need to do so. The most thorough article I've come across so far is [this one](https://www.forgetstudentloandebt.com/student-loan-relief-programs/federal-student-loan-relief/federal-forgiveness-programs/art-institute-student-loan-forgiveness/#BDAR), which includes info about how to apply.

So now I know where to find the application, but I'm still not sure how to ""link the Borrower’s Defense claim to the Art Institute’s lawsuit and the fraudulent activity that they’ve been accused of performing."" According to the article linked above, I ""will need to add details about the lawsuit into \[my\] Borrower’s Defense application, including monetary settlement figures and links to reputable sources containing information about the lawsuit and settlement they agreed to.""

Has anyone here successfully pursued this before? Is there somewhere I can read the lawsuit/settlements/reputable sources to gather that information? Final question, are there professionals out there who specialize in this sort of thing? If I could hire someone like a lawyer to help me build my case on my application, that would be an immense help.

personalfinance,Health Insurance and Balance Bill - Interstate,"I've seen a lot of these posts.  I had a procedure done with an in network facility and provider but out of network anesthesiologist.

&amp;#x200B;

My state offers protection via state mandated mediation but upon investigating that my insurance is contracted by my employer through a different state, where they are based out of.  Therefore my state's mediation does not apply.  My employer's state has a comprehensive balanced billing protection but it requires the provider to play ball to some degree.  It will not since it is not under that jurisdiction and following those rules voluntarily would require it to accept a lower amount or go through arbitration which it is not required to.

&amp;#x200B;

You would think since my state has a mediation requirement and employers does it would require some sort of mediation.

&amp;#x200B;

Had I lived in the other state or my insurance been contracted through my state, I would have some level of protection but the interstate issue is a problem because there are no federal mandates.  This is a fully funded plan so it is not mandated by ERISA.

I have filed appeals with the carrier which the first round, they completely missed or ignored applicable state mandates and upheld their medicare payment rates for the out of network claim.  I am waiting on this next round citing the state mandates but not too hopeful.

The anesthesiologist firm has offered a discount to patients of my provider, but its possible they may revoke that due to the lengthy appeals I've done and this is over 180 days from the date of service now so I may just end up having to pay that to avoid paying a much higher rate.

At 18 years old, I had zero financial understanding at all. Didn’t even know what was an average loan burden for college. I went to a private institution I couldn’t truly afford and my parents encouraged me to go - co-signing private loans on top of my federal loans. 
Halfway through college, I became more financially savvy and realized the incredible student loan burden I will have - over $200k. The program I was accepted into is relatively exclusive and it would’ve been impossible to choose a cheaper option once already in school. My starting salary will be 80-90k and my dad reasoned this was enough to justify that student loan burden.

I’m about to graduate in May and I’m honestly terrified. Pointing the finger at my parents will do no good, and I need to take responsibility for this and have a set loan repayment plan. How should I approach this? Who should I meet with and what options do I have going forward?

I know this will impact my future relationships, and I’m not even sure how to approach this subject with potential SOs. I will be keeping my finances separate from them as I do not want to burden anyone else with this debt.

I am a 24 y/o single male, getting into my first serious job, starting in the 50-60k annual salary range, depending on overtime and bonuses.   Currently I am trying to build my credit from missing 53 payments on student loans, but I have a place to live for free, a vehicle, and low expenses compared to what I will be bringing in.  I'll go over what my expenses are, my current plan for building credit, and my current knowledge of where I should start investing, but I could use some advice on where to go from there.  Where do I start a Roth IRA? Are there books I should read?

&amp;#x200B;

My current expenses are:

Student Loans:  $150/month, only required to pay $75 Minimum 

Credit Card:  $100/month, I put all of my small monthly bills on this card, totaling $96, I just rounded up for easier numbers, the card does not retain a balance past one month

Cell phone:  $60/month

Insurance: $35/month - Motorcycle

Gas:  $150/month 

Food:  $300/month - working on decreasing this by bringing lunch to work, I'm personally okay with this amount

&amp;#x200B;

My current Credit Score is 487, I have raised that from 385 in 3 months, and it was so low from missing 53 Student Loan Payments.  My student Loan Total $6366, at a 4.1% interest rate, minimum payment is $74.58, I have it rounded up to $150 currently.  I have seen some big jumps in my score, and got the credit card this past month to assist with increasing my credit score.  Is there anyway to get those late payments off of my credit score?  Or is my best route to just counterbalance them with on-time payments?  How long could it potentially take me to get to the 650-700 Credit score range?

&amp;#x200B;

Currently my new employer offers a 4% match into a 401k, so I am setting up my pay to automatically take that out.  Where should I go from there?  I have heard a Roth IRA is great to take advantage of, but how/where do I start investing in one?  My current living situation does not require rent from me, how much should I plan on putting into that investment?  

&amp;#x200B;

I understand the idea of the 50/30/20 plan for budgeting, but I will have more funds available for the next year potentially.  I do want to save to get my own place, and I am in a long term relationship, where my s/o will be getting into a field with an initial salary of 40-50k annually to assist in bills in the future.  One thing I would like to get for myself in the near future would be a car in the 18k-20k range if that is attainable once I get my credit score into a better place.   I currently am commuting on a motorcycle, which isn't the biggest issue, but I've never really gotten myself anything nice over the years and would like to treat myself.  

&amp;#x200B;

I live in Florida Currently, so when I do move out, the cost of an apartment or house would still be relatively low, but I would like to also build up a savings amount to cover my s/o and I for 6 months in case of emergency.  

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the brain dump, I have seen a lot of posts on here recommending a basic route of how to invest but I cannot find them now.  I appreciate any advice, and if there are any books that I should refer to I would appreciate that.

I'm a beginner in investing, and yesterday had the chance to attend a seminar about it. Some of the companies were looking to raise a capital, and offered us to buy Bonds with 3-5year contract and FIXED return between 35-45%. One of the companies was about digital currencies mining and offered 100% on the value in different digital currencies + 24% interest for 3 years. I wonder what is the difference between Private and Public bonds, as those offers I heard yesterday they sound absolutely unreal and I have the feeling that there is a catch with them. Got introduced to 4 companies and all of them had similar interest rates and offered a great deals (at least on my point of view), but as I said I'm just a beginner.

I'm debt-free while he has $35k in student debt (federal, unsubsidized) with an average interest rate of 4.2%. The minimum payment is $200, which will take 20+ years to pay off at that rate. According to debt vs. investment calculators like [this one](https://studentloanhero.com/calculators/student-loan-payoff-vs-invest-calculator/), if we assume a 6% return rate and 40 year period until retirement, it's WAY better to invest instead of paying off the debt. For example, if I input the monthly extra payment as $100, putting that toward the loans would save us $9,200 in interest, but putting it toward retirement savings would earn over $100k in investment returns by the time we retire. Should I interpret this to mean that we should just make the minimum payments on the loans and put everything else in retirement savings?",finance

I currently accrue 1.7% of my salary for the first 20 years of service, then 1% after that. So I'm sitting on 18.7% for retirement. If I go the full 20, that comes out to I think 34%. I can also retire early with a supplement. If I leave the covered position before 20, the WHOLE thing goes back to the standard FERS, no early out and no refund on LEO contributions.

Here are my three(ish) choices:

A. Graduate and stay in my covered position for 6 more years after that. So 2028, I'll be 45 sitting on 34%. I can then try to get a job with DOJ, possibly ride it out to age 56 or so when I'd be pulling in 50% and probably be making 40-50k over my current base, probably 30-40k over what I would max out as if I stay.

B. Graduate, pass the par, and pop smoke. Immediately move to DOJ, let the whole coverage revert, make more for longer, retire at 62 with about 40%, but higher TSP/other account contributions.

EDIT: After comparing the expense ratios to the expense ratios considered ""good"" by one of the wiki pages, I'm thinking maybe I should only take the match and put the rest in an IRA? The lowest expense ratio available to me here is 0.52%. 

The options available to me for investing are a little overwhelming and I'm honestly not entirely sure what I'm looking for. I have a table of all the options available to me listed below. Basically I split my contributions between the 4 options that have ""index"" in them because I've heard index funds are very consistent for long-term gains. These also happen to have some of the lowest expense ratios of all the options which I think is good.

Below are the options I have available to me, with the options I've chosen to invest in in bold:

personalfinance,"Just got a 20k raise. Have a lot of student debt and some savings but no investments, unsure what to do or where to focus my efforts","Hello,

This is my first time posting here and I'm pretty clueless with finances, so please bare with me :) I'm 26 and living in NYC, and just got a promotion that came with a 20k raise (I am still in shock..I don't feel like I deserve it but that's another story). 

I have a lot of student loan debt (almost 40k private combined with federal), decent savings (36k), but no real investments. I'd love some advice from you all if possible. 

I was making 85k +$7k bonus and now I make 105k + $8,750 bonus. With the 85k paycheck I took home $4,270 a month since I'm putting 6% of my paycheck into a 401k.  My credit score is about 835. (not sure if relevant)

A breakdown of my monthly bills for context:
*$751 per month for student loans [should I raise this asap??] 

*$950 for rent

*About $60 for utilities

*$10 for Spotify

*$200 for food

{Edited for reality} *About $800-$1,000 for entertainment, Ubers, drinks, eating out, clothes...etc

*$40 for gym

*$97 for phone

*$120 for monthly metrocard

*other miscellaneous travel expenses, which varies quite a bit. All in all I've been saving 1k a month for the past year. 

I have incentive units with my current job, and my last job gave me the option to buy out my stock options (2 years left to buy them…). No worth on them yet but I do believe in the company. 


My question is- should I focus this increase in salary all towards my student loans (40k), my savings, maybe even investments? Right now all of that 36k is sitting in my Chase Checking account and I feel like that's not smart? 

Thank you in advance :)


** Edit ** Y'all motivated me and I just logged into my discover student loan account, and paid off about 4k in the highest interest loans. I plan to do more once I build some courage, but I wanted to thank you all for sharing your knowledge with me.",finance
personalfinance,"Advice - Applying for car loan 2 years after Chapter 7 - Good income, no debt","Hello and thank you to whoever takes the time to read this.

I am in search of some financial wisdom and thought this would be a good place to ask.  I appreciate in advance to whoever might have some answers.

To give some context, I am 30 and my wife is 29.  Two years ago, after a bad business deal, my wife and I had to file for chapter 7 bankruptcy.  We re-affirmed our car payment ($550 / month) as well as our mortgage payment ($950 / month).  Prior to this, we both had credit scores in the mid 700s.  We were never late on or missed a payment on anything since establishing credit when we were young.  After the chapter 7, I think our scores dropped into the high 500s for a couple of weeks maybe, but within a couple of months were back up around 650.  Some time has passed since then; about a year and ten months.  We still have never been late or missed a payment on anything.  We haven't applied for any kind of credit in since the chapter 7.  We have no debt whatsoever besides our car payment and mortgage payment, however we do have monthly payments for necessities like insurance, internet, cell phones, etc like everyone else.  Our income is pretty decent, all things considered, and is just shy of $100,000 / year (combined).  I say the following things in hopes that no one passes judgment, and also because it is relevant to my questions and to a bank.  I am actually a disabled veteran and can no longer work.  Because of this, I have added benefits that sort of augment my income.  I don't pay property taxes, which is why my mortgage payment is quite low and my wife and I both have very inexpensive healthcare costs, among other smaller things.  I say this because it has mattered to financial institutions when we applied for loans in the past.  

I recently found a vehicle that I would like to purchase that will cost $10,000.  There are a couple of different issues that I've done research on, but now would like to get other opinions on. One, what are the odds that I get approved in the first place?  We have no debt besides my wife's jeep and our home.  Our debt to income ratio is very good.  Would this and our decent income be enough to overshadow the chapter 7 from almost 2 years ago and allow us to get approved, regardless of interest rate?  Two, the car is older (2000) than what banks like to finance.  I have heard this doesn't matter much to certain credit unions, and like everything else, is directly impacted by your credit history and income.  Will this be a problem?

In regards to the approval and interest rate. would offering to do a shorter or longer term loan have an impact on either?  I have some other collateral as well, but I planned on perhaps offering to use my truck as collateral.  To a bank, it would be worth at least half ($5000) of the loan amount ($10,000).  My wife and I will be co-signing and both currently have a 697 / 713 (+/- 3 pts).  We at least know to go to our local credit union where we are established and have been paying our car payment.

In my mind, it should be no problem and will most likely even get approved at a lower interest rate, but I wanted to ask the experts and get their take.  I am wondering if anyone has any thoughts or maybe any suggestions on something to do to improve my odds.  Also worth mentioning, the car isn't a need, it is strictly a want.  I don't have many good days, so I am trying to enjoy the ones I do get.  We are trying to sell our home and buy a larger one on a larger property in two years and both felt it would be better having our first credit request after a chapter 7 be a $10,000 car loan rather than a second home loan.  If approved, we plan on paying it off prior to applying for another VA home loan so it can help repair our credit the rest of the way.

Thank you to anyone who takes the time to provide their thoughts or suggestions.  It is appreciated.

personalfinance,"My scholarships are taxed, looking for a way to reduce taxes","I'll start off by saying I'm very lucky to be in this position, but it's still causing me some trouble. I received a lot of financial aid for college. Because part of the money I received is taxable (room and board stipend that I never actually see), I have to pay a lot in taxes.  

My situation looks something like this:

* $4500 from my student jobs, on my W-2

* $78,000 in scholarships, which breaks down into: 

     * $66,000 in financial aid for my home university, and $53,000 in eligible expenses, which is all reported on a 1098-T

     * $12500 in financial aid for a summer program, reported on a 1099-MISC, and a 1098-T for the program's tuition of $9000

* AOTC of $400, collected all my textbook receipts

It all comes out to about $21,000 AGI. My parents are not claiming me as a dependent and not filing with me since that just makes everything worse. My home state is Illinois, and I'm 20. My Illinois tax comes out to about $950, and my federal tax comes out to either ~$350 if I claim I'm independent or ~$1250 if I don't.

Now, my main questions:

1. I really want to claim myself as independent. That way, I don't pay the ""kiddie tax"" of 24% on my scholarships and just pay what I would in that tax bracket (10% I think?). Looking at my bank account, my parents gave me less money that I even made at my student job. Would that be valid if the IRS decided to audit me? Is that even something I should be concerned about?

2. Would opening up an account like a 529 plan or IRA save me some money, either this year or next year? 

3. Anything I could do right now to pay less? I was saving my student job money for some future expenses and now I'm going to be very broke.

CryptoCurrency,Fintrux Network [FTX] March 3rd AMA. Read how FTX approaches the P2P lending in a completely new and unique way.,"FintruX #AMA sunday 3rd march 2019
Can you give a summary of the full suite of products that FintruX will be
offering?

[Conrad]
We at FintruX Network want to build end-to-end solutions that impact every
stage of business growth. As a team of entrepreneurs ourselves, we
understand that there is a lack of tools and resources for entrepreneurs to
build a successful business from small, medium, to large. Our first solution
aims to solve the liquidity problem, and help SMEs get affordable financing
for their cashflow issues.
In regards to further solutions in the near future, we look forward to
expanding our financing solution to tackle consumer issues, developing a
knowledge base for entrepreneurs to build a sustainable business from all
major aspects, accounting platforms, cashflow statements, HR help, etc.

What purpose does blockchain have in your project ?

[Conrad]
We utilize the blockchain in 2 key ways.
1. After thoroughly performing credit adjudication and assessment with our
in-house team and partner scoring bureaus, we determine the credit limit of
the borrower (SME). The issue for many SMEs is that while they may be
credit worthy to receive $50,000 or higher, many banks are unwilling to
provide fiat for these companies because it is not cost effective for them,
and private lenders are willing to do that amount, but at very high interest
rates (15-30% p.a.). Thus, we leverage the blockchain to provide a way for
the SME to generate their own credit, by equipping them with a smart
contract to issue their own digital credit tokens (FRX) up to their credit limit.
In this way, SMEs are not limited to waiting for a third party investor to
provide them the liquidity they need, and instead can generaterepresentation of their borrowing power to send over to their creditors. In
turn, the creditors can send back any amount of the tokens to the borrower
and expect cash payments within 30 days.
To understand our entire process better, kindly view a high level process
diagram of our product below:
https://www.fintrux.com/home/assets/img/main/businessmodelv1.1.png

2. The second way, is reputation management. Our whole business model
is focused on facilitating trust back into the ecosystem, the trust between a
vendor and their client so that they can transact with financing (aka
deferred payments with interest) successfully. So managing the global
reputation profiles, with reviews, and ratings, is very important and to
maintain immutability, the blockchain will be the desired location to store
this data


As you deal with LOAN (Phase 1 - Credit enhanced Financing), what is
your main difference from NEXXO ?

[Conrad]
We are currently in closed beta testing. Our product is drastically different
from traditional p2p lenders in that we are taking third party investment
directly out of the equation, and siloing the process to be between the
creditor and the borrower. Think about it like this. Why do businesses need
funding/third-party investment to begin with? Well, it's because they have
incurred costs from goods/services that they are unable to pay back. Or,
they are able to pay back their vendors every month, but just barely - not
being able to save money to invest into R&amp;D or expansion. Our solution
solves that, by enabling a way for businesses to conduct their own
financing, with any service providers.

Can you explain me how you will convince companies to use your service. I
mean most companies use only fiat and will probably be afraid to jump into
crypto ?

[Conrad]
Convincing companies is very easy, as we drill down on the exact problems
they are facing today, and providing them solutions that do not cost them
up front.
To start, we believe the blockchain should be treated like TCIP. Not
everybody knows what TCIP is, but everyone understand the internet, and
the search bar - that by typing key words into google.com, they will be able
to look up and find information on what they wish to learn about. In the
same vein, we want the benefits of the blockchain to be inherent in our
ecosystem, but that the users, who are primarily traditional users, not have
to worry about setting up a wallet, what is metamask, how to send
cryptocurrencies...etc.
You can see below a preview of some of the collateral we send to SMEs
that successfully convince them to use our solution:
https://www.fintrux.com/home/doc/CorpProfile-TruX.pdf
As you can see, we do not need to mention the blockchain, and that there
is no need for them to interact with the layer directly - just that today, they
will be able to set up deferred payments with their vendors, on their own
terms - both interest and payout terms are at their convenience.

Is your service already offered by a centralized entity? If so, why does
decentralizing it make it better?

[Conrad]
Our service is the first of its kind, and has never been offered by a
centralized entity - it would be impossible to perform without blockchain
technology.

How many SMEs do you have on board ?

[Conrad]
We currently have ~20 interested SMEs that are signing onto the beta
scheduled to start first week of March. Our timeline is the following:

March/April 2019 - Sign up 50 SMEs, granting them credit up to $50,000 in
Singapore.

May 2019 - In joint effort with the MAS (singapore central bank and
regulator), participating in their fintech sandbox, to sign up 100 SMEs,
granting them credit up to $100,000 in Singapore.

June/July 2019 - Global launch

With regard to cashflow statements, what's the focus? Will it be invoice
factoring or invoice financing or both?

[Conrad]
To clarify, I meant cashflow statement templates for businesses, ideally
coupled into our accounting platform to help new entrepreneurs generate
the financial collateral they need to get investment, mergers, etc.
We are not performing invoice financing at this time - truth be told, the way
current companies perform invoice financing (without disclosure) is
basically unsecured lending - which our solution is performing in the purest,
true p2p form.

Is it considered as Security Token? as it is loan, seems quiet obvious thatyes.What regulation framework do you apply ?

[Conrad]
In our basic B2B model, the FRX (digital credit token) is not a security, as it
simply represent 1:1 of the local currency, simply as a representation of the
borrowing power of the SME. It is not tradable out of the system. However,
we envision many interesting consumer plans in place, dealing with digital
wallets and the spending of these credits at F&amp;B outlets, retail, etc - which
would then harbor on a security; thus, the reason why we are entering the
Singapore fintech sandbox in May 2019 where all licensing requirements
will be relaxed for a period of 18 months; giving us free reign under the
guidance of the regulators to offer our services and scale.

nice to see that companies are interested. Are there only singaporean SME's?

[Conrad]
We have a lot of interest globally; there is a waitlist building up for
companies outside of Singapore who require our solution, and we hope to
have them be the first to take part when we do our global launch

But after this period. Are you sure to get the necessary licenses ?

[Conrad]
Yes, we have a very strong legal team that will be handling the license
acquiring process for us. In addition, the fintech sandbox actually puts us in
contact directly with the regulators who will be granting our license, so as we demonstrate the use-case and necessity of our product, we should beexiting the sandbox with the licenses in place, if required.

Are you SEC compliant?

[Conrad]
our B2B model is compliant and regulatory friendly globally. This is the
case because:
1. The credit tokens are not freeflowing, and can only be transacted
between KYCed businesses on our platform
2. The credit tokens are just representations of fiat currencies that need to
be exchanged by the borrower (issuer). In this case, they are automated
and efficient ""Loan/IOU contracts"".
3. The platform is not dealing with any fiat currencies
4. The platform is not providing advice, simply providing a holistic view of
the borrower's creditworthiness.

Gains is attending many events related to crypto in Europe, we haven't
seen you so far, are you targetting the asian market first ?

[Conrad]
We are targetting the asian market first because of their strong adoption of
digital wallets and cashless societies. If you wander into any retail/F&amp;B
store in Singapore, or China, you will find that the majority will accept
Wechat pay, alipay, grabpay, etc. and some will even not have credit card
terminals anymore. They are ready for the revolution of conducting
transactions online, and our solution only compliments the shift in market
by providing reputation backed currencies.
And as we can see with many trends in the NA/EU markets, a lot of the
latest innovations follow the Asian sector. So we are keen on establishing a
strong foothold in this large market.

what do you think about the 500 trillion $ market of credit default swap?

[Conrad]
We think this market can get even larger. Historically, startups and small,
medium businesses are the most underserved - everybody wishes to serve
the bigger clients. This means that a lot of their credit and potential is
under-reported, and if we successfully bring up their market and provide
them an affordable way to get credit, then this market size will expand
exponentionally.

So global launch in june will mean development outside of singaporemarket ?

[Conrad]
That is correct. Our B2B model would be ready to go global, as it is
regulatory friendly and compliant as explained earlier.

What are the strategies following to attract more and more investors?

[Conrad]
To be clear, the reason why we are so revolutionary is that we have
removed the need of investments from lending - to conduct true p2p
financing between vendor (lender), and client (borrower). We have made it
so that every borrower can be their own issuer of credit, backed by the
reputation established by our comprehensive credit analysis and trust
profiles.

What is your cash burn for the year(s) to come?

[Conrad]
We are keen on building strong, robust systems and businesses that stand
to be profitable.One of our proudest claim to fame is that in our founding company's firm,
our securitization (bulk financing) solution has been managing 4B of assets
and services &gt;90% of the Canadian market (banks, financial institutions,
and insurance companies). In the 2008 financial crisis, none of our clients
lost any money.
We plan to repeat the same success with FintruX. Our cash burn will be aslow as possible.

Who is your lawyer ?
I don't want to be too curious but as it is dealing with very important
regulatory frameworks; it is important to be transparent on that point.

[Conrad] 
You can see a few of the legal help we have on www.fintrux.com/team,
most notable of which are Brinden, our legal director, and Alixe, a lawyer
who previously served in the securities commission office. We have also
contracted several law firms to assist.

Have you applied for any patents and what is the rough timeline for fullintellectual protection?

[Conrad]
Yes we have, and the timeline for 100% intellectual protection is going to
be consistently expanding as we keep developing new technologies and
concepts to make the entrepreneurial journey better and better.

I invested in a project that does B2C. This is not something you consider orit is a possibility in the future ?

[Conrad]
I mentioned a bit earlier, that B2C is in the works, and we have many,
many interesting ideas surrounding this. We will be experimenting with these concepts, and more in our May testing
inside the regulatory sandbox.

So what is the utility for me as a person not a company to hold FTX tokens
despite pure speculation. I mean you dont plan to grant credit to individual?

[Conrad]
Great question! FTX is the token behind our entire ecosystem, and is what
drives the platform. As businesses achieve credit, FTX will be required to
pay for these services. We also envision that as we expand to B2C models,
and the credit tokens are enabled to spend at retail outlets, etc, FTX will
still be the backbone of the currency transaction and thus the volume will
be proportional.
You can see a brief on the tokenomics in our ecosystem at
www.fintrux.com/token, and please look forward to a more detailed paper
on this after we finalize more intricate applications and utility of our token
with the approval of the Singapore regulators.

Are the interest rates on the loans going to be limited to fixed or do you
intend to include variable interest rates as well?

[Conrad]
The borrowers are able to set the interest rates at will, with the only caveat
is that if they had negotiated a holding period with the vendor (lender) on a
particular interest rate, the lender will now be free of the lock and may cash
out if they wish.

But guys we did not ask the usual question 😁. What about exchanges ?
Do you care or not ? Do you discuss with some? 

[Conrad]
We want the adoption and volume of the token to come with real users, and
real application of the product. We are keen to showcase our solution and
demonstrate that there is finally a blockchain-enabled application that is
available and scaling with traditional and crypto users alike. At the time that
we have accomplished this, we believe that market effects will have
weeded out the bad/scam exchanges and we will be able to provide fullliquidity on additional legitimate trading platforms.

do you plan to stay on ethereum blockchain ? And why this choice ?

[Conrad]
Our solution is blockchain agnostic. It so happens that ethereum has a
convenient and robust way to generate smart contracts, and erc tokens,
which is useful for our requirements. However, as time goes on, we are
interested in utilizing our own customized blockchain so that we are not
negatively affected if there is large traffic on the EVM for example.

Can you outline how much you raised and how much you still have fromICO?

[Conrad]
We raised $25M in ETH, back in early 2018 when it was over $1100
USD/ETH. We have cashed out roughly 60% of that around that valuation,
and the rest is held in ETH/BTC.
Which means around $16m in CASH

Banks in general are not getting into crypto. Their main argument is, theycould but the customers are not ready. To make a business works, you
need to be 2. What do you think ? can you address this issue in a short
period of time ?

[Conrad]
As I mentioned previously, blockchain should truly just be a layer that
provide certain benefits. We are developing a platform where the users
don't have to be technical experts to utilize a blockchain-enabled product -
they don't even need to know it at all. They just need to know the benefits it
is providing, which is our unique advantage, and have easy ways tointerface.

Do you think Nexo and SALT lending platforms pose a threat to FintruX's
proposed business?

[Conrad]
No, because they are entirely different businesses altogether. They are
providing crypto-backed loans, which means that they are:

1. Collateral based
2. Require investors to pool in funds

Our business is:

1. No collateral required - trust is the new collateral
2. Do not require investors to pool in funds.

Nexo and Salt do not accept anybody to be borrowers if they do not already
have the money. And that for me, is not helping the majority of the
businesses out there. They don't have money, which is why they need
money. Thus, I'm proud to say that our solution is the first to have virtually
no rejection rate, as we're simply providing any company the means to
issue their own credit based on their creditworthiness. Even startups with
no credit history or financials can get started building global credit on our
platform - because we can start them off with a minimal amount of credit,
and if they showcase successful cashouts, increase their limit over time.
You can think of this in terms of yourself - when we turn 18, first thing we
do is get a credit card, which they will assign you $500 or $1000 credit limit,
and you spend the next 20 years paying off your dues dilligently every month to eventually prove to the bank you are trying to get a mortgage at
that you are creditworthy, you pay back debts.

you said backed by the reputation established by our comprehensive creditanalysis and trust profiles, the platform integrates a score so ??

[Conrad]
The score is built on various algorithms, leveraging AI, manual
adjudication, scorecards, and third party credit bureau scores. The models
will constantly be changing, and even depending on the market shifts
(some industries may be more viable than others). Ideally, it's not a good
idea to release this to the public as this may enable opportunities for bad
actors to game the system, but we are making the credit process as
transparent as possible to the participants involved by showing relevant
facts and statistics of the borrower (EBITA, repayment history, etc.) in the
trust profile that is generated for them.

The 5% backup pool (Level 4 I believe?). When you were running models,at what price was FTX valued at? At current price that 5% wouldnt cover
many defaults. 

[Conrad]
Great question. We don't expect the majority of loans to reach the level 4
(FintruX Reserve) to be honest, and in the models we have run this hasproven to be true.

The levels are as follows:

1: Over-collateralization, optional opt-in of over-collateralization (security
deposit) of &lt;10% held back on loans (depending on the borrowers’
probability of default), which covers the initial &lt;10% default

2: A cross-collateralization pool (credit risk pool) made up of all
over-collateralization amounts of the same class covers all defaults;

3: Owners of the business covers owns defaults in a cascading manner;

4: 5% of all FTX tokens (FintruX Reserve) has been reserved to coverremaining losses.
As the platform operates, there will be a continuous injection of security
deposits into the credit risk pool from new loans; creating a buffering effect
and making it a safe insurance to neutralize the credit/default risk for
lenders. In addition, any losses to the pool will be liable for recovery fromthe owners of the business.

Upon mainnet launch, what could be a realistic expectation of loan turnover
in the platform? What is the adoption you're expecting at the moment?

[Conrad]
We are keen to reach up to $10,000,000 turnover minimum in our global
launch. The reasons behind this is simple - even in our May testing, we will
be helping 100 SMEs achieve $100,000 credit each. That in itself is
$10,000,000 turnover.
Our platform is not providing out fiat loans, which enables us to operate at
scale. In addition, we are helping all the businesses that were unable to get
affordable loans from financial institutions or private lenders, meaning that
we have a lot of dejected business owners who are desperately looking forany solution that will help their short-term cashflow issues, with flexibleinterest rates and terms. And that, we can provide.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Help with our future!,"Hey,

My partner (29) and I (33) are in a pretty good financial situation, but somewhat clueless about how to best proceed with our finances, specifically looking to the long-term future. Here's our rundown:

I'm making $70k at a government job and am vested in a pension, along with another couple thousand in a 403b. My partner is making $115k at a large company, which has been making small but regular indiscriminate cuts to staff. He has $42k in a 401k.

No kids, but are seriously considering adopting in the next few years.

We just bought a house for $330k eight months ago, putting 5% down and are already up to 12% paid. Interest rate is 4.6%. We have $40k in savings, and put $500/month in. But we also have combined $115k in student loans (rate mostly 5.9%) and another $11k in a car loan (rate 2%). My partner has $500k in life insurance but all through his job, and I have $50k with my job and $50k whole life outside my job.

We have a bad habit of ordering takeout regularly, but otherwise are decently frugal. We probably have roughly $1000-2000 a month surplus, so the question is where we should be putting this money. Towards a fund for future children? Against the student loans or mortgage? Get disability or life insurance outside our jobs? A long-term investment vehicle like government bonds or a Roth IRA?

personalfinance,FAFSA Disability Loan Forgiveness,"Hi there folks. First post here. Looking for some advice.

Does anyone know of a way to get her loans back under FAFSA so that she can apply for loan forgiveness? Is it possible to reverse the payment on the loan or refinance her loan under FAFSA?

personalfinance,Drowning in debt,"Hello all. Sorry this is kind of long.  
My husband and I have found ourselves in a serious debt situation and I cannot handle the stress of it any longer. I desperately need some advice.

Backstory:

My husband makes around $2200 a month. He was away for work and supposedly saving all possible money for my move back in January. I did not find out there was no savings until Jan when I was already in progress with my move. During that move the job that I had lined up ($1600 a month) didn't work out.  Because there was no savings all expenses got put on the credit cards that I had just paid off with a debt consolidation loan. I will list monthly expenses and the debts we have. I am desperately trying to find work but no where will hire me since we are moving again in May.  

&amp;#x200B;

We have since addressed my husbands reckless spending, he realizes it was a mistake and follows the budget we have made to a T. We make bills every month but we have no room to pay down the debts or to even buy a nice rib eye. 

&amp;#x200B;

Monthly Bills

&amp;#x200B;

|Bill|Amount|
|:-|:-|
|Rent|$770|
|Insurance|$164|
|Spectrum|$51|
|Debt Consolidation Loan|$452|
|Car|$207|
|Phone|$87|

&amp;#x200B;

Debts

&amp;#x200B;

|Debt|Debt amount|Interest rate|
|:-|:-|:-|
|CC1|$251.95|?|
|CC2|$2,012.82|20.24%|
|CC3|$2,305.86|22.24%|
|CC4|$3,001.98|21.24%|
|Debt Consolidation Loan|$11,033.37|20.99%|
|Car Loan|$11,080.50|4.59%|

&amp;#x200B;

So i don't really count the car loan as ""debt"" as we have a great monthly payment and an amazing interest rate.  
Before you ask, we cannot sell. It is our only car and we needed something reliable.

I called the company that the debt consolidation loan  is through and they said we can do interest only payments for a few months to get back on our feet but I am unsure if that is a good idea.

&amp;#x200B;

We eat out maybe twice a month, but every other day of the month we eat rice, beans, and other cheap produce. We spend maybe $250 on groceries. We can't really cancel the internet as I am at home all day and I use it to not go insane/attempt to make money online. 

  
I have applied to every place that isn't sketchy in my town. My husband works as much as he can. We don't have a lot to sell that would be worth it. The one thing worth selling at all is already in the process of being sold.

&amp;#x200B;

I just need some advice. I have no idea what to do. I am stressing so much. We don't spend money at all. we have a budget and follow it. We spend maybe $30 every two weeks going out to eat. We both see that as a necessity because of how much time I spend in the house and it is nice to get that quality time together. I don't know how to get on top of this debt. Someone please give me some ideas. Thank you for any and all information.",finance

I'm 48 years old and I live in Florida. I make $110K/year as a software engineer (in a stressful job I'd like to leave someday). Right now my only debt is the $350K remaining mortgage I owe on a $500K home.

I have about $151K invested right now. About $114K in Vanguard: $31K in VEXAX, $27K in VFIAX, $15K in VFTAX, $15K in VSEQX, and $26K in VTMSX. No particular reason for these other than that they looked good and I feel good about the socially-aware funds. All stocks, no bonds. I also have $37K sitting in a Federated MDT Large Cap Value Fund. All of this isn't chump change, but I know it's nowhere near enough to retire on.

I also don't have money in any retirement accounts, other than a part of my paycheck I started putting towards a traditional IRA last year. (I know, I know, I've been stupid my entire career.) My employer adds half up to 4%.

I honestly haven't given any thought to when I'll retire. Sooner would be nice, but at the rate I'm at I don't see it ever happening...

My questions are:

(1) Should I be putting my money into different investments? Should I be choosing different Vanguard funds? Should I move my money out of Federated into Vanguard? Should I buy bonds (and for how long a term)?

(2) Should I put part of my paycheck toward an IRA, or is it too late in my career for that to be useful and I'd be better off putting the money toward investing it directly?

personalfinance,Questions about the car buying process,"I’m looking to buy a car used car (2016/2017 GTI or Mazda3) sometime after 3/15 (so I can apply for the loan with my pay raise that is effective 3/1). This will be my second car ever and the first time I buy a car with a loan. My only previous car buying experience was a much older car that was cheap enough for me to just pay for from my savings. 

As I’m looking into the car loan process and how that relates to the dealership I have a few questions. 

1) I have a good credit score 793 per Discover’s free FICO tool, but I don’t have much history. I have student loans that I have never missed a payment on, I have 3 credit card accounts none of which is more than 3 years old. I’ve never missed a payment on any of these cards. I’m also an authorized user on one of my parents’ credit cards. They don’t miss payments either. 

Will my short credit history outweigh my good credit score/history?

2) I bank with a local credit union. I’ve never taken out a loan with them before. I went to talk to a person there a few days ago, to see if they could give me a ballpark interest rate that I could expect them to offer me. They claimed that was not possible. Is that accurate? Is there any way to get a ballpark rate without actually applying for a loan (and incurring a hard pull)?

3) Can and should I apply for a car loan from my credit union and also the dealership or another bank that I have no relationship with, to see what different rates they might offer me? Will the multiple applications really sunk my credit?

4) I have calculated that I can afford a $4,000 down payment on this car, and my total out the door budget is between $16,000 and $17,500. When I apply for the loan, do I tell the bank how much money I need, or do I tell them which car I want and they will tell me how much of the price they will loan me?

5) When I’m talking to the dealership about paying for the car, do they get the down payment as a cashiers check from me and the balance from the bank, or do I pay the down payment to the bank and the bank sends the whole purchase price to the dealer?

6) Is there a recommended length for a car loan to run? I’ve seen a lot of dealerships have calculators on their websites that default to periods or 60-72 months. That seems like a very long time, though the monthly payments are quite low (I can afford higher monthly payments than those calculated for the 60-72 month run times).

7) I’m looking at a few cars in my price range. Some are certified pre-owned, some aren’t. The non-certified ones are about $1,500 to $2,000 cheaper. Is the warranty that come with a CPO car actually worth the price premium? Are non-manufacturer warranties available that might provide similar protection at a lower cost?

personalfinance,Note About Traditional Retirement Accounts in Pennsylvania,"Hello [r/pf](https://www.reddit.com/r/pf),

I was going through my PA state tax return for the year and I came across information that might be useful from a planning perspective if you're a Pennsylvania resident, a nonresident otherwise subject to Pennsylvania taxes, or a person who is planning on retiring in Pennsylvania.

1. Traditional 401(k) and IRA Contributions are **not deductible from income** for Pennsylvania State Tax in the year of contribution.
2. Distributions taken from such accounts prior to reaching age 59.5 **are taxable** to the extent that distributions exceed cumulative contributions (similar to Roth IRA rules for Federal Tax purposes). After that time, these amounts are not included in income.
3. Amounts rolled over from Traditional to Roth Accounts are **not included** in income for Pennsylvania Tax purposes.

In short, for Pennsylvania Tax Purposes, Traditional retirement accounts for Federal Tax purposes are treated nearly identically to Roth accounts. I can find no discernable differences.

This means that you could potentially pay zero state income tax on Traditional 401(k) and IRA amounts if you make those contributions *while living* *in a state* that allows for such deductions and subsequently move to Pennsylvania *for retirement*. Alternatively, if you make such contributions while you live in Pennsylvania and move to another state *for retirement*, you could potentially be taxed twice for such contributions. This isn't intended to insinuate that the 3.07% flat tax on income in Pennsylvania is enough, in isolation, to make decisions about saving/living in retirement; I'm merely positing it as something to consider for planning purposes.

Hope this was informative!

personalfinance,"Should I be making the ""Standard"" payment on my federal student loans before putting money into savings/retirement/mortgage?","I understand that, generally speaking, extra money should first go toward an emergency fund, then high-interest loans, then retirement, then finally, student loans. However, does this advice presuppose that one is paying the ""Standard"" repayment amount on said federal loans?

I have finally, ten years after graduating, reached a point where I have ""extra"" money. I started saving for an emergency fund and I am also contributing a very small amount of money to a retirement account, just to get the account up and running. My private student loans have been refinanced to as low a rate as I could get and I am paying the maximum monthly payment. However, on my federal loans, I am only paying the ""Extended"" rate, which is about $100 per month less than ""Standard"" rate. Should I up it to the ""Standard"" rate, and then adjust my savings and retirement money based on my new, smaller amount of disposable income?

personalfinance,Construction Loan - good idea or stay away?,"Good morning, r/personalfinance

&amp;#x200B;

My wife and I are examining whether to sell our current house and buy a bigger one or to build an extension onto our current house.  One of the builders who drew up some proposed expansions stated we should get a construction loan to finance the addition.

&amp;#x200B;

Background:  we bought a house on short sale in 2011.  Our mortgage payment is roughly $1300 a month.  We have roughly $170k left on the mortgage (and $25k in student loan debt).  By our back of the envelope math we guess we can afford $700-$900 more a month in a mortgage.  We have a HELOC availabe for $25k but it's based on prime interest rate.

&amp;#x200B;

Due to the local housing market, our house has gained $135k in estimated value from 2011 to now. However, all comparable houses (not even mentioning upgraded houses) are now out of our range.  E.G. a 5 bedroom, 3-4 bath house is not 6-700k.  We have 3 kids and are in a 5 bedroom, 3 bath house now.  We wanted to add a room on the bottom and expand our bedroom on the second story to add a bigger master bath and closet and turn our existing bath and closet into more bathroom space for the kids. 

&amp;#x200B;

Problem 1 - i've asked for estimates to  ""build our dream"" and have been told twice ""well what's your budget,"" which makes me suspicious that they are going to estimate whatever I say our budget is.  

&amp;#x200B;

Problem 2 - Is a construction loan/refinancing a good idea with today's interest rate.  One finanical advisor we spoke with mentioned refinancing to a better rate on a 15-year note but that was before we thought about expanding.

stocks,Ladybaybee stock picks for 2019-03-04,"[Link to imgur](https://imgur.com/a/JiOg0sl)

**HOW I USE THIS:** 


1) All the stocks identified in the table are qualified as “BUY” opportunities.

2) I focus in the column “Success Rate(3m)” which shows the precision of the agents in the last 3 calendar months. I personally feel most comfortable with Rates 0.8 or higher. 

3) Then, I see the number in “Tx(3m)” which represents the number of transactions that the agents predicted for this stock in the last 3 months. I prefer stocks that have had at least two transactions during this period. 

4) Finally, I look at Growth(3m), if the agents have had a considerable growth (&gt;5% in 3 months) then I follow that trade. 

5) If a row in the table is colored green then it means that stock has been on the rise today so I purchase it immediately in order to ride the wave up. On the other hand, if the row is colored red, then I wait out until very close to market close to purchase the stock and let the price bottom out before climbing up again tomorrow.


6) After I purchase the stocks, I ALWAYS set a stop loss order at -2.5% from my buying price valid for the day. I think this is good hygiene, no matter how confident I am of my system, I still want to make sure that my losses are capped. I update this stop loss order every day. 


**BACKGROUND**


I am not a financier or economist. I am electrical engineer with equal passion in artificial intelligence and financial markets. For the past 2 years I have been working on a system that would make short term predictions of stocks. The system is rather complex, I use multiple layers which include: Convolutional Neural Networks, LSTMs and Genetic Algorithms. All bulked together produce an output like in this image. The way to interpret the image is a follows: Symbol and Date columns are self explanatory, Quorum refers to autonomous agents that decide whether to BUY/NOT BUY or SELL/HOLD a stock. Each symbol has 9 agents, and the Quorum column, counts the number of agents that recommend Buy, Selling or Holding the stock. The “Not Owned” column means: if you don’t own this stock then you should … The “Owned” column means: if you own this stock you should HOLD or SELL. The column “Growth(1 Year)” refers to what what has been the growth of this system of Agents in the past calendar year. The column “Tx(1Yr)” shows the number of full transactions that these agents recommended in the last calendar year. “Factor” is just the division of Growth divided by Transactions to get the average growth per transaction. Finally “Success Rate” shows how successful these agents have been in their recommendations in the past calendar year, success 1 means 100% successful, 0.5 means 50% successful, and so on.

Many people have been curious about the actual process that the system follows, so here it is: for every symbol (600 stocks are analyzed daily), we get the full stock data (open,close,high,low,volume) for the past 4 months. Each stock is associated with another set of “lookalike” stocks as well as major ETF’s. This initial dataset is run through a convolutional layer that extracts an undisclosed number of features. These features are then passed onto a recurrent neural network (LSTM) where sequences and patterns are extracted. The LSTM then spits out probabilities for the likelihood that this stock will have a positive, negative and neutral tendency in the next N days. These probabilities are then fed to a genetic evolution system (GES). This system essentially checks the predictions for the past N days and compares them with reality, following that the systems knows which predictions are performing the best. Once the system knows which stocks are being simulated the best, then the system automatically finds which of these best performing stocks have the biggest potential for the next few days. The system does not output explanations, unfortunately us humans are not capable of understanding (or visualizing) a problem of this dimensionality, for example the LSTM part alone works with over 10 million dimensions, not features but dimensions.

personalfinance,Collections from a Public University,"TL;DR Enrolled in a university in 2016, was told I owe $5000 for classes I did not know I was enrolled in and unreturned financial aid, and was told no collections agency would be involved and to pay back whenever. Rcvd a call from a collections agency this morning stating I need to pay back the money now. Sorry for the long post.

&amp;#x200B;

Hello PF. I think I have a somewhat unique situation on my hands. I am in Houston, Texas. I am now 22.

&amp;#x200B;

In 2016, I transferred into my local public university from out of state. (University of Houston) I enrolled in a full load of classes for the fall semester. (15 hours I think) After enrolling, I was told that only 12 of my 90 credit hours would transfer. Upon hearing this, I called the school and told them to cancel any of my classes that I have been enrolled in and that I would not be attending that university. It was at this point I enrolled in my original school in Mobile, Alabama with plans to move back there in the spring of 2017. (University of Mobile - private uni)

&amp;#x200B;

I received a check for I believe $1900 in November of 2016. I made the colossal mistake of not paying attention to who the check was sent from and assuming it was from the financial aid department of the Alabama school for my spring semester. I cashed this check to pay for school related expenses - books, tuition, moving, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I moved back to TX after a semester because I was told there were problems with my financial aid due to the amount my parents made and me being their dependent. I was not qualified for any financial aid and would have to pay completely out of pocket. I did/do not have that kind of money and parents didn't want to help. Long story short, can't really go back to school without starting over. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some additional information. I started a phone repair business at a flea market in AL that I did completely legitimately and failed epically. I did some very stupid things financially to start the business: put all of the start up costs on my very high interest rated credit cards, I had zero cash to invest in the business, and I spent money on aspects of the business that I should have waited until it was more established to spend it on. All of this to say, I came out on the other side with about $10k of credit card debt.

&amp;#x200B;

In the summer of 2018 I decided it would be more productive to finish school at a public university and I had been filing as an independent since 2017, so I would be able to start attending school in the fall of 2019 school year. I reverse transferred all of my hours to a JuCo in AL and they issued an AA that I would have hopefully been able to transfer more hours of into a university in TX. When I went to the same school I had been enrolled in 2016, I was told that my account was suspended and I would not be able to attend or enroll until my $5000 outstanding balance was paid. (Also two 'F's on my transcript) I was told that the only two classes I had taken were never paid for, that $1900 was for un-returned financial aid, and the remainder was in collection fees. At the time, I didn't think I had cashed a check from them and confirmed a day later from an old bank statement it was the check that I thought was from my AL school.

&amp;#x200B;

Back at the TX school, I explained that I never took a class at their university and that I had called and dropped out of all of the classes I was enrolled in back in 2016. They threw me through the ringer, I spoke to the teachers of those classes and they said there was nothing they could do. I spoke to the deans, was told there was nothing they could do. I was truly at a loss. I went back to the financial aid department and asked how long I had to pay and if it would go to collections. They said point blank, there was no deadline and that stuff like this DOES NOT GO TO COLLECTIONS. They also said they did not offer repayment plans, so it would have to be lump sum whenever I had the money. I clarified multiple times, yet I was/am too dumb to get it in writing. This was in July of 2018, I believe.

&amp;#x200B;

Since I was under the impression that I had all the time in the world to pay this $5000 back I put it on the back burner to pay back my credit cards as soon as possible. Side note, I had the extreme privilege and blessing of meeting my now fiance at the end of 2017. Her wonderful amazing mother heard about my troubles with my credit cards in April or so last year and loaned the full balances of the three credit cards I owed on to pay them off so I didn't kill myself with interest. She has been a godsend and hasn't charged interest or even a repayment plan. I am about two paychecks from paying her back in full.

&amp;#x200B;

Back to this $5000 outstanding balance. I just received a call from a collections agency about 30 minutes ago, asking how I plan to pay the $5000 back. The agent introduced herself as a debt collector and that it was for the amount owed to the university. Since I was kind of flabbergasted by the call, I said I don't owe anything and hung up on them. I don't know where to go from here and if 1) I have any recourse in just paying the $1900 that I now feel like stole and 2) if this can or will affect my credit. Additionally, if I will be paying all of this back, should I go to the collection agency to take care of it or go through the school? And if this is too specific then nbd, but do collection agencies have repayment plans to take care of this?

Forex,Statistical methods for Forex?,"So, I am trying to be more precise with my trading. I was looking in the wiki here, but the books mentioned, and the general outline does not mention statistical analysis for Forex, or trading in general.

A brief overview of my current progress: I started with the standard route to trading: reading books/articles on TA patterns, indicators, heuristics etc. to guide my reasoning for opening a position. Initially, it went well. I even wrote some EAs and one of them was sufficient enough to book some profits. Along the way, I became aware of basic understanding of fundamentals and FA. Then, I got greedy, started to ""gamble"" with currency pairs that were too risky. Then lost it all, made it back, lost it again, finally made it back. Learnt some lessons along the way, and the greed impulse is sufficiently eradicated after that whole trauma. And it's not even been a year!

Now, partly because of my professional background, and partly because of the experience for almost a year, I find that this whole TA stuff is not sufficient, even when vaguely paired with FA (guessing where the market will go, based on interest rate decisions, GDP, PMI, central bank mandate, interviews, policies, political conditions, reading qualitative books on specific economies). I have a qualitative strategy for now, based on simple MAs and pivots/SR levels.

At the same time, people say that ""no one can predict what will happen next in markets."" Which is true and all, but what about a probabilistic, quantitative *idea* of where the market is heading?

Is there any hope with regression analysis, or some advanced probability calculus course, that helps with trading, or even Forex trading specifically? Any books that have helped any traders here?

Currently, I am reading [Evidence-Based Technical Analysis](https://www.amazon.com/Evidence-Based-Technical-Analysis-Scientific-Statistical/dp/0470008741) and [Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Statistical-Learning-Applications-Statistics/dp/1461471370). EBTA is alright, not yet giving me much precise ground. ISL is a general textbook, which I am reading just for the fun of it. Hopefully, it will be a good foundation for developing future strategies.",finance
personalfinance,Stay Contractor or take a Federal Position?,"Good Morning everyone,

I am 25 years old and have been working in the cyber security field for over 5 years. As many of you know, the cyber sector is very lucrative in the private and government contracting world.

I currently have a security clearance but I am in processing for a higher level clearance in my current government contracting position. The federal job does not require that higher level clearance. The federal job is certainly more interesting and would give me an opportunity to do something new and pick up new skills.

worldpolitics,Brewers and Bankers of Ireland,"The Guinness family are a powerful Anglo-Irish bloodline equal to royalty. They partly own the Guinness beer company, were members of the UK Parliament, and also bankers that established Guinness Mahon Bank which they later sold. The Guinness brewing business was involved in rigging the stock market known as the Guinness share-trading fraud however only executives were arrested and not the family owners. J Rothschild Holdings was involved with this insider trading but were not charged with any crimes. Their Guinness Mahon Cayman Trust laundered profits for drug dealers. The Guinness family have intermarried with the Furstenberg and Rothschild families and do business with the British Rothschild branch. They also married with the House of Hohenzollern and Patrick Guinness inherited their Swiss titles of Count of Neuchatel. Jonathan Guinness is a British Peer and worked as a banker. Patrick Guinness is involved in blood trafficking like many distillers connected with royalty. Some of these Irish clans are working with both the Catholic Vatican and Protestant British Crown. Members of the Guinness family include Arthur Edward Rory Guinness the 4th Earl of Iveagh who is officially worth over 1 billion, Kenelm Edward Lee Guinness the 5th Baron of Ashford, Sir John Ralph Sidney Guinness, the very evil Desmond Guinness, Jonathan Guinness the 3rd Baron of Moyne, Daphne Guinness, Aster Guinness, Valentine Guinness and his ex wife and witch Lulu Guinness who is insanely evil, as well as Tom Guinness. Valentine Guinness is a ruthless psychopath that sends me constant death threats. Baron Ken Maginnis of Drumglass is a British politician, baron, and former soldier. The Guinness family branched off from the Maginnis clan. The Guinness family claim to be related to the McCartan family. A ruthless and sadistic gang stalker named Alison-McCarthy Senatro works for the Guinness family. The Guinness Partnership founded by Edward Guinness the 1st Earl of Iveagh is a subsidized housing company that owns 65,000 homes in England. This is modernized form of feudalism. Wealthy families conspire together to monopolize wealth, land, and industry and then provide small homes for the people they are oppressing and call it charity. The right thing to do is to lock up these criminals and seize their monopolized wealth and assets obtained through fraudulency to be distributed among the people they are oppressing.
 
The Hennessy family is an influential Irish bloodline. The banker Edward L Hennessy Jr. was a financial adviser for the Vatican, Roman Knight of Malta, Papal Knight of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre, and a Papal Knight of St Gregory. Edward Hennessy Jr was also the director of Lockheed Martin, Traveler’s Insurance Company, New York Stock Exchange, Union Texas Petroleum Corporation, the National Association of Manufacturers, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the United States Export and Import Bank. John Leroy Hennessy is called the ""Godfather of Silicon Valley"" and has been a board member for Google, Cisco Systems, and Atheros Communications. He was president of Stanford University and still has authority at Stanford which oversees most major tech companies in Silicon Valley. A gang stalker named Derek Warriner works for these Irish bloodlines and he like a member of the IRA. He creates homemade explosives and he has sent me about a thousand death threats since Whitey Bulger died. Matthew Hennessy is an Irish computer scientist involved with coding. John Pope Hennessy was an Irish-British politician who was the Governor of Hong Kong during British rule. The Hennessy family own Jas Hennessy &amp; Co the largest producer of Cognac in the world. They merged their Cognac business with Moet et Chandon champagne and created Moet Hennessy and Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton which is ran by Bernard Arnault who is worth about 37 billion. Bernard Arnault does business in London and with Diageo which partly owns LVMH and Hennessy and produces Guinness from London. Bernad Arnault is a Knight of the British Empire so he can do business in London. Jean Hennessy was a French politician descended from the branch that created Hennessy Cognac and also part of a French political dynasty. Jean Hennessy appears to be the father of Kilian Hennessy who merged Hennessy with Moot et Chandon champagne. Patrick Hennessy ran Ford Motor Company in London for decades. John Hennessey created the well known Hennessey Performance Engineering in Texas.
 
The Bailey Family are another Anglo-Irish bloodline involved in British banking as well as a political family in the United States and United Kingdom. The Bailey family are British Peers as the Barons of Glanusk. Andrew John Bailey has been Chief Cashier at the Bank of England and is currently Chief Executive of the Financial Conduct Authority. Alan Bailey is a Knight of the Order of the Bath and worked for Her Majesty's Treasury. Alice Bailey was an occultist and developer of the New Age religion as well as the co-founder along with her husband Foster Bailey of Lucifer Publishing Company later renamed Lucis Trust.

They are also financing Luciferian cults fronted as ""seminars"" around the world and have operations in the United Kingdom, United States, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. The Lucis Trust has Consultative Status with the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations. They organize and finance gang stalking and human sacrifices. There is an extremely evil and ruthless child murdering satanic witch in my region named Jamie Cahill-Bailey and she is married into this family. There are dozens of British and American politicians with the name Bailey through out the centuries. Bailey's Irish Cream is a popular cream liqueur owned by Diageo which was partly created and owned by Guinness. Bailey's Irish Cream is named after the Bailey's Hotel and its owner James Bailey. Mansfield Brewery was an English brewery established by William Edward Baily and was bought by Marston's Brewery which has over 1700 pubs in the UK with yearly profits of over 20 million. Anthony Bailey is a delegate for the Bourbon-Two Sicilies Constantinian Military Order of Saint George, Knight of the British Empire, and Vatican Knight. Anthony Bailey works in public relations, politics, and charities and his wife Marie-Therese von Hohenberg is of Austrian nobility. Thomas H.

1: Is there anything I should be aware of when applying for credit cards in general?

2: What's a good way to make sure I save up enough every month to pay off the card?

3: What would be a good use of the card? Groceries? Smaller monthly payments? Rent? A combination? Or should I use it just for emergencies?

Thanks for the help! I'm looking forward to getting good insight on this topic.",finance
personalfinance,Spend down cash for grad school or invest or sit on cash?,"Hi All. I’ve obeyed the prime directive and am debt free with my EM and maxed out retirement accounts. I’ve recently liquidated all my taxable investments since the market continues to flirt with highs and I just finally hit my # to pay for grad school.  
  
I’ll be going to school this Fall full-time (read: NO INCOME) for 2 years while also paying tuition that will either set me back a total of $150k in cash or saddle me with the most debt I’ve ever had in my life. I still need to make sure I have cash on hand to pay for normal living expenses beyond tuition (food, rent, etc.). I’m currently liquid (exclusive of EM and retirement accounts) about $250k so paying tuition in cash will get me down to $100k and I imagine rent and food and other living expenses over 2 years will bring me down to like $40k.  

I imagine I’d want to buy a house within the first 5 years after graduating and I know it’s important for mortgages to ensure I have: (1) a good credit score and (2) lots of cash on hand. Other than school and a house, I don’t see any other “big ticket” items in the near-term for me.  

All said, thinking of me being liquid $40k after 2 years and being debt free would be OK if not for worrying about building up cash again for a down payment and a solid mortgage rate. But who knows where housing prices and interest rates will be then. I want to know whether you all think I should go into debt for grad school like everyone else or pay with cash. Also if I do take on debt, I feel I’d still just keep the cash on hand instead of investing in case of a recession. Graduating in a recession will mean I need a lot of cash to get me through potentially up to 1 extra year of expenses if I’m un/under-employed after graduating.  

Thanks for helping me think through this.",finance

personalfinance,"[UPDATE] $30k defaulted private student loan debt, wages garnished, Please help!","[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/ao6vzh/30k_defaulted_private_student_loan_debt_wages/)

Summary from OP: Retired parent is getting social security garnished from outstanding $30k student loan.  No info on my or parent's credit reports nor the national student loan data system.  I am prepared to pay the loan, but can't find any information about it.  /u/RandomizedRedditUser recommended that I get the debt validated.   


**Update:**
After this advice, I sent a (certified USPS) modified debt validation form letter that I found on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau: [examples here](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/what-should-i-do-when-a-debt-collector-contacts-me-en-1695/) requesting additional information from the debt collector.

The debt collector responded with a copy of the Federal PLUS Loan Application and Master Promissory Note (one page, front and back - this is one document, not two).  This is literally just an application for a loan (or multiple loans, denoted by the fine print) and it was certainly signed and dated by my mother.  

* Data point #1: federal loan, not a private loan (but shouldn't that be listed on the National Student Loan Data System??) 
* Neither of us have this loan on our NSLDS accounts. 
* No information was included about the amount or age of the debt, nor the amount of the debt when the loan was obtained, no information about interest, fees, or charges.  
* Another problem I have with the response from the collection agency is that it doesn't attach any student loan account numbers.  

Over the years, I've paid off a couple of my student loans and I'm continuing to pay on other student loans...I don't have a record of getting money from my mom so now I'm a bit suspicious of this debt.  That said, doesn't the debt have to be valid if she's getting her social security garnished??

**Questions to keep moving forward:**

What recourse do I have here?  Should I send the debt collector a second letter asking them to validate the debt? The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's [website](https://www.consumerfinance.gov) is phenomenal, but this situation isn't really covered.  I expected more information from the debt collector.  Is it time to get a lawyer to help me obtain information from the debt collector and sort out this debt?

personalfinance,Car loan payoff timing and its affect on my credit score for buying a home this summer,"Hi all,

I would like to pay off my car loan. I have the funds to do it all right now. My payment is stupid high and I bought the car at a stupid high interest rate. I have two years left on my loan, and according to a calculator, if I pay it off, I'll save around $2500 in interest. Big yikes on young me.

Anyway, my wife and I are wanting to buy a house in May-June of this year. We have the money and ability to do it comfortably. That's not really what this post is about.

My credit history is pretty weak. I don't have late payments. I just don't have much credit. Her credit is stellar, but based on my research, mortgages are based on the weakest of the two applicants? Outside of my car loan signed in 2015, my only other line of credit is a $300 secured card started in the spring of 2017 that has yet to graduate for some unknown reason. And that's it. CreditKarma shows me as a 720/740 on the two scores (up from 488 in 2015!).

My current DTI ratio is 15%. Eliminating my payment would drop me to 7%. 

I think I have three options (maybe more that I'm not thinking about):

1) Pay the damn thing off all at once right now to save the max and lower my DTI ratio but risk tanking my score

2) Pay off a huge chunk now that won't pay it off but only leave about 4 months of payments to get great savings and keep my line open until after the house is done

3) Don't do anything and just do it after buying the house

Any advice?",finance
personalfinance,Can someone explain to me why you want an emergency fund before paying off a line of credit?,"Trying to turn our finances around.

I totally get why you want an emergency fund while paying off a car loan or student loan or whatever because if something comes up and you truely need that money, you can't withdraw it from your car or your education.

Our current debt that we need to tackle most is our line of credit. It's not as high an interest rate as a credit card loan but still significantly higher than we'd earn from a simple liquid savings account. It's not maxed out, there's another 11,000$ before we reach that max that we *could* theoretically, if necessary, access in the event of an emergency.

So even if we saved up 1000$ emergency fund but the line of credit had a 1000$ higher balance, and had to withdraw 500 or however much from the emergency fund, how is that better than adding that 1000$ to the line of credit from the start then if needed, then taking that 500 from the line of credit when the emergency comes up?

Edit: thanks everyone, had some details pointed out to me I hadn't thought of initially, makes much more sense now. 

Now I'm wondering though if I should move 1000$ from my line of credit into my savings in the event that my credit limit is lowered. That feels weird and like cheating but if I'd been making smaller payments in order to save money the past couple months it wouldn't be any different, right?",finance
personalfinance,Did my HR lady screw up my 2018 W-2 state taxes?,"I want to start off by saying this is my first attempt to ever file taxes all on my own, and I checked off ""1"" on my W-4.

Regarding my job, I live in NY but my company is headquartered in PA. I started the job on March 2018 and from then on until right before May 2018, I was living in PA at my parents'. For the rest of the year, I lived in NY. Upon receiving my W-2 forms, I noticed all entries (street, city, etc.) for my NY address are listed correctly except for the state - my address lists PA instead of NY.

With all that being said, I received two W-2 forms with one being an employee (aka federal) reference and the other being a PA reference. There are two parts I didn't understand, with the first part being my reported wages on the PA reference W-2 was about 88% of my reported wages on my employee reference W-2. The second part is the state income tax on the PA W-2 is about 81% of my state income tax on my employee W-2 (box 15 on the employee W-2 is listed as ""TOTAL STATE""). I didn't understand at first why these two parts didn't match and talked to my HR lady. After speaking to her and regarding the second part, I understand that the difference between the state income taxes listed on my employee W-2 and PA W-2 is the state income tax I paid to NY (I verified this by performing the calculation myself and seeing the number listed on one of the state income taxes boxes listed on the employee W-2). Regarding the first part, I technically made 88% of my income from PA with the rest coming from I guess a combination of NY and PA or just NY?

I was luckily able to upload both W-2's on TurboTax with no hassle. As soon as I completed the federal tax portion on TurboTax, I immediately saw I owe NY about 4.5% of my reported wages on the employee W-2 and immediately thought what the hell!!! I completed the rest of the questions for the PA and NY tax portions on TurboTax (I want to point out I was definitely not confident on some of my answers to the questions). But according to TurboTax, I still apparently owe 4.5% of my reported wages to NY. I reported this to my HR lady, and she said there shouldn't be anything wrong with the W-2's and wants to take a look at the file TurboTax will create for me upon completion and filing.

I'm fortunate in that at this moment, I'm back at my parents' due to medical leave. I was able to explain all this to my dad, and he immediately thought my HR lady screwed up with my address listed on the W-2's. I was luckily able to talk to my parents' accountant too, and he also thought the same thing but also offered more details - he thinks I paid too much in PA taxes while paying too little in NY taxes, which explains why according to TurboTax I owe NY so much money. Both my dad and his accountant think my HR lady screwed up.

Does anyone else think my HR lady screwed up big time??? I know I have plenty of time to get this all resolved before the IRS knocks on my door and am now going to file my taxes with the said accountant instead of using TurboTax, but man this is really freaking me out.

personalfinance,"I’ve heard two different things from two different mortgage lenders and I need help figuring out which is true, if either.","I’m about to get a mortgage on a house, but I’ve got a couple of super small (&lt;$300) debts I need to get rid of just for an extra credit score boost to make things easier. 

I also want to preface this by saying 5 years ago, I was not in the same place I am now financially and I’m doing significantly better. 

I talked to mortgage lender 1 who is the most promising. When he pulled my credit (I’m literally about to make an offer on this house so it was justified), he told me that I have a $200 debt from 2015 that I didn’t know about. In 2015, I had a super small credit card go to collections. I paid that off (I can’t remember when), and they sent me a letter of confirmation which basically said I’m done with it. Nothing else came of it and I’ve not heard anything else from anyone. But when he pulled my credit, it showed I still owe. I called the credit card company and they basically had no idea what I was talking about, but they did confirm I owe this balance (and they agreed that it was weird but asked me if I could still pay it). So this has been sitting on my credit report and I’ve known nothing about it. Credit karma doesn’t even show me anything. 

When I asked the lender what I should do, he recommended just paying it off since it’s so small and it will help me. I haven’t done it yet, but this is where the next part comes in. 

I talked to another mortgage lender who basically said to *not* pay it off, that it’ll significantly and negatively affect my credit at first, although it’d help in the long run. 

I don’t know who to listen to and the credit card company was essentially useless in giving me advice to what the best choice would be. I want it off my credit report because honestly, this is holding up the whole process and making my interest rate higher than it needs to be, even though it’s such a small amount. Can anyone give me advice on what I need to do? Pay it off or leave it?

Thanks!

personalfinance,Recent college graduate looking for advice on tackling debt,"I've been a lurker on this sub for a while and considered myself pretty good with money, until I graduated college and looked at my student loan balance. I am a first-gen college student and my parents did what they could to help, but I ended up taking on unnecessary debt just to graduate. I hope to get some feedback on the best way to manage all this.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a 24 y.o. male that recently graduated college and moved in with my gf. We live in a medium COL area. I make 51k per year, after taxes I end up taking home around $3k each month.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll format the best I can, here is my current debt situation:

* Sallie Mae
   * $11,235.32 @ 9.875% interest
   * $1,555.41 @ 9.875% interest
   * $21,123.64 @ 10.625% interest
   * $2,498.86 @ 10.25% interest
   * $2,805.47 @ 9.625% interest
   * Total current balance as of today: $39,218.70
* Federal Student Loans
   * $38,727 @ 4.3% interest (weighted average)
* Discover Credit Card
   * Discover CC: $3770.90 @ 21.24% interest

&amp;#x200B;

My monthly bills:

* Car payment - $175
* Rent - $480
* Utilities - $120 (ish)
* CC payment - $300 (just started paying this amount last month)
* Sallie Mae - $75 (signed up for $25 autopay to lower interest rate)
* Rent and bills from previous apartment - $300 

&amp;#x200B;

Other expenses include Netflix, Spotify, eating out, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents are still helping me out by handling my car insurance and phone bill, that will fall in my lap soon enough. The rent from previous apartment couldn't be avoided as the lease was already in effect and I graduated college in December. It wasn't the best financial decision but I'll take the hit for now, I will be off the hook by July or earlier if someone else takes my spot.

&amp;#x200B;

I know I could probably transfer my CC balance to another with 0% interest to help pay it off. I also need to look into consolidating my private student loans. Are there any recommendations?

Sorry if I went on a tangent, just looking for advice as I feel overwhelmed with debt. I will answer any questions.

personalfinance,Is student loan refinancing a good idea even if I can pay the original loan off in under 2 years?,"Hello,

I have about $40,000 in student loans. Half from a private loan provider and half from the government. I still have about 4 months left of 'grace period' for the federal ones. The interest rates range from 4-5% on all of them, some are fixed and some variable.

I just got a pretty good job out of school that puts me in position to potentially pay off my loans in under 2 years with a strict budget.

One of my benefits with this company is an offer with LendKey student loan refinancing. They offer $100 to anyone who refinances through them. Obviously this isn't a huge incentive but still made me interested. As far as refinancing goes, it looks like that I could have a parent cosign and lock in a 3.5% fixed OR 2.7% variable interest rate.

This would still save me over $1,200 plus the $100 incentive. In addition I could consolidate my loans for conveinence.

Are there any downsides other than a hard pull from my credit? Even though I have my loans under control I am strongly considering going through. Anything I should know about refinancing that I'm missing?",finance

I am currently a student in a college in Quebec, Canada. Also, I will be studing for atleast the next 3 years at university.  While tuition fees are not very expansive right now, some major events in my life have led me to use my credit card on numerous occasions in the past year. My current income constists of two jobs, which equals to approximately 1000$ per month. I live with a roomate and we pay half of everything making my living expanses are around 700$ per month.  The rest of my income goes into my credit card, which I never skipped a payement so far. However, this method makes me unable to have any savings, and I can't react to emergencies, which leads me to use my credit card again (example: my car broke down a week ago and I had to use my C/C to pay the mechanic).

I cannot have acces to a gouvernemental student loan because my parents have a pretty high income, but, that being said they cannot help me with my debt since they also have debts of their own.

I did some research and found out that I can either get a student line of credit with my bank or apply for a personal loan. In both cases, the interest rate will be way lower than my C/C and I think it will make repaying the debt easier. However, I am not sure which one is better.

Or if we should pay off the loan in it's entirety and begin saving the extra $800 per month in an index fund, while building our savings back up from $30k.

&amp;#x200B;

I was hoping others with more experience might be able to lend some advise regarding how to think about this, or share similar stories and what they did.

personalfinance,Should I refinance Mortgage at higher rate,"Im in my early 30s and currently owe about 144k on my property.  I've lived in it for 4 years this July.  I have about 75-95 equity in the home (probably closer to 95 as the last home in community sold for a bit over 250).   I would like to take about 30-35k in equity out and with half pay off some debit and and the other half to do upgrades to the property (finish basement, minor kitchen/bath upgrades, flooring).  Second, I'm considering refinance w/ a conventional loan because the program which i purchased my home through does not allow renting the property or HELOC.  Do you think its worth the higher interest rate? I do have about 30k in 401k, and an emergency savings of about 3 months.  I'm not sure of what my refinanced interest rate would be, but I'm pretty sure it'd be higher 3.375.",finance
personalfinance,Home (re)financing options,"Hello PF! Mostly a lurker, but just wanted to ask some for clarification on how to get some financing for some home renovation projects. I hope I provide all the information you guys need to help us out.


So quick facts:


Bought the home 3 years ago. Bought for $85k. Currently owe about $81k. Appraised after purchase for $92k. Spent the last 3 years doing a lot of renovating, current estimated (*not* official appraisal) is about $145k-150k. Interest rate is %4.12500. Monthly payment is about $659. Our credit scores are roughly low 700s to mid 700s. 




At this point, we're just tired of doing a bi-monthly projects to renovate and since we're basically getting a $2 to $1 estimated return on the work we've done to the house (New roof, new AC, massive clean up project inside, working on new water system (heater and softener)). We just want to get it all over with so our weekends can be focused on going out and having fun, not spending it doing another project. We want do take out between $30k-40k, but we're torn on the most efficient method to do so.


What we would like is to keep the total payment (Mortgage and new loan) at about $1000-1100. Our biggest concern is keeping a fixed interest rate. What recommendations do you guys have? We talked about a cash-out refinance, but the interest jumps to about 4.75 which we were not super happy about. We're a little high to do a personal loan. I was told HELOC are adjustable rates... As far as I'm aware, that leaves us with just a home equity loan that we can pay back separately without taking one the whole mortgage with the higher interest rate.


Please let us know what you guys think. Thank you a bunch.",finance

personalfinance,Should I sell my house or continue to rent it out?,"Backstory: I bought a house for $150,000 ten years ago, and now real estate in the whole area has gone up a lot. According to quick googling and looking at surrounding houses for sale, it is now worth $250,000 - $280,000. With the increase in price, my mortgage payments have gone up from $980 to $1320. 

I had moved to South Korea for 4 years, and rented out my house while I was gone. Once I came back I didn't have a job so I continued to rent out my house for a small profit (around $500). The renters are contracted until July 2020.

I currently have a job that makes $2800 a month after taxes, and I don't think I will be able to afford to live in my house, especially if the mortgage goes up again in a year and half. My house is also 30 mins further away from my work than where I live now. I live with my sister whom I pay around $500 a month.

---

In my head I have a few options once my renter's contract is up.

1.	Move back into my house. $1300 mortgage on a $2800 a month income.

2.	Continue to rent out my house and move into an apartment closer to work.

3.	Sell my house and move into an apartment and one day use the money I made for another house when my life has stabilized a bit.

4.	Rent out my house while I live in an apartment, then sell it once my life has stablized a bit.

Some notes that might be important in making this decision:

Outstanding Principle right now on house: $100,000

Apartment near work: around $1000 a month

Personal Debts: $12,000

My original plan: I can sell the house. Use the profits made to pay off all my debt, as well as have $60,000 to $80,000 as a downpayment for another house. 

Edit:
I have a 4.875% fixed interest rate. 

I was paying $1200 a month for a few years and this month it suddenly went up to $1320. The statement we have from the escrow account says that they believe the price will increase so they want an extra balance of $~1500 so that’s why my mortgage went up. Is this normal?",finance

personalfinance,First Time Home Buyer - Jumbo Mortgage Advice,"Hi Everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

Love this forum and browse it often, thank you to everyone that contributes! It's an unbelievable resource.

&amp;#x200B;

My wife and I are about to embark down the process of buying our first home. After nearly 10 years in NYC, a marriage, and two kids later, it's time to get out of this apartment and into a house. 

&amp;#x200B;

We're going to be buying a house in the suburbs of MD, right outside of DC. Purchase price will probably be between $950k and $1.1mm. We're planning on putting 20% down and definitely want a 30 year fixed. Credit is 800+.

&amp;#x200B;

I've done some preliminary browsing online for lenders to reach out to, and was hoping people here might be able to offer suggestions of lenders to look at. I don't love the idea of using a service like LendingTree, since I'm not keen on being a lead in a database for the foreseeable future nor do I want a ton of unsolicited calls from random lenders. However I don't feel like I've done a great job of finding enough lenders that are competitive for this type of jumbo loan. The best options I've seen advertised online are CIT Group (offering around 4.125%), Ally Bank (4.25%), and PNC Bank (4.125%). I think I'll reach out to NFCU and PenFed as well, but don't know how they'll stack up rate wise. I haven’t reached out to anyone yet, just trying to compile a list. 

&amp;#x200B;

Are there lenders that are known for being super rate competitive for this type of jumbo loan? Is there a Kayak type search database where lenders post their rates for people to browse? Ideally I'd like to reach out to 4 or 5 lenders and see who comes back with the best offer. I'd also love to work with a lender that offers mortgage recasting (or auto-recasts based on additional principal payments made), but I don't think that's something I'll be able to figure out without engaging them directly.

&amp;#x200B;

Any suggestions of lenders to reach out to, or resources to browse to get better ideas would be amazing!

personalfinance,"Edward Jones - fees, closing account, transfers","Good evening, PersonalFinance! I'm looking for some guidance on evaluating the cost/benefit of remaining with Edward Jones (EJ). Thank you in advance for your time.

BLUF: I (34 yrs old, single, no kids, only debt is student loans that will be forgiven in about 4 years due to PSLF) just received a sizeable inheritance (~$150k) via funds that were already invested with EJ. The funds are in a single account invested across a variety of stocks, ETFs, and index funds. Am I going to get eaten alive by EJ's higher (compared to Vanguard) fees or does my direction to the advisor to seek the lowest fee aggressive growth options mitigate that concern any?

Background info: I will admit to being only of average financial savvy. I know enough to max my ROTH TSP contribution every year (I'm a federal employee, military) and I have a ROTH IRA with Vanguard that I max every year (100% in VFIAX). I have a liquid emergency fund with Ally that is more than enough to cover 6+ months of expenses and it's where I've been dumping funds I'm saving for a house down payment in the next couple years.

I selected Vanguard for my IRA due to its low fees and excellent reputation. I'm concerned about leaving my inheritance with EJ for the same reasons. Can someone please point me in the right direction in the EJ literature to figure out what exactly its going to cost me annually to leave my account with EJ and, similarly, can you please help me make sure I'm correctly understanding the Vanguard costs for a fair comparison?

VFIAX has a .04% fee. What other costs are associated with this account if I'm not doing any trading?

If I do decide to close my EJ account and transfer it to Vanguard or any other brokerage, what fees should I expect? Tax implications?

Again, thank you for your time. I'm not necessarily looking for someone to tell me what to do as much as I am seeking guidance to make sure I understand the fee structures so I can make an informed decision. Suggestions are always appreciated, however.",finance
personalfinance,FedLoans. Interest capitalization occurred during administrative forbearance,"I switched to FedLoans earlier this year from another loan servicer after I sent a PSLF certification form in to them. FedLoans then put me on an administrative forbearance for my paperwork/information to transfer.

During this period, they hit me with a interest capitalization on my loans even though I had a recurring REPAYE payment set up with my previous servicer.

I appealed the capitalization with them and they denied my appeal stating that interest capitalization for forbearance was OK.

personalfinance,Do I start the avalanche method before or after interest capitalization?,"Hello, I have a simple question regarding my student loan debt. I’m about to end deferment period after graduate school, and I have several years’ worth of accrued interest that’s about to capitalize, but I also have a large amount in savings that I’d like to put toward the loans before deferment ends. **The short version of my question is this: if I have two loans, one with a smaller principal balance, smaller amount in accrued interest, and smaller interest rate than the larger one, should I still put all my saved money toward the larger interest rate loan (including accrued interest and principal balance) or should I pay off the accrued interest on both loans first, and then start tackling the principal balance of the larger loan?**

Here’s the nitty-gritty: I actually have 5 loans that look like this…

* Loan One: Principal Balance = 3,550; Accrued Interest = 137; Interest rate = 6.8%
* Loan Two: Principal Balance = 4,557; Accrued Interest = 155; Interest rate = 6.0%
* Loan Three: Principal Balance = 5,565; Accrued Interest = 177; Interest rate = 5.6%
* Loan Four: Principal Balance = 4,710; Accrued Interest = 120; Interest rate = 4.5%
* Loan Five: Principal Balance = 25,942; Accrued Interest = 12,364; Interest rate = 6.8%

I have 13k to put toward all these loans before deferment ends. After that, I have budged 1k a month toward the avalanche method. My question is, would it be best to put all 13k toward loans one and five, letting the accrued interest capitalize on loans 2-4? Or would it be best to pay off the accrued interest on all five loans first before any interest capitalizes, then put any extra toward loans one and five thereafter?

personalfinance,Trying to fix my financial situation and credit.,"Okay guys and gals. My credit is in the shitter. It's at like 451. 
My credit report only shows one basic type of debt - Student loans.

Well that's not true, there's also 1100 from an old apartment, that was an error - I have confirmation from the apt complex - and I just put in a dispute for it tonight. 
There's also an amazon credit card that seems to be WAYYYY over what it should be that I'm investigating. Limit was 100 bucks, balance is 324. I haven't been contacted before about it. I can handle that one quickly enough once I figure it out. 

There's a 21k loan from bank of america that I was never able to make a payment on - from 2008. 

The rest is student loans, to the tune of 181k. Interest truly is a mother. 

I don't make much money, and haven't for years. I'm working on that - I went through a tough time personally for years after losing a kid w/ ex fiance. Depression blah blah - don't want to bore you with my life story. 

Suffice it to say I've been broke for ages. 

I paid off my car - but it doesn't show there.

I also took out a loan against my car to repair it - and it also doesn't show there - I've paid those on time each time. 

Here's my question - how in the hell could I ever hope to get out of that kind of debt. It's completely demotivating me to make any kind of good life choices - Even if I get a job making 60k or so a year - It'd take decades. Wage garnishment is real. 
The loan is with Navient - who have effectively failed to send me any paperwork for over 6 years on income based repayment (which would have been $0) - and I'm just so tired of dealing with them. It's to the point I blocked all their numbers in my phone, because it's just too much. 

Is there ANY way that I can get out of this? Bankruptcy, Loan Forgiveness, etc, without living in the poor house the rest of my life?
The degree didn't get me a good job. I also didn't do a great job of marketing myself and making myself in demand.

Because of this - I don't even want to take a normal job that makes 50-60k a year - that just isn't enough. I find myself going towards entreprenuership - Currently I'm working in a business that works kind of like MLM, putting my eggs in the basket that I'll make it to ownership, and be good enough at that to make six figures a year. I've seen it done, and the opportunity is solid - but only for people who work their ass off and are talented. I have what it takes to do that in many regards, but my work ethic is simply lacking. 

I suspect maybe I have ADHD or something like that - but ultimately I feel crushed by the overwhelming idea of paying off this debt - especially with the 10.85% interest rate that I got fucked with half way through school. I wish to god I'd never went. 

I know many of you are going to talk about the ethics and morality of paying debt that I took out, etc. Believe me, I get you on that, so please spare me the condescension. 

I want to have a family, build a home, and have a life. I just fear that I can't do that with this hanging over my head. I know for a fact that financially concerned partners in the past have looked at that amount of debt as a massive negative, and wouldn't want to get married because that debt would then become theirs. I don't blame them for that. 

What can I do to start fixing this, or escape it entirely? I have no credit cards, and I pay all my other bills, I just can not pay the 1335 a month they want for these loans. I barely make 10/hr right now.",finance

Here's my situation - I'm just looking for a little clarity, maybe fine tuning in direction - as I think I'm doing the right thing already. 

&amp;#x200B;

Back story: 

Loan 1: 14.5k remaining @ 3.99% interest (at this stage, it's a bit under $50/mo, because it's amortized) (for my car)(yes I'm upside down on it, don't @ me) 

Credit card 1: 4,600 @ 24.99%. (oof, I know)

Credit card 2: 2,416 @ 0% (until about April of next year)(Best Buy 0% interest, if paid off in 18 months (which I set up my auto pay to pay it off in 17 months, just to be safe). (I look at this as a free loan, am I wrong?) 

Credit card 3: $0.00. This is the fun one - I was just approved for this one, at a $6,000 limit. With a zero percent transfer fee, if transfered within the first 60 days), and that remains interest free for 15 months. The idea was to transfer balance of credit card 1 to this, and set up auto pay to have it paid off in 14 months (a little over 300/mo). 

Loan 2: Pulled this loan through Lending Club to pay off some credit cards at a lower rate. I did the calculations back then, and even with the loan processing fees and such, I still saved a couple hundred bucks, so thought why not. Seem to be going fine on it so far. Current payment of 288/mo, with a bit over 5K left to go. Details here:  

Original Loan Amount: $8,500Loan Term:36 months, Interest Rate:13.59%APR:17.99%.   


To summarize, I'd like to know if I'm doing the right thing by paying off my loans / cards with an interest rate first, and making the minimum payments on the 0% interest ones in the mean time. I'm in a relatively new position, and making more than I was previously - though extremely unreliably. (Server / waiter in a high tourist traffic area).   


And by ""minimum Payment"" mentioned above, I mean if the introductory 0% interest rate lasts 15 months, I'll calculate what my payment would be if I were to pay it off in 15 months. I know they save up all that interest and tack it on the end if you don't pay it off in full.   


Is this sound logic?",finance
personalfinance,Planning to spend 2/3 of my savings to buyout my 3 year old lease....is this a bad idea?,"So I'm about to spend $14,000 on my 2016 Corolla because the lease is about to end. I have a bad credit score, so I want to avoid the hassle of negotiating a loan and paying interest and just buy the car fully. 
I have two main reasons for doing this: 1 is that my interest rates will be high due to my low credit score (600's), and 2 because not having a monthly car payment will help me afford a nicer apartment. I'm fairly sure I'm going to do this...but...

I only have 21 grand to my name. So by doing this I lose 2/3 of my lifetime savings and will have to save up all over again, which will probably be about 2 years of saving to get back to where I am now.

I'll still have money for emergencies, etc, and while I'm fairly certain this is a good plan, I'm still worried about parting with all that money for a 2016 vehicle.

CryptoCurrency,Will Facebook Coin be a serious threat to Bitcoin?,"According to [recent](https://medium.com/@lancengym/facebook-plans-to-become-worlds-biggest-central-bank-7d99d967b73c) [reports](https://medium.com/@lancengym/facebook-plans-to-become-worlds-biggest-central-bank-7d99d967b73c), Facebook plans to issue a Facebook Coin to allow seemless world-wide payments across it's combined user-base of 2.7 **BILLION** of Facebook/Whatsapp/Instagram. They appear to be talking to cryptocurrency exchanges for listing their (centralized) coin. The monetary policy appears to be pegging against a basket of fiat currencies. So it's more or less a centralized stablecoin.

What's new about this is the **huge network effect**, directly attacking the key advantage that Bitcoin always had as the first mover against other shitcoins. If this thing takes off, it could very quickly usurp Bitcoin in any of the key metrics that casual users and analysts alike are using to compare cryptocurrencies.

It may be strong competition to the payments use-case of BTC/LN. BTC will probably keep its scarcity and hard monetary policy advantage. But is it enough in the long run?

Since Facebook Coin is amost certainly completely centralized, it's also probably one data breach scandal away from disaster (not your keys, not your coins). On the other hand, Facebook's seems to be strong on security (I don't remember any major breach).

With this 2.7B-strong network effect and the peg to other world currencies, this may indeed create another world currency, directly competing with USD, EUR and others.

This may also raise the attention of governments and keep them busy regulating Facebook worldwide. This diversion of attention may or may not help Bitcoin to stay ahead.

If FB really use existing crypto exchanges as on-ramps, they will have the blast of their life times and are probably going to have huge IPOs. That's Dotcom Bubble 2.0 in the making.

What do you think? Is this large network effect a novel non-technical but social attack vector? Or can we calmly forget about it, like any other shitcoin.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,What is the best way to become self-sufficient from my parents?,"I'm 21 and in university right now. School takes up enough of my time that I there's no way I can realistically be self sufficient *and* attend school at the same time. So, I'm financially dependent on my parents, which also means I have to listen to them. Which wouldn't really be an issue, except they try to micromanage my life. Want to buy a car? Can't do that, even if it comes out of my savings. Want to take a quarter off to work a bit and figure my life out? Can't do that. I know this isn't r/relationships, so I'll try not to get too far into it, but, basically, a grown man can't live like this. It's driving me insane. 

Is there any way I can become financially self dependent relatively soon? I tried applying to part time jobs in my town, but the job market here is pretty bad and all the places are overstaffed already. And even if I got one, I would waste a lot of time every day walking to work, and it wouldn't make me much money anyway. Also, my radius of possible places to get a job is fairly small, because my parents won't let me buy a car.  

Cost of living in my area is very cheap, so, I *could* just drop out of college and even with a minimum wage job I'd be getting more money than I live off of right now, so, theoretically, I'd be fine *if* I find a job and a car in a reasonable amount of time. It just seems like a huge risk, since it might not work out, and it would definitely piss off my parents.

Ideally, I could take a quarter off and get stuff figured out. But, like I said, my parents won't let me do that. I guess I *could* just not register for next quarter and see what happens, but my parents have gotten aggressive over much smaller things, plus I'm financially  dependent on them, so this seems like a dangerous idea.

Is there any way I could conceivably get enough money to become self sufficient without taking a massive risk? I don't have anything valuable I could think of that I could sell. Maybe there's some ways to make money part time without a car? Participate in some weird research study? I have no idea.

personalfinance,Learn from my mistakes - Bad bill pay,"TLDR: Double check your bill pay settings before finalizing the payment!

&amp;#x200B;

I had a $4k statement to pay so went on the Capital One app, scheduled my payment, and went on my merry way. This was Friday, 3/1. Capital One shows the payment posted, but I don't see funds withdrawn yet...no big. Monday, 3/4, comes, and I wake up to emails and notifications from BOA that my account fell below $0 in Savings and Checking. 

&amp;#x200B;

I assume someone has my info and withdrew my money, approximately $2200. Freaking out, I check the account. NOPE. I chose BOA instead of Capital One 360 for the source of my CC payment. I use BOA for my daily purchases and things like groceries. CO360 is for fixed expenses like mortgage, preschool, etc (better interest rate).

&amp;#x200B;

The level headed thing to do is go to a branch, withdraw $4k from CO then go to BOA and deposit it. Maybe eat a $35 fee if it posts before credit. So that's exactly what I do...but I go to one by my work, not home, because hey, I have to go to work anyway, right?. Turns out not all CO branches are setup for cash withdrawal! The one by my house is, but not this one, 20+ miles from home. 

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't think I'd be able to leave work to make it back to those branches before they close so I had my wife write a CO check and do mobile deposit. She had both toddlers so running into multiple branches was daunting and this was a sane solution, assumed 1 day hold. 

&amp;#x200B;

Check deposited! Yay! 

&amp;#x200B;

Deposit Hold: Available 3/13. WHAT?!?! It's from a joint CO account to a joint BOA account, why is there a 9 day hold on funds??

&amp;#x200B;

So now I'm going to go to the branch by my house when they open, see if I can cancel the check I deposited yesterday, withdraw the cash, and go down the street to BOA and deposit. In the mean time I've initiated a withdrawal from my Barclay's account to transfer to BOA in 2-3 days in case I can't cancel the check as it is in ""Deposit Hold"" state. Once all this is settled I can get the money back in its rightful place.

news,California agency says 'clawback' of federal funds for bullet train 'would be disastrous',,finance
personalfinance,Pros and cos of filing bankruptcy (CAN),"Hi everyone, first time posting here hoping to get a little insight to some financial troubles i've been having. I'm 25 from ontario, canada if that helps with anything and all help is appreciated.

I'll start off by saying over the last couple of years I have been extremely irresponsible with my money as I have no savings at all and i a very low credit score with about 2.1k credit card debt. On top of the credit card debt I have about 1.5k in other collections thats owed, along with 6k owed to the canada government  because I claimed EI while working (stupid I know) but at the time the money was extremely needed for lawyer fees (again stupid i know). 

The last thing I need to mention is I stupidly bought a car with my ex girlfriend and theres been some issues about payment, the car is technically hers as she pays for it (when she feels like sending payments) and its been extremely stressful on my life. I should also mention this is a secured loan with a high interest rate of 25% and Ive been trying to sign this car over for a while but she wont meet my prerequisites before I do so.

I've asked a few people and I've been told I should just have the car repo'd and take the hit and file for bankruptcy but I'd like to know what some other options would be as thats more of a last resort, again thank you for any feedback.

EDIT: Forgot to mention currently not working as I got laid off 3 weeks ago due to company losing contracts.",finance

personalfinance,The IRS offset my entire refund. What are my options?,"So I was expecting $5000 dollars for my tax refund this year. We were going to use this money to catch up on rent and bills, and give ourselves a little cushion going forward. Yesterday, I found out the IRS is sending my entire refund to the Department of Education, even though I’m enrolled in a payment plan for my defaulted federal loan. 

So now, we can’t afford our apartment, and my wife and 2 kids had to move in to my in laws house. What are my options? Is there anyway to fight this, or am I going to have to bite the bullet?

personalfinance,What's the best way to fund a home improvement project?,"Let me know if this isn't the right sub for this question. 

We're first time homeowners in what will likely be our forever home. It was a decent deal but needs a LOT of work and updating. 

There are two big projects that really affect our quality of life in this house: master bathroom and kitchen. Everything else we can do ourselves, these are just a bit beyond our scope of comfort and ability, so we're hiring a company.

We're about to kick off remodeling our master bathroom. I'm budgeting about 10-15k for the project (it's a total gut and expansion) and 20k saved. My original idea was to save the funds, dump them into the project, then do the same for the kitchen. 

I'll be honest, I'm getting impatent and just want the two big things done. I also realized that we'll probably need to finance the kitchen anyway, because saving up for it will take longer than I want to wait. 

What's the best/smartest way to go about funding the bathroom (and maybe the kitchen)? From my understanding my options are:

-Home equity loan
-Home equity line of credit
-Personal loan
-Financing theough the company
-My current save/dump strategy

What are the differences and pros/cons of the methods?  Am I missing something I should take into consideration?

Thank you in advance!!

Edit 1: Sorry, mobile formstting is apparently crap. 

I should clarify, I'm not looking for the mathematics of comparing the interest rates, etc. I'm mostly looking to understand the differences in the types of loans and how they compare to just saving cash and dumping it. 

For example, someone told me a house equity loan means that I would just keep paying my current mortgage, but for a longer period of time? VS a line of credit is somehow different?

House was bought at 190k currently owe about 154k. The market value is around 240-250k based on recently sold comparable homes in the neighborhood.

personalfinance,Tax Advice Regarding an Already Filed Amended 1040-x (CA),"I'm in a bit of a bind and need some advice.

I had researched that you have 3 years to file an amendment to your return and so to beat that deadline I filed an amendment to my 2015 return about a month ago (Fed and State). The reason why I filed an amendment is because I had originally filed as married/filing separately (because my wife didn't have an SSN at that time). This time around I filed the amendment as married/jointly and I figured I might get a refund instead. During that tax filing year I owed about $1000 (to the state) which I did pay. When I filed the 540-x (CA state amendment) via Turbotax a month ago it showed that I was owed close to $2800. Score - or so I thought.

&amp;#x200B;

I just received a letter from the state (CA) yesterday that said I owed an additional $3300 and I'm freaking out and the deadline to pay is March 15th which is next week. I do not have this money to pay and I'm living paycheck to paycheck. I am currently the only income in my family of 3 with a mortgage.

&amp;#x200B;

Do I have any recourse in this situation? Can I just simply tell the State that I'd like to cancel my amended return? Should I refile another amendment with the details of my original tax filing? Since the deadline for 2015 is this April 15th, would it do anything good if I wait it out til this date to render the taxed owed moot?

&amp;#x200B;

I did the amendment through Turbotax and it was my first time doing an amendment so it's possible that I may have mucked something up such as using incorrect values or blazing through a TT section with incorrect info.

Any help is greatly appreciated to help save this burden on me and my family.

gaming,[Genuine Inquiry] Do you think the big video game companies will ever be run by people who play video games like it was in the 90s and early millennium?,"I certainly am tired and fed up with the way these huge videogame companies are selling half-made, extremely broken/low quality games.

When I was in my early teens I had great optimism for videogames and really looked forward to what games would be like when I was in my 20s.

Things are honestly just terrible. So many games are extremely low quality and don't ever live up to the hype or to the potential, so many games are sold when they aren't even properly made, tried and tested, so many games are disgustingly full of microtransactions, and so many games have a legacy of being failures (which still made money for the company).

I really miss the games when I was in my teens which were way better than we imagined, they increased in quality each time, and they pushed the potential forward and reached quality and acclaim above and beyond what was expected. Game companies seemed proud of the games they made because the people who ran those companies played those games. So many games from those days have wonderful legacies.

When will the game industry break free from these people who run these companies that don't care one iota about anything but making money? I wish we can make a change and get the quality, the fun, the happiness, joy, inspiration, and wonder back in videogames.

The last few years of the video game industry have been very bleak and depressing.",technology

They never really saved any money however they do have one great asset, which is the house in which we grew up in. 25 years ago my Parents purchased this house with the following details:
Value of house at time of purchase: $62,000
Interest on FHA loan: 7.75%
Total Principal remaining: $24,929.42
Date of last payment due: 12/18/2025

Currently, they are unfortunately barely getting by. Both are no longer able to work and both are on a fixed income. It maybe just be my opinion but it does not seem like they are really enjoying the later years of their lives. They go through a lot of financial stresses. Even to the point of holding off purchasing needed medicine. It breaks my heart. So I decided I was going to try to change that if I can. My brothers and I have helped financially over the years and they are all just starting families. So I am not expecting much help from them, even though it would be welcome. Basically they've contemplated selling the house in the past. In most cases I expressed my interest to own the house after they are done with it but I certainly didn't have the financial stability I feel I do now. That being said. My Finances:

$3,850.57 / Month Income after taxes/deductions
$1,600 / Month in expenses (Rent, CarIns., Student Loan, Cellphone, utilities)
$2,250.57 Left over for food/savings/fun/etc

I have only just begun making this amount of money so I do not have much savings yet and even if I did I do have think about a place to live for myself in the future as well. The basics of the idea are as follows. I would like to purchase our home from my parents giving them access to a large amount of retirement income. I would like to make it in some form or another legal for them to live their rent free for the remainder of their lives. They have not had a lot of money while we lived there so after 25 years they house needs some repairs that they were never able to do. We have a friend in the neighborhood that is a realtor. I use to fix his mothers computer from time to time. The realtor's parents are my parents neighbors. He is giving me advice on the specifics of house value base on similar houses in the area. He has already been inside the house when my parents originally were considering selling. He suspects the house is probably worth around $120,000 currently. I have talked it over with my parents and they are open to the idea. It will free up the money they pay towards the mortgage which is about $567 per month, plus give them access to a large chunk of money that can still grow in a savings account and provided them with a bit of a comfort buffer. Plus they can start banking some of that extra cash each month from their fixed income. It will also allow them to quickly pay the remainder of the truck off, freeing up another $200 of their monthly fixed. It would be quite the lifestyle upgrade for them. On my side of this, it will give me something important to spend my extra money on. I see it as an investment. I'm only gaining equity, less the interest / taxes. I believe I can still pocket some decent left over cash for my future house. Anyway, enough justification. In order to purchase the house without PMI I'm told I need 20% down. My parents have agreed to gift me the 20% down in equity. How is this going to effect us with taxes? Each parent is allowed to gift a certain amount but I think the amount they plan to gift me exceeds the max. That leaves me with getting a loan for $96,000. Credit score is hovering around 677. Now that leaves my parents with paying off the rest of their mortgage of $25,000 (96,000 - 25,000) leaving them with $71,000. I gave them my old car (2009 Nissan Sentra ~100k miles) and they had a truck that they had purchased as their main vehicle quite a few years ago. They owe about $4,000 on the truck. They plan on paying this off, leaving them with $67,000 They have agreed to give me a separate loan with a very low interest rate, but an interest rate none-the-less (is there a minimum?) for the amount it will cost to redo the critical infrastructure upgrades. For example, the house desperately needs rewired and grounding outlets installed. The plumbing needs a touch up as my father has done patchwork over the course of the houses life. The roof needs redone. Things that really need to happen sooner rather than later. The house is pretty big by the way. It has 5 Bedrooms and 2 Baths. Once the house is in shape structurally I figured I could slowly start putting money into remodeling the place room by room. The house is in Pennsylvania. I live out of state. I will not be living in the house at any point. The advice I need, other than the questions strewn throughout the information about my situation, is about: What type of loans should I look at? Anything I should be aware of that I may not be right now? Is there a better way of going about what I am trying to accomplish? They have 6 more years on their mortgage currently. I've considered also just taking over the mortgage payment each month of their current contract. However, at that point I might as well just give them cash from my check each month. What are your thoughts and advice on the topic? How do I start? What should I look out for? Thanks in advance! Any help is much appreciated. In the end I just want their remain years to be better. They deserve it.",finance
stocks,Ladybaybee picks for 2019-03-05,"[Link to imgur](https://imgur.com/a/axRj9GG)

You can follow my picks on twitter @ladybaybee1

**HOW I USE THIS:** 

1) All the stocks identified in the table are qualified as “BUY” opportunities.

2) I focus in the column “Success Rate(3m)” which shows the precision of the agents in the last 3 calendar months. I personally feel most comfortable with Rates 0.8 or higher. 

3) Then, I see the number in “Tx(3m)” which represents the number of transactions that the agents predicted for this stock in the last 3 months. I prefer stocks that have had at least two transactions during this period. 

4) Finally, I look at Growth(3m), if the agents have had a considerable growth (&gt;5% in 3 months) then I follow that trade. 

5) If a row in the table is colored green then it means that stock has been on the rise today so I purchase it immediately in order to ride the wave up. On the other hand, if the row is colored red, then I wait out until very close to market close to purchase the stock and let the price bottom out before climbing up again tomorrow.


6) After I purchase the stocks, I ALWAYS set a stop loss order at -2.5% from my buying price valid for the day. I think this is good hygiene, no matter how confident I am of my system, I still want to make sure that my losses are capped. I update this stop loss order every day. 


**BACKGROUND**

I am not a financier or economist. I am electrical engineer with equal passion in artificial intelligence and financial markets. For the past 2 years I have been working on a system that would make short term predictions of stocks. The system is rather complex, I use multiple layers which include: Convolutional Neural Networks, LSTMs and Genetic Algorithms. All bulked together produce an output like in this image. The way to interpret the image is a follows: Symbol and Date columns are self explanatory, Quorum refers to autonomous agents that decide whether to BUY/NOT BUY or SELL/HOLD a stock. Each symbol has 9 agents, and the Quorum column, counts the number of agents that recommend Buy, Selling or Holding the stock. The “Not Owned” column means: if you don’t own this stock then you should … The “Owned” column means: if you own this stock you should HOLD or SELL. The column “Growth(1 Year)” refers to what what has been the growth of this system of Agents in the past calendar year. The column “Tx(1Yr)” shows the number of full transactions that these agents recommended in the last calendar year. “Factor” is just the division of Growth divided by Transactions to get the average growth per transaction. Finally “Success Rate” shows how successful these agents have been in their recommendations in the past calendar year, success 1 means 100% successful, 0.5 means 50% successful, and so on.

Many people have been curious about the actual process that the system follows, so here it is: for every symbol (600 stocks are analyzed daily), we get the full stock data (open,close,high,low,volume) for the past 4 months. Each stock is associated with another set of “lookalike” stocks as well as major ETF’s. This initial dataset is run through a convolutional layer that extracts an undisclosed number of features. These features are then passed onto a recurrent neural network (LSTM) where sequences and patterns are extracted. The LSTM then spits out probabilities for the likelihood that this stock will have a positive, negative and neutral tendency in the next N days. These probabilities are then fed to a genetic evolution system (GES). This system essentially checks the predictions for the past N days and compares them with reality, following that the systems knows which predictions are performing the best. Once the system knows which stocks are being simulated the best, then the system automatically finds which of these best performing stocks have the biggest potential for the next few days. The system does not output explanations, unfortunately us humans are not capable of understanding (or visualizing) a problem of this dimensionality, for example the LSTM part alone works with over 10 million dimensions, not features but dimensions.",finance

personalfinance,"MFS for 2019, cant contribute to Roth IRA?","Short background:

Getting married July 2019, so from what I understand our 2019 tax returns will have to either be MFS or MFJ.

I have been contributing to a Roth IRA since 2018, and planned to max it out this year.

My fiance is in the federal loan forgiveness program in a PAYE program, so from what I understand her payments wont be affected if we file separate, but will more than double if we file joint, so the plan was to file separate until her loans are forgiven in 7 years.

I read online that if your file MFS and youre AGI us over $10,000, you cannot contribute to a Roth IRA, and I would not be eligible for a traditional IRA tax deduction. So, I was just wondering what my options are to contribute to an IRA if we want to continue filing seperately until her loans are paid off?

MachineLearning,[D] Cannot understand LSTM inference.,"&amp;#x200B;

Hi all - I seem to have stumbled on a hole in my understanding around LSTMs. In short, I cannot understand how even a simple one is *actually* fed samples, upon inference time. I wrote a post about it here on [cross-validated](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/395652/cannot-understand-lstm-inference), but here is the abridged version:

&amp;#x200B;

* I have time-series weather data. (Not important, just for context).
* During inference time, at every point in the present, I want to predict the next 5 time-steps in the future. 
* I know that there is a strong long-term dependency of about 50 samples in the past. (Meaning, something 50 samples in the past, is very informative to things going on now).

&amp;#x200B;

So my questions are: 

&amp;#x200B;

* How - exactly - do I feed in samples into this LSTM during train-time, and inference-time, such that those long-term dependencies can be captured?
* What I am asking is something very mechanical; meaning, should I feed the LSTM one sample at a time during inference? Or... how else would one even do this?...

CryptoCurrency,How Do POW Projects Benefit From Sidechains,"https://i.redd.it/8gwfc3gw6ck21.jpg

**How Do POW Projects Benefit From Sidechains?**

The majority of cryptocurrencies inherited their consensus mechanism from Bitcoin. The consensus mechanism ensures that the network agrees on a single transaction history and the method Bitcoin uses to reach this agreement of all network participants is called Proof-of-Work (PoW). Although this method has proven itself over more than ten years by now from a security perspective, it does come with certain limitations.

Proof-of-Work blockchains that are using the original consensus mechanism introduced with Bitcoin are limited in transaction throughput, have fairly high latency and a limited ability to scale.

Sidechains present an elegant solution to build on top of PoW blockchains, without having to change the core protocol too much. The protocol is a set of rules and conventions that govern the communication of all network participants. Applying changes to the core protocol is difficult. First, you need to make sure there are no security flaws and second, you need to convince the majority of developers, nodes operators, and miners that the changes are beneficial to the network.

A sidechain is a blockchain in and of itself, but with the capability to communicate with a second blockchain, the mainchain. This communication doesn’t just allow the transfer of information, but also of assets, such as a cryptocurrency.

Sidechains only require a single change to the core protocol, namely enabling the deployment of sidechains in a secure way. After this capability is introduced, any developer can start building on top of this blockchain. If the Sidechain implementation is well written, malfunctions or bugs on a sidechain cannot affect the mainchain.

Depending on the exact implementation, a sidechain can be very different from the mainchain and tailored exactly to the needs it should serve. In can use a different consensus mechanism to agree on the order of events and a number of parameters can be modified. You could increase the block size limit so that it can record fairly large amounts of data, or you could reduce the block time to allow for faster confirmations of blocks.

Horizen is working on a sidechain implementation that will allow a number of different consensus mechanisms to be used for their sidechains, with a unified protocol to send assets, in this case, ZEN from the mainchain to a sidechain and vice versa.

Horizen has a robust roadmap and is actively working on building out a sidechain solution as well as an SDK - a Software Development Kit. This will allow developers to choose from a number of functionalities for their sidechain, simplifying the development process. The engineering efforts are led by Alberto Garoffolo.

## Benefits of sidechaining

**Scalability**: Sidechain implementations will be completely decoupled from the mainchain, which significantly improves scalability. Only cross-chain transactions going from the mainchain to a sidechain or the other way around will be recorded on the main blockchain. Transactions within the sidechain are not recorded by the mainchain, meaning there can be a large number of them, depending only on the sidechain itself.

**Security**: Adding features to a public blockchain is always a difficult task. As mentioned above it needs consensus building within the community as well as a thorough evaluation of the code from a security perspective. Sidechains allow us to add a large number of features with a single change to the code base. After the deployment of sidechains is enabled once in a secure way, a large number of them can be deployed, each of them offering different features. 

**SDK**: Releasing the SDK and a reference sidechain will enable users to start designing and building applications on top of Horizen using different programming languages and protocols. This makes our blockchain attractive to developers, as they can build features with their language of choice. 

The Horizen Team is looking into a number of specific use cases for our sidechain implementation:

* We are developing a treasury system for the DAO in cooperation with IOHK. The main purpose of the DAO Treasury and voting model is to establish a decentralized and censorship-resistant funding mechanism for the development and maintenance of the Horizen blockchain platform. The voting system for the DAO based on liquid democracy will be built on a sidechain.
* Migrating the logic for the Secure and Super node tracking and payment system from running off-chain to on-chain. Currently, Node tracking is done on external servers. Moving the process to a sidechain will decentralize this process and make it highly censorship-resistant. 
* We plan on building a distributed VPN service running on our node network. Node operators will be able to choose if they would like to support this service by making their nodes available as a possible endpoint for the VPN connection. In turn, they will get paid by the VPN user. The payment logic will most likely be built on a dedicated sidechain.
* A dedicated sidechain can be build, that allows extended smart contract functionalities. 
* Another potential use case for a sidechain is to facilitate a decentralized and secure registry of public keys for encrypted emails. Email addresses could be linked to the corresponding public keys so that you don’t need to exchange public keys before you can start a secure communication via email.

**Technical Details:**

The construction of the sidechain model consists of two protocols**:** The sidechain consensus protocol  and the cross-chain transfer protocol. While the sidechain consensus protocol takes care of establishing an order throughout all the transaction on a given sidechain, the cross-chain transfer protocol establishes a set of rules on how assets are transferred between main- and sidechain

Horizen’s Director of R&amp;D Alberto Garoffolo developed the SCP and CCT independently of each other. This is what allows different consensus models on different sidechains, without having to adapt the mainchain.

The main innovation is a new backward transfer protocol, that allows transactions from one of the possibly many sidechains back to the mainchain, without the mainchain having to track the sidechain and without introducing a centralized federation of validators. While a reference implementation of a sidechain consensus protocol will be provided, a wide range of sidechain consensus protocols will be possible. 

The cross-chain transfer protocol is to be unified and fixed by the mainchain logic so that all sidechains will use the same CCT protocol.

personalfinance,Car coming off of lease. Trying to figure out if I should buy it out,"I have a car coming off a lease in a few months. I barely use it, and have to pay for parking. I now live.in a city and barely use it except for fun trips to places outside the city. To stretch it this maybe comes out to 10 times a year the car come out of the spot. 

My general finances:
I have 6 months efund

I have student  loans ~20k 6% interest (federal)

I have almost all of the cash on hand for the buy out saved up in preparation for the expense (15k)

In any normal case, I could and would easily say 'just rent a car when needed it will be cheaper, and if you need a car full time just buy one then'

The issue is that I have a physical disability that means I have to get a car physically adapted for me, and (I've checked) rental agencies don't have one of the things I need.

None of this would be a serious problem (after all I can live without optional excursions if needed) except for the time frame. The time lag between picking out a car at a dealer and getting it to a.state that I can drive takes (if I'm.being realistic) a month give or take. Point is I can't just drive it off the lot.

This leaves me with one edge case. Job loss. Currently I work in the metro accessable city, but a.lot of.jons.are.in the 'greater metro area' aka car needed for interviews and or getting to work. If I were to suddenly lose my job, and I didn't have a car, and let's say the economy is in a 'take whatever job you can find' state I would be fucked without a car for some nontrivial amount of work until I bought a.car plus paid for modifications, and added monthly costs, and I could go back to not needing it for a.long amount of time if I got a.city job.

personalfinance,Traditional vs Roth,"Hi all, after exploring many calculators and creating my own, I’ve basicslly come to the conclusion that it makes a very small difference whether the contribution goes to a Roth or a tradition account as long as the after tax net difference is 0, ie a 10% Roth contribution or a 14.7% traditional contribution assuming taxes and other payroll taxes totals 32% [14.7% = 10%/(1-32%)]. In fact traditional comes out slightly ahead. While the taxable amount under the traditional account is high, the taxes paid on that money is essentially only the federal rate which I’m estimating is 13%, based off the 2019 tax tables and a retirement withdrawal of 93k. Am I missing anything?

So what, if any, is the benefit of a Roth? The only benefit I can see might be if I wanted to take out half my retirement and buy rental properties or something else significant, then I wouldn’t be paying taxes on that money withdrawn.

financialindependence,Should I use leverage for my index funds?,"Hello.

I have an investing dilemma. 
First a little info about me:

-31 years old.
Annual income: 76k USD $. Good prospects in my business. At least 5% increase annually with job hops and negotiations.
Savings rate: 50-60%

Property value: 257,5 k
Mortgage: 220k (interest rate 1,9%)
Student loans: 53k. (interest rate: 2,1 %)
Stock loan now: 5.2k (interest rate: 2.19 %)
I am 100% invested in index funds. 70/30 in respectively MSCI World / MSCI Emerging Markets.
I have 155k invested. Net worth is 170k

I consider increasing my stock loan with 35 k. From 5.2 k to 40.2k. Then I will have totally 155 + 40.2 k = 195.2 k invested.
As I see it I will have a (possibly) better annually return by using a small amount of leverage.
Disadvantages as I see it:
- Interest rates may increase. Then both the stock loan, student loan and the mortgage loan will get higher interest rates.
- Can be psychologically heavy if the markets falls a lot. I'm thinking that a market fall wont bother me, but how I actually would have reacted by a 50% drop I'm not sure since I haven't experienced it myself. 
-With the stock loan I have today, the market can fall approx. 35% before the interest rate on the stock market bounces up from 2,19 % to 4.44%. This means that I feel the urge to ""monitor the market"", ie follow the market closer and check my account a couple of times a week. I know deep down that this is completely irrelevant and unnecessary. Even though I check the account frequently, I never plan to sell, I just do it to feel like I'm in control.
Otherwise, I like to think that I can tolerate high risk.
I had no problem seeing my portfolio fall 15 - 20% this december.

It is the desire to build up wealth as quickly as possible, which focuses me to think about this. Those who have become real rich have used various types of leverage.

Would you do it if you were me? Why or why not? I could really need some advice here.

personalfinance,Why is WLI a poor choice and what are the better options to save for retirement?,"THE WLI ISSUE:
I have seen a lot of support for cancelling Whole Life Insurance policies, of which I possess one. I have brought up concerns with my NWM agent and he hits me with convincing logic and numbers. I usually do not have enough knowledge to do much more than listen. 
If I am going to cancel my policy I want to be positive it is the smart thing to do.

THE NUMBERS:
Purchased Whole Life Paid-Up at Age 65 policy when I was 25. 
Premiums of $4800/year. Initial death benefit of $360K. 
Term Insurance with premiums of $180/yr and a benefit of $360K.

At 65 I would have a $800K death benefit and $450K in cash value.
Total premium outlay of $190K.

I am currently 28, have contributed $15K, cash value of $8K and a death benefit of $380K. I also contribute to a 401K (amount needed to receive max employee match) and intend to max my Roth IRA this year.


THE ARGUMENT:
My NWM agent explained the value of having some money invested in the stock market and some that is independent (my WLI cash value). The agent made it seem like a WLI policy is the only way to grow money that is independent from the market.

THE QUESTIONS:
Since our last discussion, I have researched bonds as a ""safe"" place to invest. It seems the higher interest rate of the bonds compared to the lower growth rate of the WLI Cash value would make ending my WLI policy worth it.

personalfinance,Personal finance help with unconventional lifestyle?,"I'm graduating university in May. I have a job making about 32,000 a year + commission set up for June after I graduate commission estimates end up for about 50-60k, but you never know with that. I have 53,000 in debt currently. All federal loans and 6,000 in auto loans at 7% interest. I plan on living with my parents for a while so I don't expect to spend too much of the salary, and have limited vacation days so my travel bug probably won't have much flex room. 

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, all the advice I see on this thread is mostly for people who want to save for retirement, start a family, etc. I want to travel literally as much as possible and have financial freedom. My current plan is to pay off my loans immediately with the job and try to build passive income. Should I be investing in a 401k? It doesn't seem very liquid and wouldn't actually produce an income for me. If I didn't have debt there is 0% chance I'd get a normal job. Probably would end up a gypsy. 

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe this is a dumb question. I just want to know what financial decisions I should be making in order to live a life of travel and adventure. I just want to know what the best future investments would be for me. Should I really be investing in a 401k or using that money to try to build up a business? Or even rental properties that could be used as passive income? I may be naive. I'm 22 and a dreamer so feel free to call me out. Appreciate you reading and any advice given!

Since they taught me about trapezoids and octagons in school, taxes confuse the heck out of me.

I started a new job in February of 2017 and I received a small refund last year and me not knowing why, I assumed it was because I claimed 1 on my W4 upon starting this job. I saw here on reddit that a single income household and me being single, I should claim 3? Wouldn't that just withhold less from my checks?

Fast forward to this year. Didn't expect a big return but it ended up that I actually had to pay in on my state taxes and only got 89.00 on my federal. Upon doing some google searching and reddit browsing, my situation isn't too bad.

I work for a county here in Minnesota and am paid 23.01 hourly. Overtime is quite frequent\\, does this make a difference come tax time? I thought when it came to overtime, it was just taxed more heavily before hitting my bank account.

personalfinance,Is there any financial benefit to my fiance and I getting married?,"Crossposting from r/studentloans...

My fiance and I are getting married this upcoming May. He has about $50k in private student loans with a monthly payment of $550 a month. I have $60k in federal student loans, am currently enrolled in the PAYE repayment plan, and estimate my payment will go up to around $240 a month this year when I recertify. We recently heard that you can't claim the student loan interest deduction if you file your taxes as 'married filing separately.' This has significantly helped my fiance out in the past and as my payment increases over time it will be a big benefit to me as well. The reason we are going to be filing our taxes separately is because my payment is based on my income; combining our incomes would likely at least double my payment. Of course filing separately will also prevent us from claiming certain tax breaks you get fo rbeing married. So my question is...is there really any financial benefit to us being married?",finance

Coming out of a major depressive state after not caring for a long time has made me try to do some digging around and make sure everything is in order. 

In 2009, I took out a $2,000 Stafford Unsubsidized student loan. Also a $3,500 Stafford Subsidized loan. As far as I know these are the only two student loans I have taken out. 

Due to those years of not really caring, the loans went through forebearance, deferment, and finally defaulted. According to Credit Karma, my loans are both currently permanently assigned to the government. 

My mom was extremely generous and in a good financial position to help me pay off some of those loans in the past year and half. She made a significant dent in it and had her payments from her banking account credited to the US Dept of Education. 

I checked the Federal Student Aid and loan websites, nslds.ed.gov and myeddebt.ed.gov , and both say  that my balance hasn’t changed much since my mom started those payments, and that the last 2 payments applied were my federal tax refund garnishments from 2019 and last year’s tax refund. 

So my questions are: 
1. Where exactly is her money going if it isn’t being applied to the government student loans? 
2. Is there any way I can check if I have any other outstanding (private?) loans?
3. Is there anything/anywhere else I should check to get current information about all this?

Any and all help is super amazing! Thank you financial whizzes, I’m trying to get on your level and slowly getting there! Have a great night :)",finance

personalfinance,Retirement &amp; savings advice?,"I started a new job recently and am wondering if I can get some advice on how to allocate my monthly net income (after expenses) to me and my spouse's retirement and savings accounts. I don't know much about investing and feel kind of lost. I thought it was easier to just list all of my information and goals instead of typing it out, so here we go:

Basic info:

* My salary: $55,000; spouse does not work and will not be working for the foreseeable future
* After expenses, we have about $1,200 each month to set aside for retirement/other savings goals
* We are 27 and have one child who is very young

Our accounts:

* Checking accounts - combined, they usually have $1,000 or so at any one time.
* Joint savings account - $21,000 (interest rate is 0.25%)
* Mutual fund - current balance is $28,000 (fund is NYVTX; not really sure what info is most important. Expense ratio is 0.88%, TTM yield is 0.52%, seems like the risk level is a bit high and return level low compared to similar funds)
* Spouse's Roth IRA - current balance is $2,300 (also NYVTX)
* My HSA - $0, just opened (APY is 0.25%)
* My IRA - haven't actually opened one yet but was thinking of opening a traditional or Roth IRA with Vanguard (target date)

Savings &amp; retirement goals:

* Save for me and my spouse's retirement
* Save for a house (want to buy in the next 1-2 years, prices for houses we're looking at range from $150k-$300k)
* Save for college/etc. for our child (this goal is secondary to the above two)

Specific questions

* How can we best allocate the $1,200 we have each month to meet the above savings and retirement goals? Which retirement accounts should we prioritize? Should I open any other types of accounts (529? We're also thinking of opening a CD account at our main bank)?
* I'm pretty sure I need to open my own IRA, but does anyone have advice about which kind I should do? It seems like my income right now is higher than it will be when we retire (I guess?), but I'm not sure.
* Should we move part of the joint savings balance to something else (I consider about $13,000 an emergency fund; I always fluctuate on whether that should be bigger or smaller)? I'm thinking we shouldn't invest it because we're wanting to buy a home in the next 1-2 years, but maybe I'm wrong.

Thanks!

personalfinance,Question about personal loan/ line of credit,"I need a loan for about 40k for two years. I checked with the credit union I bank with and they recommended to open a line of credit instead.

The personal loan would come with a rate of interest of 11%+ and the line of credit is varying right now at 7% which is their lower limit.

The margin percentage is fixed at 1 which I understood to mean that any time the fed rate changes the interest rate could go up but will stay at 1% of the the fed set rate.


Searching online as well I could see mostly rates above 7%.

I have good credit 770+ and make about 120k. 

Any suggestions on which option to pick or if there any other lenders or ways to get a lower interest rate.

I am a first time home buyer and I'm seeking guidance.   I've been working a commission based job for less than a year.  Since my income has increased by at least 30K annually.   The problem is that because I haven't been making this income for a year in total the loan underwriter cannot accept this as a valid source of income.   Because of this the loan underwriter advised to not put any money down, and then to not waste money on paying to remove the mortgage insurance.  Instead he suggests to refinance in a year or so for a lower interest rate and then at that point use my savings for the down payment of the loan which is right around 25K.  Any advice would be appreciated, thank you.",finance

My plan is if we were to take out a personal loan, pay it off quickly. I just want to be rid of this debt. My credit score is around mid 600's because of my fairly new ""credit history"". I'm only 23 and really only have a couple credit cards, student loans (+50k), and just barely bought my ""first car"". No outstanding accounts, delinquencies, etc. I always pay early, and never late on anything. The debt is mainly my husbands poor spending habits. So basically my questions are:

\- Will this personal loan really hurt my credit?

\- Are personal loans wise to consolidate debt like this? Any other route to look into?

personalfinance,My parents are offering to pay off my mortgage and then just have me pay them back,"This is my first reddit post so bear with me a little bit.. 

My parents have offered to pay off my mortgage to the bank, and then have me pay them back. They have the money in the bank, and say they would like to do this because then I can pay them a lesser interest rate and they can get a higher interest rate from me paying them back then they can with it sitting in the bank.

I feel a little awkward about this but they have also done it with one of my siblings and it’s working out well. 

They’re both within 10 years of retirement and my dad says he would like to do this for his children because he wants to help us out as much as possible and should something happen to him (he has some health problems) it would be a nice guaranteed steam of income for my mom if something happened to him.

I asked a friend what they thought and they asked if I wouldn’t feel better if I did this for myself? I did apply for the loan myself, I’ve been paying my mortgage for 6 months by myself and paying my own bills for years now.   I regularly pick up overtime at my work and save responsibly for retirement. 

Aside from being careful with taxes/laws/interest rates is there anything wrong with letting my parents do this for me?

Side note, I’m aware I’m very lucky and blessed to have parents who can even think of doing such a thing for me and I’m very grateful every day.

TLDR: my parents have offered to pay off my mortgage and pay them back for it at a decreased interest rate. Should I feel bad about this?",finance
personalfinance,Should I declare bankruptcy?,"Okay, so I need help with an issue, that lately has been stressing me in a way I’ve never experienced before. So, I’ve accumulated a good amount of debt 28K. A big amount, and something that I let get out of control after losing my job, and being jobless for a good amount of time, in which I started paying every single utility bill, food, all monthly cost I had in order to live on the credit cards. 

Once I saw the amount I owed, I did something I probably shouldn’t have done, and something that is one of my main reason for trying to figure out a way to get out of this hole. I took a few semesters off school in order to pay a lot of my bills, started working a decent paying job 18 an hour, and started putting a lot into my bills. Payed about 6-10+ thousand. Started to feel good, though I was never overly stressed about it, until recently. 

Recently I lost my job, they laid off so many people, and for the last few months, I have been – well you guessed it... Having to use my cards to pay all monthly expenses again (Unemployment didn’t go through since I made too much money in an individual quarter percentage wise, said if I apply in April, I’d get accepted). The worst thing about that is that it’s like I’m back at square one. All those months killing myself with OT to put everything on my debt, all for nothing. Last week was the first time in my life I looked at the minimum payments due and couldn’t make a payment and still can’t, and I’ve had credit cards for 6 years. It destroyed me. 

There’re a few good things! In the last few weeks I’ve had a lot of interviews, with a lot of them wanting a second interview. Hopefully that means I start working again soon (have my third interview with the same company today), but my bigger issue is school. Where I currently work at, it’s very far from where my school is, and I need to go back. I’m wasting so much time. I’m majoring in Computer Science with a 3.9 G.P.A. When I go back to school, I’m on campus. I can’t pay these bills the way I’m doing when I’m working here. That area doesn’t have these “high” paying jobs, and being a full-time student, I’m OCD with my G.P.A. This is the last semester I want to take off, since what’s killing me is knowing that I should be a Junior, graduating in 2020. Yet I’m barely a sophomore.  I’m not that young where I can afford to waste more time, 26. I know for a fact I will not be able to pay these monthly payments when I return, and the idea of putting so much into my bills for the next 5-6 months just to not be able to at all stresses me out. It’s about 1000 a month on credit card bills alone without including utility cost, rent, food etc. I basically have lived the last year and some months to just pay bills, don’t know what it’s like anymore to go shopping, or enjoy myself, go out to eat, go out with friends cause anytime I think about spending money, the amount I owe pops up in my head. When I started thinking earlier that if I would’ve put all that money into a savings account, I would have 10K+ in my savings, yet I have nothing, stressed me out.  

So, I’ve thought of a few things. Either declare Bankruptcy, or a Consolidation program, I know I’ll take the hit in my credit with Bankruptcy and it’ll hurt considering I was perfect with my credit, had a 776 FICO score, handled everything well, and like many thought I would never be in this position. But unfortunately, life threw a few curve-balls at me that I didn’t handle in the best of ways. Hopefully I get this job, kill myself working the next 5 months, work a lot of overtime, and save that money instead of putting it into my credit cards. At least 5K+ saved, and that way I’m better suited for an emergency, didn’t work on having an emergency fund because every little money I would get, I’d just put into my bills. Do that and return to school with a saving in August, September. Consolidation would be a decent option I think if I can find a good one with a low interest rate, and comfortable monthly payments. I applied to one that said there best offer is 9.5% and the monthly payments is about 550.  

Is this a bad plan? Do I have any other option out there that I haven’t thought about?",finance

&gt; **General Electric** — Bank of America/Merrill Lynch cut its price target on GE to $12 per share from $13 a share after GE CEO Larry Culp said the company's industrial cash flow would be negative this year. J.P. Morgan Securities analyst Stephen Tusa, one of the Street's most bearish GE analysts, said that his current $6 price target ""looks generous"" in light of the information presented by Culp yesterday at his company's investment conference.

personalfinance,Prioritizing Roth contributions vs. emergency fund,"Hey all,

I'm putting $300 into my high-yield checking (3.33%) monthly, which apart from $10 in Amazon gift cards that I use to maintain the interest rate, I don't touch and treat as an oh shit fund. I'm only 9 months out of law school where I burned pretty much all I had saved to survive bar prep, so right now I'm sitting on roughly 2k in there.

I also am contributing $300 monthly into a Schwab target-fund in my Roth IRA.

 So I got a good tax refund, and decided id put some of the windfall to the tune of $400 into the Roth. Thus, if all goes according to plan, I'll have $4000 contributed for 2019. Since the cap is 6k, I'm wondering whether I should try to max that out and just save a little less for emergencies.

My financial situation: I'm job secure as a state attorney through 2020, barring I burn down the building. I'm also fairly confidant I'll be hired permanently afterwards. What I'm saving now constitutes 20% of my take home. I just leased a new car in October, so can't envision anything major breaking that isn't covered under warranty or insurance in the next year. I just bought a new phone with partially saved funds and a bit of that tax refund (treat yo self) and my total monthly expenses are roughly $2200, so I'll still likely be able to cover two months expenses/lifestyle in the crazy scenario I'm jobless within the year.

Only variable I forsee is my roommate is keen on getting his own place when our lease is up in September. So my rent could fluctuate, and right now i hover just around 30% of my take home. But by then that's only 3 months away from 2020 where I can re-adjust as appropriate.

The last wrinkle is that in May and October, the way my pay schedule falls we get what are kind of like ""bonus"" paychecks as in I get 3 as opposed to 2 (26 pay periods). Since my budget only anticipates getting paid twice in a month and in no month do I only get paid once, I can probably squirrel away an extra $1000 from that. So I'd only really be reducing my emergency fund saving by $1000.

*TL;DR:* Based on my situation, does the benefits of maxing out the IRA outweigh the necessity for a safety blanket given my minimal risks in 2019? Sorry for the essay and thanks in advance!",finance
personalfinance,Classic Savings vs. Student Loan Short-Term Dilemma,"Here's my question: How much more would you dig into my emergency savings to pay off these student loans within the next few months? 

My goal is to be debt-free by May/June at the latest. Entire tax refund will be going to this loan in April. I have been paying these student loans off extremely aggressively the past 1.5 years (originally had four loans at roughly $30,000 total). I will then use the remaining six/seven months in 2019 to replenish my emergency savings fund.

  
THANK YOU for your help/advice/tips in advance.

**My Numbers**

Student loan debt: ONLY $5,000 LEFT LET'S GOOO!! (originally had $30,000ish) - 3.8% interest rate on the loan

Savings account: $3,000 

Checking account: Always keep it around $1,000 - replenish every paycheck

Monthly income: $2,400 on average (sales job, so differs a bit every month)

Monthly expenses: Roughly $1,100

personalfinance,Investing Inheritence,"Hey everyone. My father passed away a couple months ago after an illness. It’s been difficult emotionally, but my father did leave me some money in his will. His financial advisor has recommended that I invest it in America Funds, which he claims have a fairly steady interest rate, and then leave it for a few decades. 

I’m 26 currently and will be married in September. I view this investment as part of my retirement funds. The principal on this fund is $40,000.00, and there will be money from the sale of property to help me pay off my student loan debt. 

Is this the right call?",finance
personalfinance,"Filed Taxes and owe $1,800... is there anything I can do?","So here's the situation:

My wife and I graduated grad school in May 2018 and during the year we had a total of seven different part time jobs between us in order to make ends meet. Overall we made 61,000 combined. We filed our taxes yesterday (Married, filing jointly) and found out that we owe around 1,100 in federal taxes and 750 in state taxes. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, before I get into the specifics, I want to say that we have the money put away and an pay it off with no extra financial stress put on us. However, if we can get around this somehow, I would love to NOT spend $1,800. 

&amp;#x200B;

We went to H&amp;R block and the guy did all of our taxes. From what I understand, because all of these jobs made significantly less than what our combined income was, they took out less taxes. Once our income was combined, however, we were required to pay more overall taxes. 

&amp;#x200B;

We are thinking about trying to potentially amend our return and file separately. Would that help us at all? Can we do that? 

&amp;#x200B;

Is there any amendments we can make that would increase the amount of deductions we had? We pretty much only got the standard deduction and nothing else. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure if any of this information helps, but here are some quick facts that may work to our favor:

&amp;#x200B;

\- I am currently in the USMC Reserves

\- I contribute $100 a month to a Roth IRA

\- We both worked at state colleges during this year

personalfinance,Apparently Missing 2017 Tax Return,"Hi everyone,

I've run into some problems filing my 2018 taxes with my spouse (we are jointly filing this year for the first time after getting married in November 2018), and it looks like it might be due to the IRS never receiving my spouse's 2017 federal tax return. Since I am not a US citizen (but resident for tax purposes), and neither of us have been in this situation, I'm looking for some advice from those who are more experienced with this kind of thing. It's pretty nervewracking!

We used TaxAct to e-file this year (2018), but our federal return was rejected because the AGI that we have for my spouse from last year (2017) apparently does not match IRS records. After some investigation, it looks like she had a similar AGI issue last year when filing her 2017 taxes, so she opted to print them and mail them (last year she used TurboTax, and the website report it as ""printed""). Both state and federal tax returns were mailed (owing additional taxes in both cases). Since they were both mailed at the same time, she thought she was done and that was that.

Now we check her bank account details, it looks like the check for the state return was deducted from her balance, but there is no sign that the amount owed for the federal return ever got deducted from her account \[EDIT: I tried to confirm they didn't get it by making an IRS online account, but I got locked out for 24 hours during registration for using the wrong address. I'll try again tonight with the 2016 return's address\]. I managed to get our 2018 federal return accepted by setting her AGI to $0, but now I'm unsure how to proceed about rectifying the issue with the 2017 return.

I have the 2-page completed 1040A 2017 as a pdf, but I am unsure how to go about filing the return, paying any fees and interest, and have struggled to find the information online. My questions are as follows:

My spouse has moved state from where she lived in during the 2017 tax year (from Idaho to Colorado). According to the IRS website ([https://www.irs.gov/filing/where-to-file-addresses-for-taxpayers-and-tax-professionals-filing-form-1040](https://www.irs.gov/filing/where-to-file-addresses-for-taxpayers-and-tax-professionals-filing-form-1040)), both CO and ID have the same address in CA to mail to, so I assume it will be fine to send it there?

Do I have to include any information about why I am filing this late (our best guess is that the federal return got lost in the mail somewhere, and we didn't notice it hadn't gone through until we had problems filing this years return)?

~~I can write a check for the amount owed and send that in the same envelope with the 1040A - is there a correct way to do that, or is just stapling the check to the form sufficient?~~ \[EDIT: the IRS instructions mention how to do this so this one is good. [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-prior/i1040a--2017.pdf](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-prior/i1040a--2017.pdf) Payment should be accompanied with the form 1040-V and nothing should be stapled - just all kept loose in the envelope\]

How about the inevitable fees/penalties? Do I calculate those myself or request that they contact me to invoice us?

This is our ""first offense"", so I'm wondering if there is any relief for us in this case?

Many thanks for reading, and any advice that you guys can provide.

&amp;#x200B;

Update 1: I have drafted a cover letter explaining the situation and requesting abatement of the penalties due to reasonable cause, since the error was beyond our control. I also included a paragraph requesting first-time abatement (FTA) given that we have an otherwise flawless filing history (in case the IRS agent doesn't agree that it's a reasonable cause). I plan to mail the cover letter, 1040A Federal Tax Return, copy of corresponding W-2s, 1040-V Payment Voucher and a check for the taxes owed (according to the 1040A) in a package tomorrow morning. I've also given our contact details (current address, telephone number, and e-mail address) in the cover letter so they can get in touch if we owe anything else like interest or other penalties. Is there anything else obvious that I'm missing?

&amp;#x200B;

Update 2: I managed to get the IRS account made using her 2016 return address, and it looks like her account was credited with the amount sent in, so it looks like they managed to get the check but not the return. I rang the IRS this morning to work out what was going on - it seems like they found a discrepancy between the wages entered onto the form and what her employer in 2017 reported. They sent notice to her old address, but since she'd moved and her new address hadn't been processed before the case got closed, she never received the notice.  
I've double checked the form and I can't see any obvious discrepancy between the numbers in the 1040A and the W-2s, but the agent I spoke to today just said to refile it with the updated address and write a new cover letter explaining the situation. Since the payment was received in time, we shouldn't be liable for any penalties or interest, but she told me to keep a record of everything in case so we can appeal any charges if they get added. It's unclear yet whether the error was on our side or theirs (I usually default to the mistake being mine!) but redoing the form online will probably identify anything she got wrong first time around.  
Gotta admit, calling the IRS was a much better experience than I expected - the agent we spoke to was extremely kind and helpful.",finance
stocks,Ladybaybee picks for 2019-03-06,"[Link to imgur](https://imgur.com/a/5HVrpLs)

You can follow my picks on twitter @ladybaybee1

**HOW I USE THIS:** 

1) All the stocks identified in the table are qualified as “BUY” opportunities.

2) I focus in the column “Success Rate(3m)” which shows the precision of the agents in the last 3 calendar months. I personally feel most comfortable with Rates 0.8 or higher. 

3) Then, I see the number in “Tx(3m)” which represents the number of transactions that the agents predicted for this stock in the last 3 months. I prefer stocks that have had at least two transactions during this period. 

4) Finally, I look at Growth(3m), if the agents have had a considerable growth (&gt;5% in 3 months) then I follow that trade. 

5) If a row in the table is colored green then it means that stock has been on the rise today so I purchase it immediately in order to ride the wave up. On the other hand, if the row is colored red, then I wait out until very close to market close to purchase the stock and let the price bottom out before climbing up again tomorrow.


6) After I purchase the stocks, I ALWAYS set a stop loss order at -2.5% from my buying price valid for the day. I think this is good hygiene, no matter how confident I am of my system, I still want to make sure that my losses are capped. I update this stop loss order every day.

The system is rather complex, I use multiple layers which include: Convolutional Neural Networks, LSTMs and Genetic Algorithms. All bulked together produce an output like in this image. The way to interpret the image is a follows: Symbol and Date columns are self explanatory, Quorum refers to autonomous agents that decide whether to BUY/NOT BUY or SELL/HOLD a stock. Each symbol has 9 agents, and the Quorum column, counts the number of agents that recommend Buy, Selling or Holding the stock. The “Not Owned” column means: if you don’t own this stock then you should … The “Owned” column means: if you own this stock you should HOLD or SELL. The column “Growth(1 Year)” refers to what what has been the growth of this system of Agents in the past calendar year. The column “Tx(1Yr)” shows the number of full transactions that these agents recommended in the last calendar year. “Factor” is just the division of Growth divided by Transactions to get the average growth per transaction. Finally “Success Rate” shows how successful these agents have been in their recommendations in the past calendar year, success 1 means 100% successful, 0.5 means 50% successful, and so on.

Many people have been curious about the actual process that the system follows, so here it is: for every symbol (600 stocks are analyzed daily), we get the full stock data (open,close,high,low,volume) for the past 4 months. Each stock is associated with another set of “lookalike” stocks as well as major ETF’s. This initial dataset is run through a convolutional layer that extracts an undisclosed number of features. These features are then passed onto a recurrent neural network (LSTM) where sequences and patterns are extracted. The LSTM then spits out probabilities for the likelihood that this stock will have a positive, negative and neutral tendency in the next N days. These probabilities are then fed to a genetic evolution system (GES). This system essentially checks the predictions for the past N days and compares them with reality, following that the systems knows which predictions are performing the best. Once the system knows which stocks are being simulated the best, then the system automatically finds which of these best performing stocks have the biggest potential for the next few days. The system does not output explanations, unfortunately us humans are not capable of understanding (or visualizing) a problem of this dimensionality, for example the LSTM part alone works with over 10 million dimensions, not features but dimensions.",finance
personalfinance,Wife in grad school and planning a house purchase about 2 years from now - healthcheck?,"Trying to get a health check on where we (Me – 30, my wife – 28) stand financially -

My wife is in grad school, and will have a 9 month fellowship (paid, roughly $60k per school sources - not banking on this) following graduation

My wife was a teacher for the last 6 years, and started grad school in the fall. We paid off 2 of her undergrad loans, and she got teacher forgiveness on the others. I have about $60k (after all fees and setting aside taxes) in stock options fully vested from my company’s recent IPO. Once our most recent/current blackout period passes, I am planning on execution my options and placing it in a 24mo CD (unless suggested otherwise here) – that will cover the majority of her grad school loans.

Outside of that, here’s our current breakdown:

Current Savings – HYSA, 2.2% APY - $32,500

Current E-Fund – Standard Savings, quick access $10,000

\^\^ Both of those are joint

We also keep individual accounts, partially due to various benefits we were each grandfathered into with our prior accounts - each keep our checking accounts level at $2500, so $5,000 total and each keep $4,000 in a savings account with moderate interest rates in the same bank as each of our respective checking accounts, so $8,000 total.

Neither of us carry and credit card debt. We use credit cards for gas and groceries, get cash back and pay off immediately after use.

She contributed 10% to her retirement account for 6 years, I’ve been contributing 12% since I was 21

Both of our cars are paid off

Our budget breakdown is as follows:

Income: Net monthly take home, single income - $5,580; I also run a small side business with little overhead that nets about $600-$800/mo

Rent - $1,836

Cable/Internet - $120

Cell Plan - $70

Storage facility - $45

Car Insurance - $139

Renters Insurance - $35

Electric (avg) - $70

Gas (avg) - $10

Water (avg) - $10

Groceries and gas - $500

Pet insurance - $30

Dog food - $80

Savings – Was $750 while aggressively paying some student loans and car, will now be $1500

Spending allocation - $200

Date night – 1 per month - $100

Parking on campus (Boston, cheapest parking we could find while still reasonable distance) - $240

Now that cars and undergrad loans are paid off, I plan on getting a couple more months’ worth of expenses in e-fund, setting aside about $3k for a vacation as a graduation present in about 15months, and saving up a little bit for a cheaper car in case my wife’s bites the dust. Hers is a 2010 Jetta with 120k miles, should be good to get her through school. Mine is a 2018 Jeep Cherokee we just paid off. Also, I plan on paying some of her tuition cost out of pocket now that we’ve cleared any other debt.

Our main goal was to be ready to buy a house in a lower cost of living state than Massachusetts (likely Maine) when she graduates. My parents have graciously set aside about $25k-$30k to assist in a down payment for our house when we’re ready. Really what I’d like some input on is – is there anything else I can be doing while my wife is in school to shore up our readiness to buy a house?",finance
personalfinance,Student Loan Refinance?,"This post is going to be a bit rant-y because I am so fed up, but looking for advice as well. 

Back in June/July 2018, we refinanced my husbands pretty substantial student loan that he had gotten with WF. He was, as most are, taking out more than he needed, not spending it wisely, all the nine yards, but racked up about $56K in student loans through them alone. Payment came around, we noticed the rates on a couple of the individual loans were atrocious (one was about 22%). Decided to go ahead and consolidate with WF since they already held the debt. It had been okay until the last month or so, now we have a lost $200 payment, they are calling his dad who is a co-signer on the loan (yes I know they have every right to, but my husband isn’t getting any calls about it is my frustration), and not there’s also a random $25 charge on a student credit card they gave him that has been closed for about 3 years that we’re one payment away from paying off completely. 
When we consolidated, it didn’t bring the interest down to around 8%, so a substantial difference, but it’s 1. Still an insane amount to pay every month I think (it’s half of our mortgage payment) and 2. I am so fed up with WF CS that I am just done. We’ll end up paying close $110k once this loan is paid off in 30 years. Also, unlike federal borrowers, the payment isn’t based off of what you make, it’s just amortized like a normal loan. We’ve been working like crazy to get debt paid off and throwing extra at it when we can, but it still is just so frustrating in the end. He also hasn’t finished his degree (🤦🏼‍♀️) but would like to soon.  

So, all of that being said, what are some of the better lenders to refinance this amount of debt with? He probably has $63k - $65k total with federal loans, so if it were possible to put it all together that would be great, but I would just like to get all of our business away from WF at this point. 


Also PS: I really don’t need a budgeting lecture, so please stay away from that. We’ve worked REALLY hard to get all the debt we have paid off with the exception of our home and these loans. So unless it’s actually constructive, please just don’t 🤷🏼‍♀️",finance

No really.

I have some money I'm prepared to lose in this experiment.

There is one share I want to play with, no insider information just watching a tiny part of the market and my spidey sense is tingling . I understand that I can borrow shares off someone, sell it then replace later.

How much do people charge for 'renting out' their stocks?.  This one is about $100 share. I want to borrow 1.

I then want to leverage it 100 times.(so I'm borrowing 100?) I'm putting in a safely net of selling at a 1% increase.

I'll then ride this share down and sell at a target value.

For sake of argument say I start at $100 and cash out at $50.

Leveraged 100 times.

$5000.

Assuming it works and the share doesn't go to $101 to which I cash out and lose my stake.

I did the IRS W4 calculator and it said I should take 4 allowances. I double checked all the info and entered everything correctly from my paystubs. Both times I got 4 allowances which seems way too high to me but considering I got a high refund for 2018, it seems like bumping my 2 allowances to 3 isn't a bad idea.

&amp;#x200B;

Hello, was just reaching out to see if you guys had any advice on what might be the most effective way to allocate my savings in order to maximize/grow them over time. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently holding all of my savings in a Wells Fargo savings account since I use them for everyday checking, but in that account it only generates 0.01% APY interest or something extremely low. I was looking to park my 6-month expense emergency fund (which I have calculated to be $9,000) in an online high-yield savings account such as Ally Bank or Marcus by Goldman Sachs (any advice between the two would be appreciated) so that I could hopefully take advantage of the higher interest rates they offer \[2.20-2.25%\] while the money doesn't need to be immediately liquid but could be accessed quickly if the need arises. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since I have reached my target emergency fund balance and have no debts to pay off, I was looking to start investing some of my savings going forward. From what I gather, the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTI) is a good place to start and traditionally performs adequately over a long-term period of time while having very low management fees. My brother currently places roughly 90% of the money he has in stocks into this passive fund, and then uses his remaining 10% to invest in tech companies/sector/stocks mutual funds that if you happen to pick the right one it could be a goldmine (e.g. Apple in the 90's)- he considers this his ""stock gambling money"". Was thinking of maybe taking $1,000 from my emergency fund to open a Vanguard account to at least get my feet wet in the market, and then was wondering how much of my savings I should allocate each month to the HYSA, and how much to contribute to my market fund(s)? 50/50, 60/40, etc.? 

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to get started off early on the right foot financially to maximize my money's growth and enjoy reading people on this sub's advice to people and was seeing if you guys might have any for me.

investing,How do treasury bill payouts work?,"I've been learning about bonds recently. According to the [treasury rates website](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/pages/textview.aspx?data=yield), the 1Y T-bill returns 2.54% while the 10Y returns 2.72%.

1. Does this mean that if I buy 100,000 worth of 1Y bonds, I'll end up getting $102,720 by the end of the year?
2. Can I break the bond and withdraw my money before 1Y finishes? Are there early withdrawal fees?
3. If I'm uncertain about interest rates but feel that **they will rise** in the next year, isn't it more beneficial to buy multiple 2 month T-bills instead of one 1Y T-bill? Yes, the interest is lower but the opportunity cost of missing out on rising interest rates is also important.",finance

datascience,How often do data scientists develop machine learning models from scratch?,"I recently had an interview for an entry level data scientist position.

For those reasons he instead builds all of his machine learning models from scratch. In my opinion it stuck me as a bit arrogant to think that an open source software is to be trusted less than something one or two people have fully reviewed.  But I'm also not sure of how many situations there are in which there is no available library or prepackaged model, or it is more advantageous to DIY.

Few questions here:

1. Does anyone else here find standard machine learning libraries such as sklearn untrustable? If so why? Are these models not to be used in production for some reason I'm not aware of?
2. How often does a data scientist really need to build these models themselves? Or put another way how big a project does it need to be before meriting a self-built approach? e.g. I can imagine prebuilt models being the go to for quick analyses but when company's core product is centered around a machine learning algorithm it may make sense to build it from scratch. I'm wondering what it looks like between those two extremes.
3. In what scenarios is it preferred to build a model from scratch? I can understand the situation where a library or language isn't available in a production environment, or the model needs to be written in a different programming language. I'm more interested in cases where this is a decision from the model builder and not imposed by infrastructure requirements.

I am mid 30s, full time employed and have a household gross income of just over $100k.

I actually just opened our first high(er) yield savings accounts at 2.45% and it was nice to see an interest payment more than the cumulative last 5 years from our other savings accounts, and made me want to see how much further I can make our money work for us.

Quick and short of it is I was filing my taxes this year and everything seemed normal. I owed $282 to the feds and $50ish to the state. Last thing I had to fill out was a form about some shares I had purchased.

Two years ago at my old job, they offered us the chance to put all of our commission for 3 months towards buying shares in the company at a very low rate (80c a pop). I opted in, and specifically filled out paperwork that made sure I was paying the taxes THEN, and extra taxes were taken out of my base pay every month to reflect that. From my understanding, this was so I wouldn't get bitten later via Capital Gains taxes.

The company sold, and I made some money. The money I invested (3 months commission) was given back to me, and the money I made from the sale is currently being held in escrow until July, when it will be released to me.

I go to do my taxes last night, and the minute I entered the information from the form on my investment, my taxes shot up dramatically, to the point where what I now owed in taxes was DOUBLE what I actually made in the investment when the company sold. 

This can't be right. I no longer work at my old job, and I'm going to be reaching out to them of course, but I wanted to see if I'm overlooking something or seek some advice on what specifically I should be asking for to make sure this is corrected, if it can be at all.",finance

I unfortunately lost my mother over the weekend, and while we are going through the grieving processes, I’m trying to also manage the new financial responsibilities/decisions that are coming my way.

I am currently a senior at a 4-year university, with some on campus jobs and a hopeful career in technical theatre. I will be getting approximately $90,000 from life insurance funds from her passing, and do have a few things I know I’m doing straight away. First, paying off my student loans/other debt/funeral costs which will leave me with approximately $40,000 left over. I know I’ll need to set up my own phone bills, car insurance, and health insurance, so I know I need money tucked away for those while I’m still figuring out an actual job. Thankfully I have family who are both nurses and health insurance peoples so I think I can find a policy that works for me and isn’t the most expensive through their help.

I have a car that works, so I don’t need to go and get a new one, but I’ll need insurance.

I think my biggest question is what I should do with that $40,000 left over; I know I should be smart and stash some of it away in some untouchable, high interest rate thingy but I have no idea how to choose one of those, or how much to put in. I think I want to keep a good chunk of it accessible for emergencies/other bills to pay, but I don’t know what I should base those decisions off of.

My mom never had a large income/a lot of money, so I want to do what I can to make sure this can last me as long as possible. Financial responsibility does not run in my side of the family, so I know I need help.

I have lately been paying more attention to money management (since I finally started to earn a little bit of money) and am trying to play catch-up. I know I am behind where I would like to be.I am a single 38 year old professional with no children working in higher education for a state university.

GOALS:

\-Minimize Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) to minimize student loan Pay as You Earn (PAYE) payment until loans are forgiven

\-Be in a financial position to retire by 55

\-Pay off house in 15 years

\-Provide some college tuition assistance to two nieces

INCOME

\-$126,921.60 per year

\-$6600 per year rent (a room in my home at $550 per month)

LIABILITIES:

\-$160,000 student loans \[minimizing payback due to PSLF, I know Dave Ramsey would be mad at me but I’m okay with that, currently paying $580 a month on Pay as You Earn (PAYE)\]

QUESTIONS:

1. How would you invest the TIAA-Cref account to maximize returns?
2. Do you believe my Roth IRA should be invested differently?
3. Any other types of saving/investing you believe I should be prioritizing?
4. Any other potential AGI decreases you think I might utilize?

personalfinance,"University misled me, now I owe them 1K. Don't have 1K... :(","Might not be quite appropriate, wasn't sure if I should post here or to legaladvice. I apologize in advance.

I'll try to keep this short. TL;DR at bottom.

I am currently enrolled in a 4 year public school part time. I have always wanted to take Japanese for fun, but that school does not offer it. I found a school that did though, FIU.

I contacted FIU about the course and began the enrollment process. Throughout the 2 months it took me to get accepted, I asked multiple times if I would be able to use financial aid. They assured me that wouldn't be an issue, as long as I have them on my FAFSA, which I did. They also offer a 1K grant every semester to every undergraduate FIU student! Just for being a student I guess.

Fast forward to Jan and I finally enroll in the Japanese class. Everything is going well so far, but I called their financial aid department again just to make sure everything is set. It is. So the deadline to drop classes passes and I stay enrolled.

I should probably mention that I have no income, and rely entirely on Pell Grants and scholarships. I am fortunate enough that those 100% cover the cost of tuition at my first school, minus books which I need to pay out of pocket for.

So a few weeks pass and my financial aid is still ""pending"". I call FIU up again and they said it takes time, and that it will post later and that I have nothing to worry about. So I also ask about the $1,000 grant, and they said it will apply to my balance if I get a special letter from the DRC (because I wasn't enrolled full time). So I got that letter and provided it to their financial aid department.

Fast forward another week or so, aid has still not posted. I call up again and they said they needed the DRC letter revised to be ""term specific"". OK whatever, I contact the DRC office and have them fix it and send it over to financial aid again. Also, the Pell Grant has still not posted by this point.

I call again a week later very worried that I would be dropped from my Japanese class because my account still says I owe 1K for the class, and financial aid has not posted yet. They said ""Don't worry, you won't be dropped, just wait for everything to be processed, it takes time"". OK, so I wait.

Late Feb comes around and I get an email that all of my financial aid was suspended because I attend my 1st school, and I can't get aid at 2 school. SHOOT, I was never told this so I call finaid at FIU and they said ""OOPS, we forgot to mention you need to do a transient application from your home school"". OK.

So I complete the transient application, and a week later it was denied by my home school. The deadline had passed and there was no way they would approve it. No ifs, ands, or buts.

WELL SHIT. OK don't panic, I still have the 1K upper division grant that is still pending, since it's a grant directly from FIU, it has nothing to do with federal grants so this transient thing should matter.

Nope, that apparently will also no longer apply to my balance because ""they don't feel like giving out the grant if I don't get federal aid."" Is basically the gist of what they told me. I asked if there was a way to appeal, or some scholarship, or something! Nope, it's too late for all that. I need to pay out of pocket.

So now I owe over 1K for a single Japanese class at this school. I have absolutely no way to pay for it. My mother works as a cashier and that's like 9% of her salary, and we're barely getting by. She has so much debt of her own. What can I do??? There's no way I would be able to pay this balance off in the next 3 or so years. I'll go into default, be sent to collections, and worse. I have tried so hard to keep my credit clean as it's one of my best bets for getting any loans, credit cards, or jobs in the future. I would have NEVER applied to this school or enrolled in that class had I known it would cost me a grand. I am absolutely heartbroken and completely lost. I can't believe it took over 2 months for them to tell me that none of my tuition would be covered.... Over that time, I have spent 14 hours on the phone with their financial aid department, making 27 outgoing calls, and not even once was any of this brought to my attention, even though I explicitly asked ""Is there ANYTHING I should be worried about, or still need to complete""??? ""Nope. Just wait."" was always their answer.

Please help me out guys. Any advice is appreciated. I applied for a CC hoping to use that to pay my balance but wasn't approved :( Now if I don't pay, my credit will be even worse and I'll never get myself out of that. I don't see why they still can't approve the 1K grant. It's their own school's PERSONAL grant and has nothing to do with the federal aid.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Applied to school and after all grants, total cost was supposed to be zero. Confirmed multiple times by multiple reps. 2 months later ""Oops sorry you actually have to pay us 1K, haha."" Now it's too late to withdraw and I'm about to have my credit ruined forever. Help :(",finance

personalfinance,How to best handle my student loans?,"I (22) graduated from college with a BS in mechanical engineering , started a job right out making 60k/year, no medical (under parents until 26, they have a great plan), contributing 7% to my 401k (no match from my employer, but they pay the admin fees for the account)

Consolidated my private student loans to have a fixed rate and got a comparable %.

I currently owe 84k privately at 4.8% over 7 yrs, 27k on fed loans at varying rates between 3.5-4.2% over 10 yrs, and I have an auto loan I owe 17k on at 2.99% over 6 years. I'm current on all payments.

I live at home and pay for my own car insurance plus help with grocery bills and such. I have 12k saved up in a checking account and 10k in the stock market.

So now that I have a nice chunk of cash saved up, I think I'm ready to start paying off the private loan aggressively. Is this the best path forward? I'm thinking of paying the monthly's on fed and auto loan, and throwing the rest of my paycheck less monthly expenses towards the private loan to pay it off within the next few years.

Long term plan is to pay off the highest percentage loan aggressively while paying minimums on the others until it's all paid off. Does this make sense? Or is there a better at to take advantage of the lower percentage loans.

Thanks is advance!",finance

worldpolitics,Japan's political dependence,"Since the end of World War II and until the 1990s, Japan managed to avoid the need to make important independent decisions at the international level, comfortably staying behind the American back and taking care of the economic component exclusively. By giving its territory to the US military bases and speaking in the international arena exclusively in the wake of American politics, Tokyo actually had no trouble minimizing military spending, but at the same time forgot how to take independent steps, following only historical precedents and stereotypes.

Despite the unique ""peaceful"" Constitution, for the entire post-war period, Japan has not been able to finally resolve a single dispute with its neighbors. The territorial problems remain with her with the Russian Federation, the People's Republic of China and South Korea (moreover, only in the case of Russia this problem is recognized by both countries). Japan is forced to ""follow"" the United States, since Russia has no obligation to protect the Land of the Rising Sun from its neighboring nuclear weapon states. It should be noted that the perception of Russia in Japanese society is rather negative. According to opinion polls, no more than 17% of Japanese sympathize with Russia and 80% are negative; the attitude to the United States is just the opposite - almost 85% sympathize with the former adversary and only 13.5% feel antipathy.

But it is important to recall that the US President Donald Trump frightened Japan, declaring its intention to pass on to it a significant part of the cost of maintaining the American military. Tokyo was frightened not by the prospect of additional expenses, but by a hint at America’s potential to revise the Security Treaty and leave Japan, leaving it alone with China. And a truly dangerous situation for Japan can become when the American leader decides in his pragmatism that the material (economic) side of the matter is more important for the United States than the ideological one, and repeats the famous ""Nixon shock"". It should be recalled that in February 1972, the President of the United States, known for his anti-communist sentiment, did not notify his Japanese partner, came to Beijing and concluded a trade agreement with China. After all, as we know, China is considered the main threat to Japan in the field of security, given both the territorial dispute and the perception of the past. Japan is very concerned about the build-up of Chinese military power, the aggressive and offensive policy of the PRC on the seas and oceans. And in the role of the only defender from the Chinese threat, and at the same time from the nuclear missile threat from Pyongyang, Japan sees only the United States.

But, nevertheless, the desire to get out of under too strong US custody was present and is still present in Japan. The founders of the military-political alliance with the United States themselves believed that the time would come when Japan, having accumulated strength, would leave the care of the Americans. But so far this does not happen for various reasons. Among such reasons, for example, is the deeply rooted pro-American lobby. Many Japanese politicians simply do not see an alternative to an alliance with the United States. Among those who advocated Japan’s greater independence was Premier Yukio Hatoyama, but “his fate was rather sad”.

It should be recalled that Yukio Hatoyama is the grandson of Ichiro Hatoyama, the prime minister who signed the 1956 declaration. Yukio Hatoyama is not considered to be a pro-Russian politician, but positive about Russia, the successor of his grandfather. Hatoyama, becoming prime minister in 2009, said that it was necessary to distance Japan from the United States and that they needed to draw closer to China and Russia. He also said that the American bases need to be brought outside of Okinawa, or even beyond Japan. But, as we know, he stayed in the prime minister’s chair for less than a year. Thus, a year spent Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori. Obviously, it is not in the interests of the United States to lose Okinawa, where 75% of the bases in the country are concentrated, from where it is convenient to “get” both China and the Korean Peninsula. Local officials at the level of the Okinawa governor demanded to ease the burden of the American presence, but nothing came of, as the Tokyo authorities, together with the Americans, put pressure on the local population.

That is why, the current Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe acts quite differently. From the one hand, he demonstrates full commitment to an alliance with the United States, and from the other hand, he conducts an independent course in a number of significant areas. For example, under Obama\`s leadership in America, it was believed that Abe was a revisionist who would review the constitution and allied relations with the United States. But he managed to convince the United States that this was not the case. They now have quite decent relations with the current president D. Trump. At the same time, the United States clearly does not intend to release Japan from its guardianship, and fear that independent Japanese will begin to develop offensive weapons. And for the Japanese, the main defender from all sides is the United States, and breaking such relations would be a strong blow to the security situation in the country. So, many analysts from all over the world regard Japan’s actions and its desire to simply remain behind America’s back, as a manifestation of weakness and accuse Japan of being completely dependent on the moods of the American government.",energy

Regardless of buying/renting, my significant other will be living with me for at least the first year of residency - subject to change after 1 year due to career/education factors. We've discussed both renting (evenly splitting rent) or buying ( SO contributing utilities + groceries as I don't want to 'use' SO to build equity or treat as tenant). I want to ""set down roots"" and not move living situation at all during residency.

I'm currently driving a 2001 Subaru Outback (amazing quality, great car) at 140,000 miles. It just broke down today and has had enough issues in the past to make my parents think I should return it to my dad (upgrade for him over his current car) so that he can deal with future issues instead of having to bail me out whenever I run into trouble.

I really like the Outback for its 4WD and spacious interiors (good for road trips and camping) and I feel pretty set on buying another car of the same model, but I honestly don't know much about cars and haven't done a ton of research into other options. 


Financial Details:

* $25k federal student loans at ~4-5% interest (In deferment until June) 

* $59k private Discover student loans at ~8% interest (In deferment until June but currently paying down)

* $7700 set aside as emergency fund, but I'm willing to take $5000 of this as a down payment on a car. *Is this a smart or dumb idea?* Doing so still leaves me with a small chunk for emergencies while I build it back up.


Monthly Budget:

* $1600 - Student Loans

* $800 - Rent

* $65 - Utilities

* $225 - Groceries

* $120 - Gas

* $120 - Car Insurance, *I don't actually have my own insurance yet, but this was my estimate based on talking to our agent*

* $45 - Phone plan

* $100 - Auto Maintenance, *How much should I be budgeting for maintenance?*

* $11 - Renter's insurance

* $35 - Clothing

* $45 - Extra General Expenses

* ~$425 - General Savings, this is split in YNAB between vacation, gifts, PC parts, etc.

* $150 - Entertainment &amp; Restaurants

That totals to about $3741, leaving me with an extra ~$110 of my net pay (~$3850 starting in June). Am I making a smart financial decision by buying a $12k-$15k Subaru I hope to drive for &gt;10 years? If I can make a $5k down payment, I'd be looking at roughly $250-$300 per month car payment. I'm considering lowering my student loan payments to cover for the cost of the car, unless someone can suggest an area where I can improve my budget. I don't like the idea of taking out more loans when I'm already in debt, but according to my parents Subarus are reliable cars and I will get my money's worth out of them. 

One thing that confuses me is that I'm fortunate to have a relatively high paying job, yet I feel I'm still having trouble finding the budget to get a decent car and apartment.

personalfinance,A question about 401k and Taxes,"Reddit I am trying to maximize savings and tax break opportunities. 

I am 36 and make 45k a year with potential for 52k total incl. bonuses
My wife is 32 and works for the same company and makes 75 with the potential for 85k total incl. bonuses. 

We have an awesome 401k plan 5%, 100% match, PLUS an automatic no strings attached 4% salary contribution on top of that. My Balance is 76k, my wifes is 113k. Our line of work can be sensitive to market fluctuations so we try to save aggressively and minimize debt. We both contribute 5% to Conv. 401k and 5% to a Roth 401k. 

Other Tax shelters:
We Max FSA of 5,000 a year to help pay for day care
We also contribute about 150 a month to an HSA account.
We own a home with a mortage of 180k

Take home is 1850 twice a month for my wife and about 1200 every two weeks for me (lot of deductions on wifes paycheck)

Presently we both contribute 10% to our individual 401k's 5% in Traditional, 5% in Roth. 

So here's the two questions. Last year we both claimed 0 deductions on our taxes despite having a child. We ended up owing 236 dollars in Federal taxes. We did not exceed the standard deduction filing jointly. My coworker says I am doing this all wrong and we should contribute much more to our 401k's, closer to 20% and all in Traditional and up our W2 deductions to keep our paychecks the same size as they are now. He said he had claimed 5 on his W2 and his paycheck was the same amount had he contributed less to his 401k and he usually broke even each year with Federal taxes.... I am skeptical of this.

2nd question. We want to each up our savings rate another 5%, especially if the tax situation makes it advantageous to do so. Should we even be upping our 401k or would we be better served putting this 5% into an investment engine for midterm access? Despite a late start in investing our 401k's seem to be relatively on track.

personalfinance,Question of capital loss deductions,"I posted earlier about filing too early before I received my 1099-B from Robinhood. Overall, I lost 3812 on short term losses from stocks. A few redditors mentioned that I could deduct a maximum of $3000 each year from capital losses. I googled it and received the same answer. I imported my 1099B into TurboTax but it's only listing my refund as an additional $360 Federal and $197 State. Is this incorrect or can I only deduct a portion of my capital losses?

personalfinance,Trying to figure out my actual pay after bonus...,"Hey all,

&amp;#x200B;

So, I just started a pretty good job and they gave me a relocation bonus to get out here, paid for on my first paycheck. I'm looking at the numbers on my paycheck and trying to make sense of what I can actually expect on a bi-weekly basis, since I know bonuses are taxed a little differently. I'm Single, no allowances or deductions, pretty standard tax situation. This is my only paycheck so far, and it includes my bonus on it, so I'm just looking to get a good estimate for what I should expect my future paychecks to look like so I can budget accordingly.  


Here's the math.  


**Pay**  
Gross annual pay: 57500  
Gross pay on this period: 4561.68  
Bonus amount: 2500

Amount from regular wage (started on a Tuesday, so only 74.25 hours): 2052.58  
Misc credits from employer: 9.10  


**Taxes**  
Fed: 811.74

SS: 282.82

Medicare: 66.14

State: 147.28

County: 50.16

Total: 1358.14  


**Benefits/other**  
Total: 9.10 (haven't started paying the 'real' benefits yet, probably will be approx 75-80 bucks)

&amp;#x200B;

**Take-home**

3194.44

&amp;#x200B;

So, what's up? Worth noting the bonus arrived on the same paycheck as my first pay. Are they just assuming that I make twice the money I do during this pay period and taxing to a higher bracket?",finance

personalfinance,"4 Credit cards from medical bill debt payment, $6,000, best way to pay off quickly?","Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

So last year I got hurt and needed to take out 4 credit cards to pay off some medical bills. Now I'm in a place where I think I can tackle my Credit Card debt. I have 6k in CC debt.

&amp;#x200B;

My monthly income is around $3,100 take home per month, $4,300 Gross per month. I make around 50k a year. 31-Years-Old.

&amp;#x200B;

My bills:

&amp;#x200B;

Rent: 750

Car: 350

Utilities: 100

Credit Card 1: 100

Credit Card 2: 40

Credit Card 3: 25

Credit Card 4: 25

Food: 250 - 300 Grocery store/go out once or twice every 2 weeks to eat

Gas: 150

Gym: 50

Phone: 130

Car/Home insurance: 130

Student loan payment: 100

&amp;#x200B;

Total: $2100

&amp;#x200B;

Remainder: $1000

&amp;#x200B;

What are some options for paying off my debt? Right now I'm making all my payments on time but they're the minimums.

&amp;#x200B;

I've heard of taking out loans but my credit is below 600 right now due to previous medical debt that went into collections and now due to my high credit card debt it's worse.

&amp;#x200B;

I had 700+ Credit all through my twenties. I turned 31 last week and I checked my credit and it's around 560.

&amp;#x200B;

I was in a bad accident in 2017 and had a reconstructive surgery on my right leg and the cost was over 12k out of pocket with insurance. It wiped out my savings and I had to get some credit cards as the debt collectors were threatening to take my things in court even though I tried really hard to set up payment plans with the hospital.

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to be clear and back to the way my finances were before. Now that I have a new, better paying job I feel like I can tackle this :)

&amp;#x200B;

Any ideas or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

&amp;#x200B;

financialindependence,My first six months of FIRE,"TLDR: I FIREd six months ago and it’s everything I hoped it would be. Don’t sweat the details and enjoy life as you pursue FIRE.

March 7, 2019 marks six months since my last day at work. I enjoy reading updates from folks who have FIREd so I figure I might as well add my story to this collection of success stories. One thing that’s changed for me since my beginning on this sub is that I don’t judge other people’s decisions. I used to think that people like MMM couldn’t consider themselves retired since their blog was really their full time job now. I no longer feel that way. Our definition of retirement is solely our own.

**First the background**

I’m not using a throwaway account and my identity is easy to discover so I won’t be using any actual figures. Suffice to say I’m on the fat side of FIRE but by most definitions, it’s pretty low on the Fat scale.

After graduating college I began my career in Television News. Within four years I was at the number one national news show as an editor. I spent seven years in that role before moving on to producing and then as a technology trainer. My income was higher than average but in no way close to some of the software engineers or doctors on this sub.

In 1997 my girlfriend’s (now wife) house burned down and we were able to turn tragedy into triumph by investing the insurance money as we rebuilt the house. That enabled what came next.

In 2000 we got married and my wife made a bit more money than I did. While early retirement wasn’t really on the radar at this time, financial independence certainly was and she and I were totally on the same page. The same year we got married we also: bought a vacation home with three apartments that we also rented out, bought our first boat, bought a – I know I’m going to get killed for this by this sub – timeshare. Like other things, just because you don’t find value in something doesn’t mean others don’t. We’ve enjoyed our timeshare and we really enjoy it now that I’m retired.

In 2009 we bought our second vacation rental property this time in California. We had spent the last nine years vacationing in CA at least twice a year and we purchased this property in our favorite area. Our incomes continued to rise and our rentals were another stream of income.

**Lifestyle inflation**

I know this is frowned upon on this sub but I believe that some lifestyle inflation is not only inevitable, but necessary for a happy life while you pursue FIRE. Our lifestyle never inflated faster than our income but I did buy a second and then third boat (not at once, upgraded boats). Boating is a lifestyle I enjoy and was willing to pay for that experience. When I bought cars they were new cars but we also kept them for a minimum of 10 years and only financed at 0% interest, otherwise we paid cash. I still drive a 2003 Infiniti G35. We also enjoy fine dining and spent much more than average on that.

Our savings rate was consistently between 25-30% of gross income so not massive by some measures on this sub but not shabby either.

**Planning for FIRE**

The plan was lifestyle heavy meaning that we planned for what to do during retirement as much as we planned the financial side of things. One part of the plan that didn’t work out was our business venture. Well, it did kind of work out but not in the way we thought it would.

In 2012 I opened a franchise business that was intended to be our “passive” income during retirement. We had grand plans to open multiple locations and operate them remotely. Having been in the business for five years I do know some owners who successfully operate multiple locations in different parts of the country.

Long story short, the business was not easy or passive and we sold it in 2017. The good news is that with the profits we were able to accelerate our FIRE plan by a couple of years. So we bought our fourth home (first rental property, second rental property, primary residence, and now fourth rental that would become a home).
Our plan was to live half the year at our first rental property and the other half at our latest property in CA. The other two properties, our primary residence and one CA rental would be sold. 

The way things actually worked was that we sold our primary residence, we’re selling the first rental, keeping the CA rental and keeping the CA house. We have one mortgage that we can pay off any time we want but with interest rates so low we’re keeping the mortgage for now.

My wife continues to work because she enjoys it, not because she has to. She is able to work from anywhere giving us the ability to live where we want.

**The Retirement Reality**

We pinch ourselves and ask how is this possible on a daily basis. During the winter months we live in a gated community in southern CA with the most stunning mountain views you could ask for and we live at the beach with an awesome boat and waverunner to enjoy on a daily basis in the summer months. We’re members at and play tennis where the largest non-major tennis tournament is held in Indian Wells.

I’ve lost 40 pounds and compete in half marathons and now triathlons. We are by far, the fittest we’ve ever been and plan on getting even better. My wife has placed first and third in her age group in the last two races she’s run.

We made friends at our CA house long before retiring so when me moved here this season, it was like going home to friends and family. We have not been bored for one second yet. As a matter of fact, I haven’t even had time to read a book yet.

The one observation I’ll make is that there are no wrong decisions. For example, I only have about 3-4k in a Roth IRA, basically nothing. I never obsessed over it or worried about it. Whether your portfolio is in the right investment or you are perfectly optimized for taxes doesn’t matter. What matters is that you have enough to cover your expenses regardless of where that comes from.
I hope you enjoyed this as much as I enjoy reading other’s stories.",finance

personalfinance,Explanation for overall tax increases on pay stub (California),"I'll just cut to the chase. I started a new job and have received two paychecks so far. From one check to the next the taxes jumped up for no discernable reason. Ill just keep the numbers clean but, Federal went from $225 to $230, social security went from $135 to $194 (this one I'm especially upset about since at the age of 25, im not going to get see a dime of it), Medicare went from $35 to $45, California state tax went up from $75 to $76, and SUI (some sort of tax for the unemployed) went from $22 to $32.

Did some new tax increases recently go into effect that I'm unaware of, and will this continue to jump higher and higher month after month? It doesn't seem like much but that increase took about $90 additional dollars out of my paycheck. That's money I could have used to pay a bill or even a couple of tanks of gas....

I know this sounds rash, but since this isn't my permanent job, would it be smart to just stop contributions to my 401k to compensate for that increase? I'll only be at this job for a couple of years.",finance

personalfinance,Using Employee Stock Purchase Plan to avoid taxes for charitable donations,"My income is taxed at the 24% federal level, and I now take the Standard Deduction at federal after the tax changes.

How is tax treatment handled if I donate ESPP stock units immediately upon receipt? I know that if I transfer stock I own, I do not pay tax and the charitable recipient does not pay tax either.

personalfinance,Any advice to better my budget?,"## Any advice to better my budget?

📷

Hey  guys, looking to get some advice on if there is any way to better by  budget here. Attaching a PDF of my numbers sheet. Made a recent large  life change and move across country, so have some interesting  situations.

Explanations of where some things stand:

\-  Employed full time at 14.00 an hour in Alaska. It's not what I'd look  at as a permanent gig, but unless a job opens up in my field  (Occupational Safety/HSE) then I'll probably ride this out until I move.

\- Living with my sister as of right now. I pay $250/month towards utilities and groceries, no rent payment.

\-  Savings was exhausted during my move. I'm rebuilding it and want to hit  at least 3.5k prior to this winter. Intending to move up to city with  boyfriend - better empl0yement opportunities (as opposed to the small  town where I'm at now) and would close the gap there, which is a bonus.  If/when I move, we'd be living together - I would be paying part of the  expenses

\- Car was financed through BoA,  at $300 a month, but when I moved my grandfather paid it off and I now  finance through him at income driven payments and a low/non-existent  interest rate (I didn't ask him for this, but God am I grateful). I  currently owe him about 23k. As per my numbers sheet, I've spoken with  him and we're planning on income driven payments. He wants me to rebuild  my savings and pay off high interest credit cards, so I'm going to auto  deduct 150 from my account to his each month on the 15th.

\-  I have two credit cards. One through discover with a $500 limit, with a  $300 balance and a 24% interest rate (this will get paid off this  month). The other is Capital One and is a 21% interest rate with a $3000  limit and $2000 - I had to use it to pay for my car to be shipped :(  I'll pay this off with big payments over the next 3-4 months. I have my  phone bill auto pay set to Capital One, which I plan on paying off as  soon as the payment processes each month once the card is 0 balance, and  my insurance is auto payed from my discover account - same plan.

\-  Car insurance is 150/mo for full coverage. I still have a 6 year  warranty and gap coverage that I purchased through Ford as well. (23 y.o  male so this number still fucking amazes me lol)

\-  My only expenses after everything is paid is gas to/from work and  boyfriend's place and money to eat out if/when I eat out (usually only  with bf, and he generally pays, so not a common expense)

\-Currently  sitting at $500 in savings. The last page of the PDF shows how much of  leftover expenses each month I plan on adding to it.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried making a PDF, but it wouldn't let me upload a link - so I did a very poorly executed thing and made imgur links... please excuse the confusion on that, and thank you to those who take the time to help out.

personalfinance,Best life and disability insurance options for a young adult?,"A few of these questions may seem elementary, but please bear with me as I still have a lot to learn as a 23 year old. 

*TLDR at bottom*

For context, I’m a young adult newly college graduated. I’ll begin working my first post grad job for one of the Big 5 Tech companies out here on the West Coast of the US on Monday. 

Ive been working with a financial advisor from Northwestern Mutual that a good friend of mine connected me with for the past few weeks to form a comprehensive financial plan. This plan includes saving, investing, life insurance, disability insurance, saving for a down payment on property in the new couple of years, etc. 

So far everything has been pretty good and I’ve learned a decent amount just talking to him. I consider myself a relatively cautious person financially speaking, however, and there are a few concerns I’ve had that I would like advice on from an unbiased third party (yourselves).

1) We’ve had two calls so far to get a feel for my financial situation (salary, financial goals, etc) and to lay out a breakdown of how I should allocate money from each of my checks into the aforementioned financial plan buckets. They’ve been free and he says that he only gets paid once I purchase mutual funds through him and/or life/disability insurance. 

I’m always somewhat wary of salesmen, but understand it’s the job. However, from reading previous books and articles including a Random Walk Down Wall Street (maybe my favorite financial investment book of all time), I’ve learned that in the long run the overwhelming majority of mutual funds do not outperform a broad based buy and hold strategy of index funds. I’m young and have a great salary for a new grad so I can afford a riskier portfolio, but I’m not sure if buying mutual funds through northwestern is the way to go. I’m interested in buying a few index funds as a good base and then mutual funds through Vanguard as I get riskier (probably, still researching) since I’ve heard they’re the best for that. 

My question is, is buying mutual funds through this financial planner and northwestern mutual in any way a good idea? I’m leaning towards no, but need to compare fees. 

2) My company has great benefits, but my financial advisor says that two areas where I should cover my bases are life insurance and disability insurance. He mentioned getting term insurance now but switching to permanent insurance some time in the future as it becomes more economically feasible given the equity building benefits it offers. 

I have no dependents, however, so should I even bother with term insurance right now? I understand the benefits of permanent insurance, just can’t afford those premiums right now. But term insurance seems unnecessary, other than to lock in good rates now while I’m young and very healthy (which i suppose is strong reasoning). 

Another factor is that

3) As far as disability, my company offers about 60% of income if you’re on disability leave. My advisor says I should supplement this with third party insurance so that I can get up to 90% of my income if I ever go on disability leave. It makes sense to me, and would only be about $50 a month or less I believe, but again, I want to be sure this is a good idea. So far I’m leaning towards yes.



tldr;

All things considered, I like my financial advisor. He’s taught me a few things overall and the financial plan he’s given me to work with breaks down pretty nicely. As a young professional working on the West Coast for a great Tech company, I want to ensure I’m smart with my finances. I’ve learned a few things from him, and I haven’t paid anything (and won’t unless i invest or buy insurance through him). But the factors I mentioned before, coupled with the fact that I’ve read a lot about northwestern mutual not being a good company to work with in general give me pause. Can anyone advise on the questions I posed before and/or give me better options for companies/platforms to look into for investing in index/mutual funds, life insurance (as a recreational marijuana consumer), and disability insurance?

personalfinance,Advice; Early traditional IRA withdraw in California,"Hello, Before I contact a tax pro, thought I would run this by here.  My wife will be leaving her job and we will roll her 401k of 250k into a traditional IRA at Fidelity.  We are both 52, I will continue working, and my own 401k will be fine for the both of us when I retire in 2 years.  for 2 years we plan to make early withdrawals from that IRA to help make it to when I retire.  We will be withdrawing 3,000/month.  for the holding, i'm thinking 10% Fed penalty, 2.5% Calif penalty, 20% for Fed tax, and 5% for state tax.  This would leave us with around 1800 a month.  We are in the 22% fed tax bracket, if that info is needed.

personalfinance,Where to invest when you want rock-solid safety?,"Hi all,

I am thinking about buying things like US bonds or ETFs that buy bonds. What indications should I look for in the prospective reports or past behavior of these bond investments that would make some more secure than others?

\- Maturity expectations: 6-18 month terms

\- portfolio percentages: 40% equity, 60% bonds with approximately half in low-yield ""rock solid"" bonds and half in higher yield bond ETFs

\- I have a brokerage account, so I can also do Money market and CDs, but I have noticed they usually have too low interest rates.

\- I am fairly young. My goal is to build a portfolio that will become self-sustaining to the point where I can make investing with my personal fund a full-time position. So I would consider myself, currently, a passive/defensive investor. I look forward to learning more about investing so I can become an active/enterprising investor.

====================================================

Summary of responses:

Thanks for the feedback. So far I gathered that

1. I am too young (twenty-something) to be considering a too-conservative position of less than 50% equity. Someone even suggested 90+%.
2. the only ""rock-solid"" bonds are the ones with rates not worth investing in, suggesting even moderately risky debt with 5% interest is likely the better choice. This comes along with the suggestion to purchase bond ETFs so I don't have to worry about bond-picking.
3. US Treasury bonds are, in fact, still considered to be backed by the full faith and credit of the US government AND that the US credit is still considered extremely reliable, despite the large numbers on [www.usdebtclock.org](https://www.usdebtclock.org). This is likely a classic case of numbers being too large to comprehend, causing irrational fear to trump rational studying of the underlying data that would suggest otherwise.
4. inflation, despite being steadily on the low end for the past several years, is still a constant, real threat to any savings. This puts pressure on investors to maintain a portfolio that will have a comfortable margin of gain that overcompensates for any potential upswing of inflation. This suggests maintaining a significant position in equity.
5. I should not limit my search for safer investments to just bonds. CD's and Money-markets are likely to have better rates today. Indeed, my brief glance at some current rates suggests this is true.",finance
personalfinance,Tax Fraud help!!,"Hi everyone, 

&amp;#x200B;

To start off, I am in the State of Massachusetts. So, I have just recently found out that my mother and my grandfather have been using my name and SS for a social service. This service was meant to ""help"" my grandpa. My mom asked me if she could use my name originally, and I denied her the right to do so, but they both went ahead and signed up for this service. It has been going on since 2017. In about a year, they had made around 23 k from this service. Also, my mom hid my W2 from this ""job"" that came in the mail while I was at work last year. (Still in college). She also hid my W2 this year until she came clean and confessed to using my name and hiding the W2. My Girlfriend of three years has told me to file a police report and to get my own mailbox. I am hurt and pissed that they both did this and could potentially have landed me in Federal prison. Is there anyway for that to happen? I started working at a company that I love and I don't want to get in trouble with the law for this.",finance
personalfinance,Where to keep emergency fund?,"I know this has been asked before, but I wanted to make it specific to my situation. I'm trying to save up to a 6 month emergency fund (I'm single, 23 years old). Right now I'm shooting for 12k (2k a month). I'm going to keep one month in my checking account for immediate liquidity. But in terms of what to do with the rest there are a couple options I have seen on this sub.

* Roth IRA: I don't like this because the whole point is that it should be liquid. If I ever save past 6 months, then I'll consider this
* Laddered CDs: The general consensus I've seen is that CDs don't earn enough anymore and it's not really worth it.

The two I have considered are a general Chase savings account, which I use now, or a high yield online savings account. I have the ability to pretty much immediately move money from my savings to my Chase checking account. My problem with Chase is that with a 0.1% interest rate, my money isn't keeping up with inflation and I will have to continue to add to the fund throughout my life to match standard of living. So I'm leaning towards a high yield savings account. However, my problem with that is once again LIQUIDITY. From what I've gathered, having the money immediately available is an important aspect of the emergency fund. If I was to 5 months of living expenses in an online savings account, how quickly could I access this? Am I screwed if I have an immediate need over $2k? I just had to do some major car repairs and it got me thinking about how things may be different if I had to wait a week to transfer money.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Anyone have experience with transferring money from a high yield online savings account to a Chase checking account? How long does it take?",finance
personalfinance,20k in debt on one card - please help me decide on next steps,"Hello,

I’m currently ~20k (~2.5% monthly interest) in debt on one card and I’m trying to determine what method to follow to make it out as quickly and efficiently as I can. 

I have a steady job making ~52k a year after taxes. I’m able to make the minimum payments but it feels too close for comfort. 

As I understand I have some options that might make this process easier and I’m trying to determine the best route from the following:
- Loan (secures or unsecured?) - been reaches out to by companies like Upstart saying they can lessen my monthly payments. Seems like this is a good option as long as I don’t miss a payment but it will also hurt my credit score.
- Transfer section of debt to cards with 0% interest rate. This seems tricker but it might save me more money than the previous option. I’m nervous that I could mess this up though and end up in more debt. 
- Other options?

What do you all think my best course of action would be? In the meantime I’m researching budgeting apps (Mint and YNAB) because budgeting is never something I’ve done but clearly something I need to learn. 

Thank you for your time and thoughts.",finance
politics,Megathread: Paul Manafort Sentenced to 47 Months in VA Federal Court,"Manafort, who led the Trump campaign for several months in 2016, was sentenced in the Eastern District of Virginia for hiding millions he was paid by Ukrainian oligarchs in overseas bank accounts and falsifying his finances to get loans when his patrons lost power. Prosecutors painted him as a hardened criminal who needed to be made to understand the seriousness of his wrongdoing, while Manafort contended he was collateral damage in the special counsel’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.

personalfinance,"Think I over-payed on my taxes, best solution?","So I had my taxes done this morning by an agent (not software).  Knew I was going to owe a substantial amount as I moved a good amount of stock last year.  All long-term gains.

My agent was confused as my 1099-consolidated didn't have a cost basis for two of the lots I moved, and went off of 0.  Was listed as uncovered.  That didn't seem right to me so I did some digging.  Both lots were RSU's and in the other form I found on e-trade (something insert?) had a cost-basis, roughly half the sale price.

I knew I was taxed on those RSU's when they were vested, as the way it's setup they sell enough to cover withholding.

Is my best path forward here to send in my check to the IRS as is, then file an amended return later this year?  If I do so will I then receive a ""refund"" from the feds/state (Mass)?

personalfinance,Can my credit union solicit me products based on my credit report?,"Credit union called at close of business today. I did not recognize the number so waited for voicemail. No voicemail left but a few minutes later got an email from a Member Enhancement Advocate who solicited an auto loan based on noticing I might be out shopping for a vehicle. In their words they are reaching out to make sure I know about their products and get the best interest rate ""since we (credit union) receive notifications for all our members.""

&amp;#x200B;

My first thought was to verify this was indeed my credit union and not a scam. It is in fact my credit union.

My second thought was to be kind of ticked that my bank would go fishing in credit reports for opportunities to sell a loan product.

Am I overreacting?

Do all banks do this?

&amp;#x200B;

As context I opened the checking account with this credit union to pay our mortgage loan through them out of ease. At the time they did offer the best mortgage loan product and was impressed. I don't use the bank for anything else except mortgage payments and an occasional (1 transaction every 2 months max) withdraw when I need cash at work. My husband has access to the account but does not use his debit card and we have received numerous calls making sure his card is properly activated for use (he has activated it just never used it) but that does not stop the calls.

personalfinance,Vehicle Woes,"Hi guys,

I am at a point where I am financially between a rock and a hard place. I have an old truck that guzzles gas and just got several hundred dollars worth of repairs done, and there is more to come on the horizon. I am getting frustrated with the maintenance required for it. However, it runs fine for now and I do not have payments on it.

In just under two months I will be moving into a new house (with less than or equal to my current rent)  and need to provide a first, last, &amp; deposit. I just graduated college and my student loans will kick in around June, which will tank my (pretty good) credit as far as I understand. I also need to take over my car insurance from my parents around this time. So I have several expenditures coming up that I need to brace myself for, as well as my ~$4000 in credit debt that I have been slowly but steadily paying down. 

My main question is: with my vehicle situation, would it benefit me to finance a newer vehicle while my credit is good? Or wait to assess my finances and (potentially) take a credit hit when my loans kick in. I don’t want to be reactionary to my current truck’s issues, but if it’s smart to replace it I’d love to get a decent interest rate while my credit is good.",finance
personalfinance,Auto loan,"Little back story first... I am a sahm (haven't worked in about 7 years). To buy a car I need an auto loan in my husbands name. I have POA over him and it's a general one, the person who drew the POA up for us said I can literally do anything with it (including buying cars, home etc). We've never needed to use it until now.

I take the power of attorney to carmax because they say they will take it to run husbands credit and open the account. We were approved for financing via carmax financing. Perfect. Wonderful. Let's get the ball rolling. 

Hanging out at carmax for 2 hours with 2 children and the saleman comes to me and says ""I'm so sorry but carmax financing wont take POAs anymore for financing"". 

On to my question...

My husband (deployed) emails me and says just open an auto loan via navy federal since they accept POAs. I'll do that in the morning,  but navy federal uses Equifax for credit inquiries. Carmax also uses Equifax. Since we were originally approved with carmax, are we likely to be approved with NFCU since they both are pulling from Equifax and Equifax is looking at the same info (score, payment, credit age etc)?

personalfinance,Only $52 federal withheld?,"Hello! Forgive me for formatting. I'm on mobile and I also rarely post on Reddit (second time ever) so I don't know how this goes and I'm sorry if it's long.


I have a question I'm hoping someone can help me answer about my husband's W-2. He started a job in late 2017 and worked with this company up until August of 2018. In 2018, he made about $17k. According to his W-2, his federal income tax withheld was only $52 which seems incredibly low.


For comparison, his 2017 W-2 showed he had only made $1600 and $21 was withheld. How was it almost half of his 2018 when he made over 10x as much in 2018?


We requested a copy of his W-4 from the company and he claimed 3 since we have a child. I originally thought maybe he had claimed a super high number on accident.


I also found an old paystub from May of last year. It showed his YTD federal withheld was only $18 with $5 of that coming from that pay period.


Does anybody have any ideas? I hope this all makes sense. Any help is appreciated. I'm the primary earner in our household and I'm on (unpaid) maternity leave for the next three months so I was kind of hoping for a decent return this year.

personalfinance,Why is it important to have an emergency as opposed to putting all my income to my mortgage?,"What I'm considering is getting a HELOC with an interest rate that is barely above that of my mortgage. 

I understand that an emergency fund is important to have, but if I don't have an emergency, I am paying the opportunity cost of the interest on my mortgage that I could have otherwise paid. If I put everything to my mortgage I will pay it a lot faster and then IF I an an emergency, I will just use the HELOC. 

The amount of interest I save in this situation would be a ton. While I would be going into debt for the HELOC if I have an emergency,  I would just pay the minimum on the mortgage and put the rest to the HELOC. The way I see it, having an emergency fund is guaranteeing I stay in debt for the mortgage, but if I do what I'm thinking, best case scenario I pay off my mortgage way early and don't have an emergency, and worst case is I have an emergency and have to pay a little bit of interest, but still less than I'm guaranteeing to pay by sticking to the full schedule.

I feel like this goes against everything this sub believes in, but why is it a bad idea? What am I not seeing?

personalfinance,"Will having more value in assets and savings drop my Student Loan interests or increase it, while taking loans?","Hello all! I am an international student currently in the US, and would be joining a MS in Engineering degree at a good program. I am planning on taking a student loan to finance my studies. I am planning on taking about $40000 loan overall, may be more or less along the way depending on how things turn out.

Now, the lending company asks for information on Assets and Bank savings to determine the interest rate for my loan.

Now I was wondering whether showing more assets and savings would be good idea or a bad idea. Since, I am from a South Asian Country, I can demonstrate the real value of my assets (which would be around $185,000) and savings (of around $110,000). Or I can undervalue my assets (there's no real hard and fast rule to value your assets from where I come from, specially for small personal properties).

Now, which should be the better decision for me?

Moreover, would it be a good idea to pay a portion of my education with personal funds and not taking any loans? I don't want to spend much from my savings because my father is a bit sick and getting old, and we might need something sooner or later from there, and I would like to keep a buffer.

I am an international student, and I don't have a credit score or history. I am taking this loan from Prodigy Finance, who doesn't require a US co-signer and only hands out loans to a select few top-ranked universities in the US, among a few other countries. They mention that they sets the rate by trying to gauze students ability to pay back loan on their likelihood of success and other factors, hence I am asking this question. Thanks!

personalfinance,The Car Loan Debacle,"Hi there! For you to understand my debacle I’ve got to give you some backstory:

- Husband and I have been married for a year. Because of this, many of our bills are either not yet or just now beginning to be in both of our names.
- We are both super frugal, and have been living in the Dave Ramsey mindset of having as little debt as possible. 
- Because of this mindset, we have zero current loans or debt in either of our names (yay) but also a pretty not great credit score (thanks Dave...). In the past five years I’ve paid off both a car loan and my student loans. 

Okay. Now that we have that understanding, husband and I just bought a brand new car. We put a substantial amount down: car + title and taxes is around $33,000. We put down $20,000, traded in a vehicle for $3,700 and got $1,200 in rebates. We applied for ~ $8,000 loan and got abysmal results. The lowest interest rate we were offered was 9%. Two banks turned us down. Two other bankers offered rates above 10%. But since it’s a small loan, we were okay with the 9% interest and told the dealership we were good to go. We walked away with our brand new car and have loved it ever since. 

Unfortunately, today, 9 days from signing, the dealership informed me that the bank who they’re running our loan through needs a cell phone bill with both of our names on it to accept the loan. The contract we signed with the dealership states that they have 10 days to secure a bank, and if they can’t secure in that time period they can cancel and we have to reverse everything and give the car back. I’ve explained to them that we do not have a bill like that - the only bills that we currently have that show both names are our rent/water and our insurance. The dealer informed me he will circle back with the bank tomorrow to see if they will accept these bills in place of the phone bill. 

In your experience, have you ever had a dealer cancel a deal due to not being able to assign the loan in the time period allotted? Has a bank allowed you to use another bill besides a phone bill to secure a loan? How would you work to build credit if you were in our shoes?",finance

Bitcoin,Are You Ready To Be Penalised For Having Savings?,"\*\*\*Are you ready to be penalised for having savings?\*\*\*  
This week Australia fell into a 'technical recession' with more weak data across the board. At the same time the US Fed have hit the brakes on interest rate rises &amp; tightening policies. The ECB stated growth has been weaker than projected &amp; negative interest rates are back on the cards. During a recession central banks typically drop interest rates by 5% to encourage spending &amp; make debt cheaper to service. However interest rates around the world are currently sitting between 0 &amp; 2% for most major economies (1.5% in Australia).  
This means the RBA for example would likely cut interest rates to -3.5% once recession hits. So what is a negative interest rate? Well just as you earn interest on your savings account, you can also be penalised for having any money in the bank. Along this line of thinking we will see the war against cash heat up &amp; further barriers in place preventing you for withdrawing your savings from a bank. It has never been more important to understand what is approaching &amp; how to protect your wealth. I believe precious metals &amp; Bitcoin are both going to play a huge role in this next chapter.

 I go to the interview, I do a project, bla bla, you know the process. Now the thing is, before the last interview they told me my profile wouldn't fit one of Data Scientist, as I don't have the coding experience they are looking for.

Anyway, I understood that if I wasn't not becoming a DS I would be a DA ( From my research these are two different things, right?) . Now the thing is, the offer came something like an IT Audit position.

My background is in Finance and I have a  Master in Micro Data analysis.

What does my background has to do with IT Audit, and how is IT Audit related with data analysis and so forth?

My ultimate goal would be to be a Data Scientist, and I would like to know how (and if) being a IT Audit brings me closer to this goal.

My feeling is that they confused DS/DA and they just sold me the IT Audit because they need people.

Anyway, I am kinda confused right now about the whole thing.

personalfinance,Sanity check on this loan's conditions.,"Hi,

So I'm in the process of repaying my student loans, and my credit union has the following [offer!](https://imgur.com/a/pR3wVTW)

Are they referring to the prime interest rate that pops up when you google it, which is set to be 3% this year?

So to check if I'm interpreting this correctly, if I have a score of 800, I'll be charged the current rate 3% -1.5% so 1.5% interest?

Or is there another, higher rate. (Seems low)

Is there a risk of the prime interest rate being much higher than the fixed rate?

Thanks for your help!",finance
personalfinance,A formula for reducing the effective APR of any given loan?,"To all my math friends out there: buckle up.

Let's say there's a car loan that has a usurious APR of 19.99% on a $10,000 loan for a term of 5 years. Can someone help me figure out the math on what I'd have to pay to get the actual APR I'd be paying down to 3%. So for example, if I paid $10,000, the APR would ""effectively"" be 0% as I wouldn't be paying any interest.

I know it's a hypothetical, and I wish I were better at math (and Google!) but I'm hoping someone can help me out. These numbers are theoretical, but the formula would be a great help so I could figure it out for any given set of numbers.

I have approximately $2500 remaining on the loan, which will be paid off in June 2022. On the one hand, the interest I am paying technically comes back to me, but on the other hand, there is $2500 not available in my 401k to grow. I have a $2500 refund from my taxes, any reason to throw it in a 2.4% savings account, or just I just pay off the loan? I have no other debt, and a 6 month emergency fund.",finance

financialindependence,"Numbers check and a Question on Home Buying, please.","Here are my stats:

+ Age: 48

+ Cash: 200K

+ Vanguard Index Funds: 300K

+ 401(k) Mostly in Vanguard Index Funds: 450K

+ Total Assets = 950K

+ Salary = 100K

+ Monthly expenses are approx $1,500 month except plus housing costs, which is currently rent at $2,000/month.  So total costs of let's say $3,500/month or 42K/year.

+ Annual savings: Approx 35K

My goal is this: Work 2 more years then have the option of retiring at 50.  And if I do retire, have a two-pronged approach:   1) Burn-down on the cash until I hit 60 at which point I'll switch over to a 4% SWR off the 401(k) money (which ideally will be above 750K by that point) plus at that point I'll have social security money (age 62), plus possibly some inheritance money.  So if I can make it from 50 to 60 off the burn-down, I'm thinking that I'm in good shape from that point forward with the 4% SWR.



As far as healthcare costs, I'm assuming a $500/month premium from age 50 to 60 which may be optimistic.  The 42K/year costs includes that $500/month (I slightly inflated my current costs so it's a wash).


The trick here is housing costs.  This is a HCOL area, with rising housing prices.  My options are to buy a small house for about 500K or continue to rent.  If I buy, my thought is 200K down (the cash above), which would leave me w/about $2,100/month in mortgage + insurance + taxes.  So total annual expenses stay roughly the same, about 42K.  To retire at 50, I'd need that times 10 to get me to age 60, or roughly 420K in cash/index funds.


If I buy such a house, I'll be down to 300K on the Vanguard funds.   My thought is that with luck it may be possible to boost that back up to 420K or so in 2 years (given my 35K/year savings plus let's say 5% appreciation on the remaining 300K).

My question to the group is:  Given my timeline, does it make sense to buy the house?  (200K down, 300K mortgage) And in general, does my plan sound roughly reasonable? 

EDIT: Taking into account a good comment below, I might reduce my down payment to just 20% (i.e. 100K) since a 200K downpayment is unnecessary and presumably index returns will beat the interest rate for that 100K.

Lastly, you may ask why buy here in the HCOL area?  Why not retire and move elsewhere?  A couple reasons.  1) I will probably choose to keep working for a few years after hitting my number in order to pad my investments, as the above calculations don't leave much margin for error.  Also 2) this is where my people are.  It's not appealing to quit working and move to where I don't know anybody.  So ideally, I'd like to stay in this HCOL area.

Thanks for your input.",finance
personalfinance,I'm a College Student that's making more money this summer than I've ever made. What do I do?,"I'm a sophomore in college at the moment and I'll have an internship this summer that will be paying roughly $22,000 gross for the summer. I've worked 2 internships and a part time job in the past, but the combined income from all 3 of those don't even add up to what I'll be making this summer. I'm not sure whats the proper way to be handling all that money. 

Here's a breakdown of my current life:

University is mostly covered by scholarship, the little left remaining is covered by my parents and my parents support me in other areas (food, school materials etc. )

Living expenses for the internship will be paid by the company

My current portfolio is as follows:
- Standard Checking Account
- 1 Credit Card
- Investment Account
- Roth IRA
- Cryptocurrency Account (lets not talk about what happened here)

My current plan for my salary (which I've guesstimated to be $19,000 after taxes) is to put $4,000 into the Roth, $3000 into the investment account (this investment account is serving sorta as a savings account that I intend to liquefy post graduation and use as no strings attached money to travel or something). $4000 into my checking account to serve as spending money for the year. That leaves $8000 unaccounted for. I feel like with how low interest rates are, leaving the money in a savings account would be a waste. I don't feel super comfortable making another investment account for it. Although my accounts are up, I've made some boneheaded decisions in the past and I wouldn't feel super safe leaving such a large % of my money in stocks. Should I invest in a mutual fund? Are there some major expenses that might arise as I get older that I should save for? I'm not entirely sure whats the best option to follow.

On a side note (if it influences anyone's decisions), I do intend to pursue a masters following graduation (so at least another 4 years of school) and my parents will be supporting me through that as well.",finance

“Wow this person should have much more saved” is what I would be thinking if I were you reading this post, rightfully so. I just overcame a serious gambling issue and just got my shit together so I’m getting back on my feet. You have no idea how hard I cringed when I went over the past 18 months of withdrawals from atm’s 🤮🤮🤢🤢... a high price to pay for a lesson learned.

Debts -

$1,100 CC - interest rate I just assume the highest like 24%

$80 - phone
$116 - car insurance 
$100 - utilities 
$60 - cable/internet 

I want to pay off my debts... but I also want to save for a house. I was thinking paying off the CC since it’s higher interest rate and sticking with car payments to simultaneously save for a house while not depleting my accounts more than I need to, is this a good decision or could I do something better?




Update: fuck it I’m going to pay off my car, picking up OT next week and using that to pay off the CC. Less than a month until completely debt free . Weeeeeeee.

personalfinance,My Unpaid Student Loans Aren’t Affecting (Or Showing Up On) My Credit Score,"I went to one semester of college in 2008. I was unable to take out private loans, so I got the maximum federal loans available, I believe it was 2 loans totaling somewhere around $9,000. I dropped out of college for financial reasons, and a few months after not paying on my loans, I started to get calls from the loan agency. I think I maybe paid one or two small payments, then stopped and it eventually defaulted. I’ve gotten calls and letters a handful of times, but after changing my number and addresses over the years, haven’t heard anything since. 

I recently decided that I may want to buy a house some day, and should probably get my credit in order.  I started using a free credit score website to check my score. I fully expected to see my student loans listed. They’re not currently affecting my score, and my score is not actually pretty decent.

personalfinance,Help me sort my Homeloan and Heloc,"Hello PersonalFinance!

I have a VAhomeloan of 123k with a 3.75 fixed through USAA. I also have a HELOC of 15k with a near 10% APR through Navy Federal. My home value is around 210-220k. My credit score is between a 720-730.

I unfortunately got a HELOC to help pay for my final year of university. I will be moving and renting this home in the next few months as I start a new well paying job in the public sector. 

How can I use my equity to sort this mess I have made. I am also a military veteran if that helps at all. I could also use some of that equity as I transition into my new job. 

I know the first year will be tight but afterwards I plan to aggressively pay down all loans and debts since I am used to living frugally.

personalfinance,Retirement funding + Social Security - are we saving too much?,"*Overview: I am 38 and make 94k/year plus 15-20% mandatory bonus with the possibility of more. I will get future pay jumps (I’m up for a 20-30k raise and promotion this spring and I’m not at the top of my career by a long shot). My husband currently makes 47k/year but plans to be a stay at home dad* who freelances with consulting work . *He’ll do that for 5-11 years starting when I get pregnant (which will be shortly we hope).*

My work matches my 401k, 200% of 3% of salary, so $5640 free money plus my contribution of $2820. Each year we get $9k of stocks, and each year 50% of the stock we got last year vests. The stocks roll over into the 401k and then we can keep or sell. I also elect to have 10% taken from my annyal bonus (\~$1500-$1900). My total annual retirement with the numbers above is $12960. However I’m currently doing 10%, not 3%, so my total retirement funding is $19540, 20.79% of my salary. 

My current 401k value is 110k; Roth is 40k. 

My husband doesn't have access to a 401k/403b but has about $20k in a Roth currently, plus about $15k in stocks. He's 32 and starting next year will be making 20-25k/year for around 5 years and then go back up to \~45k/year. We are planning to have a kid and he'll be a stay at home dad who freelances with consulting work. 

We have never spent more than 45k/year, including on housing. Therefore we aren't expecting to spend much in retirement or pull much out of our retirement funds. Our plan in 33 years is to sell our place in the HCOL area we are in and move south or abroad. We also have \~4500./month coming in from social security; due to the age difference between my husband and I, I won't be pulling from social security until I am 70+. I also love work and want to keep working at least in consulting until I'm old. 

Currently I want to dial back my retirement savings to contributing 3%, not 10%. This is in part because we really want to buy an apartment since rent for a 2 bed is 2400+/month. The NY Times rent/own calculator strongly favors buying here, and we have a 25% downpayment saved up currently. I also want to have a college fund for the future kid and be able to do activities (sports, arts, music). 

However the main reason is we also think we are just plain overshooting for retirement. Current calculations say we should be getting what seems like a massive chunk of money each month in retirement, even assuming a 4% interest rate. 

However I know PF recommends 15% of salary and I see a ton of people talking about maxing out retirement funds. I just don’t see how we could end up spending at least 90k+ a year in retirement every year since we’ll have a paid off house that we can sell and use the profits for to buy something else plus have several hundred thousand left over.

personalfinance,(US) 10k in Debt (5 Credit Cards) - Balance Transfer or Personal Loan?,"Hello PF,
I have about 10k in debt across 5 credit cards. The interest rates range from 18% to 24%. My credit card usage overall is a little less than 35%, however for 2 cards my Credit usage is about 40 to 50% on those cards.

My income recently increased,and I can pay about 1k a month towards debt. However I really would prefer not to have to pay 5 different cards a month. I was looking at two options:

Balance Transfer (First year, No APR)- The downside to this one is that I'm not entirely sure I could open a balance transfer card at 10k. My highest limit card right now is 10k (opened when my credit was around 750, now it is around 709-715). This would also mean my credit usage on the balance transfer card would be close to 100% of usage. Which may hurt my credit?

Loan- The loan amount is 10k, with 16% fixed interest for 36 months. No Early payment fees. I have never received a loan, except for an Automobile loan. This looks like a good idea to me because the interest rate is lower than what my interest rates are on my credit cards. I also can pay it off in 10 to 11 months, as opposed to 36 months with no early payment fees. My question is, will I still be charged 16% interest for 36 months even if I pay the balance off in 10 to 11 months?

What does PF thing my best option is here? My goal is to pay off the debt as soon as possible and raise my credit score (Or atleast stop it from going lower).

personalfinance,An (over) analysis of property taxes vs town services related to my house location - LONG,"For background, I live in a small town in Mass, south of Worcester. My wife and I pay around $8800 in property taxes. The other day I hit a pothole  in my hometown (which is pretty common in New England) and while it did no damage it made me annoyed because on the way home I kept thinking about how bad the roads are in our town. And how we have no trash pickup services (we have to pay $200 per year for the privilege of bringing our trash to a transfer station which has somewhat limited open hours. I began to wonder if our $8,800 is being put to good use.

I did a comparison with another larger town in the area which would be much closer to where my wife works, and closer to a commuter rail line for when I need to commute to Boston (about 2x per week), and frankly just closer to civilization. As far as I am aware this town has trash pickup, better schools, and arguably better roads. They also have natural gas (my town doesn't) and their own electric company and experience far fewer power outages. I wanted to understand if either: 1. My town is underfunding our services with respect to $ / road mile, $ / student, $ per teacher, and other things OR 2. If my town is funding at the same or higher rates per ""capita"" than this other town and we are just not getting value for $ spent.

&amp;#x200B;

What I found was very interesting. Obviously difficult to do a complete apples to apples comparison because of how towns bucket expenses and when their reporting comes out so I did the best I could.

&amp;#x200B;

We spend $320 per resident on public safety and have a volunteer fire department. They spend $218 and do have a full time FD

We spend close to double their amount on public works per road mile

We spend 50% more per student (total school budget/pupils) and have lower test scores, college attendance, etc. AND they manage to pay their teachers more than us.

My town charges around $19/1k appraised, vs the other town at around $12.5 per $1K. Certainly houses are more expensive in this other town, so if my wife and I were to move to this town we would probably end up having to buy a house that costs 35% more than our current house to keep the same amount of square footage and amenities. And ironically this would mean probably paying close to $8,800 in property taxes to this other town. But as they say death and taxes, I just want to get the most for my money.

Were we to move, we'd pay more in mortgage, but likely save on heating our home because we could use natural gas which costs less per input BTU than our current oil heating and gas systems typically have higher efficiencies. This all assumes similar insulation and solar profiles of homes. That savings might get eaten up by being on public water / sewer but in the long run these could be savings over well water / septic systems in terms of repair costs or required pumping of septic tank.

We would save money to a small extent on commuting. We would gain a small federal tax deduction edge by having a larger mortgage due to the increased interest (as this is not limited like the SALT deduction).

I'm not sure all of this would truly offset our mortgage going up by $800-$1000/per month but it could help. We'd be able to afford the larger mortgage - but right now we are a little spoiled by having a mortgage that is well below what we can qualify for. We just happen to have longer commutes and lacking town services.

The other factor here is that we don't yet have children. I could see that being the major tipping point. Getting better value for $ is important to us, but moving is a HUGE pain. Having better schools and being closer to my wife's work could make things better/easier.

Thoughts?

&amp;#x200B;

TL/DR: Considering moving to a town with better public services / lower property tax rate but higher property values; probably wait until having kids to prompt the move.",finance
personalfinance,Putting my money towards removing PMI,"Hi,

My question is about PMI, and whether it's worth investing in removal of it. My situation is this:

* $150K in cash on hand, due to some very awesome bonuses recently. Looking to figure out what to do with this money.
* Most of the prime directive already done - emergency fund, employer match, etc. I'm also working on doing a backdoor roth IRA &amp; setting up 529's for the children we plan to have. I know this is slightly out of order (high interest debt is Step 3), but I'm uncertain on this one, hence my question below.
* I have student loans, but they all have a 3.6% fixed interest rate or lower.

My question is, my mortgage has a 3.45% interest rate, and it has PMI on it. The loan was for $420K, and the current value is $395K. To give an example, last month the payments were as follows:

* $720 to principal
* $1140 to interest
* $950 to escrow (we have high property taxes in Austin)
* $142 PMI payment

From the research I've done (please just take me at my word on this, my question is about the merits of this, not whether it would work), we would need to put ~$75K towards the mortgage to pay the principal down to the point where PMI would be removed. Since we have the cash, this is an option. However, I am trying to figure out if this is actually a good idea. 

Most of the posts, articles I have read about PMI say something like ""it is horrible, and you should try to get it removed ASAP"". I have had a hard time understanding the rationale behind that, though.

My thinking has been that given those numbers, my effective interest rate with PMI is ((1140 + 142) * 12) / 395000) - 3.89%. So, I will essentially be investing $75K to move my interest rate from 3.88% to 3.45%. Furthermore, 3.9% is not particularly high, especially since PMI will drop off in several years no matter what.

Similar to the posts &amp; articles I've seen, the other line of thinking I see (outlined in [this article](https://www.kitces.com/blog/eliminating-private-mortgage-insurance-pmi-principal-preayment-downpayment-80-ltv/)) says to look at it as if you are essentially taking out two separate loans - one that includes PMI, and one that does not. So, the idea would be that the math would be that I effectively have two loans: 

* Loan A: ~$100K with PMI
* Loan B: ~320K without PMI

In this world, I would currently be at an $75K balance on loan A, and investing to remove the PMI would be worth a 2.2% effective reduction in the interest rate ((142 * 12) / 75000).

The article I linked seems to lean towards the first interpretation I noted - a quote from the article:

&gt; ... prepaying PMI may not necessarily be as good of an investment as it may look at first glance. The ROI can be very attractive based on short-term ROI calculations, but the longer-term returns that result from locking up funds in an “asset” that has a yield of just the rate of the mortgage itself are going to be lower. In fact, the longer-term ROI on pre-paying a mortgage to eliminate PMI may often be only slightly better than the standard ROI an individual would receive from pre-paying their mortgage in the first place!

Help! I am leaning towards my first interpretation of this, because it makes the most sense to me, but I really could use some help. Thank you!!",finance

personalfinance,"Worried 39 Year-Old Expecting Child, Look to Become Financially Literate and Do the Best that I Can Going Forward","It’s taken a lot of courage to write this. I know that I’ve made a lot of mistakes and been financially illiterate. I’ve made a commitment to be better for the reasons below.

My fiancée (41) and I (39) are expecting a baby in May with the intention that she will me the first of two. My fiancée is wonderful has been instrumental in helping me get my financial/immigration house in order. Now, I’ve been immersing myself on personal finance that I ought to have read in my 20s/early 30s in order to become financially literate so that I can make the most of the time I’ve had left. I am mixing Euros and dollars, because I work between the US and Europe.

My present earning potential: I make my living from a teaching portfolio that includes: adjunct university work for subcontracts for private language tutorial for children and professionals in my current country of my residence. I expect my opportunities to greatly expand once I receive a long-term visa in the next few months and my language facility has improved to the point where I can work in the native language. I’m looking at resumé rehab, online management, leadership and accounting courses and a more stable position and career transition. Organisations like OECD/UNESCO might be a good fit and I have some limited experience with the latter.

Credit cards: I owed 7K on two credit cards ($500 and $7500 limits). I’m directly applying the entire amount I’ve made on the adjunct contracts in order to pay them off by the end of the fall semester, likely October. This cost will immediately be passed off into child care. Cost of paying off the cards will be put immediately into child care as the amount I was spending on monthly payments is the amount we’d be spending on child care.

My net projected cash flow for 2019 is about 25 K Euro after social charges if I continue as is and total house household about *at least* 40 K net with with my fiancé’s maternity leave projected to take about 4 months of her monthly income. Her work is growing by leaps and she is at least as capable an earner as me now. Remember healthcare is not a concern, childcare is much more and is not a concern and we may likely qualify for income-based housing subsidy once my visa comes through. Our joint tax burden with a child and new home will be low.

Housing/Family: We are in the process of purchasing an apartment with some help from my fiancée’s family, our loan is in the area of 205 K with an interest rate of about 1.7% over 20 years with the potential to renegotiate for a lower rate after a couple of years. For my fiancée’s maternity leave, we’ll be living essentially rent-free in an apartment her family owns from May to September. Our new home will be in the name of us and soon-to-be-born child. The personal finance study came in handy, because I was able to convince hay fiancée not to sell a property she owns. Our monthly nut so far as the house/child care will be projected to be 1700 from July when we close on the house. Rent from the property would account for about a little more than 1/3 of our 1000 Euro loans over the course of a year.

Savings: All the books told me one thing: Pay yourself first. Since the beginning of the year, I’m putting 10-15% of my money non-credit card paying jobs into a savings account where I don’t pay tax on the interest accrued over the course of a year. I’ll eventually start doing it when the credit card paying job when that money is no longer going to the outstanding balance. I am trying to convince my fiancée of the utility of doing the same and think I will after she sees a year, or so what I’ve been able to save without much risk.

Student loans: Saved the worst for last. I have over 500 K in student loan debt with about 80K that is not Federal in default. Details over PM as I don’t necessarily want to be identified by some specifics. I plan on entering repayment as Pay-As-You-Earn. The default on the private (semi-public, really) as a problem, but I intend on negotiating it down with debt collectors as a later date as the family member who was handling the payments passed away. As I don’t drive, live abroad and am less worried about the immediate repercussions of the 80 K loan. Going by the Federal student repayment calculator, I won’t be paying anything after a Fall 2019/Spring 2020 graduation date from a doctorate in a humanities field (where I don’t intend on teaching).

I am on track to save additional $14,000 this year, which would bring me little under 20% down payment on a $250,000 house.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I bump down my 401K contribution and try to put away more towards cash savings?  My retirement savings isn't great.  I paid off my student loans last year.

&amp;#x200B;

I estimate my mortgage payment to be about $2200, borrowing $200K at 4.75% with insurance and property taxes.  (I roughly added $600 for taxes and insurance to a 15-year mortgage payment)  And my utilities would go up about another $100.  Then I would only have $400\~$500 left every month.  That doesn't leave much room for emergency.

&amp;#x200B;

I am frugal in everyday life (not paying for Starbucks coffee and taking bus instead of Uber), but I do eat well at home, so my grocery bills are maybe higher than most people.  I take international trips, go out of town for concerts.   Should I not even consider paying 45% of my net income towards mortgage and wait even longer?

&amp;#x200B;

Income could go up another 5\~10K by beginning of next year on a conservative scale.

Details listed below. It would shave off over $500/month of our mortgage payment. It sound great at first and we could DEFINITELY use a $500/month break, but then we realized we'd be throwing away the $84k of interest we already paid so far (on the 1st mortgage mainly), resetting the loan clock back to 30 years and there's also an estimated $4,000 in closing fees. We figured there's probably other things we're overlooking as we're not well versed in this stuff. Before deciding whether to take this opportunity or pass, what are some other things to consider? What are some calculations or exercises we could do to see how the numbers and situation can play out?

1st Mortgage (2011)

* $332,000 - outstanding principal balance
* 4.0% - interest rate (fixed)
* $2,750 - monthly payment
   * $690 - principal
   * $1,110 - interest
   * $950 - escrow (taxes &amp; insurance)

* 5.79% - interest rate (fixed)
* $1,470 - monthly payment
   * $370 - principal
   * $1,100 - interest
* This is the 2018 mortgage/refi that was done to consolidate a 2016 HELOC and the high interest credit card debt we incurred for our major model in 2016 (re-did kitchen, bathrooms, added 3 bedrooms - 5 bedrooms, 2 baths in total). This lowered our overall monthly debt interest and payments.

* $3,670 - proposed NEW total monthly payments
* $4,220 - current total monthly mortgage payments
* $550 - proposed monthly savings
* $4,000 - estimated closing fees

Other relevant info:

* We're in Seattle, WA, USA
* We're in our mid to late 30's with children ages 4 and under
* We hope to keep the house forever in the family for generations or as long as we're alive - either handing it down to the next generation(s) and/or eventually making it income property
* Because of the big increase in our property value from the major remodel (and increase of property values in the region in general), property taxes have increased significantly which increased the mortgage by $400 (since buying the home in 2011)

I'm a ~25 year old engineer making 70k a year.  I started a new job I really like in a city I really enjoy about 5 months ago and I'm starting to look for houses as I see myself staying here a while.  

I have no debt and about 500k in assets from parents/trust fund however I'd like to try and stick to spending my own money on mortgage payments and keep that as a safety net. However I was planning on using some of it to make the down payment in addition to the 30k or so I've saved up in the last year. I have perfect credit (greater than 720 every month, greater than 740 some months) and interest rates in my area seem to be around 4 - 4.125 for someone in my position. 

I've been living with a rent of no more than $1000 every month which leaves me relatively carefree while still saving a significant amount, so a mortgage payment will be a big change for me.

personalfinance,"Parents are letting me open a savings account, and I have a couple questions.","**Relevant Information:** I live in Washington state, and I am 18 years old. I still live with my parents and haven't graduated high school yet, but will in June. We will be using Chase.

**Background**

My birthday was a couple of days ago, and my parents told me that they would let me open a savings account. Now, I know absolutely nothing about banks, bank accounts, et cetera— I've never been allowed to have an account before, and I haven't really asked how it works because my parents didn't like me bothering them about it. My parents are going to take me to open an account in-person. It's going to be opened under my name, and they're going to do something that lets them deposit money into my account.

**My Questions**

My main question is what kind of savings account I should go for. I looked on [Chase's site](https://personal.chase.com/personal/checking), and apparently, there's more than one. I don't really understand the difference aside from different monthly service fees, interest rates, and that one is a college checking account, which sounds like something that I could use. (I'm currently in college (Running Start) and am continuing college next year.) Should I ask for the Total Checking, Premier Plus Checking, Sapphire Checking, or the Student Checking account?

My second question is about my parents' access to my account. Listen, I love my parents, but they can be... overbearing, to put it lightly. I know I just turned 18, but I don't want my parents to use their affiliation with my account as something they can hold over my head, especially if they can have the ability to deposit *and* withdraw from my account. Is there anything that they could do when I go to open my account with them that could lead to problems with them using my account/taking money/et cetera?

My final question is about jobs, and paycheck depositing. I plan to get a job as soon as my parents let me, or as soon as they let me get my license, and I don't know if I need a different kind of account to deposit my paychecks into. I've already filled out a couple of applications, and most say that they either don't offer, or don't prefer to give payment in the form of checks. They like to deposit directly into an account. What does this entail for me? Do I need a different account type, or is a savings account fine?

**EDIT 1:** Yes, my parents are adamant on Chase. I cannot change their minds, but if you have any documents that prove Chase screws over their customers, et cetera, please PM me them so I can show my parents. Maybe they'll be more likely to talk something out if I have proof.

personalfinance,"Please Help with Financial Plan for in debt father. (have plan, looking for feedback)","Hello Reddit, 

Thanks in advance! I need help with the method of helping my in debt father. I have a plan in place, I would just like the communities input in case there are any steps I've missed:

&amp;#x200B;

Why I am doing this: My father is 65. He has no retirement savings other than social security. I care and would like to see him be successful. He's been a good dad, except for handling his own finances. Why I think this can work? I just recently showed him YNAB and set up the basics for him. At the end of setting it up he cried a little and thanked me, not because of how overwhelming it was, but because he felt like he might have a chance of regaining control. That moment lead me to believe that I can put together a plan to teach him how to manage his money, and he wants to learn, he is just overwhelmed and doesn't know how. There is also the fact that he owes me 3000. So if i can get him to be successful, I will eventually get my 3k back. (although my loan is way down the plan priories list). My finances are in order. I'm no Warren Buffet, but I have an emergency fund, retirement savings, car is paid off, balances are on 0% apr cards and my bills are paid a month ahead.

&amp;#x200B;

**Here is the background on my father:**

* Currently works Lyft ""full time"" hours (Pay is good some days and bad other. I've seem him have over 30$ an hour days)
* Works ""odd jobs"" through various recruiters when he can.
* Is 65 years old
* Has no retirement plan other than SS.
* Will inherit decent money when his father passes (I also want to help him plan for this so it doesn't go to waste) 
* Is not disabled
* Is Charismatic
* Struggles to keep a full time job after hire
* Has poor driving record (Crazy insurance cost)
* He is willing to give me access to any information I need to assist. I will however be assisting, ***not doing for him.*** 

&amp;#x200B;

**Here is the background on what I know surrounding his financial situation from our previous few hour session with YNAB.**

* He is currently approximately $28,000 dollars in debt.
* 11,500 of that is owed on (what I think is) a 2014 jeep commander (I will review year, features, mileage, maintenance to get an idea of how much this is worth)
* He owes me $3000
* He owes my sister $5000
* Everything else he owns are in various (6) collection accounts, most of which is bought out credit card debt.
* He does not have any active credit cards
* His credit score is most likely in shambles.
* His wife is paying all of the bills. Until he's cleaned up his debt mess there are his obligations:
   * Medicare RX $30 month
   * Medicare Manhattan $108.97 month
   * Medicare Quarterly $408 a quarter
   * Gas to use while lyfting (car is new enough repairs isn't a major concern, maintenance is addressed later)
   * Partial Groceries (My mom pays the other part)

&amp;#x200B;

**Here is my plan, please correct or add anything you think I should be doing:**

Plan Objective: 

* Payback all debt
* Start emergency fund in HYSA
* Learn to mange and budget income consistently.
* Repair Credit Score
* Open small rewards credit card (eventually)

&amp;#x200B;

**Plan Steps \[Debt\] - These will be managed in YNAB - he will need to add every inflow and outflow the day its made to keep up with budget, and reconcile 2 a week per account.** 

1. **Do not lend him any more money.** I lent him $3000 last year to keep his car from getting repossessed. I will not be lending him any more money.
2. Have him pull his free credit report (and any other credit reports he may have access to via other services). Record any debts we missed
3. Have him contact each collection agency and request a validation letter from each collection agency. Required information: Amount of Debt, original owner of debt, interest rate if being charged. 

After validation: Attempt to negotiate a ***debt deletion*** with each collection agency for a lump sum payment below what is owed at a target date my father could reach. (He's already negotiated one which is a 50% payoff, I was proud of this)

1. Work as many hours as needed to reach any payoff sums offered on time. Request verification letter of account removal and closure after paid.
2. Verify account is removed on credit report
3. Make minimum payments on all other accounts except Myself and Sister. 
4. Take any extra money earned and apply toward the collections account that has the highest interest rate.
5. After debts are being controlled, add in family debts to pay schedule as possible.

**Plan Steps \[Budget\] - We will start working on these intertwined with working debt. YNAB will be the mechanism that allows us to see both obligations, and progress.**

1. **Add all debts to YNAB (Assumed complete, may need updating)**
2. Add and link checking account to YNAB
3. Redorder YNAB for prioritization of payment. 
4. Add all lyft income to YNAB the day after its earned first thing in the morning.
5. Budget all lyft income to payments in order of prioritization. 
6. Review YNAB app for Budgeted money BEFORE making purchase.
7. Add all during the day transactions immediately when purchased during the day. 
8. Reconcile all YNAB accounts every Saturday &amp; Tuesday Night.

**Plan Steps \[Other\]**

1. After debt is controlled, open two HYS accounts. 1 for saving, 1 for tax money. Adjust lift earning deposits so that enough money is saved to pay 2019 Federal, State, SSA, SE taxes etc... Expand emergency fund with left over money. 
2. Add savings goals for rewards as debt is paid off. (Fist savings goal suggestion: New ""refurbished"" laptop from micro-center, price point around/under 350.

Thanks all in advance, I'm looking for feedback on anything, espically debt collectors as I've never dealt with them before except on stupid amounts of money (once had a $9 medical bill go to collections because I never knew it existed).

I was looking into the ""marriage filing jointly"" tax brackets, and I came up with some calculations, please let me know if this sounds valid..

Say a married couple makes $120k. Take standard deduction for 2019 ($24,400), dropping the income $95600 for tax purposes. According to 2019 tax brackets, they would be paying $970 for first 10%, $4543 for 12%, then $3633 for the rest as 22%. If nothing was tax-deferred, they would be paying $9146. Did I do this right?

We are 2 years into a 30 year mortgage. We have a fixed 2.8% interest rate for 20 years, at year 20 our interest rate will adjust to the going rate at that time for the remaining 10 years. 

Our current loan value is €210,000 and our monthly payment is €910. We are allowed to pay off up to €44,000/yr on our mortgage with no penalty. 

We have €50K in savings that we’d like to do something with. We are thinking of one of the three:

1.	Pay down our mortgage, slicing 6 years off of the end of our loan, but keeping monthly expenses the same.

2.	Pay down our mortgage, trimming our monthly payment from €910 to €700 for the next 20 years.

3.	Invest in a rental property. We are preapproved for a property of €200,000 with a 30% down payment. In our area, that would get us 60sqm and rental income of €1000-€1200, covering our expenses, plus an extra €100-€200 or so every month. 
(Not sure if this makes a difference, but I am a dual citizen with one country being the USA. The country I live in does not tax rental income, but the US will. Even though I haven’t lived in the US for 6+ years, the property will not be in the US and the loan will not be in the US, I will need to submit a tax return every year to the US paying tax on the income.)

Salary is 72k, taking home ~$1800 biweekly after taxes and retirement contribution. I have $19,000 for student loans and $17,800 for car loan. I have $15,000 in savings and $40,000 set aside for buying a house at some point.

Since I started my first job last June, I was paying the minimum balance on student loans ($431.4) on a 5 year plan with 2.9% interest. I am a commuter for work and my car went downhill in October 2018 (I had it for 11 years, wish I still did!). So I got a new commuter car (I know I should have gotten a used car). My car loan interest rate is 2.9% and the monthly minimum is $341.4 on a 5 year plan.

For a few months now, I decided to put a freeze on my savings (15k is adequate including emergency fund), and to pay aggressively on my student loans so that I can have it paid off completely by September 2019 instead of the 5 year plan which would be May 2023. My student loan and car loan have the same interest rate (2.9%) and basically the same remaining balance, so I chose paying my student loans off first.

My question is once I pay off my student loans, should I attack my car loan and have that paid off by April 2020 or stick to the 5 year plan? I’m just unsure about whether a car is worth paying off ASAP aside from the benefit of reducing paying interest.

Any extra money I make (sign on bonus in four quarterly payments and my tax return that I’m getting soon) is put toward loans.

Looking for some advice.

I've gotten pretty good at budgeting and saving my money. I've opened up multiple savings accounts with ""high"" interest rates (my banks highest they'll give is a measly 1.95%), just to save enough to pay off my loans, and save for a house.

I graduated from college 2 years ago and came out with two student loans (OSAP, and Student Line of Credit) totalling up to about $45,000.

Now I'm stuck at a crossroads. I'm not shy about my money, so I'll share an approximate total. Over the last year and a half of figuring out how to properly budget and save, I have saved a total of $16,300.
My SLoC has an owing balance of $16,800 with a current interest rate of 5.95%.
My OSAP has a balance of $18,000 with a floating rate of 6.45%.

As you can see, I'm $500 sort of completely paying off my SLoC and getting rid of one of my loans. But this will leave me back at square one, with no money saved for a house, and completely broke.

I'm not sure what I should do. Should I continue with payments as I am? ($200 bi-weekly in SLoC, $300/month in OSAP) and continue saving for a home. Or pay off my SLoC my next paycheck, and start back at zero with one less loan.

&gt; The report Friday of just 20,000 nonfarm payrolls created in February was shockingly weak, compared to the expected 180,000 jobs. The data reflected slower growth, but also possible ill effects of bad weather, the government shutdown and other statistical abnormalities.
*****
&gt; But economists, while doubting the report, also said they are paying close attention to incoming data for signs the report is either an outlier or the beginning of a broader more negative trend.
*****
&gt; ""You go from 310,000 jobs to 20,000. That doesn't seem logical,"" said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. "" I think we look back over the past few months and we had that very disappointing December retail sales number. That seemed a bit of a fluke...But we're quants. You can't just toss out the data that doesn't agree with your existing view.""
*****
&gt; The other significant market factor in the week ahead could be any developments on U.S.-China trade negotiations.
*****
&gt; But the overriding issue is whether the global economy is slowing, particularly as China's data continues to look weak.
*****
&gt; Not all was negative in the U.S. February employment report. Economists said wage growth of 3.4 percent year over year and a lower 3.8 percent unemployment rate were encouraging, as were other data. The report also followed an unusually strong January number of 311,000, after revisions.
*****
&gt; The 35-day government shutdown delayed many reports and may have affected the quality of others, economists said. The weakening trend in the first quarter, while expected, is hard to get a handle on, and while it's expected to be temporary, every negative report increases doubts.
*****
&gt; ""Anybody who is mentioning the word 'recession' is wrong. The economy invariably slows in Q1. What we don't know is it more than usual, and the poor quality and volatility in the data since the government shutdown has made it impossible to assess,"" said Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist at Jefferies.
*****
&gt; First out of the gate Monday will be retail sales, which fell 1.2 percent in December. January's headline number is expected to fall by 0.1 percent but excluding autos and gasoline, sales are expected to rise by 0.7 percent, according to Refinitiv.
*****
&gt; Economists say the big drop in retail sales for December makes the comparisons in the first quarter GDP report more difficult. First quarter growth is widely expected to be below 2 percent but the economy is expected to bounce back above 2 percent growth in the second quarter.
*****
&gt; ""We are already pretty weak [in the first quarter] because of the retail sales number. The arithmetic that goes into adding up GDP, you're in such a hole to start the quarter because you ended so weak,"" said Kevin Cummins, senior economist at NatWest Markets.
*****
&gt; Durable goods for January is reported Wednesday, and economists are watching to see what happened to business spending in that report. At the end of the quarter, expenditures slowed down, yet in the fourth quarter GDP report, business spending was surprisingly strong.
*****
&gt; CPI on Tuesday is also important. With the Fed now signaling it is pausing in its rate hiking, any surprise pickup in inflation would be significant.
*****
&gt; ""Inflation data is important from the Fed's perspective, but I don't think it's going to be something that's going to spook them if we get a stronger report,"" said Cummins. ""We expect 0.3 on headline, core 0.2 percent. Year-over-year core would stay at 2.2 percent for the third month. It doesn't seem like something that's market moving if our forecast is realized.""
*****
&gt; The Fed will largely be out of the picture in the coming week, with Fed officials in a quiet period ahead of the next meeting March 19 and 20. But Fed Chairman Jerome Powell was to appear in an interview on ""60 Minutes"" Sunday.
*****
&gt; Stocks were lower in the past week, with the S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq and Dow all down more than 2 percent in their worst week since Dec. 21, right before the Christmas Eve plunge. The market reacted to signs of slowing global growth and concerns the trade talks would not lead to deal.
*****
&gt; Keon said the market could be disappointed by a trade deal, unless it is is broad and includes protection for intellectual property and an end of Chinese transfers of U.S. technology. White House top economic advisor Larry Kudlow said Friday that President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping could meet later this month but nothing is in ""cement.""
*****
&gt; Speaking on CNBC, he pointed to overnight economic data from China that showed exports there plunged 20.7 percent last month from a year ago, missing expectations by a wide margin.
*****
&gt; ""We have hurt them,"" Kudlow said on ""Squawk on the Street."" Both sides have indicated they hope to reach a deal. ""We are still negotiating by phone and teleconference.""
*****
&gt; Keon said a sweeping deal, with an end to tariffs and a hardline on technology, would drive the market higher.
*****
&gt; ""If you get a real deal, you would get a big response. I would not really count on that as a big positive catalyst for stock prices, but it's possible. If the whole thing falls apart, in that case it would be pretty negative for the market, particularly if we increased tariffs,"" said Keon.
*****
&gt; Trump has held off another round of tariffs, expected March 1, due to progress in the talks.

# The Bespoke Report — The KISS Market

&gt; Global equity markets had a rough week, but the US staged a nice intraday rally on Friday after an NFP-driven gap lower. Global economic data has been rough, but there are reasons for optimism. In this week’s Bespoke Report, we talk about earnings, smart money flows, retail flows, economic data, and upticks in US data we’ve seen since last Friday. For the S&amp;P 500, the technical line in the sand is 2,816, while 10 year yields are desperately clinging to 2.61% support that has held for the past few months.

# Head and Shoulders Above Average Pre-Election Year Gains

&gt; Even after a few tepid trading sessions, DJIA is still up 10.6% year-to-date as of today’s close. S&amp;P 500 is up 11.3% and NASDAQ is at 14.2%. Compared to average pre-election year historical performance since 1950 graphed in the charts below, DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ are all up above average for this point of the year. Pre-election years have historically produced the best average performance out of the four-year cycle. Other than some mild weakness in May, July and October the trend in past pre-election years has generally been higher and higher.

# The Nasdaq’s 10 Weeks of Green

&gt; U.S. stocks’ recent momentum has been historically impressive by many measures, and the Nasdaq Composite Index notched another milestone last week.

&gt; The Nasdaq has risen for the past 10 weeks, its longest winning streak in 19 years. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the feat could signal more gains for U.S. stocks: In seven of the last eight 10-week winning streaks, both the Nasdaq and the broader market have climbed over the following 12 months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/10-Week-NASDAQ-winning-streaks-are-historically-bullish.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Technology stocks have rallied 23% since bottoming on December 24, 2018. While equities began the year extremely oversold, solid corporate earnings, a Federal Reserve pause, and progress on trade have helped fuel risk-on sentiment and boost prices.

&gt; “We expect stocks to power through periodic bouts of uncertainty,” said LPL Research Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “While the road to new market highs could get bumpy, we encourage investors to focus on the fundamentals supporting economic growth and corporate profitability in 2019.”

&gt; The one outlier in Nasdaq’s history of 10-week streaks is the one ending in December 1999, three months before the peak of the “tech bubble.” From the beginning of 1999 to March 2000, the Nasdaq more than doubled to reach record highs, then fell more than 70% through the end of 2002.

&gt; In contrast to that period, we don’t see material signs of excesses in financial markets, and the recent rally has been more broad-based and backed by strong earnings growth. The S&amp;P 500 Index and Dow Jones Industrial Average have both climbed 16% over the past 10 weeks, pacing with the Nasdaq’s 20% gain.

# Slow, But Steady

&gt; Slow but steady growth may win the race again as the economic expansion nears the 10-year mark.

&gt; While muted growth in the current economic expansion has been frustrating at times, especially after a swift and painful downturn amid the 2008 financial crisis, it has helped extend the life of this cycle and keep excesses in check.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, inflation-adjusted gross domestic product (GDP) has increased an average of 2.3% annually in this cycle, the slowest pace of growth among all expansions since 1970 and a key contributor to this cycle’s near-record age.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Slow-But-Steady-GDP-Growth-Compared-to-Past-Cycles.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Historically, cycles with annual GDP growth higher than 4% lasted about five years on average, while cycles with annual growth lower than 4% lasted about nine years on average.

&gt; “While it’s important to be mindful of where we are in the economic cycle, later-cycle economies can continue to exhibit stable growth for years,” said LPL Research Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “We’re maintaining our positive outlook for 2019, thanks to our conviction in sound fundamentals supporting moderate economic growth.”

&gt; Steady economic growth has been helped in part by a careful and gradual approach to monetary policy. The Federal Reserve’s (Fed) policy efforts have been implemented for several years, but policymakers only started increasing rates in December 2015, more than six years into the expansion. This tightening cycle has persisted for three years now, yet inflation-adjusted interest rates are barely above zero.

&gt; Still, inflation has hovered around the Fed’s 2% target for several months now, and wage growth is healthy, but manageable. Leading market and economic indicators (including ones we track in our Recession Watch Dashboard) also hint to more runway in the expansion.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week ahead?

*****

Have a fantastic weekend and a great trading week ahead to everyone here on r/stocks! :)",finance
Forex,"A fun hypothetical(yes, hypotheticals are fun)...","I'll start by laying down the conditions in which this ""what-if"" scanario exists...

* Aside from Dodd-Frank regulations in the US, FX trading worldwide is a perfect utopia(See? I said it would be fun).
   * Foreign brokers actually hold segregated accounts.
   * Foreign brokers can always be trusted to allow clients to withdraw.
   * Foreign brokers will never preemptively close out an account in the event that a client is wildly successful because they truly make their money off of spread and commission and never take the other side of a clients trades.
* Dodd-Frank regulations still exist for US traders.
   * Some foreign brokers still accept US clients.
   * US authorities still go after brokers who are found to not be registered as RFEDs.

&amp;#x200B;

On to the scenario...

Let's say a US based FX trader(with the help of 100:1 leverage) became wildly sucessful on a foreign account in less than a year. Starting in January, they turned $10,000 into $10 million in the span of 10 months, they never withdrew profits,  and they have yet to file their taxes(they absolutely intend to come tax time, they are not registered as a business, they are just an individual with newfound incredible talent). Now the trader would love to buy a yacht with $5 million of those earnings, but they recognize that making a large withdrawal at this point would be incredibly problematic, not because the broker can't facilitate that withdrawal, but because a large wire transfer from that foreign broker to the clients US bank account would be a giant red flag to the US authorities. Triggering inquiries on the source of those funds.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm assuming that if tax time does come around and the trader properly calculates, submits, and pays their taxes on a $9.99 million profit, the authorities will immediately go after the broker.

&amp;#x200B;

My first thought was that if this traders broker allows crypto withdrawals(as is becoming popular lately), they can skip the international wire transfer process. However, this would probably be classified as serious money laundering and now the trader is a criminal where they weren't before. The trader definitely wants to be lawful.

&amp;#x200B;

My second thought is regarding ECP status. This trader now has $10 million in assets. Would the US government recognize those assets in designating ECP status to them? They would most certainly recognize those assets when tax time comes around. If this trader becomes an ECP, then it doesn't matter that their assets are in a foreign brokerage account(the Tallinex lawsuit was because they were soliciting non-ECP US clients). I would imagine the US authorities would still go after the broker, but the trader is an ECP now. It wouldn't matter whether they want to withdraw via wire transfer(ECP's can transfer however they want). They can withdraw their whole account to a US based broker and still trade as they always have been(except now, from that shiny new yacht). So would the legal Dodd-Frank workaround for this trader or any other trader be to simply not withdraw until until they have $10 million($5 million, if hedging) and hope they reach that goal before tax time? Simply trading the foreign account does not open the trader to any criminal liability, as trading a foreign account is not a crime(Unless you dont pay taxes on your earnings come tax time, of course). The criminal liability is on the broker.

&amp;#x200B;

I bring this up because as traders, we see a lot of posturing on forums such as these, but I feel like the actual legal repercussions of success are never ever discussed. It appears the easy answer to any person trading a foreign account would be to just not do it at all. Or to at least keep the account size at no larger than $1000 and only withdraw smaller amounts. Though the legal reportable threshold(under FBAR regulation) for foreign accounts is $10,000, US authorities do view accounts that are close to that amount as suspicious activity(structuring), putting the trader in legal jeopardy. All that said, is there truly no legal benefit for a US based trader to use a foreign account?

personalfinance,Advice Requested: What Kind of Tax Pro Do I Need?,"We are fortunate to earn fairly high salary. Two wage earners, almost $400K/year. All job salary/bonuses (investment mix gets reinvested). I'm looking for a recommendation on the type of tax professional to seek out, to potentially help (legally) reduce our tax burden.

Married, file jointly, no children, live in a state with no income tax. All retirement investment options are at max.

As our wages have gone up we have (of course) been paying more and more (Federal) taxes. I don't have a problem paying our fair share, but we literally do nothing besides the standard deduction. As a result, we pay an astonishing amount. Of course, one hears all the time about other people reducing their tax burden.

We'd like to do the same - again, legally - and want to seek the advice of someone who specializes in this. I don't think I need a CPA, and certainly the local H&amp;R Block isn't right. What profession do I 'google'?

I realize that these are ""problems one wants to have"". We are very fortunate to be in the situation that we are in. For the curious, we work in tech, have ""worked our way up"" to senior level positions in the last couple of years. We save about 35% toward retirement, have a very modest house that will be paid off in a couple of years, and a mountain of student loan debt that we consistently chip away at and should be destroyed in about 3 years.

Finally, individual recommendations (e.g. ""start a business!"") are probably interesting but not my primary focus. I welcome them - they'll be nice to read about - but really... who do I hire? Thank you for your response.",finance
personalfinance,CD Rates foreign/domestic,"So I'm trying to finally start to look at my personal finances and take action on my money. It isn't much but doing something vs nothing with money I can afford to tie up seems beneficial. 

I am investing some of my money into mutual funds, this was basically a sum of cash given to me as a work bonus and I don't need. Then my savings we'll say is about 100k (using this number for simplicity sake). I'm thinking I want to keep  about 60k liquid for money for down payment on a house emergency fund and 40k in a CD or multiple CD's that will have a higher return than a standard savings in a bank account 

I was looking at CD's and I see a 3 month CD at fidelity for 2.3% but it's from Bank of India. Is there any legal or tax implications of a foreign CD if I buy it in Fidelity (I'm in USA) vs buying a CD at a domestic institution but at a lower interest rate.

personalfinance,Taking over a father's finances. Are we on the right track?,"For the longest time, my mother ran the finances for she and my father.

She took over the finances and things were stable, to the best of our knowledge.

My mother unexpectedly passed away, and to assist (protect?) my father, with his permission and help, my wife and I are taking over his finances. Below is the list of thoughts/questions we have as we start this journey with him.

1. Does he want help?

2. If so, how much? Does he want our help in trimming costs? Managing payments? Or have us handle 100% of the finances? We (not just you and me, but our generation) handle things differently. We're not loyal to a phone/TV/internet/insurance provider. Is he open to change, and how much? 

3. We need to see the tax return he's filed for this year, if he has it. If not, when will it be filed? Is anyone helping him file it?

4. Is he comfortable with setting us up as Power of Attorney? Does he even want that yet? 

5. Does he have a safe deposit box at a bank or credit union? If so, what's in it?

6. What is his insurance situation? Medicare? Life insurance? Car insurance? Home insurance? He's hyper loyal to his current auto/home insurance provider (someone he knows) but he's likely paying way too much in premiums.

7. Where are his/their bank accounts and what are the account numbers?

8. What are the regular monthly recurring expenses for absolute necessities? Mortgage, utilities, insurance, car payments, health insurance premiums, other debts? Is there any credit card debt?

9. How are the utility bills paid? Online? Check? In person? Are they in good standing?

10. What is his total monthly/annual income going forward? Where is it coming from? (Social security, job, etc.)

11. Are there any retirement accounts? Pensions (these would fall under #10)?

12. We need to work with him to determine his total current cash flow. Is he cash flow positive or negative? If negative, what do we need to do to fix? If negative, can he work more? If positive, by how much? Is it sustainable?

13. What is the debt situation? What is the mortgage payment, interest rate, and outstanding principal? What is the car payment, interest rate, and outstanding principal? What other debt is out there (student loans, health care payment plans, etc.?)",finance
personalfinance,Help with computing tax withholding allowances? I want to nearly break even on my 2019 taxes or get a small couple hundred dollar refund. Trying to compute my ideal withholding allowances.,"Hello all!

I want to adjust my withholding allowances to get the smallest tax refund possible for the 2019 tax year. I work in the public sector so I must contribute to a pension, but pay nothing to social security and SDI. I only pay FICA medicare. I live in CA. Here's a breakdown of my income:

* Started job: Feb 4, 2019.
* Single with no dependents
* Current withholding: Single 2 for both Fed and State
* **Gross income** (Biweekly): $2537
* Non-taxable pension/retirement contribution: 11% (or $279 biweekly)
* CA State Tax: $88
* Fed Tax: $234
* FICA Medicare: $37

personalfinance,Hard Inquiries,"We are working to rebuild my husbands credit. We paid off all collections in early February, and they have all fallen off his CR as of yesterday. He has two charged off cards I plan on getting paid... both a few years old. We had a car loan with on time payments for 4 years, but the car was totaled 3 weeks ago. The insurance company sent the payoff check already and that should show paid at the end of the month. 

We had to get a new car, so we financed a new one at a stupid high interest rate( I know, I know... shouldn’t have bought a new car), with the plan of refinancing after 6 months or so since the collections hadn’t fallen off his report at that time. 

Prior to the car being totaled we had planned on applying for a credit card to help improve his score and show consistent on time payments and diversity. Since we had to take a couple of hard inquiries for the auto loan, I’m wondering if we should go ahead and apply now so that all of the hard inquiries are within a 2-3 week period. I’ve heard that this lessens the impact of them.

personalfinance,Help me understand WV State income tax as married couple.,"Hi all.

Can someone tell me if I am understanding this correctly for the state of WV on taxes. 

According to https://statelaws.findlaw.com/west-virginia-law/west-virginia-personal-income-tax-laws.html 


""The tax rate in West Virginia varies based on most individuals, including married couples, and married individuals filing separate returns. The rate for individuals, heads of households, estates, and trusts is:
Income of $10,000 or less – 3% of taxable income
$10,000 to $25,000 – $300 plus 4% of anything over $10,000
$25,000 to $40,000 – $900 plus 4.5% of excess over $25,000
$40,000 to $60,000 – $1,575.00 plus 6% of amount over $40,000
Over $60,000 – $2,775 plus 6.5% of taxable income over $60,000

For married individuals filing separate returns the rate is:
Income of $5,000 or less – 3% of the taxable income
$5,000 to $12,500 – $l50 plus 4% of excess
over $5,000
$l2,500 to 20,000 – $450 plus 4.5% of
additional income over $12,500
$20,000 to $30,000 – $787.50 plus 6% of amount over $20,000
Over $30,000 – $l,387.50 plus 6.5% of income over $30,000""



Now for my question. Here is a married person W2
A married couple. On their W2 listed in Box 16 State wages, Tips etc.

Husband   $65956.26            
 Wife  $46456.00

According to state law the couple would pay:

Married filing jointly taxes:

$65956.26  + $46456.00 = $112,412.26 (total Income)

112,412.26 - 60,000 = $52,412.26

(52,412.26 * 0.065) + 2775 =  $6181.78

Couple would pay $6181.78.


If Married filing separate taxes:

$30,000 – $l,387.50 plus 6.5% of income over $30,000

Husband: ($65956.26 - 30,000) *.065 + 1387.50 = $3724.65

Wife: ($46456.00-30,000) *.065 + 1387.50 = $2457.14

So total the married couple would owe $6181.79

Which is the same as if married filing jointly.

Now here is where I am getting confused. If the two people husband and wife were not married and made the same salary each they would be:

Filing single:
Husband  $65956.26         
Wife   $46456.00

Over $60,000 – $2,775 plus 6.5% of taxable income over $60,000

Husband: ($65956.26 - 60,000) *.065 + 2775 = 3162.15


Wife:  $40,000 to $60,000 – $1,575.00 plus 6% of amount over $40,000
  
($46456.00 - 40000) *.06 +1575.00 = $1962.36


So together as a singles they would pay $3162.15 + $1962.36 = $5124.51



So to recap Tax as married couple would be $6181.78. Married filing jointly would be $6181.79 ( Husband $3724.65 + Wife $2457.14) and single $5124.51 ( Husband $3162.15 + Wife $1962.36) 
So a married couple pays about $1,000 in taxes then two single people?

So I always heard that being married gives you tax benefits. But if my math and understanding is correct as married people in WV we pay more in taxes than if we would of been single. Is this correct? Why would WV do this?

In full disclosure I did not look at federal so maybe we still come out ahead being married and paying less in federal and makes up for the more we pay in state. I was just shocked seeing these numbers when doing my taxes this year for the first time as married couple. Was thinking we get a refund but instead we owe money.

personalfinance,Loan/withdrawal from 401K to pay federal tax return?,"I’m slowly coming to the realization that I did not accurately fill out my W4 at my new employment, and while finishing up my TurboTax filing I owe $4,500 in federal tax. I have about $6,000 to my name and I’m super conservative with my paychecks as they go to car/school/apartment fees each month

I was contemplating withdrawing that money from my 401K that’s currently holding approx. $26,000, so that my current money flow wouldn’t take a hit.

But while looking through the process (Fidelity NetBenefits) it looks like a withdrawal would be subject to taxes and an IRS penalty. I wanted to know exactly how bad this is - is there a %age I will have to pay in taxes of that amount I withdraw? And what would the IRS penalty be? The idea of having to withdraw money from retirement, which will be taxed, to pay off taxes kind of freaks me out. I’m planning on talking to HR Monday but wanted to know more from you guys.

personalfinance,"How do I ""beat"" the mortgage game?","I bought a house almost two years ago, put about 25% down and the mortgage is a 30-year term with about a 3.8% interest rate. I have always tried as much as possible to make additional payments toward the principal when able to. I'm not exactly living paycheck-to-paycheck, but I don't know that I have the bandwidth to pay off a substantial chunk of my principal.

However, as I was looking at this month's mortgage bill, about two years into my mortgage and nearly 3% of the principal paid off in that time, I was wondering if I had to accept that I would be paying this mortgage off for the next 30 years. I thought that maybe I could find ways to chip away at the principal and get ahead of the interest rate, so that maybe I could reduce that to 25 or even 20 years.

I don't know if I plan to stay in this house for 20 or more years. I love the house but I wouldn't mind expanding as my family increases in size, or even selling the house for a good profit. But I was wondering if anyone out there had ever attempted to calculate just how much additional principal one would want to pay each month in order to get ahead of the interest rate? Or at least if there was some formula to determine how much it would take to cancel out the increase from interest?

personalfinance,does this scheme to pay off student loans work?,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

My wife is about to graduate medical school with about $330k in loans, spread across 12-15 lenders at a range of interest rates, the highest topping out at 8%. Many of these loans don't qualify for income based repayment, and IBR balloons your debt (and tax burden after 25 years) anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

I am already in the workforce, making about 100k and growing. I have 100k in non-retirement investments and liquid cash, and owe 8k on a 2.2% interest rate car loan that I have no incentive to pay ahead of schedule. I have no other debt. I have a generous 401k that I've been maxing for 3 years (currently has 60k in it), and have also been contributing to my Roth every year for 4 years (about 23k). We are looking to buy a house for \~300k as she starts residency, based on my income.

&amp;#x200B;

If we decide to take a 15 year loan on this house and put down 70-80k, aggressively build equity while continuing to max retirement, would it be possible to use the 401k and home equity as collateral to pay off my wife's student loans at a single low interest rate?

worldpolitics,International Banking Mafia,"​The Medici family are a well known Black Nobility involved in the Vatican, banking, medical industry, secret societies, and Zionism. They are leaders in the global banking mafia. Many of the Florentine noble families are ancestors of Assyro-Chaldeans that practiced witchcraft and alchemy and then migrated into Florence during ancient Rome. During the Moorish invasion more of these clans migrated into Florence and brought large amounts of gold with them. Napoleon Bonaparte was the first political Zionist who proclaimed for all ""Jews"" to settle in Jerusalem. Zionism is really about domination. Zion is a hill in Jerusalem which is considered a holy land by Christians, Jews, and Muslims. Zion refers to a military triumph. The Medici family were one of the wealthiest banking families in Europe for centuries. They produced 3 Popes and 2 Queens of France. The Medici and Bonaparte families are closely related and are still working together. Both of these families still exist today. Emilio Garrastazu Medici was a Brazilian dictator that established the military government in Brazil. The Brazilian Andre Cezar Medici works at the World Bank as a health economist in Washington DC today. The name Medici means medical and they have been linked with practicing sorcery. Pharmacy derives from the Greek word Pharmakeia which means sorcery and poison. The most common symbol used in medicine is the Rod of Asclepius which is of a serpent coiled around a rod similar to the Staff of Hermes. The Medici family are involved in alchemical witchcraft and run the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.  Chic Cicero is an agent of the Medicis and he founded an American temple of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. The Medicis have a statue of Hermes at their palace in Rome. The Medici family founded the Botanical Garden of Pisa which is the oldest botanical garden in Europe and also established the Botanical Garden of Florence. They use herbs and plants for alchemy which is about the manipulation of the human psyche and physiology. They use members of their Hermetic Order to infiltrate food and drug companies. The French Hermes-Dumas family are agents of the Medicis and own Hermes a luxury fashion company headed up by Axel Dumas. The Hermes-Dumas family are worth about 30 billion. Patrick Guerrand-Hermes is another member of this family and worth about 1 billion. The Medici family of Ottajano own the Chaldean Mafia headed up by Louis Akrawi of Detroit. The Chaldean Mafia are Iraqi Catholics and known for trafficking ecstasy and operate in Israel. The Israeli Mafia are the primary manufacturers of ecstasy in the world. Ecstasy is a dangerous synthetic chemical drug used for mind control and is a form of alchemy.

The use of chemicals to manipulate the body and mind is what alchemy really is. The Merieux are a French family that own Institut Merieux which develops vaccines and studies diseases. What they really do is engineer diseases and add them into vaccines that are ""intended"" to prevent the diseases they create. Many vaccines admit to using live viruses. The Merieux family are agents of the House of Medici with Alain Merieux as the head and worth over 3 billion. There is a Medici Firma international investment firm with offices in the United States, Switzerland, and Australia. Medici Firma is a financial mafia that works as a shadow partner with banks like HSBC, Liechtenstein Global Trust, HNA Group, Softbank, and BlackRock. Medici Firma has a financial intelligence division used for gathering information on economies, governments, banks, and markets. Medici Firma has been secretly buying up land in the United States through their real estate division. Medici Firma is probably the most secretive investment firm on the planet and has removed information regarding its investments and business contracts since it was originally exposed. On their Medici Firma Council page on their website they have a Masonic square and compass. There is another company called Medici Ventures which is a subsidiary of Overstock. Medici Ventures manages companies involved in online bank transfers, online security programs, and other types of online financial systems. Medici Firma and Medici Ventures are secretly controlled by the House of Medici. The Gucci family were recent billionaires with Aldo Gucci who was born in Florence, Tuscany. Gucci is still headquartered in Florence today and is headed up by the CEO Marco Bizzarri and Alessandro Michele. Gucci is now a subsidiary of Kering owned by the French billionaire Francois Pinault who is an agent of the Medici family. Francois Pinault and his family including his son Francois-Henri Pinault are worth about 30 billion. The French Pinault family owns the holding company Groupe Artemis which owns Kering and the auction house Christies with Patricia Barbizet as the CEO. Political Zionism had origins in France. The Medicis are secretly connected with many Jewish Zionists and were the owners of the Italian-Jewish East Harlem Purple Gang which worked with the Savoy owned Genovese crime family. The East Harlem Purple Gang absorbed into the Genoveses which today manage the Harlem based rap group and organized crime syndicate called the Diplomats or Dipset with members Cam'Ron, Jim Jones, Juelz Santana, and Hell Rell. Members of Dipset often wear purple and pink. The Medicis and Savoys have intermarried. The Medicis also owned the older Jewish Purple Gang in Detroit. The old Jewish Mafia was always mixed in with Italians. Both the Jewish Mafia and Medicis have been partly kicked out of black hand organized crime for trying to take over. The Medicis are still infiltrated in various mafias and use Zionist bankers like the Dreyfus family to tax them through money laundering operations. The private bank Dreyfus Sons &amp; Co in Switzerland paid a fine of 24 million for enabling tax evasion with their hundreds of hidden US connected accounts amounting to $1.76 billion.
​
The Dreyfus family have similar ancestry as the Medici family and they are extremely wealthy. The Medici, Dreyfus, and Sassoon families are all descendants of Babylonian-Chaldeans. Baron James Sassoon covertly works with the Medicis and is the current Commercial Secretary to Treasury in the United Kingdom. It was during the Sasanian Empire when the Chaldean Catholic Church was established. The French Dreyfus branch work as Court Factors for the House of Bonaparte which work with the Medicis. Julia Louis-Dreyfus is a very high level murderous satanic witch and she is overseen by Prince Giuliano de Medici. Pierre Dreyfus is Vice Chairman of the Swiss bank Dreyfus &amp; Sons. Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte was the first President of France. French presidents are the heads of the Bonaparte's Legion of Honour which has many members that are billionaires and heads of major corporations and banks like Alfred Dreyfus, Pierre Louis-Dreyfus, Benoit Potier, Pierre-Andre de Chalendar, Patrick Pouyanne, Rene Obermann and Bernard Arnault who is worth tens of billions. Cosimo III de' Medici the last Medici Grand Duke of Tuscany bankrupted the state bank right after receiving large deposits of gold from the Elector of Bavaria. I believe the Medici family used this gold to finance the Jewish Rothschild family as the new top bankers as an attempt to deflect away from Christian royals and nobles and especially north Italian bankers like the Medicis. The Rothschild family have worked with the House of Medici with Carl Mayer von Rothschild who ran the Naples Bank financing the House of Medici and working with Prince Luigi de Medici of Ottajano. The Medici family developed the Double-Entry book keeping system used for tracking debts. Current members of these crime families include Prince Ottaviano de Medici, Prince Giuliano de Medici, Prince Lorenzo de Medici-Tornaquinci-Foscari and of the House of Bonaparte there is Prince Charles Napoleon Bonaparte, and Prince Jean Christophe Napoleon Bonaparte. Prince Jean Christophe worked for Morgan Stanley and Advent International which is a major buy out firm with assets estimated at over 30 billion. There is another Prince Lorenzo de Medici in Italy as well. Princess Elisabetta de Medici works with a ruthless and diseased child murdering rapist witch named Elizabeth Martello. The Medici family are Rome's tax collectors and they oversee the IRS through Rome's network of power. David Kautter was Jesuit educated from Georgetown Law and is Commissioner of the IRS. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York shares a similar architectural design with the Palazzo Medici-Riccardi in Florence. The Medici family command their agents in the IRS to financially persecute people that Rome has declared as heretics. Not only is income tax immoral but the IRS make up debts out of thin air and they persecute people based on these made up or inflated debts. Prince Ottaviano de Medici is the head of this evil bloodline and a ruthless tyrant.",finance

personalfinance,"How do I ask for a 20%+ raise? Multiple coworkers have resigned, their work is now mine.","Hello, I’m new to the job force and don’t yet understand how these things work (or if it’s even possible to do what I’m asking), so I’m looking for candid advice where salary negotiations, while already working for a company, are concerned. 

The short of it is: Multiple co-workers have resigned, in quick succession, in a short time span and now there’s a [huge] void on a project that I’m being asked to fill. As in, going from fully staffed to just me and a product manager now. I‘m of the opinion that such a significant shift in responsibility should come with a title change and a salary adjustment. 

I would like to go from junior [job title] to just regular [job title] and boost my salary closer to what I know one of the coworkers who left made (I’d still be making $10k less than the lowest paid one). 


Background:

I came into the company at a junior level (role and pay) and in the year or so that I’ve been here, I’ve already come up to par doing work equivalent to my peers, who get paid $20k-$40k more than me based on their experience. 

Up until now, I haven’t minded being undervalued by the company since I valued all the growth and learning I was getting for my own future. But I think we’ve begun to slip into the realm of ridiculous with this new proposition of doing 2-3 people’s work for the same junior title and pay. Or maybe I need to adopt some more humility and grind it out until annual reviews...9 months from now? I just worry about that cause my raise for this past year was 3% — and that was after coming up a steep learning curve.  

I don’t mind working harder, I just don’t want to be taken advantage of. I already flagellated myself in accepting this junior pay cause I was excited about the industry and the experience I would build. That “opportunity” is now turning into a financial nightmare. 

So how do I navigate getting that tremendous salary adjustment? My leverage right now is that the company probably cannot afford to lose one more person (but companies can be irrational lol, so who knows!)",finance

Hello,


I'm working on my Year 2018 taxes.  I see the same situation coming up possibly that I considered in the past although a few details have changed.


I am still in repayment on my federal student loan for a few more years.  That's based on my AGI.  So if I lower my AGI on my federal taxes, my student loan payments are lower (by 15%, I'm on income based repayment) for 12 months.  That's sticking money in a traditional retirement account so I'm not paying taxes now.  Whatever amount I can stick in an IRA (up to the max on that) would be the basis for my student loan recalculation, which uses 15% of income above the poverty line, so it would be ""saving"" 15% of that max IRA contribution on my next 12-month student loan payment cycle.  For example, if $5,500 is the max IRA contribution for Year 2018 taxes, 15% is $825.  If I do nothing with the IRA, my adjusted gross income is up $5,500, and I pay $825 over the near-future 12-month student loan repayment cycle.  If I do max out the $5,500, my student loan gets recalculated $825 lower over that next 12-month repayment cycle.  There's no future retirement tax waiting on the student loan.  My student loan should be forgiven in a few years.  I'm on track for that.  In a sense, it's investing $5,500 in a traditional IRA (pay taxes later when I take it out) but it gets me back $825 in the near-future.  That's already a 15% return ""now"" (during the next 12-month student loan repayment cycle) on that $5,500.


Change since 2016 -- My job changed a little.  I now have benefits, including retirement.  It some kind of traditional retirement.  I'm thinking that's not a Roth, so I'm probably not paying taxes now.  I'm paying x% of my income into that.  I'm looking at my Year 2018 W2 though.  I can't tell if my #1 ""Wages, tips, other comp,"" includes what I would have paid into the employeer's retirement thing.  The retirement option wasn't an option.  It was a ""choice"" between their retirement plan options.  A percent of my income went into that, no opt out choice.  I bring this up since it would affect how much I might pay into an IRA now (for Year 2018).


I did set up a Vanguard account around 2016, but never used it.  As far as I know, it's still there, ready to go.  I was thinking when I decide on this, I could drop some money in that (minimum IRA is $3,000 I think, or was in 2016).  I'm not sure how I get the paperwork for Year 2018 taxes though so have the Year 2018 IRS forms filled out properly).


So my goal is to reduce my AGI on federal taxes for Year 2018 by throwing money into an IRA.  What's the max retirement contribution allowed for Year 2018 (was $5,500 in Year 2017 I think)?  I wonder if I'm missing a form from the work retirement plan.  I'm not sure how much I (was forced) contribute to that for Year 2018.


It looks like on IRS 1040 year 2018, Schedule 1, line 32, there's a spot for IRA contributions.  That uses form 8606.  I don't see a ""maximum of $5,500"" or anything like that anywhere though.....


It looks like I'd only be doing this year and maybe next year if I decide to do it.  I'm just fuzzy on how to contribute to Vanguard with an IRA, how to get paperwork for Year 2018 from them, how much I can max out that IRA deduction (if that's $5,500), if anything from work retirement now affects that....
Back on my Year 2018 W2 form from work, I do have box 13 checked for retirement plan now.

Edit: Also, I'm aware it's not a taxable event at all if I'm only withdrawing the money I've put into the account each year, but in this particular question I'm referring to both the money I've put in as well as the gains beyond that.",finance
personalfinance,The best choice for paying down debt to buy a house,"Hi there, new to making the right choices with my dollars and am getting caught up with all that there is to offer here. While I’m looking to get my budget locked in, I want to take the right next steps in regards to my debt. Here’s the lay of the land:

Car 1 owe 11,300 @5.49 for 290 a month
Car 2 owe 30,000 @6.99 for 589 a month
School owe 19,000 @4.5 for 190 a month

I currently have 15k in savings that would be considered an emergency fund or what I was previously trying to just save for a house. I know now that I shouldn’t be saving for a house with this money and rather paying off these debts first. I have a decent salary(140k) pay off CC debt monthly. I know there are other areas we can tighten the budget to help, but Given I want to buy a house for my family I could really use some guidance here. I pay 1500 on rent monthly, but don’t think I’ll easily find a house that meets our needs for that mortgage based upon the “down payment” I’d have today (20k if I liquidated everything which I know is not the right answer). I’m 36 with 2 kids and have had the same job for the past 10 years. 

I feel like these are my options:


1 - put the 15 k towards the big car loan. Look for other opportunities to pay to principle and focus on closing that out due to the high interest rate. 
2- pay off the smaller car loan in full, put remainder of 15 k towards the other car loan and convert my 290 payment to principle of the other car loan. 
3 - continue to pay on the loans and look for housing by either compromising on the house or distance to work. 

Open to other suggestions. From what I’ve read #1 seems to be the preferred mechanism, though a hard pill to swallow seeing it’ll push back the home buying easily by 2-4 years. Help me make the right choice here.",finance
personalfinance,"Parents found savings bonds for me totalling a current value of $2,500. What should I do with it?","For a little context, my great-grandmother had been buying savings bonds for me since I was born. My parents had recently sorted through a bunch of old financial documents and let me know about them. They are EE series savings bonds, and using the official website calculator I found out their current value totals $2,500.

EE series bonds max out their value at 30 years, and the oldest I have is 23 years old. Their interest rates change yearly, and I don't know the best course of action for the money. I know next to nothing about investing, and I'm not sure if there's a better place for the money or if they should stay in the bonds? I don't necessarily need it right now, but it'll probably be useful within the next 5 years.

personalfinance,What would I need to do to drop money in a Vanguard IRA for Year 2018 taxes?,"If I want to max out the $5,500 Year 2018 federal income taxes option, and I already created a Vanguard account and linked it to my bank account a couple years ago, what would I need to do to drop $5,500 in a Vanguard IRA to lower my adjusted gross income on federal taxes?  I should see if the account still works.  Otherwise, it looked like I just had to click a few buttons to transfer money when I checked in 2016.  

How do I get the form from Vanguard for my Year 2018 taxes though?  If I drop money with them today, can I just print off a webpage for my IRS 1040 to prove that I put money in an IRA for Year 2018?  Or do I have to wait for Vanguard to mail me something?",finance
personalfinance,Filing two years taxes for international student,"Hello everyone,

Sorry if this is not the correct place to ask, but I'm an international student and last year I did not file my taxes (federal or state). I'm owed tax return for both, this year and last year, and since I'm an international student I cannot file online and have to mail the documents and forms to the IRS. I wanted to ask since I'm filing for both 2017 and 2018, should I mail the docs for each year separately, or put them all in a single file and mail them? Also, for 2018 form there's a place that asks if I've filed tax returns before. Should I answer yes and put my 2016 tax return information or 2017 (which I'll send this year)?

personalfinance,Should I refinance to this?,"Not sure if I'm in the right thread but I'll start here.

So I have an auto loan. 14.99% interest. Ugh. I tried to refinance through the bank I've been banking with for ~5 years. They denied me. The bank that I have my loan from doesn't refinance into another auto loan, rather into a personal loan. I NEED a lower interest rate. Even if it's 10%. Should I refinance into a personal loan? Other places won't refinance me either because the loan amount is too high. I bought the car for $8,900, almost $800 in taxes and fees, plus $1,200 in additional protection in which it has paid off already having it. I currently owe a little over 11k. Loan total was 12.3k I think. 

Any suggestions? I can provide more detail if needed.",finance
personalfinance,"Should I list my car's business-related mileage on my Schedule C tax form, even though I claimed Virginia's ""car tax relief"" on my personal property tax?","Not sure if this is the best place to ask about this, but I'm not really sure where else to go. I work as an independent contractor for Instacart (think Uber, but for groceries), and use my personal car for work. Most of the mileage on my car is for work.

About a month ago, when it was time for me to pay the personal property tax on my car, I received a form in the mail, which said that I qualified for something called ""car tax relief"". This lessened my bill by about $100. But the back of the form said that I would only qualify for car tax relief, if I claimed less than half of my car's mileage as a business expense on my personal income tax. 

I only made about $11,000 this year, and my understanding is that everyone in the US qualifies for a standard deduction of $12,000. So I figured that there isn't any point for me to itemize. I went ahead and claimed the car tax relief, since I don't plan on claiming anything as a deduction on my federal income tax.

But now I'm trying to file my taxes on Freetaxusa.com, and apparently, I have to fill out something called a Schedule C form. There's a ""Vehicle Expenses"" section, which requires that I specify how many business miles I put on my car over the year, and it's impossible to leave this blank.

So I'm not really sure what I should do. Should I put in the actual number of business miles, even though I claimed the car tax relief on my personal property tax? Or should I put ""zero"" as the number of business miles? Will it even make a difference? 

As noted in the title of the thread, I live in Virginia. I'm not sure whether ""car tax relief"" is something that exists nationwide in the US, or if it's specific to my area.

personalfinance,How to file California State Taxes w/HSA info (for free) when I've already filed Federal?,"I filed my federal taxes directly using the IRS website, because that's how I like to do that. I expect people to ask me why, or tell me what's better, but that's not what I'm here to discuss right now.

But this year I'm encountering a problem: CA won't let me file directly through their website, because I had HSA-related deductions on my federal, and CA reckons HSA information into AGI differently from how the IRS does.

I tried Credit Karma and got right to the end of the process, only to find out that it doesn't support filing State separate from Federal.

personalfinance,But Vanguard's not federally insured?,"I looked into setting up an IRA a couple years ago.  Never actually pulled the trigger and put any money in it though.  I saw the overall interest rates were something like 11 or 12%.  Whatever it was.  Good return for return interests rates though.  So I mentioned that to someone else -- Hey, look at this Vanguard thing.  The interest rates look good.  Looks like it's a slow growing good thing... right?  Their response?  ""No, no.  That's not federally insured.  Are you nuts?  You could lose all your money.  You want these federally insured ones....""  But the interest rates are more like half (in 2016) of what Vanguard had.  

I believe the IRA thing (yep, I'm a noob for this, not stupid, but much more on the noob side) was based off top performing stocks, etc.  So in order to lose money, the entire US economy would have to tank.  (Or is that the Great Depression....?  Except a Vanguard IRA isn't just stocks either...)


So what say you, those-who-know-more-about-this-than-me?  And how would you respond to that person who says, ""I don't know.  You might lose all your money there.  They're not federally insured.  Why don't you put that into a federally insured IRA with the local bank (with half the interest rate)?""

I'm still thinking over the life of the IRA, it's ""safe enough.""  If I've got a Vanguard IRA, social security, whatever else has been tacked on jobs for retirement... That's also diversifying things a bit that way.",finance

personalfinance,Getting stuck in the details of actually setting up a Vanguard IRA...,"Getting stuck in the details....

I set up my Vanguard online account a few years ago.

I connected it to my bank account to verify myself back then.

I see I have a ""Federal Money Market (Settlement fund)"" in my Vanguard online account.


I want a traditional IRA (to my lower my adjusted gross income on federal taxes).  I think I want to buy a Targted Retirment Account, and I've got the year picked out.  I just want a traditional IRA (I think).


I clicking through the buy process, but I'm getting confused.  I would adding to my existing $0 balance ""Federal Money 
Market (Settlement Fund)""  account, or is that just something for shuffling money to pay whatever fees there are for this, ie I need to open a new account for a traditional IRA with money?


Looks like it lost my bank info from a few years ago.... I only see an option to add a new bank to transfer money.


And my name on my Vanguard account and my bank account don't appear to match... Even though they look identical to me, with a few variations to try to get it to work.  Dang.  I have no idea why it's doing that. 
""Requires notarized signature

I guess really doesn't matter if I don't have my bank account connected to my Vanguard account.  I can always mail in checks for this.


Any ideas on this?   If I'm logged in on the Vanguard site, which account do I buy an IRA under?  Or just set up a brand new account?  Any ideas on why my bank account and Vanguard names don't match, even though they're identical.  The only missing part is having a ""Mr."" in front on my Vanguard account I guess.",finance
personalfinance,I got my transfer acceptance letter for the college I want to go to. It's a state university so costs will be less than alternative universities.

Unfortunately, I don't have any idea how much more yet as I am sure that will fluctuate as I get more clients.

My rough calculations put the cost of tuition for my two years there at about $16k before I get my B.A. and teaching credential. I am not necessarily opposed to stutent loans to cover some of the costs, but I would like to keep that at a minimum as I am sure many of you can empathize with.

personalfinance,Looking for feedback on our options to tackle student loan debt.,"Hi all. My wife and I are recently married, and we are attempting to get her student loan debt from grad school under control. We could use the perspective or r/personalfinance. Before I get in the details, I want to say that I know am very fortunate to have options – many aren’t so lucky. So here’s our situation:


We’re both around 40. I make about $110,000 a year. My wife only made around $15,000 last year because she’s launching a new business. Things are picking up for her, but it’s unlikely she will earn more than $50,000/year for the foreseeable future. 


She has about $55,000 in student loan debt. She’s always made the payments, but I didn’t realize that for a big chunk of the loans, the interest was accumulating faster than she was paying it. Additionally, that same big chunk is an IBR (Income-Based Repayment) loan, so if we file our taxes jointly, the payments will jump significantly.


The loans: 

* Federal (IBR) - $45000 at 6.8% (forgiveness in 16 years)
* Perkins - $3500 at 5%
* Private - $6500 at 7%


Our finances:

* We have a $20K emergency fund.
* For the last few years, I’ve maxed my 401k and Roth IRA. My wife hasn’t been able to save anything for awhile due to her income. 
* We currently have $150K in retirement accounts.
* We currently have $50K in a brokerage account (VTSAX, VTIAX)
* Our mortgage and property taxes are about $2300 a month. There’s $333,000 left on the principal, and the home is worth around $850,000. Like I said, I consider myself lucky.
* Given how much I’ve been throwing into retirement accounts (and our upward-creeping lifestyle), we are basically holding even each month. Our bills are getting paid, but we aren’t saving for vacations or anything. If the student loan payments jump, we will soon be depleting our emergency fund.
* No kids in our future.


Our options:

* We could sell the funds in the brokerage account and pay off the majority of the debt. There are about $5000 in long-term capital gains here. This is what we are leaning toward, since 6.8% and 7% are very steep, and I’ve read the rule of thumb is to pay debts with interests over 4% instead of investing.
* We could potentially borrow from our parents, and then make steady payments back to them. Not sure why this is better than paying it ourselves, but I suppose it’s an option.
* We could file separately to keep the payments on the IBR loan very small. This would hurt us a bit in tax returns. Also, running the numbers through some payment estimators tells me we would have to do this for the next 16 years (when the debt would be forgiven) for it to be a good deal. And that’s only if my wife continues to make a modest income.
* Anything else? 


As for risks - who knows what could come? That $50K in the brokerage account is a significant safety net for us, and I'm nervous about losing it.


Any advice is appreciated. Thank you.

personalfinance,Currently Losing Money to Inflation. Paying off low interest Student Debt vs. Investing in low cost Index Funds,"Here's my back story:

* Graduated in Summer 2015 with **$17500** (all federal, avg. 4.8% interest) in student loans and no other debt. 
* I have been working for a few years now and have gone from an anual income of 50k starting to 80k currently. 
* I have a 3 month **safety net** of cash in my savings account. 
* I have participated in my company's ESPP program (10% of my paycheck) and contributed 10% of my paycheck to my **401k** (no employer match)
* With semi aggressive payments over the years, chipping away at highest interest rates first (4.4% fixed vs 3.2%) I am down to **$6800 in student debt.** 
* Still no other debt. Pay off CC in full every month. 

Current Situation:

* Girlfriend of 8 years is in similar financial situation. We are both pretty good with our spending. 
* I've got the basics down (401k, safty net, no credit card debt)
* I have about $30,000 in the bank (cash, this excludes my safety net) that is just sitting there losing value to inflation.
* Buying a $800 ring in the next month or so :) 

What I need advice on:

* Should I just **pay off all my loans $6800 of low interest (3-4.4%) in one shot?**
* I have also heard people on this forum say that the market **could** (not guaranteed to) outperform my losses on these low interest student loans. Would I be better off dropping **$6800 into low cost index funds**/mutual funds?
* My gut tells me to clear this debt in one shot (today!) and take the 3-4% guaranteed return instead of dropping my money into a mutual fund and hoping for the market to beat that ~4% interest.
* I like the idea of not having to think about my debt and finally being totally debt free.

personalfinance,Best Lenders for Refinancing Private Student Loans?,"I have some high interest rate private loans.

I need to be sure that I have a trustworthy lender - I want some help in deciding who to choose. I.e. no one who has overpayment fees or people who try to prevent you from overpaying to get rid of principal balance.

Some people do scummy things, and that's one area that I am quite sensitive to because my debt is pretty high right now and my income can only barely handle it. From a financial stability perspective, my income doesn't handle it - I live frugally and paycheck to paycheck. There are hardly any expenses to cut except for my loans. My balance doesn't seem to creep up or down.

personalfinance,Trying to boost my credit score.,"Hi guys, 

I currently am sitting on a 719-733 credit score (TransUnion vs Equifax), and I want to improve it. Right now, I have the following- 

3-5 hard inquiries (kinda strange, TransUnion and Equifax have completely different hard inquiries, and Equifax has me hard inquired for things like rental lease arrangements, utility bills, etc.). 

&amp;#x200B;

Average credit age of 2.2 years. 

4 open accounts- 

1 credit card with a $4000 limit which I barely use. (Capital One Platinum Mastercard, 25.24% APR)

1 new personal loan of $2000 with 8.7% interest, paid off after 3 years. (I do not need the loan money, I only opened the account for credit building purposes. Probably a mistake in hindsight.)

2 open Nelnet student loan accounts, totaling roughly $11,000 at an average interest rate of 4.2%

&amp;#x200B;

My ideas were as follows- 

\- Pay off a big chunk of that bank loan now and pay interest on a much smaller amount for the next 3 years, or just pay off that loan entirely.

\- Open one or two new credit cards to boost my number of open accounts. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am worried about a few things though if I do this. 

\- If I kill most of the bank loan now, it might not benefit my credit score. Does the size of the loan matter in terms of improving credit? I've had a $5000 loan with this bank in the past which I opened and closed for the same reasons as this one, and I am not sure if repeatedly opening/closing these loans like this might hurt my score. 

\- If I open 2 new credit cards, I am worried it will trigger 2 more hard inquiries on my score as well as further reduce my average credit age. I know these are short term issues, but I was worried that it will wreck my credit score for the next year or so. 

Thanks for any advice.

personalfinance,Follow dave ramsey vs his followers,"So my wife and I have $53,000 of debt not including our house. We reduced our expenses quite a bit and increased our income. Living relatively frugal we can pay this off in 2 years conservatively.bwe have about $1,500 left over to allocate towards these debts each month. Our debts are as follows

Personal loans (credit cards): 15.7k
Car 1: 6k
Car 2 16k
School loan 1: 10k
School loan 2: 6k (deferred until December 2019)

The personal loan has a stupid high interest rate of 11.5%. payment is $468 and we are paying $2,000 on it. Then we will tackle the student loans, once those are done car 1 will have 2k left then car 2 will take 4 months to pay off. Now that being said, I can do a few things. 

We could save $40/month cutting cable but it's our only entertainment. We take my dad and mom out to dinner every week. Mom is terminally ill and they are struggling hard with medical bills. down we allocate $150/ea to cover those dinners and misc stuff we need such as restock items not in the food budget.

Now I've also been told to get rid of my dog. Like seriously that's like saying get rid of a child. He's very high energy and needs 3-4 hours of exercise everyday and we are gone from 7-7. So we utilize daycare which is $20/day. He's also on a meet and rice diet and being a border collie eats a ton, that's $100/month. Due to his many vet visits we also pay $50/month for insurance. It adds up to $500-600/month. But again, that's literally like saying put your child up for adoption because you want to pay debt off sooner.

Even Dave Ramsey understands some needs. We can't eat beans and rice because my wife and I have health issues and are on a specific diet which we cook. I just don't understand why people want to cast aside family just to pay debt off a few months sooner. Dave Ramsey wouldn't do that but his subreddit does.",finance

Bitcoin,PSA for the noobs - Why bitcoin over other crypto,"When I was new I felt like one of the big things stopping me from buying any bitcoin was because there are so many other coins out there, how do you choose? And if there are so many, what makes one better than the other?

The thing that is most important to a cryptocurrency is its decentralization and monetary policy. Bitcoin wins at this - hands down, no question about it.

If you believe that doesn't matter, there will always be a newer 'better' coin with faster transactions and lower fees. Not to mention that if you feel that way, your credit card works way faster, with a HUGELY better infrastructure for retailers to accept payment with.

The problem, is that none of these solutions have the economic inventive feedback system that bitcoin has with ever more miners providing ever more security with ever more hash power in order to print bitcoin.

If any coin were to try it, it would be instantly under control due to any one party being able to 51% it as soon as it came online.

This is why maximalists believe in bitcoin above all else, and why bitcoin beats the newest, fastest, 'proof-of-anything-BUT-work' coins.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Is it okay to sell a car after only owning for a year?,"Hi Everyone. To make a long story short, I purchased a used 2014 Mazda 3 (tech package etc) with 35k miles for $12k last February. This car has been great to me however my career has changed a bit. I'm now in a field based role where I'm driving 20k miles a year in the Northeast (snow, etc.). My company pays for milage plus I receive $350 a month for a car/insurance. This is in the form of additional money on my paycheck so i keep it regardless of my car payment. With all the driving I've been doing, I've started getting lower back pain which I believe is from sitting and driving all day. I'm 6'4 so a Mazda 3 probably isn't the best choice of a car seeing that I have to push the seat all the way back to fit, limiting the number of customers I can fit in the back. Is it stupid to sell this car, especially since I just bought it and I also have an extremely low interest rate (2.2%) which I don't believe I'll be able to get today? 

Issues: Back Pain, Limited Space for Customers (Since seat is pushed all the way back), no AWD

personalfinance,How to get best personal loan rates?,Not sure if this has posted already but I have had my ebbs and flows of credit card debt and personal loans in the past. From ubering and my full time position I have found myself in a position to consider keeping multiple credit cards open at various interest rates (most 0% unitl later this year) and a personal loan. In the past I have had a personal loan for 20.99% which was lower than my credit cards at the time. I have found a supportive partner in paying down costic debt and am mostly curious in finding out what do these personal loan companies require to get their best rates. Some as low as 3% but discover offered 6.99%. To me it seems if I am ever in a position to qualify for those Id probably have the cash vs personal loan.

personalfinance,21 year old college student conflicted on how to handle my remaining 2 years,"My situation: I am a sophomore mechanical engineering student with currently 16000 in student loans. I work 20-30 hours depending on the week and all of the money I make currently goes towards rent, food and monthly payments for loans. I get no assistance from my parents as I make more money than my mom and my stepdad doesn't financially support me. He also makes enough money as to where I only receive a partial federal unsubsidized loan. my tuition is $16,000 a year and I'd expect to pay about $6,000-8,000 for rent per year.

My problem: I feel like I am missing out on opportunities at college that will have an impact on my career. I want to participate in clubs and do research with professors but currently have no free time to do these things.

I would like to get an internship but am starting to notice a trend from all of the ones that I have applied for would like to see a recommendation from a professor. I feel like the way that you would typically get this is by being a TA for them or doing research for them. Based on my experience that's a game of who you know not what you know. I am usually unable to go to office hours and develop a relationship with the professor due to my work schedule. lt just feels like a circle that I can't get into while working in college.

In addition I know that networking is a huge factor in getting opportunities and I have had to miss many of these because calling out of work for those few hours is literally the difference in me eating.

I want to know if you think I should stop working and start getting out loans to cover all of my expenses for college starting next semester at least until I can get a position at the University as a TA or researcher, or if this is a bad idea.",finance

worldpolitics,About cooperation between Moscow and Tokyo on the Kuril Islands issue,"The peace treaty after the end of the World War II between Moscow and Tokyo still remains unsigned. The main obstacle to its signing is territorial dispute over the southern part of the Kuril Islands: Iturup, Kunashir, Shikotan and Small Kuril ridge that called in Japan ""Habomai"". Japan, calling the islands their ""Northern territories"" does not recognize them as Russian, and Moscow, in turn, does not recognize the fact of territorial dispute. Russia's principled position is that its sovereignty over pointed territories has an appropriate international legal form and cannot be questioned.

South Kuril Islands are the biggest problem and important part of relations between Russia and Japan. Japan links the issue of their affiliation with the conclusion of a peace treaty with Russia. Moscow offers Tokyo to focus on cooperation in economic sphere, including through joint economic activities in the southern Kuriles. Japanese authorities were 

Japanese authorities were not satisfied with such a statement of the question for a long time, but recently Tokyo, pretending on these islands, still hopes to solve the territorial problem with Russia through the development of economic relations between the two countries, including the southern Kuriles. At the same time, the Japanese government states that ""under no circumstances"" will allow its citizens and companies to conduct economic activities in the Kuriles in compliance with Russian laws, because this undermines its position on the ownership of the South Kuril Islands not of Russia, but of Japan.

After Shinzo Abe became Prime Minister of Japan, some progress has been made on that issue. In December 2016, during the visit in Japan of Russian president Vladimir Putin the two parties agreed on the document about the beginning of consultations on joint economic activities of two countries on the South Kuriles. As part of the implementation of the agreements in June and October 2017, two business missions of Japanese entrepreneurs and officials visited the Islands, who showed interest in the development of the Islands. 

At the same time, the Abe administration hopes that Russia will agree to allow Japanese companies to participate in local economic activities in the Kuriles on the basis of a special legal framework outside the usual Russian legislation. Moreover, the Japanese hint that the possibility of such a ""special legal system"" was allegedly discussed in a confidential face-to-face conversation between Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Russian President Vladimir Putin during the latter's visit to Japan in December 2016. However, immediately after that conversation, the presidential aide for international affairs Y. Ushakov stressed that we are talking about the work of Japanese companies in the Kuril Islands in compliance with the Russian legislation. In the same vein, the Deputy Minister of foreign affairs of the Russian Federation I. Morgulov has repeatedly spoken about this.

It should be noted that in political circles of Japan from the very beginning, the Prime Minister was reproached for his too soft position towards Moscow and unjustified reliance only on his ""especially trusting"" relations with V. Putin. At the same time, it was noted that the Kremlin, seeing this, on the contrary, tightens its position on Japanese territorial claims. In turn, Japanese authorities suggested that Russian leadership took a tough stance on the Kuril issue due to the upcoming presidential elections, and after the re-election, when the situation is calmer, Russia could give consent to the work of Japanese companies on the Islands within the framework of a special legal framework. That is why the Japanese Prime Minister S. Abe was one of the first who congratulated V. Putin with re-election on the highest state post. Tokyo thinks that ""while Putin, who enjoys stable support at home, continues to be in power"", a territorial issue will be solved. The official position of Japan on the Kuril Islands issue announced the day after the elections in Russia, Secretary General of the Cabinet Yoshihide Suga, having declared Tokyo's intention to hold ""persistent negotiations"" on that issue in the future.

And now the Japanese government continue to ""promote joint economic activities with Russia on four northern islands and strive for conducting the peace treaty, solving a territorial issue"", connecting a new term of V. Putin with their hopes to get the southern Kuril Islands into the state. The Japanese Prime Minister hopes for the breakthrough in that issue, and 2018 year which was officially proclaimed the cross Year of Japan and Russia, is defined as a year of possibilities. Thus, S. Abe expects significant progress in resolving a territorial issue during his visit on 25-26 of May in Russia to participate in the international economic forum in St. Petersburg and the opening ceremony of the Year of Japan in Russia. Moreover, the Japanese government wants to invite Russian president Vladimir Putin to Japan on May, 2019. V. Putin is expected to visit the Land of the rising sun in any case next year, to take part in The G20 summit, the date of which has not yet been announced. Furthermore, S. Abe will try to hold individual negotiations with V. Putin on the islands issue during the East economic forum, which will be held in Vladivostok on 6 and 7 September, 2018. 

It should be noted that the administration of S. Abe considers not particularly large-scale joint economic projects, which seem to be a very modest step against the background of Japan's official goal to return all four Islands, as a gambit. Seeking permission for Japanese companies to return to the Islands, Tokyo wants to use these projects for strengthen its influence on the Kuril Islands. In a long-term perspective, the Japanese government hopes that it would be possible to use that influence for solving the dispute in more propitious way. 

In that long-term strategy, for Tokyo it is important to obtain Moscow's initial consent to the work of Japanese companies on the Islands within the framework of a special legal framework. This will allow Japan to create a small gap that can be used later for a larger breakthrough. During the March meeting with students from the Hokkaido Prefecture of Japan, the winner of the competition of oral presentations devoted to the ""Northern territories"", Abe said that the problem of the peace treaty will be resolved ""during the lifetime of his generation"". And this achievement the Prime Minister of Japan is going to ""pass on to descendants"".

Meanwhile, during the visit of Russian foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to Tokyo on March 20-21, projects of Russian-Japanese economic activity in the southern Kuriles in five regions (mariculture, wind energy, creation of greenhouses, garbage disposal and organization of package tourist trips) were concretized. At the same time, S. Lavrov, saying that ""the dialogue is developing constructively in a good, positive atmosphere"" voiced Moscow's position on Tokyo's unceremonious demand to change the Russian legislative system ""taking into account Japanese requirements"". As the Minister said, Moscow ""does not see the need to create any supranational body"" on Russian territory. At the same time, Lavrov focused on economic privileges and benefits for foreign, including Japanese, companies willing to work in the Kuriles, calling such benefits ""the essence of the agreements"". This is, first of all, the regime of the territories of advanced development and the Free Port of Vladivostok.

The representative of the Japanese foreign Ministry, M. Yasushi, recognizes that ""the issue of concluding a peace Treaty is a very difficult task"", which none of the predecessors has been able to resolve for more than 70 years. However, all post-war problems between Russia and Japan have long been settled. Peace between Russia and Japan actually came after the surrender of Japan in 1945, and the legal state of war was stopped by the Soviet-Japanese Declaration of 1956. In the current conditions, a formal peace Treaty with Japan is a clear anachronism. Nevertheless, S. Abe is going to ""move forward"" on the peace Treaty, which actually serves as a cover for the solution of the territorial issue – the unjustified Japanese claims to the southern Kuriles. And Japan's demonstration of active participation in economic cooperation in the Kuriles is done with a quite pragmatic goal – to encourage the Russian leadership, if not immediately to give the Kuril Islands, then at least agree to discuss with Tokyo the prospects for such a transfer. At the same time, Japan is trying to combine the incompatible – the possibility of good-neighborly cooperation with Russia and the account of Japanese claims to the ""Northern territories"". However, Tokyo's demands to Moscow to change the legal framework on the Islands in favor of Japan, so that it takes into account Japanese claims to the ""Northern territories"", only create additional difficulties in the relations between the two countries.",energy

personalfinance,Is there a good middle ground for TurboTax and credit karma?,"I’ve always used turbo tax and they’ve been the simplest to use and have given me the most clear and relevant deductions for me. They charge a lot though.

I was recommended creditkarma as being the only tax preparer that gives free federal and state. However, their system is hard as hell to understand and also gives me wildly different numbers than turbo tax does.

Turbo has me at about $1600 return and creditkarma has me at like $2200, but I’m pretty sure the turbo tax one is the more accurate one.",finance
gaming,What do you do to a friend who can’t accept defeat? It’s getting frustrating,"I’m at university, new friends new life. I became friends with this guy, who always told me that he’s the most humble person  when it comes to games in general, and not just video games (yes this is very ironic, but it happened), in fact he always talks about himself and how he’s so amazing, ALWAYS. The funniest part is that I was too stupid that I believed him, and did not find the irony in his statement. 

Last two weeks, my friends introduced me to Smash ultimate, and that guy was the strongest player (he only played for four months), and like the humble guy he is, he told me “I’ll give you 3 years to defeat me” because he always tells himself (and us) that he’s a very fast-learner, he’s simply skilled, so he says he’s very ahead of us no matter how much we practice. So I beat him after a week of purchasing the game, though I’m fully aware that I’m horrible at it, but he’s just as bad. He then said “Happy? This is your first and last win, keep lying to yourself into thinking you’re good” and I have not even said a single thing.

Put all what I have said aside. Now we’re playing Smash ultimate as a party of 5 players, a PARTY! we should only have fun, everyone is laughing as we’re playing. However, whenever this guy loses, he makes excuses and acts like a kid all the time. “You’re all focusing me because I’m more skilled than all of you” no one is even focusing him or anything, but he’s too in-denial to admit that he lost.

What pissed me off to the fullest, is when I introduced one of my old friends to the game to join us and pick a character called “Meta Knight” to spam the heck out of us. He did, and it was hilarious how he just joined the game and beat our asses with his spam, we were all laughing super hard, especially at the comments that he made when he spammed us. Now there’s that sour loser in the background saying “What are you laughing at? You’re completely bad at the game it’s not even funny” I straight up told him “Shut the fuck up you, you’re being a sour loser”. We never had anything like that said before in our group, so that was very surprising to everyone. He replied with “shut your mouth before I do it for you” I was this close from knocking his ass I’m not even kidding, then the guys immediately told me to stop and that it’s only a game and laughed it out. They’re right because it was not worth fighting over a video game, but I’m so fed up from his personality. Not only in Smash, every game I’ve played with him.",technology
personalfinance,"Missed Payments on Credit History due to Student Loans, Goodwill Adjustment Possible? How to improve my credit score?","Background: So after I graduated college, I, like many others, had student loans to pay. However, I understood there was a grace period of 6 months after I graduate so I didn't worry about it. The background info is that I went to one college, transferred and delayed, worked for a year, then re-entered the new college with in-state tuition. The issue is that I had used my grace period during this year of working for my 1st school and deferred the loan payments at the time because I couldn't afford to pay back the loans with living expenses.

For 5 months, I relaxed about payments as I understood that I had a grace period. However, my previous loans apparently had activated their payments as soon as I graduated. So I had a balance. I immediately paid the balance off. Since then, I have been overpaying on my payments $400 against the required $297.38. I currently have $50,000 on my balance  to repay left.

&amp;#x200B;

The Issue: Sure, having a late payment on my credit score is justified. I am not here to get rid of it. However, since my loans were at various interest rates, there are 14 different loans at various interest rates. Meaning, I now have 14 late payments on my credit score, which tanked it. I got it up to 580 after paying off my balance and decreasing my school debt a bit with a lump sum.

I have taken steps to improve my score. I mentioned that I overpay my loans to decrease my debt. I also took out a secured credit card and I keep my utilization at 30% and pay my balance each month. I understand it will take time for me to rebuild my score, but I want to explore all avenues to improving it. It sucks that I made such a rudimentary mistake and that it will affect me for the next 7 years. Especially when I want to get an apartment, get a car loan, etc in the near future (1-2 years). 580 with one late payment isn't so bad versus 580 with 14 late payments when applying for a loan.

TLDR - Questions:

1. Do you think if I write a letter to my loan servicer (Navient) for goodwill adjustment they can combine the fourteen late payments marks on my credit history into just one since it's for the same type of debt? Is it even worth attempting it? If so, any tips for writing such a letter?
2. Are there any other avenues or things I should try to help improve my score and more quickly?

P.S. I have no other outstanding debt aside from school loans. I am budgeting well and cut out any frivolous spending.

EDIT: Reformatted and deleted some sections to shorten post length. Added Postscript.

EDIT 2: Fixed IBR Amount

gaming,"I hate ""Survival"" games","I've played Rust, ARK, Conan, Nether.. These ""Survival"" games where you craft your own pants, work for 8 hours building a humble little house and decide to go on an exciting adventure once you finish crafting your backpack or your first metal axe.

personalfinance,Advise on investment/personal finances strategy,"Hi all, I have been reading through various forums and doing lots of research on my own and wanted to post my long term investment plan here. I'm relatively confident about the sanity of it, but would like to post it here for some more input and advice where possible.

&amp;#x200B;

NOTES:

* I'm in Europe, so some things may not be relevant for US users, where I possible I have tried to indicate differences.
* The numbers in this post are approximate, I've calculated everything with a reasonable margin

&amp;#x200B;

Bit of a backstory on my current situation: I recently finished building a house with my now ex-girlfriend. I had to buy her out her part, so while I do have assets, at the moment I have very little liquidity. My personal assets are currently this:

* Liquidity: 10K
* Apartment valued at 120K, rented out with a mortgage of 80K (16y left to pay) at 2% interest rate. Rent covers mortgage exactly
* House valued at 500K with a mortgage of 247.5K (30y left to pay) at 2.5% interest rate. Monthly rate is 1K
* I earn quite well at around 120K a year (70K after taxes), so around 6K a month.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I realize I'm very much over invested in real estate and I'd like to start diversifying a bit.

On the house, I have the option to take out an extra 10% on the mortgage (27.5K), which would raise the monthly rate to 1.1K.

&amp;#x200B;

My plan is the following:

* Keep both the house and the apartment. The house is partially an investment, but also a dream of me. The apartment is essentially paying for itself because of the rent covering the mortgage.
* Build up another 10K in liquid assets / savings account to cover for a 6 month period of costs and expenses
* Take out the 27.5K and invest it in index funds (type Vanguard, with low comissions and balanced over world, US and europe assets, balanced more towards bonds for additional stability). From what I calculated this should yield more than the 2.5% I need to pay extra on the mortgage.
* Max out my pension saving (I'm in europe, so that's the equivalent of a 401K in the US), which would total around 8K per year
* Add an additional 12K per year to the index funds investment, spread out over 12 months
* Spend additional funds on improving value of house (both for investment as well as personal comfort)

&amp;#x200B;

On a monthly basis that would look like this

6K income

* 750 towards pension fund (think 401K)
* 1.1K towards mortgage
* 1K towards index funds
* 1.5K fixed costs (utilities)
* 1K house improvements
* The 650 left over is extra spending money to whatever I want to do :-)

&amp;#x200B;

Does that sound like a reasonable plan? Any ideas or suggestions on how to improve that strategy?

personalfinance,Recent graduate in need of job advice,"I having a hard time finding a job, I realize many are in the same boat but it's really starting to get to me. I graduated in December 2018 and only started looking for employment beginning in January due to a slight career shift. Most of the ideal careers I'm looking at are with the federal government or with the city and both of those take a long-time to process (1-2 years, city is a bit quicker but have limited positions that open infrequently for my field).

I'm looking for immediate work and am having an incredibly hard time. Like I said I've been applying since January, both for career oriented positions and just some full-time low pay gigs so I can pocket some money. I'm not getting any responses. I've applied to grocers, food service, contractors, rest-stops, anything local basically. I graduated with honors in Criminal Justice and have a diverse background in food service, construction, security, and office environment experience.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, is there anything that I can start now that can net me ok pay? Something like uber or lyft? (can't do either because my car is too old). Or is there a position is that isn't degree specific but hires recent graduates? I'm running out of ideas and sitting by the phone hoping for some call-backs, but in the meantime I thought I should at least make sure I'm not missing anything. Thanks.

It looks to me like a lot of people are using online banks for their 2%+ interest rates, which is nice.

Since we're talking about money that may not be needed right away (hopefully never), what about putting the money into a CD ladder?  One of my credit unions has a 1-years CD at 2.28% (2.3 apy).  I was thinking, instead of opening a new account with an online bank, maybe I'd just create a monthly CD for one or two thousand bucks, and let them roll over year after year.  Based on the CU's paperwork, if I withdrawl the money from the CD, I lose up to 6 months of interest, which sucks, but if it's an emergency, I can't see a huge problem.

I've only been living in my house for a few months and interest rates were pretty high at the time of the purchase. If they ever do get substantially lower, is it worth refinancing ever?

personalfinance,Map Us A Way Out,"6 months ago, My wife and I bought a house we bought or $350k with over 20% down, and a 3.50 interest rate 30 yr mortgage. We chose this because it wa s simply the only option for us financially that gave us a monthly mortgage we could afford. not because we plan to stay there for 30 years. Long story short, we are both originally from NJ, and ending up going to school and working in Philaelphia where we met. We spend alot of time driving back and fourth from philadelphia to new jersey to be with our family.  Our monthly payments are $1700, combined monthly income is $2500.  The area itself has not been as advertised. There has been some buyers regret. It is simply not safe, especially For children. (We do not yet have any) 

We do not plan on living in our current state for 10 years, let alone 30.  We want To eventually raise our children in NJ, closer to our families and what would be our childs grandparents. We want to do as much as we can now with the goal of moving to NJ 7-10 years from now. We would be looking to buy something in the $250-300k range when we move from here. We are afraid of not having the money to do so. So much of the money we pay each much is purely interest. And considering this is our first home, we are really limited in knowledge on selling houses before the mortgages are paid off, etc. 

Can anyone more knowledable and experienced provide us a potential road map to where we hope to be? Should we be looking to pay the mortgage down as quickly as possible with our modest excess funds each month? What mortgage payment and savings/investing strategy would put us in the best position to sell in 10 years or so? We would love to someday pay off our house completely and truly own it. We have 35K total in savings that we are waiting to decide on what to do with, in terms of what to invest, what to keep for emergency. 

Household income is 60k before taxes, we have 750 credit scores. 90k was already paid off that we put down in cash at sale. Thanks so much for reading. 🙏

Update: thanks for all the replies! So far most seem to want us out of the house immediately, and most of the advice is centering around that. Unfortunately that just isn’t something we can do for several reasons. We are looking at this more long term, to move when we are ready to raise children.

personalfinance,What to do with this extra cash,"I just got a new job that came with a $650/ month pay increase and an $8k sign on bonus. I was living comfortably before, so I’d really like to invest this excess cash wisely. 

I’m struggling between the idea of hyper focusing on paying off my student loans or saving up to buy a house. 

I have $3,200 left on one student loan. I’m going to pay this off ASAP since I’m so close. Which will also free up another $180 a month. 

I have a second student  of $37k with 6% interest rate. If I continue paying the minimum, it would take another 20+ years to pay off.  If I took all excess cash (and the bonus) and threw it at this loan I could have it paid off in under 3 years. By my rough calculations if I tried to save for a house first it would take me roughly 8 more years to pay this off.  Paying off this loan in 3 years instead of 8 would save roughly $5-6k in interest. 

Paying off student loans definitely has huge gains, but the part that gets tricky is the housing scenario is difficult to predict.  If I wait to start saving for a house until after my loans are paid off, then the cost of houses could increase far more than the $5-6k I saved in interest. Or the housing market could crash and I could get a good deal later. You just can really predict that. However, I live in an area that is booming with several major corporations making their way into town over the next several years,  Experts predict the housing market to stay on the upward trend for a while. 

Please note these calculations are rough estimates as I’m just trying to get a high level overview. I’m also not an accountant. I just need help deciding, house first or loan first? 



EDIT:
Breakdown of monthly budget:
All housing bills: $800. I live with a roommate so internet, electricity, etc are all rolled up into this. 
Phone: $50
Groceries: ~$180
Car payment: $253 with 2.85% interest and 2 years left
Car insurance: $97

stocks,Ladybaybee picks for 2019-03-11,"[Link to imgur](https://imgur.com/a/3OpJiMG)

You can follow my picks on twitter @ladybaybee1

**HOW I USE THIS:** 

1) All the stocks identified in the table are qualified as “BUY” opportunities.

2) I focus in the column “Success Rate(3m)” which shows the precision of the agents in the last 3 calendar months. I personally feel most comfortable with Rates 0.8 or higher. 

3) Then, I see the number in “Tx(3m)” which represents the number of transactions that the agents predicted for this stock in the last 3 months. I prefer stocks that have had at least two transactions during this period. 

4) Finally, I look at Growth(3m), if the agents have had a considerable growth (&gt;5% in 3 months) then I follow that trade. 

5) If a row in the table is colored green then it means that stock has been on the rise today so I purchase it immediately in order to ride the wave up. On the other hand, if the row is colored red, then I wait out until very close to market close to purchase the stock and let the price bottom out before climbing up again tomorrow.


6) After I purchase the stocks, I ALWAYS set a stop loss order at -2.5% from my buying price valid for the day. I think this is good hygiene, no matter how confident I am of my system, I still want to make sure that my losses are capped. I update this stop loss order every day. 


**BACKGROUND**

I am not a financier or economist. I am electrical engineer with equal passion in artificial intelligence and financial markets. For the past 2 years I have been working on a system that would make short term predictions of stocks. The system is rather complex, I use multiple layers which include: Convolutional Neural Networks, LSTMs and Genetic Algorithms. All bulked together produce an output like in this image. The way to interpret the image is a follows: Symbol and Date columns are self explanatory, Quorum refers to autonomous agents that decide whether to BUY/NOT BUY or SELL/HOLD a stock. Each symbol has 9 agents, and the Quorum column, counts the number of agents that recommend Buy, Selling or Holding the stock. The “Not Owned” column means: if you don’t own this stock then you should … The “Owned” column means: if you own this stock you should HOLD or SELL. The column “Growth(1 Year)” refers to what what has been the growth of this system of Agents in the past calendar year. The column “Tx(1Yr)” shows the number of full transactions that these agents recommended in the last calendar year. “Factor” is just the division of Growth divided by Transactions to get the average growth per transaction. Finally “Success Rate” shows how successful these agents have been in their recommendations in the past calendar year, success 1 means 100% successful, 0.5 means 50% successful, and so on.

Many people have been curious about the actual process that the system follows, so here it is: for every symbol (600 stocks are analyzed daily), we get the full stock data (open,close,high,low,volume) for the past 4 months. Each stock is associated with another set of “lookalike” stocks as well as major ETF’s. This initial dataset is run through a convolutional layer that extracts an undisclosed number of features. These features are then passed onto a recurrent neural network (LSTM) where sequences and patterns are extracted. The LSTM then spits out probabilities for the likelihood that this stock will have a positive, negative and neutral tendency in the next N days. These probabilities are then fed to a genetic evolution system (GES). This system essentially checks the predictions for the past N days and compares them with reality, following that the systems knows which predictions are performing the best. Once the system knows which stocks are being simulated the best, then the system automatically finds which of these best performing stocks have the biggest potential for the next few days. The system does not output explanations, unfortunately us humans are not capable of understanding (or visualizing) a problem of this dimensionality, for example the LSTM part alone works with over 10 million dimensions, not features but dimensions.",finance

personalfinance,Large Jump in income plus Investment Property,"Hi all!  I am looking for advice.  I have basically gone through a huge jump in income.  From about 100k to 200k.  This jump has caused me to move to the midwest.  My house back in my old city we had just bought (about 2 years ago now) and it is a 2 unit property so we had a renter in the apartment and now also we have a renter in the house.  When we bought it we put down 11%.  Our interest Rate is  4.125%  for reference. After principal, interest, taxes, and insurance...our monthly bill is 1500.  Rent Income for apartment and House is about 1900 after the property management company cut.  So technically it gains 400 a month but then taxes will be taken out and sometimes one of the units is not rented...so that has led to situations where we are closer to breaking even overall.    


The situation is we want to buy another house next year.  We are trying to figure out how to apply that extra increase in money.   I already max out my 401k, ira, hsa, etc.  So we just have extra cash to save up for another down payment.  The question is, what is the better option?  Is it better to have more towards a new down payment on my next house or is it better to send it towards my old house so we can get rid of mortgage insurance plus apply towards principal? The loan is definitely interest heavy in the front so I am thinking I can throw a nice amount at the loan principal and it would help.  We have about 90k between the different checking and savings accounts.  By this time next year I expect us to be closer to 115-155k (yeah pretty big variable but having a kid soon so no idea how much to budget for a kid yet).   We are thinking 300k for our next house leaving us with a 60k downpayment plus 8k in closing costs.  Putting us at 68k needed.  We will also want to keep a decent amount in savings.  So I am not sure about doing the mortgage insurance reduction and a down payment.    


Financially speaking, it seems like throwing the extra cash towards the old house loan is the smart answer.  That would reduce our overall interest paid plus get rid of mortgage insurance.  But then we are stuck renting.  Our current rent is 1800 a month and so it also makes sense to buy a house to reduce that. We could also sell our rentals but I think that would probably be a loss considering we've mostly paid interest on the loan plus repairs plus closing costs.    


So any advice on what is the best option?  Maybe there is a happy medium?",finance

What amount should I realistically be paying on my Federal student loans? How and where do you all cut costs? Advice on securing additional income?  I have bad habits of casually eating out or grabbing beers, and am generous with my expendable income.

&amp;#x200B;

Note: The reason I'm putting an emphasis on my Federal Loans is the minimum payment I am making isn't enough to keep the principal from ballooning. The private loan, owned by my Dad, is lower interest and (morbidly) is gone when he passes away.

It’s a small real estate developer business of 3 partners, CFO, and myself. They’re all very nice and welcoming people to work for and while they’re all very busy I am generally stuck doing nothing. I apparently got hired in between projects, so for the last 8 months I just organize mail, order supplies, handle the monthly operation invoices and that’s pretty much it. I’ve asked for additional work and they admitted to not really having anything that I could work on.

While I feel it’s a great payout for what I’m doing, I feel like my work is stagnant and there’s really no way for me to justify a higher salary for what I’m doing. They’ve stated at my 1 year of employment I would receive an evaluation and potential raise. I have no idea how much the raise could be.  

I also commute 1.5-2hrs from traffic each direction and it’s taking a toll on me even though it’s 10 miles from my house. I am working towards becoming a CPA also and the CFO at my organization is not licensed and would not be eligible to sponsor me. 

TLDR;

Main cause for this post. I’ve begun to see new job postings offering $27-$29 with similar benefits requiring 1/yr experience closer to where I live that I believe I am a good candidate for. However, I’m not sure if I should at bare minimum stay at this company until a year to find out what kind of raise they have to offer before I take up the next available job opportunity?

After I graduated, I decided to keep them going for a while and make monthly payments because I had no credit history and wanted to up my credit score. I got a bit of inherence so I could have paid them off but it would have been a good chunk of my savings - I have much more now because I’ve been saving $900-$700 a month for 4 years. My credit score is now 797. Not sure if I want to close out all my student loan accounts because I still don’t have much of a credit history besides credit cards (no car loans, mortgage, etc...).



I’m thinking to pay off completely the biggest loan which also has the highest interest rate with my money in my savings account. Really, it’s just bugging me how much goes towards interest. My plan is to pay it off and use the extra monthly money to up my 403b contributions a bit and put a bit in savings. 



Is this a wise way to use my money? Any other financial advice is welcome! Thank you.",finance

personalfinance,Non Title IV School Student Loan Refi Options?,"I'm a little baffled. I graduated from a college that was not a Title IV school. I fell into the old Sallie Mae hell hole as I'm sure most of you have read the horror stories. My Sallie Mae loan was then bought out by Navient and that is where I'm at now. 

So today I checked out a whole bunch of refi lenders and none of them will touch a student loan that was paid to a non Title IV school. I mean one of my interest rates are over 15%! So after exhausting all of my student refi options I figured let me see what taking a personal loan can do for me. I called up SoFi and the long story short is that I can not take out a personal loan to pay off a student loan debt.  I'm trying to put feelers out if anyone was in a similar situation to this and if there is an out or do I need to just grind it out and pay this thing down? Just wanted to mention that I do not have any kind of equity I can put up for a loan.

personalfinance,Where to keep money at age 70+ when you don't have much?,"My boyfriend's mother is retired and is currently living off of a combination of social security and pension payments. She receives \~$1,500 per month combined, and does not spend all of what she receives each month. However, she does not have any other retirement or investment accounts, and her total savings outside of the monthly payments is only $70K, which until now she has kept in an assortment of regular checking and savings accounts earning little to no interest. She has recently combined all the amounts together in a single savings account, but still one that earns basically nothing.

Another family member has started trying to sell her life insurance as a better investment for her savings (I'm not sure of the exact details, but probably whole life of some variety) and she is really interested, but my boyfriend and I are very skeptical that this might not be the best move for her. Fortunately she does not have any debts, no mortgage, no spouse, and no other children or dependents besides my boyfriend and her own mother (whose care is supported across five adult children and does not rely on financial contributions from my boyfriend's mother). My boyfriend has his own savings and no longer relies on her financially in any regard. She does not have any expensive wishes or expectations in terms of after-death expenses (funeral, etc). Given that, it seems that she doesn't really need life insurance for the insurance purpose of it at least.

We've been encouraging her to move the bulk of her savings into a high yield online savings account for now so that at least she is earning a decent interest rate as far as regular savings accounts go as opposed to basically nothing. Is there merit to considering the life insurance option? Should we instead be looking at investing 30% of her savings in index funds or bonds or a combo (at Vanguard, for example)? Something else we've missed? Or a combination of options? 

She is very frugal so I don't see her expenses increasing unless/until her health deteriorates (currently great health, fully independent), so my biggest concern is affording good care for her when/if the need arises and only having $70K to work with since my boyfriend and I are not currently in a position to provide much additional financial support. We need the funds to be accessible in case something does come up, so some measure of liquidity is important. Given how little she has, we certainly don't want to take big risks but I'm not sure she can afford to take no risks either. Any suggestions or guidance would be appreciated!",finance

gaming,My pitch for an assassin's Creed game set during the American civil war,"When the war starts both the Templars and assassins don't want to get involved. But eventually the assassins and the Templars in the south decide to team up to win the civil war they call their faction the Homeland. In the North the Templars and assassins do the same thing think all their faction the United. In the game you play as the United.

There are three playable characters two assassins in and one Templar. One assassin is a guy from West Virginia he was a member of the assassins before the civil war I felt the assassin's weren't doing enough so he joined the Union army then he saw members of the United fighting the Confederacy at the Battle of Vicksburg and decide to join the group. The next assassin is a female assassin from Europe in her old country she with fought the assassins in a failed pro-democracy or anarchist revolution but she believes and what the Union and United are fighting for and move to America to join the cause. She is a pyromaniac Love's using explosives and gadgets. The last one is a Templar who is a former Boston police detective when he was a detective he was able do solve a murder that was committed by an assassin the Templars were so impressed that they made him a member of the organization.

The game will have three main locations the Battle of Vicksburg, Union occupied New Orleans, and Richmond the capital of the Confederacy. The Battle of Vicksburg has become a stalemate with trench warfare with occasional skirmishes if the union and Confederacy trying to break each other's line missions in location what about trying to sabotage the Confederates by sneaking behind their lines freeing Union prisoners of war, blowing up magazines, and assassinating officers. The next one is Union occupied New Orleans and this one you help the union occupation hunt down pro-confederate insurgence in the city I think this will be a change of pace because there aren't many assassin's Creed games are you fight with the occupying Force. Also Richmond where you work to sabotage the Confederacy from which in by starting riots, helping escaped slaves, and assassinating politicians.

In the plot of the game the Homeland have discovered undersea first civilization ruins off the coast of the South and plan to build a submarine to reach them. The United try to stop them but fail. The Homeland have retrieved several weapons from the ruins the former assassin's within the Homeland ship the weapons to Nashville to defend it from the imminent Union attack. When the United get there it looks too late the leader of the assassins within the Homeland Ames is first civilization weapon at the Union forces is there about to charge the Confederate lines but he is killed when he is shot by the Union. Showing the twist about the Templars in the Homeland betrayed their assassin allies they replaced first civilization artifacts with fakes and took the real ones and fled to Europe. It turns out they're really members of a cult that worships Juno they called their organization the crooked cross a reference to how Juno's constellation in the night sky is crooked. In Europe they eventually go on to form the Nazis their motivation in this is to purge workers they as unpure so Juno all have a perfect workforce to rule over. The surviving southern assassins go on to form the ku Klux Klan. The United continue as an organization for a while combined their efforts they are able to turn the United States as a superpower but the assassin's within the organization are eventually Purge during one of the red scares.

The modern-day storyline is about a teenage brother and sister who live in New Orleans and our best friends and like playing abstergo video games together they're playing the game together and make jokes and commentary on the events of the game while you're playing.the version of the game they're playing is called the Templars code instead of assassin's Creed because the game is made by abstergo industries which of course is run by the Templars so the assassins were edited out and the Templar former police officer was supposed to be the only hero of the game but because of the bleeding effect both the brother and sister are descended from the two assassins in the game it ends up adding new content for them.

As the game goes on you see the bleeding effect starting to affect them they both start to get eagle vision and some of the assassin skills one of them realizes they have eagle vision when they lose their phone and they get eagle vision and are able to see where it is under the covers on their bed. It turns out the game having the side effect of the bleeding effect was created to be intentional by abstergo industries they wanted to be able to detect if there was any descendants to the assassins in the Templars that they haven't been able to find yet so they designed the game system to steal their memories and put it into the game so abstergo will be able to learn more about the conflicts between assassins and Templars so they would be able to find more first civilization artifacts.

Eventually the brother and sister are kidnapped by abstergo industries and are taking to an oil platform off the coast of Louisiana the platform being used for oil is a cover story it was really built so abstergo could look for the first civilization ruins at the Homeland discovered during the civil war. They hook you up to a more advanced version of the Animus tell hope you will see a way to open a door not that abstergo hasn't been able to get through in the ruins yet. Animas the brother and sister get to the end of the civil war story and find out the artifacts aren't in the ruins anymore they know the Templars won't be happy and are able to use their new skills they got from the bleeding effect then are able to escape the oil platform and go on the run from abstergo. That is my rough draft of the idea sorry it is so long. What do you think?",technology
personalfinance,CD or money market,I'm setting aside some money for a down payment.  I expect to buy a house in about 14-15 months.  Is there any realistic risk in putting it in a Vanguard money market fund over a 12 mo CD at my bank.  The interest rates are essentially the same and all things being equal I'd rather have the flexibility to pull the money out earlier as long as there's  no realistic risk of putting the principle at risk.,finance
personalfinance,Question on best path for my situation,"Little background.  I am engaged and am looking to buy a house within the next year or so.  I am also weeks away from graduating law school.  I currently have 160K in student loans.  In total I have about 80k in savings, not including the money i will use to live on for the next 6 months or so.  my dad also passed away about a year ago and as a result, my and my siblings will be inheriting about 150k each once everything is handled.  My loans have interest rates at about 5-7%.  

Now my question is what is my best avenue.  Keep in mind my goal is to set up for the future the best i can while protecting my future wife.  I currently have to ideas on how to move forward.  First is pay off all my debt and put a down payment on a house. the upside is that the interest is not kill me on the loans compared to the current mortgage.  the second option is pay for a house cash and pay my loans down moving forward, perhaps with a income based repayment plan.  I like that because in that instance, if something were to happen to me my house would be hers and the debt is wiped away.  

Im really struggling with all of this and what is best.  Any and all advise is more than welcome including payment plans for the loans.  Thanks all!",finance
personalfinance,Question about percentage of credit used and when to pay a charge.,"I have an overpayment from Social Security that I'm paying back. After some squabbling, it's down to the $10,000 I think I owe them and I have their money tucked away because I knew they'd ask for it back. I had planned to pay them back in monthly installments, but was offered a position with the Federal Government so I decided to start paying it down faster.

Today I discovered they take credit cards at the office. I still owe $9300. My card has a $10,800 limit. I swiped my card to pay off $5000 of the overpayment.  The charge happened today so it's still pending. Lately my average monthly bull has been $700-1,000. If I pay the $5000 off now, instead of waiting for the end of my statement, does it affect my credit usage? I'm thinking it won't but I'm not certain. 

Even if it does, paying by card was easier than any other form and I get reward points.",finance
Bitcoin,Should Coinbase's next acquisition be some kind of state or federally chartered bank?,"It seems like Coinbase could be well-equipped to re-invent banking and by attaching itself to the current banking system it might be able to protect itself as a going concern.. advertising itself as a 100%+ fully-reserved bank, it could do this with a stable-coin, vanilla CD products... fully transparent banking where customers know what the bank is doing with their money at all times... Obviously, competing with fractional reserve banks would be tough because they have a significantly lower cost of capital, but it seems like there are still be projects out there that need to borrow at higher costs of capital, and perhaps conventional banks won't play in that space",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Do interest rates affect credit scores?,"I have three student loans and could afford to pay them in full when it’s time for me to pay them. But I’m wondering if instead, I should pay two of my student loans in full, and keep one to pay on monthly and build credit. If the interest rate on the loan does not impact how quickly I build credit, I’d just pay them all off in full and continue to pay monthly on my car payments and credit card (with lower interest rates). 


What should I do?

personalfinance,Relocated to teach in Phoenix and I'm starting to drown.,"I (38/M) recently relocated to Phoenix from NYC a few months after graduating with my Master's degree in education (general and special education grades 1-6) in 2018. I've lived in NYC all my life and wanted to try something different. Prior to this, most of my work experience has been in education/residential care field.

In planning for such a big transition of lifestyle/environment, I did my homework and researched to determine the income I would need to financially get by as a single guy with no dependents. I figured that 45k would be a really modest start as the cost of living would be much less than back home in NYC.

I found a full time teaching position pretty quickly but it involved agreeing to a lower salary (41k) with that being the max I could make as a new teacher with no classroom experience. I thought that tightening my belt for a couple of months would be tough but necessary because of my inexperience. I signed a 6 month contract but what I didn't account for (Our was told about until my second paycheck) was Arizona's retirement system taking out 12% every single paycheck. This mandatory deduction is more than my federal and state tax deductions combined!

Now what I thought would be a small compromise, has now evolved to me barely living check to check and having to go into my savings monthly to make ends meet. I'm making considerably less than what I thought I'd be making. Teaching has its moments but overall, I can't financially survive on the smiles of my students.

Monthly bill breakdown
Rent+utilities+WiFi+phone - $1020
Car note+ insurance - $400
College loans+repaying credit cards - everything else

My current contract expires in May 2019 but soon I have to let my school know if I plan to return for another year. If I choose to return, I would be contractually obligated to stay because leaving would have my teaching license revoked. I have no idea of where to do next. Any advice/options/suggestions on what steps to take next would be highly appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,What are some low risk investing options?,"I have suddenly started making some money after university and am debt free at 23. 

I currently have most of my money in a month to month savings account, which has about a 0.2% interest rate each month.

I also put about 200 bucks each month into that account, after paying for all of my needs.

I however feel that I could make a better long term decision by moving some of that money into other investing strategies that may pay a little more.

I am working full time, so I do not need the money right now, but the idea is security over gains, because I do not know what my situation will be in a couple of months.

What options do I have to put my money to good use, with minimum fear of loosing my savings?",finance

gaming,I completely underestimated Skyrim (Some Story Spoilers),"Hi, long time lurker, first time poster.

&amp;#x200B;

So, because I missed the last gen of gaming almost completely, I didn't pick up Skyrim until rather recently. For the longest time, I didn't particularly care to pick it up either. One of the reasons I didn't pick it up was that I played Dark Souls first; trying to adapt to Skyrim combat and being forced fed story simply seemed like it wouldn't go well. And at first it didn't, but I reworked my mindset and put that aside so I could enjoy the story and quests more.

&amp;#x200B;

But what I didn't expect was for Skyrim to ellicit an emotional response. Yesterday I cleared ""Escape from Cindha Mines"" for the first time. I completely understood Madanach and the Forsworn. But that was hardly anything compared to clearing ""Battle for Whiterun"". I felt sad when I realised Jarl Balgruuf had declined to join the Stormcloaks, and even worse when I defeated him. This was the man that took a chance on a stranger to help fight the dragons, to declare me a thane. Hell, I still have Lydia as my companion (I'll probably replace her when I can, because damn she gets annoying). I looked upon what the Stormcloaks had done to the small city I was ever so fond off.

&amp;#x200B;

I underestimated Skyrim in many ways. The combat doesn't hold up to Souls standards, not by a long shot, but that's fine. It's its own thing. Sure, characters come across much more one dimensional, combat isn't as good. But by god, as much as I love the story of the Souls games, no particular moment in any of them really hit me in the same way listening to Balgruuf lament the state of affairs ever did.

&amp;#x200B;

God dammit Todd Howard, I thought I wasn't supposed to like Bethesda at the moment, now this!

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for hearing my little ramble. To any younger people that weren't around when this game first came out or people my own age that simply missed the last gen of gaming and are only now catching up; do pick up Skyrim. 10 or so years on and it still has a little charm to it.",technology

There are currently five 737 MAX aircraft registered and operational in the United Kingdom. A sixth is planned to commence operations later this week.

The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is responsible for certifying all Boeing 737 MAX  models and it is the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) that validates this certification across the EU, including the UK.

personalfinance,State Tax Form for a State I neither Live in nor Work in,"I work in New Jersey and I live in New Jersey. However, the address that my job has listed for me is my parent's place in New York (as this was my address when I was looking for the job). I am currently renting a place in New Jersey, but I've been lazy about fixing my address listing for my job (but even then, my paychecks get directly wired to my bank). All my bank information is keyed to my NJ address and I have an NJ driver's license (which was issued in January 2018, if that's relevant).

My W2 however includes sections for both NY and NJ, and when I went to file my taxes online the place I used generated a State form for both; the result is a pretty big tax owed to NY which is cutting away almost all of my federal return. But it seems that this is just because of the address that my job has listed. There is also no number listed in box 17 (State Income Tax) of the NY statement, despite this being filled for the Federal and NJ statements.

This probably also factors in, but box 16 (State Wages) is split like 80/20 in favor of NY; as in of my total yearly wages, 80% are listed in the NY statement and 20% are listed in the NJ statement. I'm not sure how this breakdown could have happened at all.

I figure I probably shouldn't just not file my NY return, but is there something I can do about this? Would this be more an issue on my employer's side or on the state/federal side? Is this whole thing just an issue of my using a tax filer that imports directly from my W2, and can be easily dealt with by just filing it manually?",finance
personalfinance,Student Loans- RePAYE,"Me and my wife just got married in October of 2018. My wife currently has $120,000 or so in student loans from her master's program that she completed at the end 2016. She is currently enrolled in the PSLF program with fedloans and has 8-1/2 more years of qualifying payments. I have $35,000 in student loans, which I just refinanced last year and have 9 more years on (with minimum payments.) She makes $40,000/year and I make $70,000. We are both in our early 30's

My question is- we were intending on filing our taxes as married filing separately to keep her income based payments low ($110/month). It turns out she is on RePAYE and they count both of our incomes towards calculating the monthly payment regardless of our tax filing status (is this correct?) What options do we have to keep her monthly payment as low as possible, or are we stuck and just have to bite the bullet for the next 8 years?",finance
stocks,Ladybaybee recommended stock picks 2019-03-12,"[Link to imgur](https://imgur.com/a/GBtXNbV)

**HOW I USE THIS:** 

1) All the stocks identified in the table are qualified as “BUY” opportunities.

2) I focus in the column “Success Rate(3m)” which shows the precision of the agents in the last 3 calendar months. I personally feel most comfortable with Rates 0.8 or higher. 

3) Then, I see the number in “Tx(3m)” which represents the number of transactions that the agents predicted for this stock in the last 3 months. I prefer stocks that have had at least two transactions during this period. 

4) Finally, I look at Growth(3m), if the agents have had a considerable growth (&gt;5% in 3 months) then I follow that trade. 

5) If a row in the table is colored green then it means that stock has been on the rise today so I purchase it immediately in order to ride the wave up. On the other hand, if the row is colored red, then I wait out until very close to market close to purchase the stock and let the price bottom out before climbing up again tomorrow.


6) After I purchase the stocks, I ALWAYS set a stop loss order at -2.5% from my buying price valid for the day. I think this is good hygiene, no matter how confident I am of my system, I still want to make sure that my losses are capped. I update this stop loss order every day. 


**BACKGROUND**

I am not a financier or economist. I am electrical engineer with equal passion in artificial intelligence and financial markets. For the past 2 years I have been working on a system that would make short term predictions of stocks. The system is rather complex, I use multiple layers which include: Convolutional Neural Networks, LSTMs and Genetic Algorithms. All bulked together produce an output like in this image. The way to interpret the image is a follows: Symbol and Date columns are self explanatory, Quorum refers to autonomous agents that decide whether to BUY/NOT BUY or SELL/HOLD a stock. Each symbol has 9 agents, and the Quorum column, counts the number of agents that recommend Buy, Selling or Holding the stock. The “Not Owned” column means: if you don’t own this stock then you should … The “Owned” column means: if you own this stock you should HOLD or SELL. The column “Growth(1 Year)” refers to what what has been the growth of this system of Agents in the past calendar year. The column “Tx(1Yr)” shows the number of full transactions that these agents recommended in the last calendar year. “Factor” is just the division of Growth divided by Transactions to get the average growth per transaction. Finally “Success Rate” shows how successful these agents have been in their recommendations in the past calendar year, success 1 means 100% successful, 0.5 means 50% successful, and so on.

Many people have been curious about the actual process that the system follows, so here it is: for every symbol (600 stocks are analyzed daily), we get the full stock data (open,close,high,low,volume) for the past 4 months. Each stock is associated with another set of “lookalike” stocks as well as major ETF’s. This initial dataset is run through a convolutional layer that extracts an undisclosed number of features. These features are then passed onto a recurrent neural network (LSTM) where sequences and patterns are extracted. The LSTM then spits out probabilities for the likelihood that this stock will have a positive, negative and neutral tendency in the next N days. These probabilities are then fed to a genetic evolution system (GES). This system essentially checks the predictions for the past N days and compares them with reality, following that the systems knows which predictions are performing the best. Once the system knows which stocks are being simulated the best, then the system automatically finds which of these best performing stocks have the biggest potential for the next few days. The system does not output explanations, unfortunately us humans are not capable of understanding (or visualizing) a problem of this dimensionality, for example the LSTM part alone works with over 10 million dimensions, not features but dimensions.

personalfinance,Pay off mortgage? Buy the house next door? Expand our own house,"The house next door is about to come on the market, but we are almost finished with plans for an expansion of our house.

* I’m 34, she is 38. 
* **CASHFLOW -** Total HH income ranges from $700-$800k. We currently operate at about $2600 positive cash flow per month after all bills paid and investment accounts contributed to.
* **CASH ON HAND -** $650K in a Marcus MM account. Recently boosted by some heavy bonuses.
* **DEBT -** We have two car loans outstanding, need approx $40k to pay them off, but in my eyes it's a low priority as the car loans are at 1.5%. We have $775k mortgage outstanding. A 7/1 ARM, 3.75% now, rate starts increasing in Jan 2022.
* **INVESTMENTS -** We have about $500K across retirement and brokerage accounts.
* **KIDS** \- We have two kids (1 and 3). They both have Custodial UTMA accounts with about $15k each. They both have 529 accounts with about $25k each with modest monthly contributions.
* **RISK** \- We have a tolerance for risk. 

We see that we have a few options:

**Pay off our house in 12 months**

1. We bought two years ago have a $775k mortgage, a 7/1ARM at 3.75%. The adjustable rate starts increasing in Jan 2024.
2. I was planning on putting $50-100k a year into this mortgage to get it down to a less crazy size when the adjustable rate starts going….or I could just pay it down heavily now and then finish paying it off in Feb 2020 with the next round of bonuses.
3. As much as I hate paying so much interest I feel we could wait to pay this off until 2024. People tell this is the sensible approach to get to debt free but I don’t feel the financial urgency to do this.

**Buy house next door as guest house and develop it in 5 years**

1. We live in the very strong (but potentially overheated) market of Austin TX so are wary of current valuations, however there aren’t many opportunities to buy your neighbor and basically double your lot size. The owner next door has approached me as he is thinking about selling now or developing the property himself.
2. The house comes with plans and builder estimates for a very modern 3/3 house. The house is a 3/2 mid century modern house but needs probably $30k to get it ready for short term renting. Our neighborhood has a booming STR market due to it being walking distance to downtown. Property taxes would be about $17k a year and we estimate it could make $25k - 35k a year from STR (for the week of SXSW festival the house could rent for $900/night easily).
3. Our thought is to buy this property, short term rent it and use it as a guest house for visiting family from abroad...and then in 5-10 years when we make a planned move to the UK we use the proceeds from selling our existing house (likely $1.4M or so) to finance the new build.
4. Our cost basis for the house would be approx $2.3M (Current Land cost is $800k. Builder estimate is $1.5M.) Owner projects a sales value of $3M post development. There are comps nearby going for $2.5M. So in 5-10 years we hope we can sell for $3M+ and net a nice little windfall. This would mean we couldn’t do much work to our existing house, which is a little cramped with 2 kids and family visiting from abroad.

**Develop our own home, expanding it**

1. We could spend $600k in cash on a conversion/expansion of our garage to two kids rooms + bathroom, as well as adding a large pool and an 1bed/1bath ADU perched on the back of our property would take our property from a 2bed/2bath up to a 5 bed 4 bath (including ADU). This would give our kids their own spaces and make the house a space visiting family actually enjoy coming to for extended periods, cementing the grandparent-grandchild bond.
2. I believe this expansion would would likely add about 600k in current value (taking us from $1.1M to $1.7M) although could be more as Austin’s real estate market has bene increasing 5-10% in recent years... and there are some recent precedents near us over $2M.
3. We could simply pay cash for this work, or pay some cash and some in loan, freeing up cash for other things. We have been quoted for a construction loan at 5.25% for $400k, interest rate starts rising after 3 years.
4. If the real estate market tumbles then the project is a wash or worse and home improvements mean my TX property taxes will increase from $22k to probably $28k+. This would add a lot of joy to the family but also heavily disrupt us with ongoing construction.

Thoughts on approach here? As we are already down the path of expanding our home we are leaning towards this path.",finance

I filed my taxes using turbo tax at the start of Feb this year. Everything went fine as usual, and was to receive a federal refund for around 1800 dollars.

I contacted the number for BFS and they told me that my refund was sold off to a debt agency because of my unpaid child support. The kicker is that i do not have a child. I dont have any garnished wages in my paycheck and I checked my credit monitoring and everything is fine there.  I am not sure what is the best route to try and get this resolved.

personalfinance,Runaround Perkins Loan,"So about a year ago I decided it was time to take control of my credit and finances.  I knew that I wanted to try and buy a home in 2019 and my credit at the time wasn't doing me any favors.  I have a Perkins loan that's being run through Heartland ECSI and the financial contact at the school advised that I call them and set up a loan rehab program that would erase my past missed payments from my credit score. I called, made a payment and set everything up in April 2018, with the rehab ending in December 2018.

My fault for not following up or paying close attention but the automated recurring payments weren't coming out.  I called again in July to set it up all over again.  First payment came out on August 1 and things were set to run for another 9 months with the loan rehab.

September 1 and 2 go by with no payment coming out for the loan.  I call ECSI and they tell me something was set up wrong on their end and that it was fixed now.  My next payment would come out on September 11th and would continue to come out on that date each month. No harm no foul.

October rolls around and nothing comes out on the 11th.  I call and again they say sorry, someone set everything up incorrectly, but now it's fixed.  They tell me my next payment will come out November 11.  I ask if I can make a payment right then to prevent the rehab program from having to start over and he says no, you won't be penalized for this month because it was our fault.

November 11 the payment actually comes out and things look good.  I start talking to a realtor who hooks me up with a mortgage lender.  Unfortunately I can't get pre-approval for a mortgage due this federal loan.  While it's in the rehab, my payments aren't showing up and it still looks like it's delinquent. I call ECSI just to make sure that everything is still on track to finish the rehab in April 2019 and they confirm that.  They also confirm that each month continues to show delinquency on my credit until the rehab has been fully completed.

My payments are now consistently coming out on the 11th of each month and things are looking good.  After my payment just came out today, I call ECSI to see if I can make my final April payment a little early so I can get things rolling with my mortgage.  They tell me that my rehab program doesn't end in April 2019 and that it was restarted in November 2018 because of non-payment in October 2018. 

I am absolutely livid and am awaiting a call back from a manager. I'm not sure exactly what they can do, or if they can over ride the error that was on their end.  I'm not really sure what to do from here.  There isn't much left on the loan and I could just pay it all outright and end the loan, but I'm concerned about the impact on my credit because all of these months this loan is showing in delinquency due to non-payment, even though it's been in rehab this entire time. Anyone have any experience with this or advice?",finance
personalfinance,Unexpected expenses forcing us to adjust - Can you help validating our plan?,"Our current situation:

* We have (or had) a 3 months emergency fund
* We have been maxing out our 401k and IRA contributions for 5+ years
* We had a few major unexpected expenses hitting us at once, depleting our emergency fund, and forcing us to use our home LOC for the first time in many years

I believe the correct plan should be for us to re-fund our emergency fund and pay off our LOC (APR 6%).
To do that, we plan on being more careful with expenses, as well as lower our retirement contributions as follows:

1. Only contribute enough to 401k to get employer match
2. Skip the 2018 IRA contribution

Once we are back to normal, I will resume maxing out our 401k and IRA contributions.

I have to admit that it does sting to realize that I will be missing out on contributing to our IRA for the year 2018.

A slight alternative to the plan above would be to lower the priority of repaying our LOC, given its relatively low interest rate, and keep contributing what we can to our retirement funds while replenishing our emergency fund.

ada,Proposition about channels of communication of the Ada community.,"First some explanation. In my opinion, at this moment Ada community is bit fragmented. Some people are on Usenet, some others are on IRC, Gitter or Telegram (and probably few other places which I don't know). The worst: I think that we should even open more places to discussion, to promote Ada. It may be a bit problematic to find a help sometimes, especially that Ada is not the most popular programming language on the world. Of course, everyone can create accounts everywhere and keep separate computer just for run all this awesome programs needed to communicate. Normally in that situation someone propose to move everyone on the one channel - of course this one which he or she use :) But I have another proposition: let's allow everyone to use this channel of communication which he or she prefer and merge all of them in one. How to do it? My proposition, Matrix.

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(protocol)):

&gt;Matrix is an open standard and lightweight protocol for real-time communication. It is designed to allow users with accounts at one communications service provider to communicate with users of a different service provider via online chat, Voice over IP, and Videotelephony. That is, it aims to make real-time communication work seamlessly between different service providers, just like standard Simple Mail Transfer Protocol email does now for store-and-forward email service.  
&gt;  
&gt;From a technical perspective, it is an application layer communication protocol for federated real-time communication. It provides HTTP APIs and open source reference implementations for securely distributing and persisting messages in JSON format over an open federation of servers. It can integrate with standard web services via WebRTC, facilitating browser-to-browser applications.

From my own experience, Matrix is very nice communication protocol, probably created by people who were that same frustrated about communication channels fragmentation like me ;) It is easy to write ""connection"" (called *bridges*) between Matrix and other communication protocols, definitely easier than writing another client program to merge them all.

So, my proposition looks that: I was created few days ago, room in Matrix dedicated to Ada programming language. I wish to connect it to the others chats of the Ada community, but for this I been need approval and some help from administrators, operators, people who take care about this rooms or channels. If we connect everything together, people could use any channel which they prefer. The Matrix room will be works as ""hub"" and additional place to promote Ada. For example, if someone ask question on IRC, that question will appear on other chats too. Thus there will be a bigger chance to get the answer and we will not force people to use specific protocol of communication. I think it may helps a bit Ada community to grow. I'm writing this proposition here because (if I good guess) most of administrators of Ada chat rooms and channels are here too.

I was wrote some information about current state of the Matrix Ada room (what it offer, how to connect) here: [https://www.laeran.pl/adaroom.html](https://www.laeran.pl/adaroom.html) (if you have problems with this link, you can try this [https://bin.disroot.org/?98fb4ea8eda715e2#FBNZEj3UWgP0z0zzpeqbxgE4fWvTdJs1dJZWrHLMRIM=](https://bin.disroot.org/?98fb4ea8eda715e2#FBNZEj3UWgP0z0zzpeqbxgE4fWvTdJs1dJZWrHLMRIM=) )

personalfinance,(UK) Saving vs Investing - Question relating to historic interest rates,"I'm 23 and for all my life I've known nothing but incredibly low interest rates, meaning that saving accounts have always been 2% or much lower. Therefore if one is wanting to compound money, the solution has always been to turn to the stock market / investing. I'm aware that people generally consider the market to return an average of 5-8% annually, over a long period of time (the S&amp;P500 returning 7% and FTSE 100 slightly lower). Although I'm wondering if investing is always the best option and has always been the best option in the past?

http://www.swanlowpark.co.uk/savings-interest-annual

After research (like the link above) and speaking with parents and friends who lived throughout the 1980/1990s, it seems crazy to me to imagine a time when interest rates were as high as 10% or more. This has made me curious as to what investors did throughout these periods of time? Surely it'd make sense just to take all your money out of the market and simply stick cash into a normal cash savings account if you could get a BETTER return than investing?

If interests rates potentially rose in the distant future to 5/6/7% (or more even - however unlikely), would investors just move over there stocks to cash? No reading annual reports, no following markets, no RISK. Just stick the cash in a savings account and beat the market?! Would this be correct? What did investors do during the 80s and 90s?

I feel that I might be missing something but I would love it if someone could fill me in on if investing is ALWAYS the a better option and why. I'm aware that at the moment and for the near future it is the best option... but could that change?",finance

personalfinance,Inactive 401K Advice,"So quick insight/background. I have a pretty decent-paying job, but we are a single-income family. We have student loan debt, a mortgage, and a car loan. I just recently changed careers, and have about 1.75 years-worth of a pre-tax 401K from my old job sitting out there.

My new job is a federal one, so the pay isn’t quite as good as my old private-industry job. We are still doing fine, but are looking for ways to bring payments down across the board. I am, admittedly, horrible in this department.

So here’s the scenario: I have just over $18K in my old 401K. I talked with an adviser with that firm about quantity scenarios, and it comes basically to this. I can roll that in to my current TSP or pension fund, or I can cash out. But, since it’s pre-tax, my cash out is right around $8.5K, which includes early-withdraw penalties as well.

It just so happens that my existing car loan has $8.3K remaining, with about 2.5 years left on the loan, which is a $270/month payment. So one option is to pull that money out, take the painful hit in penalties, but be able to get rid of that car payment each month, and allow us some room to purchase a new (or at least, new to us) car a bit down the road (no pun intended).

Other option is to do the roll-over, and lose minimal in minor fees.

I guess I’m trying to figure out what a better option would be. I know it’s a pretty subjective, personal-preference type question, but it’s what I got. I know if I roll it over, I’ll get more bang for my buck so to speak in the long run when I retire, however that’s really long term. This is only 1.75 years’ worth of contributions, and let’s be honest, it’s 2019, and I will probably be working for 40+ years anyways. So will I even miss that $18k in 2049-2059? Or, do I improve my short-term, immediate situation, with the hopes that it will all pan out long term into a good investment idea?

solar,Buckboost with solar charge controller,"Hiya,

I’m working on a small project and was wondering whether this was viable.

The power source is a 12V alternator that’s being fed into a 12V/24V DCDC converter (Quint PS) that has the ability increase the output voltage up to 28V. That will then feed into a pwm solar charge controller (sunsaver) that will maintain charge for two 12V AGM batteries in series.

Any issues with doing it this way that you can see?",energy
personalfinance,Grad School Financing Advice!,"First, let me start off and pre-apologize for any formatting issues there might be with my post. This is my first official post on reddit beyond comments I’ve made. I’m hoping to get advice from good people of this subreddit. To fast forward to my problem, I’ve recently as of last Thursday received both of my acceptance letters from USC &amp; UCI for their Public Policy graduate program. I’ve worked exceptionally hard over the past few years to elevate my life to a level in which I and my family can be proud of. I struggled severely in school from K-12th but then found out how to be a good student thanks to my community college. It is also there where I found what is essentially my passion; politics. With the skills I learned at community college I excelled greatly while doing my undergraduate degree. Where I expanded further on my leadership and communication skills while having earned my bachelors degree and being awarded the honor of graduating Cum Laude. Since then, I moved from LA to Sacramento to further my professional background interning with a sitting U.S. Senator, working for the Mayor of Sac., and also working for a progressive fundraising group dedicated to consumer protections. And it is with these experiences I believe earned me a spot with both schools. I am humbled to be given this opportunity to further my educational aspirations. 


However, my family isnt wealthy at all but have been assisting me where they can. My dad is a security guard and my mom is disabled and cannot work. They also have a considerable amount of debt and can’t really do much for me in terms of tackling the either 44k or 24k cost of tuition per year other than offering me a place to stay while completing my degree. I would have to help and pay rent (300-400.00) which is much cheaper than the 700 I pay currently.


My question is, with having been given acceptance letters for both schools I applied to. Is it worth going to USC which is ranked 6th in the nation for my particular program (Masters in Public Policy). But at the cost of 44k per year w/o housing costs. My acceptance letter also did not include a scholarship award with it and I’m still unsure of the other 5 scholarships I’ve applied to. I’ll know more about them by the end of march, but I need to give USC an answer by april 15th and the same with UCI. Having talked to the people at UCI which is not ranked at all for my degree program. I’m seeing that they are willing to give me a significant amount to help with schooling. They’re cost of attendance is 24k opposed to 44k. However, I don’t know the exact dollar amount of what they’d be willing to help with. 


I’m currently 3,700.00 in student debt from my time in undergrad and I don’t regret it due to all of the life changing experiences I’ve had and opportunities I’ve been able to get with funds I had available. I’m currently in the process of moving back down to LA so I can assist my parents financially and also get ready for grad school. At the same time, searching for scholarships, federal work-studies, and fellowships is currently what I’m doing. But again, as someone who has seen how debt can be a huge hinderance on people’s lives. I’m worried about taking out such a huge loan when I’ve done whatever possible to stay out of debt for the 27 years I’ve been alive. A few months ago, I even sold my older model bmw to get a little civic that was easier on maintenance and better on gas to allow me to focus on paying down my student loan and save more monthly. I’m literally doing what I can to be saving the most amount of money possible but again taking out such a significant amount of money in loans seriously worries me. If any of you all have advice on how I should handle this situation. It would be greatly appreciated.

personalfinance,"Received 40k, need guidance","I received $40,000 as part of an inheritance.  I am 32, married with two kids.  My wife and I both work.  The only debt we have is our 15 year mortgage.

We are both federal employees so we take advantage of TSP.  Initially, I was just going to stick this money in a high yield savings account but I believe I can make better use of the money investing.

The options they gave were: 

A.) 1 mo deferment, then a credit limit reduction to $12,500, with a plan to pay a minimum of 2% of credit limit, so $250. In doing the math, I would only be paying about $80 towards the principle. They would keep the card open. 

B.) Close the card. Drop my interest rate to 6% for 12 months to allow me to pay off as much of the principle in those 12 months. She was vague as to what my APR would be at the end of the 12mos, but let’s assume 18%.

Will option B hurt me in the long run, what with closing the account? I do intend to cut the card up and discontinuing adding to my balance.

My family member just passed away, leaving us each a not unsubstantial amount. About 50k. My husband has about 25k in student loans left, and my instincts are to pay that off first, set up a good emergency fund, and then possibly invest the last bit. 

My question is, is it our best financial interest to get rid of the student loan in a big way, or to just continue paying it on schedule? I would love to be rid of this burden, as at this time it just feels like another bill to be felt with.

Thank you!

Edit to say the interest rate is like 6.8% and we’ve got about 4 more years left. I think I’d like to take a guilt free vacation/ honeymoon, cause we honestly thought we weren’t going to be able to afford that for a long time after our super frugal wedding.

personalfinance,Paying off a $450k loan in full vs loan repayment,"I am currently in my last months of residency and about to finish with a whopping $450k in loans with a job lined up that will pay me $230k annually. I currently am faced with two general options for loan repayment which I'm having trouble making a decision on. 

1. Refinance for a lower interest rate and pay off as much as possible monthly (Standard 10 year repayment although I would be aiming for about 6-7 years) 

2. Pay as little off monthly and aim for loan forgiveness after 25 years (Of note, I will not be going for the public service loan forgiveness)

A couple things that are complicating my decision. I believe just based on math the net present value of my total loan payments would be less under option 2. This is also nice because I would be paying less per month and therefore my wife and I would be able to live a little more comfortably during our younger years (currently 34). Although my wife is not a gold digger by any means, I do want to provide a somewhat comfortable lifestyle for her while it matters more (ie during our youth). If I do go with option 2 I would plan on putting a large amount of money away in a mutual fund in anticipation of the tax bomb at the end plus the small possibility that the law may change around loan forgiveness. 

On the other hand, going with option 1 would have the loan out of they way in 7 or so years which would take a weight off my shoulders once done. It would also probably encourage me to work overtime a bit more and focus more on saving until the loan is payed off. The downside is that I think the net present value of my total loan repayment would be higher, and my wife and I would be living frugally for the rest of our 30s and early 40s. Also, I could also realistically see myself paying off the loan in 10 years instead of sticking with 6-7 years. 

Other factors that play a part is that my wife and I both have parents who have saved up absolute nothing for retirement, don't have much in terms of assets, and are all approaching their mid-late 60s. My wife and I also hope to have a child in 1-2 years which will also cost money. Our entire family also lives in Southern California where costs of living are high. 

Once I refinance I cannot go for loan forgiveness so I want to make the right decision from the start. Any advice is welcome!",finance

Boeing has now released details of a software update for the jet, which has been in the works for several months and predates those crashes.

personalfinance,TAX HELP: How to file two W2s b/c I only paid federal taxes for half the year due to visa-change?,"Hi, hoping to get some advice on how to file my taxes this year.

&amp;#x200B;

I was on F1 student visa post-grad from May 2017 (started work Sept 2017) to May 2018, and therefore was exempt from federal taxes like social security and Medicare. Last year's taxes went smoothly. June 2018 onwards, I switched to a TN visa (for Canadians) and therefore started paying federal taxes because I passed the significant presence test and classified as a resident alien.

&amp;#x200B;

My W2s arrive this year and to my surprise, I'm hit with two W2s with different 'wage' totals because my company had split my forms into pre and post TN visa. I make \~70K and therefore I received one W2 that includes federal taxes paid and the other half doesn't. The state / local numbers are a mess too because I'm a NYC resident but work in NJ. There is no way for me to consolidate this data properly onto a program like Turbotax because it doesn't allow me to add two different W2s for a mid-year visa switch situation like this. Especially because if I add my total 70K salary but only half a year federal taxes withheld, it'll calculate that I owe taxes even though I didn't need to pay them for that half of the year.

&amp;#x200B;

I've consulted a few tax accountants and they seem a bit shakey on the best way to move forward. Any advice would be much much appreciated! Thanks in advance! Happy to send a screenshot of what I mean by two W2s if needed.",finance

My Situation:

I work in Agriculture and have been recommended for a full time job at a university doing research in my field. I am not guaranteed to get the job but it is likely.  In general in my field job searching is pretty open because people leverage their previous company to help get them into new companies, and it is considered faux pas to leave anytime other than the end of the growing season. My father who works in a business setting says I should not mention it until I have a written offer. My direct supervisor and mentor at my current job suggested waiting until I have an interview to mention it. 

I'm not so much worried about the timing and leaving them out to dry and burning the bridge because we are overstaffed and there is someone qualified below me who I have been mentoring for the past year. I am worried though that the university will contact my current boss if I list him as a reference. I am planning on telling him when I get an interview but if they contact him as a reference before then it would not look good.

personalfinance,Tax software is showing to drastically different amounts I need to pay back.,"My story: In the beginning of the year, I worked at a startup that was located in NYC in the first month of the year then moved to NJ. I stayed in NYC the whole time until I got fired. I collected unemployment from NJ, but they didn't take out any taxes. I collected that for about 10 weeks before I found a new job. 

My problem: While doing taxes i used two different softwares showing drastically different amounts I need to pay back. I first used a free tax prep software which showed I need to pay NY ~$1,116 and owed the Feds ~$550. Using Turbotax it also showed I owed NY about the same, but it said I owed the Feds $9, and of course TurboTax wants me to pay $100 for the deluxe package since I needed to file my unemployment and then pay to file my NY and Fed taxes.

My question: What can I do? Can I use the free software to do my NY taxes and use TurboTax for my Fed? Personally I rather not support TurboTax because of their lobbying against return free filling. Also is it safer to go with the tax prep which shows me the owe the least amount?",finance

stocks,Ladybaybee recommended stock picks 2019-03-13,"[Link to imgur](https://imgur.com/a/8KljBlY)


**HOW I USE THIS:** 

1) All the stocks identified in the table are qualified as “BUY” opportunities.

2) I focus in the column “Success Rate(3m)” which shows the precision of the agents in the last 3 calendar months. I personally feel most comfortable with Rates 0.8 or higher. 

3) Then, I see the number in “Tx(3m)” which represents the number of transactions that the agents predicted for this stock in the last 3 months. I prefer stocks that have had at least two transactions during this period. 

4) Finally, I look at Growth(3m), if the agents have had a considerable growth (&gt;5% in 3 months) then I follow that trade. 

5) If a row in the table is colored green then it means that stock has been on the rise today so I purchase it immediately in order to ride the wave up. On the other hand, if the row is colored red, then I wait out until very close to market close to purchase the stock and let the price bottom out before climbing up again tomorrow.


6) After I purchase the stocks, I ALWAYS set a stop loss order at -2.5% from my buying price valid for the day. I think this is good hygiene, no matter how confident I am of my system, I still want to make sure that my losses are capped. I update this stop loss order every day. 


**BACKGROUND**

I am not a financier or economist. I am electrical engineer with equal passion in artificial intelligence and financial markets. For the past 2 years I have been working on a system that would make short term predictions of stocks. The system is rather complex, I use multiple layers which include: Convolutional Neural Networks, LSTMs and Genetic Algorithms. All bulked together produce an output like in this image. The way to interpret the image is a follows: Symbol and Date columns are self explanatory, Quorum refers to autonomous agents that decide whether to BUY/NOT BUY or SELL/HOLD a stock. Each symbol has 9 agents, and the Quorum column, counts the number of agents that recommend Buy, Selling or Holding the stock. The “Not Owned” column means: if you don’t own this stock then you should … The “Owned” column means: if you own this stock you should HOLD or SELL. The column “Growth(1 Year)” refers to what what has been the growth of this system of Agents in the past calendar year. The column “Tx(1Yr)” shows the number of full transactions that these agents recommended in the last calendar year. “Factor” is just the division of Growth divided by Transactions to get the average growth per transaction. Finally “Success Rate” shows how successful these agents have been in their recommendations in the past calendar year, success 1 means 100% successful, 0.5 means 50% successful, and so on.

Many people have been curious about the actual process that the system follows, so here it is: for every symbol (600 stocks are analyzed daily), we get the full stock data (open,close,high,low,volume) for the past 4 months. Each stock is associated with another set of “lookalike” stocks as well as major ETF’s. This initial dataset is run through a convolutional layer that extracts an undisclosed number of features. These features are then passed onto a recurrent neural network (LSTM) where sequences and patterns are extracted. The LSTM then spits out probabilities for the likelihood that this stock will have a positive, negative and neutral tendency in the next N days. These probabilities are then fed to a genetic evolution system (GES). This system essentially checks the predictions for the past N days and compares them with reality, following that the systems knows which predictions are performing the best. Once the system knows which stocks are being simulated the best, then the system automatically finds which of these best performing stocks have the biggest potential for the next few days. The system does not output explanations, unfortunately us humans are not capable of understanding (or visualizing) a problem of this dimensionality, for example the LSTM part alone works with over 10 million dimensions, not features but dimensions.

Bitcoin,After years of watching coinbase pro / GDAX markets getting spoofed...,It's clear to me that the only way for us to be able to take control back from the market manipulators pushing down the price of Bitcoin is for us to all move our Bitcoin off these exchanges into addresses that we have a private keys for. Go ahead and take a look at it for yourself. Go on over to coinbase Pro and look at the BTC USD Market in real time .  You will see that there are people / bots just waiting to bring in huge sells with a hundred plus  Bitcoin  at the ask price only to delete it instantaneously and then push it down even further to the next lower price when there's not enough  purchasing power at  the buy side .  I believe that until everyone with any amount of Bitcoin moves their bitcoins from all the major exchanges to their own addresses that the price will continue to be manipulated in any way that these manipulators want it to via typical Wall Street financialization techniques. Big money is all over this market right now and they are trying to get enough Bitcoin to be able to control the market indefinitely. They're using ingenious techniques of market manipulation  with over-the-counter markets  and cash settled Futures to heavily manipulate the price of Bitcoin. This system has never been present in any of the previous bull or bear markets that Bitcoin has experienced and we are therefore going to have to make it our mission to spread the word about the importance of taking physical custody of  Bitcoin asap and avoiding custodial Solutions as much as possible. Otherwise they will continue to manipulate the price as they see fit to achieve their goals.,cryptocurrency

personalfinance,"22yo, Current College Student, $14.6k Taxable Income from Summer Internship, Invest into Traditional or Roth IRA?","I made $14.6k in income in 2018. With the $12k standard deduction, my taxable federal income is $2.6k. I was wondering which of the following strategies would be most advantageous:

Method 1: Contribute $2.6k into Traditional IRA to deduct $2.6k from taxable income, resulting in 0 federal taxes. Contribute remaining $5.5k - $2.6k = $2.9k into Roth IRA with 0 federal taxes. (Is this correct?)

Method 2: Contribute $5.5k into Roth IRA.

The reason I think Method 1 is advantageous is because I'm saving $260 now because of the deduction. This money can then be moved into a brokerage account and grow there. However, I think it's unlikely that I'll be in the 10% tax bracket ever again, so I think that means I should take advantage of that now and invest fully into the Roth IRA. This is magnified by the fact that tax rates are at historical lows. 

So my question is: 

**Should I lower my tax bill now through a Traditional IRA contribution or should I go all in on my Roth IRA given my current low-tax situation?**

Additional thoughts?

- I'm not eligible to contribute to other tax-advantaged accounts (401k, HSA, etc) in 2018

personalfinance,Getting an Inheritance- Completely Stressed Out.,"I never expected to be in this situation and the emotions are surprisingly more stressful than I expected. 

I am set to receive $150,000 (after all is said and done). Currently, my husband and I are dirt poor. We have a toddler, hopefully one on the way, tons of student loans and a cc debt ~$20,000 (like many this is due to medical expenses). We do have a house that is 100% paid for. We are fairly frugal. We don’t eat out, we buy second hand, I can’t remember the last time we went to the movies. 

What we are looking at in terms of major expenses (not necessarily this order)
1. Pay off CC ($20,000)
2. Fix House ($30,000- possibly less. Needs new roof, siding,   
    floors and some deck repairs. We can do the work ourselves-
    minus the roof) 
3. 4 door truck and small stock trailer - (used- idk cost, our  
    current car is toast. 
4. Safety Net
5. Student Loans (Would be most of $150,000- and more are  
    coming)

Obviously things are more complicated than this but in general: We are currently breaking even each month, paying off a tiny bit of our debt at a time while working towards better careers.

CC is obviously gone ASAP but then we run into questions about the student loans. They are fed loans and on an income driven repayment plan. We would like them gone ASAP but combined, with more school in our future, that is all the money. That would leave us with no safety net and potentially ending up with cc debt again.

personalfinance,Home remodel / refinance,"Hey all, 26M, CO
I need some guidance on taking the correct approach to my home remodel. 

House is estimated to be worth $480k. I owe $196k on it. I’d like to borrow against the equity and remodel this place. I have a general idea of what the front and back would cost, exterior, and the entire interior. 

Say I needed $80k in renovations. My credit is right around 760. Where when I bought the house it was 680. I own the home with my brother (44). He also has excellent credit. The housing market in Colorado has been crazy - we decided to remodel instead of buy an additional home. 

What’s the best approach here? I’m not familiar with the options, and the lenders I called all felt like sales people. I’m hoping to borrow for the remodel, refinance for a lower interest rate, and basically keep my monthly spend the same at the end of the day. Any insight would be appreciated. 

Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Would it be crazy to for me to buy a house?,"Edit: Y’all convinced me. It is a crazy idea. Thanks everyone for chiming in. I’ll keep the money where it is and wait to buy a home when I no longer have debt and can afford a 20% down payment!


I am 25, almost 3 years out of college/in the work force, and haven’t really been saving money as I have been focused on paying down my student loans as aggressively as I can. I currently make ~$4200/month after taxes and put at least $1,000 per month toward my loans (though I usually try to pay more), plus any bonuses/windfalls go directly to my loans. I have ~$23k left to pay off (interest rate 5.5%). I am changing jobs and will get a salary increase that would come to ~$5,000/month after taxes, plus a substantial signing bonus that should allow me to pay off my loan this year.

I had always thought that I wouldn’t even consider buying a house until my loans were paid off, as I really am not accumulating any savings due to throwing all of my extra money at the loans. However, when looking into what to do with the funds in my employer 401k (about $17,000) when switching jobs, it seems I can put it in an IRA and can use up to $10,000 to a buy a home without having to pay a penalty for withdrawing early. It also seems I could get a first time home buyer loan where you only have to make a down payment of 3%, so I could put $10,000 dollars toward a ~$200k house, and the mortgage payment would be very manageable for my budget. I currently split the rent of a 1 br apartment with my boyfriend, which comes to $700 each. To get a decent house in my budget we would have to move to a different part of town, but I’m ok with that. I would probably ask my bf to just pay half the mortgage payment. Or we could get married and buy the house together (though I didn’t want to get married until I paid off my loans either). But those are things I can think about after I figure out of doing this is even a good idea or not.

So, is it better to just leave the money alone and let it grow, or is buying a house something I should actually consider? Or maybe wait a year, pay off my loans, and then buy a house with the IRA money? What do you think?",finance

The payment would 100% cover the car loan with enough left over to pay another 40% of my student loan. This would reduce my monthly payments required, but I would roll the car payment into the student loan payment. This is option one.

&amp;#x200B;

Or I could keep my car loan since it has a lower interest rate, and pay all of it onto my student loan, which would cover almost 60% of the balance. This wouldn't change my monthly required payments and not allow a roll over for another year. This is option two.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to drop the lump sum payment onto the parent PLUS loan until I pay off the loans in my name. Is option one the best route to go, or is the additional principal paid on the higher interest rate just better all around?

personalfinance,Thoughts on a balance transfer credit card from a credit union?,I currently have a few credit cards with varying balances (anywhere from $3800 - $300) and most have apr rates in the 15% - 20% range. I recently received an offer from the credit union that I used to finance my car for a pre-approved card with a 10.49% apr and 1.99% apr for balance transfers for the first six months. This makes sense for me in two ways - first obviously the lower interest rate and second I will only have to remember one monthly payment. Are there any pitfalls I should be aware of?,finance
personalfinance,Pay off current auto loan or save for down payment on new auto?,"I currently own two vehicles: 1. old commuter car that is paid off, but now has enough upcoming maintenance needs that it makes more sense to replace it by the end of the year instead of dumping thousands into it; 2. family van that is a few years old and still has a loan (about $8k at 2.275%). 

I’ve just paid off the rest of my outstanding debt (medical bills, credit card, etc) so I now have some extra monies each month that I can put towards either paying off my current van loan, or saving up for a larger down payment on a replacement commuter car, which will need a loan to finance, as it’ll likely be about $30k total. I also have about 2k in savings, which is my minimum rainy day fund until I get things paid off and build up a 3-6 month savings fund. 

My credit score is now above 750 (according to Mint), and the auto website is quoting a 3.5% interest rate, but I’m pretty sure that’s just a placeholder/estimate until the actual loan is applied for and granted. 

Questions: 
What makes the most sense? Should I make larger payments on my current van loan, or save up as much as I can to make a larger down payment on replacement commuter car? 

Is there a threshold of a minimum down payment I should be looking at, or does it just depend on how much it might lower the interest rate on the loan? 

Or does it just make sense to treat these two loans as a snowball vs. avalanche scenario? (I’m team avalanche all the way, which has worked well for paying off my debts.) I’m going to make sure I can afford both auto loan payments before taking on the new loan. 

Anything else I should consider?

personalfinance,What to do with a pension account I can’t use,"So I’ve worked for a university for the past 3 years while preparing for graduate school. This employer is union represented and has a mandatory pension plan for all employees with mandatory contributions from each check. You need 5 years of service credit minimum to be able to use the pension at the age of 55.

So because I will be ineligible (3 years credit) I have basically been forced to pay into a “retirement” plan that I won’t be able to use and will subsequently be forced to pay the additional federal 10% penalty to receive the money I paid into it pre tax. 

Should I leave this money in the pension on the off chance I get a job at the university after graduate school? Or should I take it out now face the tax and penalties and reinvest it elsewhere like a 401k or 403b. It should be noted that I can always “buy back” into the pension if I’m rehired and I take the money out. 

I guess what I’m really asking is, will the long term benefit of paying penalties and fees now and reinvesting be greater than just leaving the money in there?",finance

personalfinance,Extra mortgage payment to remove PMI vs Investing,"Throwaway account.

&amp;#x200B;

I bought a house for 569k with 5% down (conventional loan) at 4.5%. The PMI is $103/month (pretty good right?). To remove PMI, I need to pay $85,350 towards the principal. Using math, I found the PMI interest rate to be 1.44%, plus the 4.5% of the loan, for a grand total of 5.94%. If I  make $500/month in extra payments, PMI would be removed a little over 5 years.

I plan on staying in this house for at least 10 years.

&amp;#x200B;

Pros of extra payments

\- build equity

\- remove PMI 3 years earlier

&amp;#x200B;

Cons of extra payments

\- won't see a return in the remaining years of not having PMI.

\- putting many eggs in one basket

&amp;#x200B;

If you were me, would you rather contribute $500 to a retirement account, or make 5-6 years of extra payments to remove the PMI?

personalfinance,Nelnet Parent Plus Loan my mother forgot to tell me I had.....,"Hey guys, 

I’d appreciate some help with my current scenario I’ve seemed to find myself in with student loans. I have currently been repaying my fed-loan balance from college, which consists of a few different subsidized and unsubsidized federal loans currently totaling 29,000 dollars. My monthly payment under fed loans standard repayment plan is $387.78 a month. These are the only loans I thought I had......until this week when my mom dropped a bomb on me saying she also signed for parent plus loans through nelnet, which I had no idea even existed. Turns out the loan amount for these loans have been accruing interest since I started college in 2012 and currently have managed to add $15,000 to the principal balance of the loans themselves. She’s been deferring them for the past 5 years. 

The three loans I’ve received from nelnet are as follows: 

Direct Loan Plus
IR : 7.9 % 
Outstanding principal balance: $9,000
Unpaid interest to be capitalized : $5,280.17

Direct Loan Plus 
IR: 6.41%

Unpaid interest to be capitalized : $5,315.90

Direct Loan Plus

What is the best way to go about repaying these loans? Should I just go through nelnet or get an outside loan? Or should I consolidate them with my current fedloan and make one uniform payment? And is there anything nelnet would do about the interest? Or am I screwed ?

personalfinance,First full time job!,"I make $45k a year in a job I started a couple of months ago. This is my first full time job out of school (I spent 6 years in school which included a graduate degree). I’m turning 26 in a few months and I wanted to get a head start on retirement instead of waiting well into my 30s. I work in show-biz (arts/entertainment). My salary is pretty low compared to most people on here, but I feel like I’m at a great place considering the nature of this industry and my age. 

I have a massive amount of student debt BUT it’s all federal loans that are currently very affordable. Plus I work in the not-for-profit sector (and don’t plan on leaving the sector as most of the jobs in my industry fall within it anyway) so I’m not super worried about them since I plan to use PSLF. Saving for retirement actually makes the amount I will have to pay out in the long run lower. These loans will ideally be gone when I’m 35. So paying as little as possible on these loans the next 10 years will save me more money in the future. 

In June, I will be available to contribute to my company’s 401k plan. It’s pretty unusual (in my experience) to find a non-profit in the entertainment sector that has a match so I want to take full advantage of that. They match up to 4% of contributions. Since I haven’t been contributing to that plan (since I’m currently ineglible) I’m using that money to build a little emergency nest egg.

Salary: $45k
Monthly Expenses: $2,200 
(Monthly expenses includes short term savings of $150 to put towards vacations, big purchases, etc.)
Matching 401k: 4%

Should I put in as much as my company is matching and then max out a Roth IRA?… and then in the future, start contributing more to my 401k?… OR should I just contribute 15% to my 401k. The more I contribute to my 401k, the lower my student loan payment is since it’s calculated based off of AGI (I guess I would have to do the math to see if the impact would even be significant). I’m on a PAYE plan.

And if I want to save for a downpayment on a place, how should I balance that? Should I instead save 10% for retirement and the other 5% for short term goals?",finance
personalfinance,What should I do with my extra money?,"Hey guys, I am very lucky to be in a great financial spot. I’m looking for some advice on where I should put my extra money.

Salary - 71k. I recently received a big raise and i would like to put my money to good use. Spouse makes around 62k.
Age- 28, married, no kids
Debt- just our house. Currently owe around 139k on a 30 year loan with an interest rate of 3.75%. Put down 20% when we bought the house. Monthly payments are about $850, but I pay additional principal each month and pay $1100 each month. The house is updated so we aren’t looking to make any improvements at this time. Might have to purchase a new HVAC unit in the next year.

Our cars are new and paid off. No student loans, etc.

Savings- I have 21k in savings right now. This sits in a bank account not gaining any interest. Spouse has an investment account with 140k. Note this isn’t our retirement savings. Again, we know we are very lucky to have this.

Retirement- I have close to 50k in my 401k. I contribute 8% of my pay check. My company contributes as well. My spouse contributes 11% of his pay check into his 401k. I’m not sure how much he has in his 401k- probably around 30-40k though.

So basically, I feel like I’m in a good spot, but don’t want to look back one day and wish I had done something different. As I mentioned above, I just got a big pay bump. What would you do with the extra money? I don’t need anything for our house, we can easily afford our vacations/ anything extra we want.

Should I try to invest my money somewhere like my husband? Should I contribute more to my 401k? My only hesitation is I’m only 28 and I know I can’t touch this money until my 60’s. 

Or should I increase my overpayments on the mortgage? The interest rate is so low that I’m not sure this is wise either.

investing,Allocating investments in credit unions,"As far as conventional investing wisdom goes, perhaps some percentage will be invested in stocks, ETFs, fixed income, real estate, etc. Most people don't like investing too much in savings accounts due to the low interest rates.

There are some credit unions, NCUA insured up to 250k, that can offer up to 5% APR. Consumers Credit Union, for example offers 5.09% APR for sums up to 10k. While I know 10k isn't a large amount, if you are younger, most of the investment might be going to more risky investments. And if you do want to invest more, you can always split the money amongst a few credit unions.

Am I missing something or are credit unions slept on in terms of their investment value? 5% returns aren't too shabby when many of the large banks can't come anywhere close...is there any catch here?

The only catch is that you have to spend up to 1k a month using the debit card they provide. If you can only to 500, then the rate is 4.09%. I guess the problem then becomes not being able to use credit cards as much to get cash back rewards and build credit. Is there any way to commit debit card transactions and end up with cash? That would solve that problem, since you would have cash which you could reallocate into your normal checking accounts and pay your normal credit card bills from there.

EDIT: There are some credit unions offering 3.33% APR with 10 transactions and no expenditure minimum like Heritage Bank NA. In this case by a pack of gum in the morning, or lunch one day and it should be relatively easy to meet that. I'm really not seeing the risks here...",finance
worldpolitics,Development of Infrastructure in the Arctic,"Today in the world there is a surge of interest in the Arctic. The main reason is the willingness of many countries to invest in the development of the rich natural resources of the macro region. Moreover, the Arctic is one of the few places on the planet that still have a national appropriation, because initially the resources of the Polar region were not divided between the countries. At least five states apply for the Arctic zones: Russia, Norway, Denmark, Canada and the United States. All these countries have access to the coast of the Arctic Ocean. In the future, national claims may be supported by various arguments, but it is clear that the main one is practical, that is, the real readiness of the country to actively develop the north.

And since the development of the Arctic for Russia is a very important task, on December 1, 2014, the Combined Strategic Command ""North"", which is more known as the Arctic grouping of troops, began to perform combat tasks. The decision to restore Russia's military presence in the Arctic was made by Russian President Vladimir Putin, approving in February 2013 the Strategy for the Development of the Arctic Zone of the Russian Federation and ensuring National Security until 2020.

According to experts, Russia's strengthening of its position in the north is explained by its neighborhood with NATO member states. But at the same time, they also stated that the restoration of the military presence beyond the Arctic Circle is necessary for Russia to reliably protect the natural wealth of the territory. At the moment, it is not known for certain what reserves of oil and gas the Arctic possesses, which is called the “pantry of the Earth”. According to preliminary estimates by scientists, there is about a quarter of the world's proven hydrocarbon reserves under the ice. At the same time, great importance is given to environmental safety, waste management and cleaning of the Arctic.

Military expert, candidate of historical sciences Vadim Solovyov is confident that, given the increasing international competition for Arctic resources, the creation of the Joint Strategic Command ""North"" was fully justified. V. Solovyov noted that the area is not simple and it is necessary to develop the Arctic, prepare the appropriate infrastructure, and accumulate a certain military potential and train personnel in very difficult conditions to ensure environmental safety, rescue and scientific work. According to the Minister of Defense of Russia, General of the Army Sergey Shoigu, the protection of Russia's national interests in the Arctic region and its active development remain priorities of the activities of the armed forces.

It should be noted that the environmental problems of the Arctic are not a secret to anyone. Since Soviet times, a huge amount of rusty empty barrels, iron and an insane amount of other garbage have remained. The Russian army, which is now returning its infrastructure, began to take out the garbage. ""Cleaning"" the Arctic is a long and serious work, but it already gives a positive environmental effect.

Viktor Boyarsky, Chairman of the Polar Commission of the Russian Geographical Society, noted that the program of cleaning the Arctic Archipelago started back in 2012. He summarized that the military presence is a natural stimulus for the development of the region. And it meant not only improving the environment, but also developing the entire infrastructure of the Northern Sea Route, and all this activity is not building up power, but simply returning to a normal state of affairs.

Furthermore, on December 24, 2018 at a meeting of the Public Council at the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, S. Shoigu said that by 2019 the Russian Defense Ministry would complete the cleaning of the Arctic islands of scrap metal, and the Russian government stressed that this work is considered essential and necessary activities.",energy

worldpolitics,Sanctions are not an obstacle for Russia in the issue of the Arctic,"It should be recalled that on October 31, 2017, the US Ministry of Finance announced a ban on American citizens and companies from participating in Russian projects related to oil production in the Arctic and on its shelf and depth. The sanctions came into force on January 29, 2018 and complement those that began to be introduced in 2014 after the joining of the Crimea to Russia and the beginning of the conflict in south-eastern Ukraine. In turn, Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly stated that no sanctions can affect the principal positions of the Russian Federation in the international arena, and also that the position on Syria, Donbass and Crimea would not change, no matter what sanctions their American partners impose.

It should be noted that according to the review of the Energy Information Agency, which is part of the US federal statistical system, the sanctions pressure on Arctic and shale projects played a paradoxical role in increasing their attractiveness at a certain stage and made mining on the shelf in the Arctic a profitable business. And the Russian government changed the dividend and tax policy in relation to state corporations, became able to balance the budget.

Moreover, in the review there was a provision stating that the development of such complex deposits as in the Arctic, ""is impossible without the assistance of Western companies"". However, the imposed sanctions did not affect the current level of production. Thus, the CEO of the Center for Political Information of the Russian Federation, Alexei Mukhin, in May 2017, said that Russian companies, including «Rosneft» company, have quite successfully made their way to adapt to these sanctions. Thus, the existing sanctions have stimulated the development of import substitution in the Arctic shipbuilding, and instead of Western companies in these works domestic companies have appeared. Thus, in the construction of nuclear icebreakers of LK-60 type, components supplied by Russian manufacturers are mainly used.

Analysts at the US Department of Energy point out that Russia is actively developing new gas-bearing provinces, as well as cooperating with other manufacturers. At the same time, there is a general trend both in coal and in gas in shift to Asian markets and moving away from traditional European partners. In the case of deliveries of liquefied natural gas, there is a growing interest of Russian companies not only in its export by special ice-class tankers in the Arctic region, but also to the construction of gas liquefaction plants of medium and small sizes both to cover the gas deficit on its own territory and for export to neighboring countries.

In this regard, there are serious questions about the effectiveness of sanctions and, of course, there is a desire, including among Russia's western partners, to simply lift them, because the result is exactly the opposite. The attempt to strangle Russian companies through sanctions has clearly failed. Moreover, it provoked a very serious activity of the Russian authorities in the search for new markets.

It should be added that the sanctions can not only enhance the multiplier effects of Arctic shipbuilding and other industries: metallurgy (materials for the hull, metal products for shipbuilding), instrument engineering, engine building, radio electronics and marine electronics, but also provide Arctic projects for equipping ships of the Arctic fleet with diesel engines and ship diesel generators of a new generation that meet promising international requirements for environmental safety, efficiency and reliability.

Thus, the sanctions mechanism did not stop the development of the regional economy, but launched the solution of tasks that were not given due attention in previous years. At the same time, the mechanisms of state regulation of the Arctic transport system for the next decade remain priorities.",energy

The crash that everyone seems to be predicting as a foregone conclusion will not happen in 2020 or in the next several years for that matter.

The economic downturn already happened in 2018. That was the markets taking a breather from this historic run on all assets.

Our financial system has not been systemically improved since 2008/9; it is still a house of cards dependent on debt slaves taking on more obligations and not defaulting. However the environment in which that house of cards is built has somewhat shifted.

It is now all but decided that inflation and low/negative interest rates will be used to prop up the markets.

Why do I believe that is the case? For many reasons.

First and foremost the beneficiaries of inflationary QE style stimulus is almost everybody, at least in the short term.


* Inflation reduces the burden of past debts; so debtors benefit from inflation


* Inflation increases the value of assets ; so wealthy people benefit from inflation


* Inflation increases economic activity; so there are more jobs

When you don't consider the long term ,macro economic, or geopolitical effects of inflation it seems to be a good thing that benefits everyone.


We've talked about how Inflation is the culprit behind excessive warfare, how inflation steals from wage slaves, how inflation created an unsustainable global economy, how inflation is destroying the environment, etc. Inflation has created the hellish circumstances our future generations will face. But its important to remember that ""The Road to Hell is paved with Good Intentions"".


Even though inflation is inherently evil (in the sense that it is creating the conditions for the greatest starvation event the world has ever seen); the immediate effects of inflation are positive for everybody except those who store their value in fiat currencies.


If it weren't for the fact that inflation funds wars and creates an unsustainable global economy; there is nothing inherently evil in wanting to smooth the boom/bust cycle. Its just that in reality humans have always abused this power, to everyone's detriment. Just like there isn't anything inherently evil wanting a benevolent communist government to centrally plan,increase efficiency/quality of life for its inhabitants, provide basic services for free. Its just that in reality people shouldn't wield that kind of power. People make mistakes, and people are selfish.


Anyways; currency inflation can be maintained for decades , maybe even longer, if managed in lock-step with other major currencies.


There is no reason we couldn't see a gallon of milk going for $50000 and average salaries in the hundreds of millions/billions. The issue would be if other economies don't inflate at similar rates they can gain purchasing power over us. So major economies just need to inflate at roughly similar rates and they can keep this game going as long as the people let them keep going.


And the people will let them keep going; because those who are most negatively affected by these policies literally have no idea that these policies are affecting them. Those who are most aware of these policies are in a position to take advantage of them; so they root for it.


Look at what is going on in the world around us. Global events, politics, the news. Its all so dramatic and confusing. I believe that we are in the midst of being pulled through the eye of a needle. The world is changing rapidly right now and most are too distracted by the media circus to take note. These are deliberate distractions, not necessarily manufactured, but exaggerated greatly.


I suppose its more comforting to be distracted than to see that the global system which has kept the order for nearly 80 years is being radically re-negotiated , without input from the people. It would be hard for the masses to keep going through the motions if they knew the magnitude of changes they may soon be facing.",cryptocurrency

""",finance
personalfinance,Getting out of debt and saving,"First of all I freaking love Reddit. 
It’s like the family I never had, there’s literally a sub for everything. ❤️

Second of all, as the title says I need to get back on track. 
I’m 23F,  I recently bought my first car and my first house and got a way better paying job. With that being said my budget has been messed up since. 

Let me give you the nitty gritty 
 I make about $1600 USD net biweekly and $2100 gross. 
I make $26.45 an hour and work 40 hours a week. 
I have 2.5% of my gross going to an IRA account that’s matched by my work. My work will match up to 6% but I feel 2.5% is all I can afford. 

Since I am under 26 I’m still on my parents insurance which is actually causing me more harm then good since I don’t have an HSA account. 

Bills: 

car payment is $140.60 and there’s about $6,000 left on my loan

mortgage is about $1300 (I’m in a condo so that’s mortgage and HOA)

phone bill is about $110 (my work pays $65 of that and $60 of that is for my device itself)

Internet is $40 but that’s paid for by work. 

Electric is about  $25

Gas for the condo is about $35

Car insurance is $63

Gas in car is about $35 every week. 

Groceries about $60 every 2 weeks

Out n About class for my dogs $30 a month

Therapy $80 a month (that’s with insurance, yay the American health care system)

Dog food is $55 a month



Okay. So I’ll be the first to admit I royally screwed myself  with credit cards when I was 18/19 because I didn’t know better. 
I have about $3500 in credit debt left. 
Let me break that down. 

Chase Freedom- 1.5% cash back $1,800 on it and minimum payment of $25 25% interest rate. 

USAA-$918 on it and minimum payment of $15 10% interest rate. 

Capital One-$381 on it, minimum payment of $17  7.4% interest rate.  This account is currently restricted from when I lost my job a few years ago and couldn’t make payments 

Capital One- $288 on it. Minimum payment of $25 26% interest rate. 

Ulta- $288 on it minimum payment $30 and I believe interest is 26% 


I seriously want to get out of credit card debt and start saving money. My car broke down yesterday and it was a huge deal with how I was going to pay for it, I ended up putting it on a credit card. 

I also travel for dog sports but I usually go with friends and stay in super sketchy motel 6s. I’d say those trips cost me about $180 a weekend once every other month. That $180 includes food gas entry fees and room. 

I was getting my hair bleached every 6-8 weeks but I’m cutting back on that and going back to my natural color. 

I eat about 2/3 times a week and get a coffee once a week. 

Is there away to start saving and getting my debt down and still having a money to do the things I enjoy?


Please let me know if you have any questions, I’ll answer them as best I can.",finance

The total amount on all three is roughly 4K. I have been paying $25 on each monthly per the agreement I signed in court. My question is this. I should be getting enough back on my tax refund to pay off either the credit cards or the judgments but not both. Which should I pay off? I was thinking judgments but if I pay those off do they come off my credit immediately or do they stick for a certain amount of time and if they do would it just be better to pay off the credit cards since it is more immediate? Along with the 70K coming off my credit I am just trying to make the biggest improvement in my credit score to get the best rate on my (hopeful) new home.

personalfinance,Understanding Texas First Time Home Buyer Program,"Looking for help understanding this program and whether or not I should take advantage of it. I'm looking to buy my first home. I don't have 20% for a down payment, but my lender said that I qualify for this program. This program puts down 4% for me (which I do not have to repay, even after selling the home) while increasing the interest rate. I would also get a $2,000/year mortgage credit. What's attractive to me is that I would be able to keep the cash that I was going to use for a small down payment and put that toward other moving costs. My lender said that I can also refinance in the future when my fiance finishes grad school and starts working, so we're not stuck with the higher interest rate. Is this a smart way to go at this or does anyone have any insight on the program and any pitfalls that I'm not seeing. Thank you for any advice!",finance
personalfinance,Prepayment of Mortgage vs Investment and/or Pension,"I have read a lot about the benefits of investing additional disposable income into the market and/or retirement versus using those funds to prepay a mortgage loan.  I understand the basic premise is mortgage interest rates are very low and the gains from the market will generally exceed the interest paid.

Now, I am in year 5 of a 30 year fixed mortgage of $495,000 at 4.25%.  I have already paid it down to $400k and am self-employed and also just took over my family's other business which will basically guarantee an additional $100k in disposable income per year moving forward.  My thought is to take this money and pay approximately $8,000 per month as additional principal which will reduce the length of my loan to about five more years and save over $250k in interest.  

So my question is am I missing anything or is this the best strategy to pursue?  I am way to conservative to put all of my excess earnings into the market and should have more than enough time after my mortgage is paid to further invest in the market/diversify and contribute to a retirement.  I admit my retirement accounts are woefully underfunded, but I figure I can make up for this in 5 years when mortgage is done and/or take out a reverse mortgage one day and live off the equity in my home if all else fails.  

Any thoughts or insight are appreciated.  Thanks!",finance

This was also my highest earning year.

&amp;#x200B;

I was especially surprised, because I expect my number to be much lower than other people with a similar income since I live in an inexpensive house relative to my income, drive a cheap car, spend less (so lower sales tax), and I know other areas have higher income, sales, and property tax rates.

* Employer Insurance Premium  $5,496.00
* Property tax (car + house)  $4,069.60
* sales tax (no idea)  $0

* AGI  $121,770.00
* Tax Rate 48%

Edit: as u/dominick555 pointed out, I should add any employer contributions to my income.  Adding my employer's contribution to health insurance and FICA, my rate goes down to 43%. Adding in my 401k contributions (which aren't in the AGI number) to the denominator, my rate falls further to 38%.",finance

I have recently paid off all my debt with the exception of my mortgage. I owe $100,000 on a house worth about $300,000.  I have made some changes to my monthly expenses and have freed up about $600 a month. Does it make sense for me to put that $600 into the house in the form of an additional amount on my mortgage payment? My base mortgage payment is $760 right now and that includes insurance and property taxes.

Is that a wise use of the money or should I do something else with it? Retirement account contribution perhaps?

401K has about $50,000 in it and I contribute 5% with a 3% match.

Expenses break down like this:

\- Mortgage = $760

personalfinance,Is my debt going to screw me over this fall?,"Basically, for the better part of a year I've carried around a $1400-$1900 debt on a **$1500 limit** credit card that I have. This is one of those 5% cash back, high interest rate, no fee credit cards through RBC (Canadian company). I've never missed a *minimum* payment, and have bulk payed on it several times. Admittedly the reason I still have the debt is due to having a somewhat expensive lifestyle in that most days after working a full day (I work 40 hrs a week at an office), I tend to drive downtown and thus spend gas money and food money fairly often, meaning my chequing account will be in a tender place so I let certain expenses still charge to the credit card.

I understand this is shitty practice, and as of the last few months have stuck to a plan to attempt to crush it as soon as I can, but there are things I'm wondering if you guys could offer your best guess on in terms of advice.

This autumn I'm moving closer to town as I've applied for school in September, and want to be within bussing distance and begin living on my own (currently 22, live at parent's place paying rather large rent). My wonders lie in:

* Will this hit on my credit mean I likely won't get approved for becoming a tenant, assuming they do a credit check?
* Will this hit on my credit ruin my chances of getting a student loan?

I know that $1500 of debt hardly cracks the surface of some folks' experiences, but as someone who has never required a credit check, and has fretted over this for a while now (though like I said, have never missed a minimum payment at the very least), am I screwed?

so please bear with me.

so theres this federal w/h tax, fica hi, and fica oasdi, state taxes that i see on my paycheck and they take a huge chunk out of my income and not only that, i noticed that i get them twice a month. i get paid twice a month, so every 15th and every 30th i get those deductions

i am trying to figure our what are the percentages of these taxes and i guess its like a fixed rate??

so i tried to get my total income for that period and deduct the pretax deduction, and then i tried to find out the percentage of each tax (federal and state) based on my total.

based on my calculations we get taxed federal w/h tax 8.3% and fica hi 1.2% and fica oasdi 5.18%??

but since i get taxed twice a month, that means those percentage are actually higher?

unless those percentages are for each pay check and not for every month?

also, this is just my rough calculations... where do i actually find the actual rates/percentage for each tax?

and most importantly for state taxes, are there ways i can lessen the amount of money they take out of my paycheck?

its a little frustrating to see all of it go... :C

personalfinance,Buying a home or paying off my car.,"Hi there Reddit,

I recently bought a new car, which cost me about 25k I put zero down and got a 3.75% interest rate. The idea is just to pay it off as quickly as possible. As of the month I have paid off all my credit card debt.

Have been making 70k plus for the last five years and this year I'm pacing for 110k (but I'm in sales so that means nothing as this time last year I was pacing for 100k). I'm currently 26, and have enacting the snowball method per advice of this reddit so thanks for that. I put 15% towards ESPP (we are a pretty big and established tech company and have faith it's going to be sticking around for the long run) and 10% towards 401k. I have an emergency fund saved away plus if I ever need I can always sell my ESPP shares at anytime with no penalty from my employer except the taxes you pay on cashing out. 

With that being said since all my credit card debt has been paid that gives me roughly 1000-1500 a month towards debt after my monthly expenses. (With only dogs and me and my girlfriend splitting our living expenses evenly it's not very high) 

Now to the decision I have been renting for the last 5 years for extremely cheap first with roommates and then with the girlfriend I told myself I would buy a house this year but also after being on this thread would love to have zero debt to buy a new home. 

Based on this and the advice you wonderful people always give, do you recommend wasting money on rent one more year to be completely debt free before buying a house or 
Pushing off closing costs and using that money to pay off my vehicle. Or just adding to the debt I already have with a mortgage that could either appreciate or depreciate in the following years.

personalfinance,Debt Consolidation or file for bankruptcy?,"(sorry for poor format and any spelling errors, typing through mobile) 

So in my early life I was pretty awful with finances, my credit score was perpetually at sub 600.  I had acquired about $8,000 in debt for student loans.  I haven't paid a cent to them since 2011.  I also got into a car loan that I still owe about $17,000 on.  The car was repoed, and after another year the account was closed.  It was nearing the fall off time line and last year the bank sold the loan so it has been reopened.

So now that I've matured a little more into my late 20s I want to repair my credit as much as possible.  I work as a correctional officer and I make about 30k a year.  I'd like to be able to get a tax return next year so I'm trying to figure out what I can do to get myself onto the right track. 

I figure that I have one of two options.

1: Student loans offered a rehabilitation program that I can start paying off the loan at $90 a month and within 5 months of on time payments I'll be good standing and my tax return will no longer be offset.  For the car loan I'll file bankruptcy, although I have some questions about the two vehicles I own.

2.  I get a debt consolidation loan for everything, pay off everyone I owe, and start throwing all my spare cash to pay it off as quickly as possible. Due to my poor credit score it will likely be a high interest rate, so once my credit improves I can refinance for a better loan.

TLDR

My debt is

$8000 Student Loans 

$17,000 car loan.


Haven't made any real attempt to pay them in the past and I'm looking to improve my credit score

 I went to search on youtube privacy vs aml kyc and found NOBODY speaking on behalf of privacy.  This world is gone folks there is no freedom or privacy or personal dignity and I'm very depressed because it seems that people just are not opposing invasion of privacy and censorship.. And this is what it is all about.. they want kyc so they can eventually CENSOR  people's ability to use or spend money.  When we look at how many examples of speech are censored for POLITICAL reasons the conclusion becomes obvious.  

This is shaping up to tie in with china's social score (black mirror) so that eventually if YOUR VIEWS ARE outside what the STATE wants you will have no access to your money.

&amp;#x200B;

If you are into crypto and don't stand up for THE RIGHT FOR FINANCIAL PRIVACY then the 'crazy Christians end time prophesy' will be proven correct.  

&amp;#x200B;

Some articles on the subject.

KYC doesn’t always target the bad guys. It prevents impoverished people who may not have access to identification from opening bank accounts, freezing them out of credit which could be life saving. It can be wielded like a cudgel by the majority over minority groups. And most crucially for our purposes, it utterly obliterates any shred of anonymity or privacy.  [https://blocktelegraph.io/kyc-effect-bitcoin/](https://blocktelegraph.io/kyc-effect-bitcoin/)

&amp;#x200B;

Privacy, both financial and personal, is a key component of life in a free society. Unlike in totalitarian or authoritarian regimes, individuals in free societies have a private sphere free of government involvement, surveillance, and control. The United States Constitution’s Bill of Rights, particularly the Fourth, Fifth, and Ninth Amendments, together with structural federalism and separation of powers protections, is designed to further that end by protecting individual rights. The current financial regulatory framework is inconsistent with these principles.

Bitcoin,If Federal and Central Banks can print money. Why can’t they print money and buy all the available Bitcoin,"I have a simple question on my mind from a long time. What if central banks print all the money, use that money to purchase all the available bitcoin.

I know literally the consequences are due to demand the price keeps going up. But they can get them on OTC while suppressing the price by manipulating the media and other outlets with fud articles.

The other side effect could be they do not want to give too much power to existing whales to become central bank like monoliths of power. They could even print enough money to overcome that too.

Wonder why that is not starting to happen???",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Refinance student loans that were previously refinanced?,"I refinanced about 82.5k in student loans in April 2018 (actually only about 60k was refinanced because some of the interest rates were lower than what SoFi was offering). It dropped my interest rates from as high as 9% (variable 😭) to 5.75% (fixed). That being said, I’ve seen other financial institutes offer refinancing at lower rates than the 5.75%. I’ve never really looked into too much but was wondering if anyone else has refinanced student loans that they have already refinanced, especially if it was with SoFi. I haven’t dove into any of the paperwork that I signed with SoFi, but I don’t recall anything saying that I couldn’t refinance the loans with another institute at a later time. Any input is appreciated.

finance,Explained Tips to lower your personal loan interest rates in India,,finance
personalfinance,Mortgage companies requiring escrow for property tax?,"I'm looking to refinance a loan that I got about 8 years ago.

In my current loan (and prior home mortgage as well) I did not escrow property tax, since it is allowed in my state. I always pay early to get the early payment discount. 

I have started talking to banks to refinance at a lower interest rate, and they are telling me that they will require property tax escrow. This increases the cost of closing and I want to avoid rolling the closing costs into the loan. Certainly it's not the only factor in choosing a lender...if I get a super low APR then it's what I'll have to do. FWIW I have perfect credit...FICO is 850.

I hate lending them money for free, as they always collect way more than they need to. But one of my friends told me that this is fairly standard practice now and that the banks are requiring escrow on all their loans. Is this true?",finance
investing,Seemingly contradictory effects on bond markets,"I've recently taken an interest into what drives fluctuations in the bond market, specifically long term treasury bonds.  As I understand there are two major factors that drive bond prices:

* Interest rates: As interest rates increase, the resale value of your bond in the market decreases to stay competitive with newly issued bonds.
* Volatility and return in equities: As equities become less attractive investments, particularly for people with low risk tolerance, the demand for bonds increase as they are deemed safer.

However, these two factors should at least partially offset one another. When interest rates rise, the relative return of equities decrease, driving people to bonds.

Hypothetically, if the Fed were to raise interest rates by 0.5% tomorrow, what would be the impact to TLT?  Would the influx of demand drive up the price enough to offset the \~10% devaluing of existing bonds? Why or why not?",finance
personalfinance,"After reading some horror stories about accounts being hacked, is it a good idea to open an account with another bank to spread my money around?","Let's say I have $20k with Ally: $2k in checking and $18k in savings, because I don't want a lot of money being drained if someone gets my debit card.  

So I'm considering opening a savings account with Alliant and moving $10k into it, earning the same interest rate. Now my money is spread around, and I can transfer from Alliant to Ally if necessary. I could even open a checking account with Alliant so I have two debit cards.  

Is this a better move from a security standpoint? How about from a financial standpoint? The interest is about 2.2% at both banks anyway.  

I'd like to hear about anyone's experiences with this. Thanks.",finance

From what I've read I assume this would violate federal trade regulations, since the trade hasn't settled? Would this result in the 90 day restriction? If in the example, would this be different at all if it was two different securities? Does account balance/value matter?

personalfinance,"Money management for my retired mother, and financial advisor concerns","My 69-year-old mom retired from her full-time job a year ago.  She has monthly income from her pension and social security, but she also still has a mortgage, so she has continued to work part-time.  She recently inherited money which I'm hoping can help her eventually be fully retired (&amp; not working for the rest of her life).  She has recently talked to a financial advisor who I have some concerns about, and I'm hoping to get some outside perspective.

&amp;#x200B;

First, here is her financial situation:

&amp;#x200B;

**Monthly expenses (including mortgage):** around $4,500

&amp;#x200B;

**Monthly income:**

* \~$3,500 from pension &amp; social security combined
* $600-$700 from working part-time (therapist at a non-profit)  


**Assets:**

* A modest house in a high COL area
   * She still owes around $240,000 
   * The interest rate is 3.62%, and she refinanced about 8 years ago so there are still 22 years left on the mortgage
* Around $100,000 in IRA and TDA accounts
   * She has not started taking disbursements yet
   * She is extremely risk-averse, so both accounts are mostly in interest-only funds, with some percentage in the Vanguard Target Retirement 2015 Fund (after my encouragement a few years ago).  Since the market didn't do too well last year, she's unhappy about losing money in that fund (unrealized loss).
* Around $200,000 in a high-yield savings account earning 2%
   * Most of this was inherited very recently

&amp;#x200B;

**Debt:**  Just the house; she's always been very responsible with credit cards.

&amp;#x200B;

Since my mom is so risk-averse, I thought it could be a good idea for her to put some of the inheritance towards her mortgage, since it would be unlikely to get a 3.62% return without any risk anywhere else.  I also thought I-bonds could be good for something risk-free but still fairly liquid.

&amp;#x200B;

Though I have learned a lot from browsing this forum over the years, I'm not an expert, so I thought it could be helpful for my mom to talk to a fiduciary fee-only financial advisor, to see if they could help come up with a better plan.  I sent my mom a link to [http://www.napfa.org/](http://www.napfa.org/) but she ended up talking to a friend who was raving about their amazing financial advisor who helped them make a bunch of money.  I warned my mom that there's no such thing as a high return without higher risk, but agreed that it couldn't hurt to talk to this guy.

&amp;#x200B;

He says he's a fiduciary, but he does *not* appear to be fee-only, and his suggestions for my mom concerned me.  Here's what he's suggesting:

&amp;#x200B;

* Don't pay off the mortgage early (not worth it).
* He is suggesting that she move the cash inheritance to a **Prudential Premier Retirement Variable Annuity** with ""highest daily lifetime income benefit"".  
   * Supposedly, this would give a guaranteed 5% return, which doesn't sound right to me.  
   * Looking at the brochures, it also looks like you have to wait to actually withdraw money, which concerns me.  What if she has an unexpected expense and needs to access her money?  
   * Additionally, it seems like he glossed over anything about fees.  I found [this document](https://www.annuities.prudential.com/media/managed/documents/pruannuities_investor/premier_retire_va_pros_3.pdf?siteID=25) online (page 3) and these fees look absurd to me.
* He suggested moving her IRAs to Franklin Templeton Investments, to **Franklin Income Fund** which apparently outperformed its equity benchmark with lower risk.  
   * However, it is [clearly not without risk](https://www.franklintempleton.com/investor/products/mutual-funds/overview/1109/franklin-income-fund/FKIQX), and it seems like he gave my mom the impression that it would be (or glossed over anything about risks). 
   * He also didn't explain the fees, and from the link above, these fees look excessive too.

&amp;#x200B;

My mom says she wouldn't have to pay the financial advisor anything directly, which is even more concerning to me, because of what other potential hidden fees there might be.

&amp;#x200B;

If she is willing to take any investment risk, it seems to me that it would be much better to just stick to Vanguard index funds (probably just the 2015 or 2020 target retirement fund due to her age and risk tolerance).  However, she was disappointed when her target retirement fund lost money last year, so she wasn't too enthusiastic about that idea when I suggested it.  But it looks like the funds suggested by the financial advisor would have lost money last year too, so it really doesn't seem to me that he's offering anything special.  In fact, the fees would be higher, and it looks like (if I'm understanding correctly) the money would be less liquid.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, my mom was super excited about working with this guy because he made her feel confident that she won't have to work for the rest of her life, but I'm not convinced about his recommendations.  What do you guys think?  He works for **Transamerica Financial Advisors** which is an established company, but I'm also seeing some bad reviews of them online.

&amp;#x200B;

Are my concerns valid, or are these actually not terrible options for my mom?  If they are as terrible as they seem, does anyone have suggestions about specific facts I can share with my mom about why this is a bad idea?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, based on my mom's assets and expenses, what do you all think would be the best way for her to manage these finances to ideally last the rest of her life (hopefully 20+ more years)?

&amp;#x200B;

personalfinance,401k question,"We received the 2018 summary for my husband’s 401k account and it says our total earning is a 10% loss.

We are still far away from retirement (at least 20 years), but i just want to make sure we do the right things now for the future. The reason i kind of freaked out when i saw the -10 is because my 401k had a positive earning for 2018 so it seemed weird that his had a loss.

personalfinance,How should I go about paying off my student loans?,"I currently have student loans from 2 borrowers.

Loan 1: $16,415 (listed what I currently owe in parentheses)

- $5,500 @ 3.760% ($5,430.38) 
- $3,000 @ 4.450% ($2,969.62)

Loan 2: 1,700
- $1,700 @ 5.0% starting July 

I just started paying the first one off. My monthly payment is $173 and from my understanding, the default setting is that any excess amount paid per payment gets distributed. I plan on paying excess every time. 

So, as a default, if I pay $173+X amount, the X gets distributed to:
1. Accrued interest
2. Principal of the loan with highest interest rate (but I think it pays off some principal of each loan with majority toward highest rate and least toward lowest rate?)

I can change this so that the X gets distributed in any way I want. 

As for Loan 2, I haven’t started paying it off yet because the interest isn’t currently accruing, but not sure if that’s the best way to go.

How should I plan to pay off these loans? 

Should I change the way any excess payments get distributed across Loan 1? I was thinking either pay off lowest amount first so that I can knock out one at a time OR pay off highest interest rates first so that those get paid off first. And regarding Loan 2, should I start paying it all off now and try to pay it all off before July, which is when it’ll start accruing interest?",finance

personalfinance,Best action to get out of debt and raise my credit score?,"(sorry for poor format and any spelling errors, typing through mobile)

So in my early life I was pretty awful with finances, my credit score was perpetually at sub 600. I had acquired about $8,000 in debt for student loans. I haven't paid a cent to them since 2011. I also got into a car loan that I still owe about $17,000 on. The car was repoed, and after another year the account was closed. It was nearing the fall off time line and last year the bank sold the loan so it has been reopened.

So now that I've matured a little more into my late 20s I want to repair my credit as much as possible. I work as a correctional officer and I make about 30k a year. I'd like to be able to get a tax return next year so I'm trying to figure out what I can do to get myself onto the right track.

I figure that I have one of two options.

1: Student loans offered a rehabilitation program that I can start paying off the loan at $90 a month and within 5 months of on time payments I'll be good standing and my tax return will no longer be offset. For the car loan I'll file bankruptcy, although I have some questions about the two vehicles I own.

2: I get a debt consolidation loan for everything, pay off everyone I owe, and start throwing all my spare cash to pay it off as quickly as possible. Due to my poor credit score it will likely be a high interest rate, so once my credit improves I can refinance for a better loan.

TLDR

My debt is

$8000 Student Loans

$17,000 car loan.

Haven't made any real attempt to pay them in the past and I'm looking to improve my credit score

It's currently at 569 on trans union.

I'm not too worried about defaulting or missing payments, rather I'm now in a position to start aggressively paying back these loans. My current monthly payment is $213.51 and breaks down as follows, $36.01 on loan 1, $23.49 on loan 2, $47.16 on loan 3, $56.64 on loan 4, &amp; $50.21 on loan 5. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have $1,800 every month to put towards these loans. Unfortunately, I am required to make the minimum monthly payment on each loan, so I can't just put all $1,800 into the loan with a 4.66% interest rate. The way I currently approach the loans is by paying the minimum for all loans then use the remaining $1,586.49 towards my highest interest loan. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm asking the question from the title because I realized that some of my lower interest rate loans were accruing interest faster than my higher interest rate loans. Or perhaps its because my lower interest rate loans have larger principal balances so they're not accruing interest faster but rather just have a larger dollar amount because of the larger principal balance?

My real question is after all the information I've provided what is the most optimal way to pay off my existing loans with paying the least amount of interest? My goal is to pay off these loans by February of 2020.

Essentially what happened is I did not end up applying for IBR until July because the consolidation process ended up taking a long time. This was after beginning my new job but before getting my first paycheck. I got a start up bonus of $800 though. 

My concern is that I when applying for IBR I said that my income had not changed substantially since the previous tax year where I had no income, despite making $6-7k during the temp job and technically having started residency at time of application. My financial aid director at school said the money made with the summer job wouldn’t be enough to make a difference and that I should say my income hadn’t changed substantially, but I’m worried that since I applied after July 1 and the start of residency I effectively lied on the application regarding income change.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm kind of in a situation (and to be honest after paying these loans off for 3-4 years and having them in my name for almost a decade) that I can finally pay them off in full, but am unsure if I really should. Some stats to start:

Age: 28

Student Loans Left Over:  Just under 14k, all federal subsidized. The highest interest rate is 5.35% but that is at \~\~1600 bucks left.  The next one is at 3k at 5%. Everything else is below that. I started at 30k but let the loans sit while I was in college and also deferred a few years after while getting settled in school, so they grew to maybe 33k.

Current Income: 68k, but just threw my additional bonus into the loans to get it under 14k. Usually with bonuses and everything in I sit somewhere around 73k. I have also talked to my boss and he is recommending me for a promotion and I am really hoping to get it but it is in flux at the moment (I am trying to push but he is on vacation for the next week)...will keep bringing it up every week.

&amp;#x200B;

Current Savings: 5k in an ally savings, \~\~11k in a mixture of index funds (taxable account), and then a mixture of \~\~2k in checking accounts right now.

If i pay off all my loans as of today, I'd have between \~\~3.5-4.5k leftover which somewhat feels like a tight rope to walk in the event an emergency comes down but I really want to get this mental block of these damn student loans out of my head (kick that b\* sallie mae to the streets).

I've read the sidebar and there is a little bit of vagueness around loans that are between 4-6% because it is highly dependant on risk tolerance (as it discusses) and I am sort of at flux on what to do.  Dave Ramsey's channel says just keep 1k in savings, but that feels tough.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess my question to the community here is if anyone has been in this situation, what did you do? And if not, if you were in the situation, what would yo do?

&amp;#x200B;

I really want to just pay them off, but having between 3-4.5k leftover seems really light in the event something happens and it keeps me at edge to just do it. I get that this is more of an emotional decision than a mathematical one.

I don't own a home/condo (will probably be a condo since I live near NYC)  right now, but can foresee doing that in the future at some point as well. Don't wanna knock the idea of it.

So, it seems like recently, or maybe for even longer, the big AAA titles are produced in such a way that's so disconnected from what I actually find interesting, and want.  There's little in the way of innovation from what I can see.

Even Minecraft, which was a work of genius in my eyes, when it was picked up by Microsoft just....crammed a bunch of non innovate elements into it and called it progress, endlessly tweaking it to resell it over and over again.

The focus on the dazzling visuals, the fast paced gameplay just feels hollow.  It's like the industry did a bunch of analysis on what elements made games sell well 15 years ago, but we as an audience just matured and grew up more.

I know personally I've changed.  Books, movies, games and shows that I loved when I was young...when I've taken the time to revisit them so many of them are actually just awful now.  Some of this, like when comparing the original X-Men films to some of the more modern marvel movies, are just due to that technological, flashy progress that we're also seeing in games.  But unlike movies, games actually are an intereactive experience where you might get to **discover** and **experience** the story versus having it completely spoon fed to you.

It's like, when a game lives long enough for some other team to take the reigns and move forward with the intellectual property...the chances that they actually produce something high quality the hardcore fanbase will enjoy are pretty much dead out of the gate.  Blizzard is really coming to mind here.

Am I alone in this perception, or are there other people out there who just don't need amazing and expensive to produce visuals to have a satisfactory experience that I want to come back to again and again.

Despite all this, there are still really good games out there, like Breath of the Wild.  The whole approach to that game was vastly different.  I read that the director of Breath of the Wild made a demo for Miyamoto, the original creator of the Zelda series, trying to sell it to him and get his blessing and approval of the direction he was going to take things....Miyamoto ended up climbing trees for hours on the playthrough.  But anyway, over there even though the people behind the actual creation of the game were different, they were driven to have the original creative drive give them their blessing and approval that the game they were making was just fun enough.  I think that's why it's a winner, and that's why it's amazing.  They rose to the potential of what games could be and should be, but so many other corporations are just forgetting about.

personalfinance,Should I consolidate Student Loans?,"So I am right about the point where I need to start making payments on my student loans. I have a huge variety of loans:

3k @ 6.2%

11.5k @ 7.8%

1.5K @ 11.865%

15k @ 8%

10K @ 4-5%

&amp;#x200B;

I want to consolidate since I have loans from three separate companies and don't want to overstretch myself making three different monthly payments. I am worried however that the interest rate I get from a consolidation loan may not be as good as some of the Federal Student Loans.

personalfinance,"Doing well, but still have debts, need some advice","Hi Personal Finance,

I posted here previously, qnd since then have gotten a new job which netted me a 100% raise. 

That being said, I still have student loans that I am working through (~30K.) Those loans have a reasonably high interest rate (which I'm not struggling to pull off, 6 and 7%). I also own a condo with a morgage at about 190K/4.2%. That condo has gained about 130K in market value since purchase about 2 years ago.

I'm wondering if it would be a good move to somehow consolidated my student debt using the added value in my condo, hopefully to get a lower interest rate. I lnow that it wouldn't eliminate the debt, but the saved interest money could be put back into the loan to pay it off faster. 

Does this sound off base? Any pitfalls I should be taking into consideration?

personalfinance,Student Loan Advice,"Hello! Long time reddit reader, first time ever posting 😬 

I have $97,000 in student loan debt. Current interest rate is 6.88%. This current situation will never be paid off if I continue as is. Current monthly payment is $470 (IBR). 

I have an opportunity to refinance my loans. My workplace has a partnership with a company (SoFi - any reviews?) that would offer a discount on the interest rate. The interest rate would typically be 6.349% with the new company, but with my discount the new interest rate would be 4.72%. The loan would be paid off in 20 years, but with an incredibly high monthly payment. 

I am interested in possibly selling my stocks that I inherited (thanks grandpa!) to bring the balance lower. As of today, the stocks are at $46,000. What are the pros and cons of this? What are the tax implications? If I do nothing, it will never end. Are there any other options besides paying a lump sum or a high payment to get this debt out of my life? If I ever leave my job, I lose the discounts on the interest rate. 

Other facts:
My salary is 30k. I am 31. My other-half makes 85k and has 82k in student loan debt. Current monthly payment $270 (IBR). Fingers crossed for student loan forgiveness. We do contribute to retirement. $3000 in the bank currently. We pay our mortgage weekly ($430/week). We have an almost 1 year-old who attends daycare ($350/week). We own one car with no payment.

personalfinance,Can we afford to buy a house?,"Husband and I live in San Jose where the average cost of a home is extraordinarily high. He works at a tech company and is given stock every year in addition to his salary in which a percentage vests every 6 months that we have never accessed. We live primarily on salary alone. We are looking at purchasing a home as we plan on staying in the area for 5+ years and housing costs continue to rise. We spoke with a home mortgage consultant about what we can afford and this is what we discussed:

Asking price of home: $965,000
Down payment: $150,000
Reported interest rate: 4.125%
Property tax: 1.25%
HOA: $278 
*The Mortgage Consultant stated that we would NOT be getting PMI despite the fact that we do not have a 20% down payment. Does this sound accurate?

Long story short, we don’t feel as though we can afford this despite the Mortgage Consultant’s advice indicating otherwise. It would mean that 70% of our net income would be going towards housing costs. Is this insane? Is the “30% rule” based on gross or net income?

personalfinance,"27, $67k/year, Awful Credit. Any advice for improving my credit?","After 3 years of jumping around temp jobs, being suddenly laid off 3 different times and spending about 8 months of those 3 years unemployed, I recently was offered a full time job at the last contracted job I worked. 

Thankfully, each of my contracts increased in pay and the job I secured pays $67k annually, which is relatively high paying for someone in my field, my age, and in my city (75th percentile). My company offers incredible benefits - no premium for health benefits, 401k match. I bring home around $1900 bi-weekly, and my bills are around $1400 monthly, which means I have a little over $12k annually for the rest of my living expenses.

However, because I spent a lot of time unemployed, I don't have any savings besides a small 401k. Also, I went delinquent on my federal student loans, car loans, and had a private loan go to collections. All of this left my credit in the shitter.

personalfinance,"I owe $6,600 before I can return to college because of financial aid office made a mistake?","It all began in the summer of 2018.

&amp;#x200B;

I filled out my FAFSA application per usual, except this time I claim myself as an independent because my last living parent passed away November of 2017. I usually receive federal Pell grant, NJ's State Tuition Aid Grant (TAG), Federal SEOG Grant, Federal Sub Loan, and Federal Unsub Loan. I used to pay off the 2017-2018 year by accepting the full amounts of the grant and federal loans, and paying off the rest of the bill out of savings. Which I had to pay off about $3000. However, at the time of summer 2018, I had absolutely no money in my bank account, living off of free housing by my college, and paying for food by working a minimum wage job in my college. I had planned to pay off the bills for the 2018-2019 year with a bigger federal loan. I have heard from my resident building coordinator if I claim as an independent, I can potentially accept bigger loans. Having no other choice, I claim as an independent on my FAFSA and sent my application. Later on, I receive from HESAA, stating that they haven't received the appeal of dependency override form. I've already shown my next of kin and my father's death certificate to my financial aid office and they've made copies of it before. So, naturally, I go to my financial aid office, asking for the correct form to hand in which then I fill out and hand in with the supporting documents.

&amp;#x200B;

Over a period of a month, I still received e-mails from HESAA claiming they haven't received my dependency override form. I call my financial aid office asking if everything is okay and if I needed to hand in anything extra. The lady on the line tells me everything is fine, they will send the form to HESAA soon. September rolls around and school starts. I'm still getting e-mails from HESAA stating this is my final warning before they pull out the state grant which is about $5,600. Panicking, I rush to my financial aid office asking what is going on, and then they told me I haven't submitted the correct form. How could I submit the wrong form when I literally asked them which form to hand in when I entered their office during summer and I also double checked with a lady I called to the financial aid office. Then they tell me it's my fault and I was supposed to hand in this other certain form. I don't remember if they made me fill out a dependency status verification form initially or the appeal for a dependency override. However, by the time the financial aid office could fix it, HESAA pulled out the state grant. Which left a huge bill I had to take care of. I meet with the Dean of Students about this, she tells me, unfortunately, she cannot do much but to apply for the hardship program which could possibly let my college forgive my bill partially or fully.

&amp;#x200B;

I apply for the hardship program and get completely rejected by the committee who reviewed my case. Of course, I couldn't focus on coursework while I was trying to figure this out the whole semester. At this point I couldn't even focus on the whole bill, because my next worry was I am going to become homeless in a month. At this point, I'd like to remind you guys I have no home, no savings only $300 in emergency money, no car, nothing. I only had my friends to rely on for resource, which I absolutely hate myself for doing. I once again shamefully ask my friends if they have any shelter I can potentially be in. I was eventually referred to another person one of my friends knew. The deal was to only pay $150 monthly. After the semester ended, I get a call from the college's retention manager asking if I am returning for the next semester. I pretty much told her, I don't really have a choice, because I don't have $6,600 laying around. She told me she is speaking with a person to figure this out, but every time I would call back every once in a while to check for updates, she always tells me, I'll speak with that person again and get back to you later. But she never does. I pretty much accepted at this point they don't really care or can't do anything but they're just not telling me?

&amp;#x200B;

So, I eventually move out of the dormitory to live in this stranger's house. I pay off the first two months with the last remaining money I have. For the first two months, I was just applying everywhere, trying to get a job. For food, I just ate either pizza rolls or chips or just starve for 1-2 days, because I just couldn't afford anything. This month I have also been told that the rent will be increased to $270 because of utility bills increasing and I would probably have to move out by May because they're moving out. So I have to again find another place to live. I only finally been recently able to land a job as a busser at a restaurant a couple of days ago. Thank god they provide free soup and bread. But I'm still in debt because I had to borrow money from friends just for transportation, food, and rent. I also have to buy these required work clothes and shoes for my job. However, with the little amount of money I can get, I have to spend it on food, transportation, rent, basic hygienic things (haircut, shampoo, ...) How am I supposed to save up $6,600 within the span of 5 months when I have to buy all these basic things just to survive because I don't have anything? What do I do?

# **Week Ahead: Fed to make important forecasts as stocks on 'precipice' of breaking out  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/15/fed-to-make-forecasts-as-stocks-on-precipice-of-breaking-out.html)**
*****
&gt; The Fed's meeting is the big deal for markets in the coming week, and it is widely expected to send a message that investors in both bonds and stocks could find bullish.
*****
&gt; But analysts in both markets say the Fed's message has been well telegraphed, and market response could be tepid or even a ""sell the news"" reaction.
*****
&gt; The key for both markets will be what the economic data shows, after a series of weak reports. Thursday's regional Philadelphia Fed survey and PMI data Friday on manufacturing and the services sectors will be important. Existing home sales are also released Thursday.
*****
&gt; ""The first quarter has not exactly been a hallelujah quarter, and the Fed has to acknowledge that,"" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.
*****
&gt; The Fed is expected to hold interest rates steady, but it is also expected to issue a new forecast with fewer rate hikes and a slower economy. The Fed also is likely to announce the end of its operation to unwind its balance sheet, but economists are divided on which month this year it will actually end the program.
*****
&gt; Stocks surged in the past week with the best performance since November for the S&amp;P 500, which ended up 2.9 percent. At the same time Treasury yields, which move opposite price, continued to fall. The bench mark 10-year Treasury slipped below 2.60 percent Friday, its lowest yield since June 4, and the 2-year was at 2.43 percent.
*****
&gt; The fact that both markets are rising at the same time is somewhat unusual, and at some point the trend could break in favor of one market versus the other.
*****
&gt; An easier Federal Reserve, meaning one less inclined to drive up rates, is viewed as a positive for stocks because higher interest rates can slow the economy and send borrowing costs higher for companies and investors. Bond yields also head lower when the Fed is not likely to raise interest rates.
*****
&gt; ""This could be an interesting week,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. He said it should be positive for stocks if the Fed reduces its forecast for rate hikes and delivers on expectations.
*****
&gt; ""This is the meeting where we get more clarity on the balance sheet reduction. Both those things would be an affirmation of where things are right now. It's also technical…where we close [on the S&amp;P] puts us on a precipice of breaking out,"" said Hogan.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 closed at 2,822, near the key 2,825 level which is the upper end of a big band of resistance. ""The only down week of the year was the week before this, and the trend has been higher,"" he said.
*****
&gt; But Paul Christopher, Wells Fargo Investment Institute chief international investment strategist, said the stock market could actually have little reaction to the Fed because Fed officials have been very dovish in public comments.
*****
&gt; ""It could be neutral or perhaps even negative. What more can they say? You might see some people selling the fact,"" he said. Christopher said he sees the market as stretched, and it could sell off. But then, there could be a buying opportunity.
*****
&gt; ""We think stocks have to start to feel better about the economy first,"" he said, adding a trade deal with China could be a positive.
*****
&gt; The Fed's actions could also already be priced into the bond market, according to George Goncalves, head of fixed income strategy at Nomura. He said what really matters is what risk markets, or stocks, do in response.
*****
&gt; ""There's scope for risk to do better and the Fed's not hiking. You can see it rally into the summer and the economy will look better and if that happens that will be a buying opportunity for rates,"" he said.
*****
&gt; Economists see the Fed reducing its forecast for two rate hikes to one or even none for this year. They also expect it to say it will end its program to reduce the balance sheet, but they don't agree on whether that happens in June, September or closer to the end of the year.
*****
&gt; The Fed is currently reducing its balance sheet by allowing securities to roll down as they mature, instead of replacing all of them as it previously did. It now theoretically could allow $60 billion a month to roll off, but Fed officials could change that program and begin to repurchase securities to replace them.
*****
&gt; The markets are also waiting to hear if the Fed will focus solely on Treasury securities, and at what part of the curve – or duration. In the past it had purchased mortgages but is expected to discontinue that.
*****
&gt; ""We think they're back to buying Treasurys by Oct. 1. Somethings got to give. At some point, its either that [bond market] people are too pessimistic and the economy is going to do well because the Fed is behind the curve, or we have another kind of correction on our hands in the next six to nine months,"" he said. ""We just have to pass through time There's a powerful faith-based system around easy money can fix all things.""
*****
&gt; Swonk said she expects the Fed to continue to forecast one rate hike for this year. The Fed interest rate forecasts appear as anonymous dots from individual Fed officials on a chart, known as the ""dot plot.""
*****
&gt; Even so, she doesn't expect the Fed will actually raise rates but it will continue to give itself flexibility. Economic data has been mixed with some very poor reports, like December's retail sales, which fell 1.6 percent, and February's jobs report, which showed job growth of just 20,000 jobs, 160,000 below forecast.
*****
&gt; ""I think they have to walk a fine line between acknowledging the weakness we've seen and then also show that we're still going to see growth this year,"" she said.

# Irish Eyes Shine on Market Last 25 Years, but Monday After Sunday St. Patrick’s Day Weaker

&gt; Saint Patrick’s Day is the only cultural event that perennially lands in March. Over the years gains the day before Saint Patrick’s Day have proved to be slightly better than the day itself and the day after. Perhaps it’s the anticipation of the patron saint’s holiday that boosts the market and the distraction from the parade down Fifth Avenue that causes equity markets to languish. Perhaps it’s the all the green folks don that stirs up thoughts of money and market gains. More likely, it’s the fact that Saint Pat’s typically falls in historically bullish Triple-Witching Week.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c625182aa350a6356847eb0e14d70a58/tumblr_inline_poey5afw611spdppr_1280.jpg))**

&gt; Whatever the case, since 1950, the S&amp;P 500 posts an average gain of 0.19% on Saint Patrick’s Day (or the next trading day when it falls on a weekend), a gain of 0.13% the day after and the day before averages a 0.24% advance. S&amp;P 500 median values are 0.17% on the day before, 0.20% on Saint Patrick’s Day and 0.07% on the day after.

&gt; In the nine years when St. Patrick’s Day falls on a Sunday like this year, since 1950, Friday advanced an average 0.15% and the following Monday suffered an average loss of -0.08%. However, over the last 25 years market performance on Saint Patrick’s Day and the day after has improved, up 72% of the time on the Holiday with an average gain of 0.57%.

# The Bespoke Report – Break Out the Monocle

&gt; Below is an updated look at our ETF Asset Class Performance Matrix, which shows the total returns of key ETFs across assets classes on both a YTD, MTD basis as well as over the last week. How strong were global equity markets this week? Well of all the equity-related ETFs in the matrix, not a single one finished the week in the red. Even Industrials (XLI), which were dragged down by Boeing (BA), managed to eke out a gain of 0.2%. Among US indices, the Nasdaq 100 blew away the field rallying over 4%, but every other US index ETF was up over 1.4%. International markets were even stronger with India (PIN), Brazil (EWZ), and China (ASHR) all rallying more than 4%. Rounding out the four names from BRIC, Russia (RSX) even rallied 3.5%. In terms of YTD leaders, China and Crude oil are neck and neck for the top spot with gains of 25%+.

# The Most Loved Stocks in the S&amp;P 500

&gt; Earlier this week we provided a full update on analyst sentiment across sectors and individual stocks in our Closer report. Below are a few charts and tables that we’ve pulled from the big report in case you’re interested.

&gt; As shown below, there are 22 analyst ratings per stock in the S&amp;P 500 on average. But Energy and Communication Services have more than 29 ratings per stock! It’s hard to find an edge with nearly 30 analysts covering a name.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/ratingsper.png))**

&gt; Notably, the Energy sector also has the highest percentage of analyst Buy ratings, which is surprising given that Energy has been the weakest sector of the market since the S&amp;P peaked last September. It looks like analysts think the sell-off for Energy has caused valuations to become more attractive.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/buyratings.png))**

&gt; Below is a table listing the S&amp;P 500 stocks with the highest percentage of Buy ratings right now. There are 3 stocks in the index that have 100% Buy ratings — Marathon Petroleum (MPC), ABIOMED (ABMD), and Keysight Tech (KEYS). Both MPC and ABMD are basically flat this year, but KEYS is up 39% YTD. Even after the gains, though, analysts still love KEYS.

&gt; Other notables on the list of most loved stocks include mega-caps like Amazon.com (AMZN) with 93.9% Buy ratings, Alphabet (GOOGL) with 93.2% Buy ratings, and Microsoft (MSFT) with 91.9% Buy ratings. Diamondback Energy (FANG) is the most loved Energy sector stock, while AMETEK (AME) is the most loved Industrials stock.

# S&amp;P 500 Sector Trailing 12-Month P/E Ratios

&gt; The S&amp;P 500’s trailing 12-month P/E ratio got down into the low 15s at the bottom in late December, but we’ve seen huge P/E expansion as the market has rallied back. As of this afternoon, the S&amp;P’s trailing 12-month P/E sits at 18.61. Even still, that’s well below readings in the 20s that were seen for a number of weeks in 2018.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/spxpe0315.png))**

&gt; Below we show one-year P/E ratio charts for major S&amp;P 500 sectors. Since the December lows, we’ve seen P/E expansion in every sector, but the one that stands out the most is Utilities.

&gt; We went into detail on extended valuations for the Utilities sector in yesterday’s Chart of the Day for members, but you can see the spike up to 19.80 in the one-year chart for Utilities below. At 19.80, only Technology, Health Care, and Consumer Discretionary have higher trailing 12-month P/E ratios than Utilities right now.

# Pre-Election-Year March Historically Stronger

&gt; As of today’s close, this pre-election year March is below average when compared to it historical performance. Strong market performance in pre-presidential-election year frequently translates into above average performance for individual months. March is a month that typically enjoys a nice boost, but so far it has not occurred. Prior to the gains of today and yesterday, this March was well off its average levels. This March and past pre-election year average performance has been plotted in the chart above and the gap in performance is readily visible.

&gt; Strong gains in January and February had major indexes right at key resistance levels at the start of the month and when they failed to break out profit taking ensued. Slowing global growth, naming in China and the EU along with ongoing trade concerns and last Friday’s tepid jobs report have all weighed on stocks. Heavy selling of DJIA’s largest component, Boeing (BA) has kept that index in check this week. Despite sign of slowing growth, the US economy is still on relatively firm ground when compared to other regions. Further market gains are likely, but progress is probably going to be choppy.

# What Type of Pullback Could We See?

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Index corrected nearly 20% from the September peak until December 24 before staging a furious rally of 19%. What could happen next? A well-deserved pullback would be perfectly normal, and in fact, is probably needed before another surge higher can occur. Now the $64,000 question: Would a pullback be a retest of the December lows, a 10% correction, or something more modest?

&gt; As we discussed in our recent Weekly Market Commentary: Modest Pullback Or Something Bigger? we think a pullback in the range of 3–5% is the most likely scenario. “We continue to see solid fundamentals, valuations that are quite reasonable, the strong possibility of a U.S.-China trade deal over the coming months, and healthy market technicals,” explained Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. In fact, six technical indicators we mentioned in the recent commentary suggest a pullback could offer buying opportunities for suitable investors:

&gt; * The S&amp;P 500 is above its upward sloping 50-day moving average (MA), suggesting an improving trend, and at support in the form of its 200-day moving average.
&gt; * March has been the second strongest month for the stock market over the past 20 years.
&gt; * Stocks tend to go up in the final 10 months of a year (25 out of the last 27 years) after experiencing gains during January and February.
&gt; * Market breadth is favorable, with a high proportion of stocks participating in this year’s advance.
&gt; * Investor flows have been negative in 2019—evidence of caution, not euphoria
&gt; * Investor sentiment surveys suggest bulls are not in overabundance.

&gt; Last, as our LPL Chart of the Day shows, it’s important to remember that the S&amp;P 500 has been higher a year after every midterm election since World War II—that’s 18 out of the past 18 midterms—with an average return of 14.2%. President Trump views the stock market as part of his re-election path, suggesting this pattern could hold once again. With the S&amp;P 500 up only 1.3% since the midterm election last November, there indeed could still be room for stocks to run in 2019.

personalfinance,Settlement check came in; best debt to put it toward?,"Hey all, I feel like I know the answer to this, but I would like a second opinion. I just got a settlement check for $7700, and I am thinking I would be best served by paying off my CC then putting the rest in my emergency savings. My breakdown is like this:

* Identifying: 28/M/Single/Healthy

* Monthly income: $2550

* Rent: $900

* Mileage card: $6400 at 18.2%, paying $600/mo in addition to what I put on it

* Student loans: $17000 at 3-4%, paying $200/mo. Have not yet applied for income based payments.

* Savings (current total): About $900

No car payment, no other CCs, no tickets outstanding to take care of. I'm pretty frugal but used my CC to fund a move to the West coast and have been paying it down quickly (I feel). It makes the most sense to me to pay off the highest interest rate then put funds into my emergency savings, say in case I become unemployed, sick, my car dies, whatever.

personalfinance,"Why is my State Income Tax HIGHER than my Federal Income Tax? Baltimore, MD","Edit: I did not realize that the state standard deduction was so much lower than the federal one. My state taxes are proportionally high because I don't make very much and the state tax rate is effective on much more of my income than the federal one. Thank you!

&amp;#x200B;

I live and work in Baltimore, MD. I am 24 and not super familiar with tax filing yet, so I am sorry if this question has a really obvious answer but I just don't understand.

On my W2, my gross pay for this year was around $21,000. From that, $908 was withheld for federal income tax and $975 was withheld for MD State income tax.

When I input this W2 into popular online tax filing sites, it says my federal refund is about $30 but that I actually OWE $190 more to MD. I took the standard deduction and do not own a home or a car (I rent and walk where I need to go), nor do I have any loans. I am single. I had one job through the whole year and didn't make money other ways.

As far as I know, my federal tax rate should be 12%. My MD state tax should be 5% (and no MD income tax is more than 5.75%). Even with the Baltimore city tax rate of 3.2%.. how are my state taxes so much higher when the rates seem to be lower? Can someone help me understand this? It just doesn't seem right. Everything I've seen seems to indicate that state taxes are almost always lower than federal.

financialindependence,"I've spent my entire career in the federal system so far. I'm getting major FOMO seeing peers leave to the private sector, but staying seems like an easy path to FIRE?","Preface: I do know /r/govfire is a sub, but this sub has more traffic and I need perspectives from non-govvies.


I joined the military as a teenager and at the end of my contract went right into a federal civilian job making $100k~. At this point I'm 29, maxing out my tax-advantaged savings vehicles, and slowly building up a mediocre pension. I don't hate my job, but I'm also very much on board with the idea of a comfortable retirement in my 40s instead of a lavish one in my 60s, thus the FIRE desire. My current savings rate should allow this.

I'm in a LCOL/MCOL area - you can buy a 1500sqft house for less than $100k if you want to live in the worse areas. There's a lot of gentrification going on, but it's a pretty big culture difference from where I grew up on the coast. Like my job, I don't hate it, it's just...okay.

On one hand, sticking it out in this federal job seems like an incredibly safe path to FIRE. Job security is insane here, pay generally adjusts with inflation and I can expect a couple more promotions before I basically cap out in the $140k range. 40 hour work weeks with plenty of time off and decent (not great) benefits. I could putter along here and probably be FIRE-ready in my mid 40s. My long-term coworkers on the federal side are obviously fairly biased in favor of the federal career and will tell me of the long work weeks and constant layoffs of the private sector.

On the other hand, *I've never actually had a real job in the private sector, just some teenage minimum wage work.* I'm the field of cyber security, and fairly well qualified on paper. I've seen coworkers leave for industry jobs with a 50-100% pay raise, with some of them making over $200k. Obviously this usually involves moving to a much higher COL area (CA, DC, etc). This is very tempting since if I could keep my costs under control there's the potential to drastically increase the amount I'm saving - although not necessarily my rate.  I've run my resume around a few times and these opportunities seem real and attainable if I'm willing to uproot my life/career and pursue them. I also feel like I'm selling myself short by only really ever having one ""career"" and not seeing what else is out there. I might not only be missing out on compensation, but also the opportunity to do something different in a big city for a big corporation or trendy start-up. 

Has anyone here made a decision like this? I can't tell if I'm over-romanticizing non-government work since I've never really done it, or selling myself short by sticking with the ""safe"" option. I don't want to look a gift horse in the mouth but I also don't want to be stagnant.",finance

I'm at a crossroads now regarding pursuing grad school vs. employment and need some advice about my future.,"I'm 23, in a week I will graduate with a BS in Physics and a minor in EE from a decent engineering school on the West Coast. I have about 30k in federal loans.  

I was accepted to a top 10 masters program for aerospace engineering. The school is in a great location, has good connections with a nearby leader in the industry, and opportunities for research that I find very interesting. The department offered no financial assistance and the price tag without any would be around 80k for two years. I'm too busy with finishing school and dealing with the aforementioned health issues to devote the energy to finding aid right now and I'm afraid that most of the fellowships and grants will be gone by the time I can do so. Thus I feel that at best I'm looking down the barrel of over 100k in federal loans to educate myself. 

I have already asked many questions and read many responses and most of the advice given to people in my situation who are considering an engineering masters right after undergrad is to go find a job first and get them to pay for your education. Since the masters would be in a different field than my undergrad I am having a difficult time adapting that advice to my situation. 

Although the price tag scares me I find the idea of getting a graduate education from this institution very exciting. I was born with scoliosis and have spent most of my life and undergrad fighting my body and figuring out how to deal with and succeed despite the fact that my spine is not as straight as it should be and all the problems that manifest because of that fact. I know a lot of my engineering classmates who had jobs lined up straight out of undergrad because they were able to devote the appropriate time and energy to taking advantage of the opportunities available to them. I feel that if I were to accept this schools offer and find a way to pay for it I would be able to use the knowledge and wisdom that I have gained from my experience to put myself in a similar position and get a high-paying industry job after graduation that would allow me to pay off my loans in a timely manner. 

At the same time I know this picture is probably too rosy for reality and that there is a lot that my analysis is missing or unaware of. I am very nervous to put myself 6 figures into debt but also hesitant to turn down what seems to be an amazing opportunity. What would you do?",finance

Got a call today from my bank (caller ID confirmed) saying they'd seen fraud on my ATM card (telling me the last 4 digits of my ATM card) at a Walmart in Florida.

I live in Colorado. Of course that wouldn't be me, and yes I do have the ATM card in my possession. They never asked for the full card number.

While they put me on a brief hold to verify something, I did a reverse lookup on the phone number, it DID match my bank. They sent me an SMS code to verify over the phone, the shortcode of the sending number ALSO matched my bank's SMS shortcode.

Figured everything was legit, gave them my home address to ship me my new card. They put me back on hold ""to talk to a manager"" to waive an additional fee to expedite sending the card.

But it was NOT my bank.

While they put me on that second hold they withdrew almost $1,000 in small increments at an ATM in California. (again, I live in Colorado)

I hung up, \*I\* called my bank, they verified they did NOT call me, had no record of possible fraud in Florida but that the six ATM withdrawals in California DID flag as fraud.

I happened to record the phone call of the ""bank"" calling me, so I'm sending the phone recordings to my \*actual\* bank.

Meanwhile I have to wait 10 days to get the $1,000 back. Yay.

Thank goodness for things like an emergency fund, so the lack of the cash doesn't hurt, but still a major nuisance.

Quick edit: Thanks for the incoming messages about this and the genuine support. Many have had similar experiences, and I posted this as a reminder to all that you should always call your bank yourself to verify anything, never verify anything on an incoming call.

\---

**EDIT for clarification from several comment conversations:**

Here's what likely happened: they spoofed my bank's phone number, asked me where I wanted the new ATM card shipped thus I verified my mailing address. They followed my bank's verification playbook and said they were sending me a verification code via SMS, which I then relayed. What was very likely happening on another phone line was they were social-engineering my bank, pretending to be me, verified my mailing address, verified the SMS code which I relayed to them, and likely changed my ATM card PIN so they could withdraw cash. Even down to my bank charging a fee for rushing a new card and waiving the fee in case of fraud. This was a VERY clever social engineering feat.

**ALSO an important note:** there are tons of apps out there which can record phone calls, but the legality of this depends on where you live AND the location where the person/business on the other end of the call are located. One comment has a link to a lawsuit where the second party was NOT in a one-party-consent state, which makes recording a phone call illegal. Always tell your caller that you're recording the call. I miss being on Google Voice that could play a message that you were recording the call etc..

\---

**Friendly reminder of the day** (besides drink more water, go out and enjoy some sunshine, and be nice to one another)

personalfinance,Existing universal life policy for parking emergency fund cash?,"When I was a teenager (late 80's) I took out a small ($10k) cheap ($100/year or so) universal life policy with AAL (now Thrivent) as part of applying for a scholarship they offered to policy holders.  Over the next several years my parents paid the premiums, and the policy built up enough of a cash value that it's been funding the insurance premiums for a few decades (though admittedly the cash value is slowly dwindling).  I've mostly just let the thing run on auto-pilot for almost 30 years, figuring there was enough insurance there to pay for my funeral expenses, but otherwise it wasn't worth messing with.  Current projections show the policy lapsing due to a lack of self-funding somewhere when I'm between 80 and 100 years old.

Recently when I was reviewing some policy documents I believe I discovered that the cash component has a guaranteed 4.0% interest rate.  That's definitely better than the 0.1-0.15% my money is earning in bank checking and savings accounts (yeah yeah, I should probably have been keeping that money in Capital One or Ally or such).  I also understand you can withdraw the cash component as you will, with tax implications when withdrawing gains. I realize it may take a few weeks to get access to cash withdrawals (request, processing, mailing a check, depositing that check, clearing, etc.).

Putting all this together, I've started to wonder if it might be in my best interest to park my emergency fund savings, and possibly even some of my general savings as well, in the universal life policy's cash value component.

We live relatively modestly for our income, have no debt other than a mortgage, already hit federal maximums for 401(k), Roth IRA, and HSA savings each year, and we budget adequate savings for all the usual stuff (vehicles, house repairs, insurance deductibles, etc.).  So this is ""true emergency"" money, such as for temporary loss of income or losses beyond insurance coverage, and we've exhausted pretty much all the usual tax advantaged savings mechanisms.  The cash under consideration isn't destined for an investment where it may lose value (e.g. stocks); its primary purpose is savings, not growth.  But as long as the value is safe, it might as well grow as much as possible.

At the moment I'm not seeing any downside to this idea other than the temporary liquidity problem should I need to put my hands on funds quickly.  As best I know Thrivent is a well-run company, and the risk of default on their end appears minimal (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong).

The one outstanding question which could throw a wrench in the works is what happens to the cash value should I die before withdrawing it?  I find various articles about whole life which seem to indicate that the insurance company would retain the cash value (can this be right?), but I cannot seem to dig up any statement to this effect regarding universal life.

**TL;DR: Apart from the time lag required to process and receive a cash withdrawal (a few weeks), what are the downsides of parking emergency fund (and general) savings in a universal life policy which guarantees a 4.0% return?  Will I screw my beneficiaries if I die with a substantial cash value in the account?**",finance

investing,Reuters: U.S. manufacturing sector slowing as economy loses steam,"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy/u-s-manufacturing-sector-slowing-as-economy-loses-steam-idUSKCN1QW1UL

&gt; U.S. manufacturing output fell for a second straight month in February and factory activity in New York state hit nearly a two-year low this month, offering further evidence of a sharp slowdown in economic growth early in the first quarter. 

&gt; The reports on Friday extended the streak of weak data and underscored the Federal Reserve’s “patient” stance towards further interest rate increases this year. Fed officials are scheduled to meet next Tuesday and Wednesday to assess the economy and deliberate on the future course of monetary policy. The U.S. central bank raised rates four times last year. 

&gt; The Fed said manufacturing production dropped 0.4 percent last month, held down by declines in the output of motor vehicles, machinery and furniture. Data for January was revised up to show output at factories falling 0.5 percent instead of slumping 0.9 percent as previously reported. 

&gt; In a third report on Friday, the University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index rose to a reading of 97.8 in early March from 93.8 in February. Strong consumer sentiment bodes well for consumer spending in the months ahead after spending appeared to have retrenched early in the first quarter. 

&gt; “In addition to trade, risks to manufacturing stem from the labor market, as the scarce supply of workers will also limit growth,” said Stephen Ciccarella, a senior economist at Moody’s Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. “We expect this headwind to intensify over the next few quarters as the labor market continues to tighten.”",finance

I sent them an email asking why they don't show my ACTUAL rate of return that includes defaults. They replied, saying:

&gt; ""The 9.63% weighted average coupon is not the same as your portfolio's overall return. Unfortunately, Funding Circle does not publish returns because there is not an established industry standard of how to do so. You may calculate your return using whichever method you prefer. ""

I’ve been working for 5 years in banking, concretely, with the supervisory stress tests of banks conducted by the Federal Reserve or the BCE (in Europe).

I was wondering why not to apply this process to the personal finance.

This tool will take a holistic view of your finances to make sure you’re not only financially stable but able to handle almost anything thrown your way. The idea is a model which starting from macroeconomic scenarios and risk events, stress your money (expenses, income, retirement fund, assets, debts, insurances, etc) and push you into crash mode, and then, it will help you cope or recover from that.",finance
personalfinance,(GER) Student grant (BAföG) paid in error many years ago,"Hey everybody!

I'm in a bit of a predicament and I wanted to see if maybe anybody else went through this as well or has some ideas for me.

Story time:
In 2010/2011 I received the German federal student grant (BAföG) while I was at university. In 2015 they sent me a letter claiming they messed up the calculations and I am supposed to pay back the whole €4,500 that I got within 2 weeks. Still being a student by that time (in a different field) I had basically zero money to my name so it came as a bit of a shock (understatement of the year).
So I consulted with our lawyer and he sent them an objection, asking for insight into their files etc. We didn't hear back from them for almost 5 years, until now (2019).
The objection was rejected as ""baseless"" and the amount to pay back (within 4 weeks this time) is now almost €5,100. Our lawyer sent me a letter of almost 10 pages going through all the different options we could take but it turns out the only way with a slight chance of success would be to sue over a small technicality that would result (if we'd win, which isn't even likely) in a €270 reduction. That, tbf, is an irrelevant amount at this level (especially with the risk of losing and having to pay over €1,000 in process bills).
I currently do have just about enough money to pay them back but it would kind of ruin everything that I am currently working on (like moving out, taking vacations to go and see my (as of yet) LDR fiancé). 

I am simply staggered by the way they conducted their business in this matter and I hope that maybe they at least agree to letting me pay in installments but otherwise I am a bit lost currently. I am taking steps to having a bit more money on the side, like asking my aunt (who provided me with an interest-free loan to buy a car) to pause my payments for a few months. But yea...

If anybody has had similar experiences maybe it would be nice to share and who knows, some of you amy have some ideas too.

personalfinance,Student loan help,"Hi guys, long time fan of the sub and finally decided enough is enough and I need help and advice. I have two student loans, one parent plus loan and one in my own name. The total of both loans currently is about $80,000 usd. I have been paying about $800-900 a month (400ish to each loan) for the past 3 years. The average interest rate is about 5.25%. 

Looking at the math at $800 a month it would take me 100 months to pay them off not including any interest accrued. So give or take another 9 years. 

I want to know the best plan to get these loans taken care of. A friend of mine told me to just pay the minimum payment on them forever and not worry about it but that didn’t seem very smart to me. If anyone has tips for what type of payment plans to use (income based, standard, etc). That would be extremely helpful. I’m currently on an income based payment plan on my loan through navient and the parent plus loan is just a standard payment plan.

I work for a company that contracts out to school districts for special education and related service provision. When I signed on to this position, my recruiter said that to get me a little more money, he could use this federal program that provides a percentage of my pay non-taxed almost as a per diem/meal/travel voucher if I worked more than 50 miles away from my home. 

Here comes the confusing/sketchy part: upon signing, my recruiter knew (I made it VERY clear) that I would not be living at my parents house in Pennsylvania and that I would be moving to New Jersey. He said that was no problem and found a work placement in a school district near my apartment in New Jersey. Now, in order to get this “special non-taxed portion” he used my parents address in PA as my permanent address because it’s more than 50 miles from where I work. 

I also have a second job in New Jersey over the summers (as most school employees do), so I get a W-2 with my address from NJ. 

Did I fuck up by putting my NJ address on my W-2 for my summer NJ job? 
What residency do I file under for my regular full-time job? PA because that’s what’s on the W-2, or NJ because that’s technically where I live? 

I’m planning on leaving this company ASAP because this is not the only somewhat sketchy thing they’ve done.

personalfinance,Fraudulent FedEx Charges Turned Over to Transworld Systems Collections,"Posting my experience to see if anyone has experienced this issue - saw a similar post (about a year old), with some helpful links to the collections FAQ, but there were minimal comments. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday I received a letter from Transworld Systems notifying me that \~$4900.00 of charges has been turned over from FedEx. Due to the amount, I immediately assumed scam, and started googling. It seems Transworld is real, and other people have run into this same combo of FedEx/Transworld. Some  had legitimate charges with FedEx, some did not. Here are some details from my situation:

* In December of 2017,  I received a random charge from FedEx on my cc. I did not make any purchases,  so I marked it as fraudulent with BoA. I filled out some paperwork, they reviewed for a week or so, and sided with me/refunded me. Another charge tried to come through, and they blocked FedEx from charging my account. It now seems like the charge (while not me), was actually from Fedex and that's why they are coming after me. There are four invoices on the collections bill between 12/2017 and 1/2018
* I have not heard a peep from FedEx, or any collections agencies since that time. Have not received any correspondence - emails, calls, texts etc. from FedEx or anyone else. 
* The letter from collections is dated **3/1/19.** I immediately checked my credit reports from Creditkarma and as of **3/16/19**, no dip in my score has occurred and there are no collections posted to Transunion or Equifax. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm planning on calling FedEx first thing tomorrow to see if they can get to the bottom of it. I was really hoping the collections agency was fake and the charges were fake as well, but it doesn't seem that way. I also plan on calling collections and following the guidance from the ""how to deal with collections"" FAQ.  If anyone has dealt with FedEx or Transworld and has specific advice, I'd appreciate it.

If it’s impossible to skate by while only taking the unsubsidized loan, that’s fine. It would just be beneficial to not have to take the extra loan if it is not necessary. Thank you for any help you can provide!

1. I have an student loan, right now I´m within my grace period and what I want to do is start paying my loan, this in order to reduce as much as possible the debt before said grace period ends (I still have like 10 months before it ends), my question here is, is there any rule like: ""use x% of your income to start paying the loan""? if not, is there any guidelines/recommended books or reads or advice you could give me?
2. Right now I have some money on my bank account, it is not that much but for sure most of it will stay there, the main reason is that with my new income I can sustain myself while paying my debt (I still live with my parents and thus a lot of costs are not assumed by me plus, I'm already doing some budgeting and I am certain of this -sustainability and loan payment-), I am interested in doing some sort of investment and while I know that bank rates wont make me rich it'll still be better than just leaving that money hanging out doing nothing (right? first question), my other questions are: What indicators should I evaluate before making a decision on how to invest the money (like interest rate, etc), Should I just do said investments with my bank because it would be harder to do it with other banks (Because my savings are already in my bank's system) or is it worth it to *shop around* taking into account I don't really need that extra money right now and the only reason I'm looking into this is for the reason I stated previously?

personalfinance,Owe 15k in taxes,"Hi, throwaway as some friends/family know my reddit account and wish to hide my income/etc.

This year after doing my taxes the same way I did my taxes last year (turbotax, pretty much same forms), I owed the IRS $15k. I attributed this to not setting my withholding allowance correctly - had it on 2, just moved it to 0.

Talked to some friends and they said that even with that allowance I shouldn't be owing 15k. I'm following up with some questions to my company's payroll and etrade on Monday. Here to look for a second opinion.

Here's what I've researched/found so far -

My W2 states that my total wages/tips/other comp (salary+rsu's+espp/box 1) is \~231k. To break that down, my salary is about $137k, and the rest is from RSU's and ESPP. W2 also states that I have paid about \~70k of taxes if I add up fed/state/medicare/social security.

Going on  [https://smartasset.com/taxes/california-tax-calculator](https://smartasset.com/taxes/california-tax-calculator)  shows that I should be paying about \~$85k. (Which seems to make sense on why I owe $15k)

&amp;#x200B;

What's strange to my friends is that when RSU's vest, the company sells shares to withhold for taxes. I know for a fact that my company does this. One of my friends is suggesting that the company may have made a mistake and did not include the RSU tax withholding on the W2. My W2 doesn't show anything related to RSU tax

I took a look at the last payslip I received for 2018, and it also states that employee taxes were YTD was at 70k, which aligns with the W2.

The strange thing that I don't understand is, there is a section on post tax deductions which includes 401k roth, espp contributions, and RSU's. The YTD for that is $107k. Is this where the tax witholding is reported for my RSU's? Should this be on my W2? Quite confused.  


Edit: Thanks for all the great suggestions! I was able to confirm through a payslip last year on the pay period for when RSU's vested and confirmed that employee taxes paid jumped up. This helps reassure me that the taxes paid on the W2 includes RSU tax withholding and comparing that with smartasset's calculator seems to be correct that I owe $15k.",finance

*Contrary to criminal cases, a lawyer in an Article 78 doesn't have to accept the case.*

*When the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) promulgated the Bitlicense regulation in July 2015, a four month clock to submit a lawsuit starts. When I filed the lawsuit, I could not find a lawyer that knew bitcoin, even less file lawsuit. I filed the latest week possible in October 2015. It took 6 month for the State of New York to do a reply, and then another 6 month for my lawyer to understand it. The reason my lawyer took the case is that the State of New York sent me a reply of 26 pages.* ***A frivolous lawsuit answer is usually a few pages.***

*The arguments on the original lawsuit became so convoluted for everyone, including to the the judge that they all agree to start a brand new document and the Standing question was addressed.In May 2017, my lawyer rewrote the complaint, in June 2017 the State argue for the dismissal, we replied in July 2017, and in August 2017 we asked for discovery and in October 2017 we are in front of a new judge and she decided that I did not have standing.*

*(Someone who understand lawsuits - he has about 3,500 - explains what will happen:* [*https://youtu.be/CKvipt04g8s?t=13*](https://youtu.be/CKvipt04g8s?t=13)*)*

# Dear All,

**I received this analysis from one** of the group that wanted to file an Amicus Brief but their lawyer advised against. *I will keep the name of the firm hidden because it's doesn't add anything to the story.* Their analysis is worth discussing. The expertise needed in this case is **Administrative Law** but this firm expertise is in other areas.

&gt;According US News best law firms [*https://bestlawfirms.usnews.com*](https://bestlawfirms.usnews.com/), they are a **tier 1** in Bankruptcy and Creditor, Commercial Litigation and Bankruptcy *(in the New York and National categories.)*

**All I can say is that I see that their crypto unit depend on the Bitlicense to exist,** the first question I have is whether it make sense to them to advise that I am weak case? At the end of the day, the administrative question is simply whether I have the right to sue. **Do I have standing?**

In their analysis they write:

&gt;rather than its application, the four-month statute of limitations for Article 78 proceedings is not even applicable. *See Westhampton Beach Assoc., LLC v. Incorporated Village of Westhampton Beach*, 151 A.D.3d 793, 795 (2d Dep't 2017).

**But wait!** That analysis is based on a 2017 decision. I started my lawsuit in 2015 when that decision did not exist.

The only positive thing about that rule is that the four-month status of limitation is not applicable. According to that ruling of 2017, it's now six-year statute of limitations. **Anyone who was affected by the New York decision back in 2014 can potentially challenge the Bitlicense.**

Anyway, the appeal **oral arguments are scheduled for March 28, 2019 at 2:00 pm.** I hope this thread spark a good discussion.

# The analysis:

We have analyzed the Theo Chino appeal to determine what policy arguments might be addressed to support an amicus brief being submitted by YYYY on behalf of  the XXXX.  While we very much look forward to working with the XXXX to advance its policy objectives, we are concerned that the facts and  circumstances of the Theo Chino appeal are extremely weak and may be suboptimal for any amicus brief being filed on behalf of the XXXX. In particular, it appears that Theo Chino and his company lack standing to prosecute the appeal, and as a result, this appeal appears to not address any significant policy issues that we assume the XXXX is keen on advancing. We are of course available to discuss this further with the XXXX in the event there are any considerations that we may have overlooked.

In connection with our analysis, we have reviewed Appellants' opening brief, the Supreme Court's decision and order that was appealed from, and the parties’  briefing before the Supreme Court o the Defendants-Respondent's motion to dismiss the complaint and Article 78 petition for lack of  standing. We also have reviewed key legal authorities cited in Appellants' brief and the  briefing below on the motion to dismiss and conducted  some further independent research on the issues involved. Our preliminary conclusion is that, based on the factual circumstances of this case - in particular, the fact that the Plaintiffs-Appellants did not complete corporate entity's application to DFS or receive any determination that the challenged regulations even apply to  the business - the appeal is not meritorious and does not present an opportunity for a compelling amicus argument, public-policy oriented or otherwise.

**I.** **Factual and Procedural Background**

Theo Chino (""Theo"") and his company Chino Ltd. (""Chino"") challenge the DFS's ""virtual currency"" regulation (the ""Regulation""), which went into effect in June 2015 and, *inter alia*, required virtual currency businesses to acquire a license and abide by other mandates, such as maintenance of adequate books and records and minimum capitalization requirements. In 2013, prior to the enactment of the Regulation, Theo established  a small business to process Bitcoin payments on behalf of convenience stores. Upon the Regulation's enactment, Theo filed for a license under the Regulation on August 7, 2015.  He then initiated a pro se proceeding on October 16, 2015 challenging the  Regulation,  before receiving any response from DFS regarding his application. On  January 4, 2016, DFS returned the application stating that it could not be processed because it contained ""extremely limited"" information and, among other things, did not describe the business in which Chino was or would be engaged and did not specify in what  respect, if any, the business involve virtual currency. Thus, DFS explained that it could not determine whether Chino was subject to the  Regulation.  In response to the DFS letter, Theo discontinued Chino's Bitcoin-related services, although Chino continued as a non-operating business. Thereafter, Theo and Chino retained counsel, which filed an amended complaint and Article 78 petition challenging the Regulation. Defendants-Respondents moved to dismiss for lack of standing.

**II.** **Order Appealed From**

On these facts, the  Supreme Court, we think correctly, held that the Plaintiffs-Petitioners lacked standing both with respect to the Article 78 petition and the  challenge to the constitutionality of the Regulation. With respect to the Article 78 Petition, the Court observed that CPLR  7803(3) allows a petitioner to challenge ""whether a determination was made in violation of lawful procedure, was affected by an error of law  or was arbitrary and capricious or an abuse of discretion"" and here, because DFS did not reach a decision on Chino's application, there is no ""determination"" for the Court to review. Moreover, the Court explained that a petitioner must exhaust available administrative remedies before permitted to litigate in a Court of law.  The Court considered the ""exceptions"" to this exhaustion principle, which Appellants claim in their appellate brief are applicable here, but determined that the exceptions are not applicable, again because of the petitioner's failure to complete the DFS application. Because of this failure, DFS did not take any action - constitutional or otherwise - that the petitioner could challenge in an Article 78 proceeding. With respect to the plaintiffs' standing on the constitutional challenge, the Court found this was a ""much closer issue,"" but again found that  plaintiffs lacked standing. This determination also came down to  plaintiffs' failure to complete the DFS application: the Court concluded  that the plaintiffs did not show ""injury in fact"" required  for standing because they did not properly apply for the DFS license required by the Regulation. The Court also rejected plaintiffs' economic loss argument because Chino never made a profit before the Regulation and its losses after enactment of the Regulation were consistent with its prior financial history. 

**III.** **Merits of the Appeal**

In their Appellate brief, the Appellants do not engage, at all, with the Court's  determination that their failure to complete an application for a  license under the Regulation or submit enough information to allow DFS to determine whether the Regulation applies to their business  deprives them of standing. Nor do the Appellants cite any authority that demonstrates that such a failure is not fatal to their standing. 

With respect to Article  78 standing, Appellants argue why each of the exceptions to the ""exhaustion"" principle apply to their action without addressing the fact  that, in the first instance, DFS never made a regulatory determination with respect to their business. Setting aside this threshold issue, the authority cited by the Appellants to support the applicability of these exceptions to their circumstances are extremely  weak.  On their argument that their action is excepted because DFS acted beyond its legislative power, they cite to *Bankers Trust*, which acknowledges this exception, but found that, in that case that  the relevant agency had acted within its statutory authority. For the constitutional exception, Appellants cite only to *Martinez 2001* and incorrectly state that, in that case, the First Department found that the exhaustion doctrine was inapplicable. In *Martinez 2001*, the First Department explicitly found that the exhaustion doctrine ***was*** applicable, stating that it was ""not convinced that  plaintiffs' procedural due process argument is the type of  unconstitutional agency action that is exempted from the exhaustion doctrine.""  *Martinez 2001 v. N.Y. City Campaign Fin. Bd.*, 36 A.D.3d 544,  548-49 (1st Dep't 2007).  The cases cited by Appellants on the futility exception are equally inapposite. In fact, *Lehigh*, seems to demonstrate why, under the circumstances here, exhaustion would not be futile. *Cf. Lehigh Portland Cement Co. v. N.Y. State Dep't of Environ. Conservation*, 87 N.Y.2d 136, 141 (1995) (finding exhaustion of administrative remedies futile where the agency had ""arrived at a ***definitive position*** which ***concretely affected*** the status of plaintiff's BUD petitions and then ***communicated that position*** to the plaintiff"" (emphasis added));  *see also N.Y. Inst. for Educ. of Blind v. United Federation Teachers' Comm.*,  83 A.D.2d 390 (1st Dep't 1981) (affirming dismissal of complaint for failure to exhaust administrative remedies where the Labor Relations Board had not passed on the issue of whether  the plaintiff was a ""public employer"" within the meaning of the  challenged regulation). Finally, with respect to the irreparable harm exception, Appellant's argument rests on the flawed assumption that the statute of limitations on their Article 78 challenge  would expire if they waited for DFS to make a decision on their application. It is the DFS's decision on the application, however, that would trigger the statute of limitations for the Article 78 proceeding, so there is no way that, in awaiting this decision, the statute of limitations for the Article 78 proceeding would expire. In fact, when challenging the actual substance of the regulation, as the Appellants do here, rather than its application, the four-month statute of limitations for Article 78 proceedings is not even applicable. *See Westhampton Beach Assoc., LLC v. Incorporated Village of Westhampton Beach*, 151 A.D.3d 793, 795 (2d Dep't 2017).

Appellants' argument that they can demonstrate ""injury in fact,"" as required to challenge the constitutionality of the Regulation, is equally problematic. Their argument here rests on the assumption that the Regulation applies to their business; but, as set forth above, DFS never made this determination. As Respondents pointed out in their motion to dismiss, Appellants voluntarily shut down the business before DFS processed Chino's application or issued any sort  of rejection, direction or mandate.  Thus, any injury to Appellants *was not caused by the Regulation*. Appellants also rely upon the $5,000 application fee and the costs of  compliance with the Regulation to support their claim of injury. As observed by the Court below, however, Appellants did not actually pay the $5,000 application fee (instead submitting a handwritten request for fee  waiver).  Moreover, as argued by the Respondents on their motion to  dismiss, Chinos never ascertained whether the business would need a license to operate under the Regulation, so any claim with respect to the cost of compliance is entirely speculative.

**IV.** **Considerations Relevant to a Potential Amicus Brief**

In light of the above,  we don't think that we want to submit an amicus brief in this action.  Issues related to the regulation of cryptocurrencies that have been percolating as of late (and are presumably of great interest to the XXXX) are not really implicated by this appeal. The issue here is of the Appellant's standing, and the Supreme Court's determination on this issue is based on the fact that, here, Appellants were not the subject of any DFS action or determination, rather than any legal principle that would  be applicable to other cryptocurrency businesses. The Supreme Court  did not address, and the appeal does not implicate, issues that would be  relevant to other cryptocurrency businesses other than the Appellants, such as (i) whether virtual currencies are a  financial product or service subject to regulation by DFS; (ii) whether the Regulation is arbitrary or capricious; or (iii) whether the  Regulation is preempted by Federal Law. Thus, we  do not see a public-policy/interest angle that we could compellingly  sponsor in this appeal.",cryptocurrency

 “The Fed appears to be on hold for the foreseeable future,” said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James Financial Inc. “Economic growth is expected to moderate this year, but risks are weighted to the downside.” 

"" In a series of questions on the Fed’s balance sheet, economists predicted officials will reveal this week that they intend to halt a gradual shrinking of their bond holdings in the fourth quarter.

personalfinance,Loan Payment Options,"Good evening,

I am trying to purchase my first home and unfortunately it is within the terribly taxed state of Connecticut. Since I am in CT and it is almost impossible to save, I am trying to figure out the best options on attacking/saving money from my student loans in hopes to save a few extra dollars. Problem is, I am terrible at math haha.

I was able to consolidate all my student loans into one loan which helped. I was paying $600/month. 

**Original Loan:** $30k over 15 year loan at 6.3% fixed rate. $250/month payment.

I am currently down to $24,500 with 12 years left. I have started making larger payments to help pay this debt off quicker. But once I purchase a house, this won't be happening anymore as I will have to pinch every penny.

I received a refinance option and was wondering if I am actually paying more in the long run or not. The option was for:

**(Different company)** $24,500 over 15 years at 5.33% fixed interest rate. $197/monthly payment.

Am I better off keeping my original? Since I am three years into it already? or will the lower interest rate help me save money, even though it goes back to 15 years. 

Is there anything else I could/should consider? I wish moving down south was an option, but family is here.

personalfinance,Stupidly upside down auto loan at 20 years old...,"So i'm here trying to figure out what the best way of getting out of my current loan would be. I'm not here to be called an idiot for getting such a terrible loan.

So last june, I bought my first ever car using my mom as a cosigner because at the time, things were fine and we weren't worried about losing our jobs etc etc but fast foward about a year and my mom and I are now unemployed, her old 2009 prius with 180k miles just broke down because she never took care of it and now we're left worrying about being able to pay rent and all that. We have a close family friend who can help us if we REALLY need it but i'd prefer not to rely on him. My mom hadn't bought a car in quite a while so she didn't realize how terrible dealerships can be and me being uneducated on it all, neither did i. blah blah blah, i'm now 12k in debt with a 24% interest rate and I honestly feel like crying because I now realize how badly I fucked myself. I do start my new job on the 24th so i'll have some income but my monthly payments on my car are about $376. My main goal is to vastly decrease those monthly payments as i'm not worried about insurance since thats not very high at all. 

A while ago I went to a dealership in hopes of working something out but nobody wants to work with me because i'm about 3-4k upside down. One place i went to said they'd be able to get me much lower monthly payments in a brand new car that costs about 5k more than my current loan but I instantly said no because that just sounded like an even worse decision. Would that actually be a good idea or no? I've been looking for super cheap cars like in the 3-4k range but I have no clue what to do, it's so overwhelming.

Note: the car is a 2014 chevy cruze, well maintained with just over 55k miles on it.

TLDR: I messed up, got a bad loan at 12k with a 24% interest rate at a young age and now i'm wondering if what I can do",finance

stocks,Nigerian regulators approve Diamond Bank merger with Access Bank,"LAGOS, NIGERIA: Diamond Bank Plc has announced receipt of the final approval of both the Central Bank of Nigeria and the Securities and Exchange Commission to the proposed scheme of merger between Diamond Bank and Access Bank Plc. “The scheme is subject to judicial sanction of the Federal High Court,” a statement issued to London Stock Exchange (LSE) said.

Access Bank and Diamond Bank announced in December 2018 their intention to merge, for a total consideration of N72.5 billion ($200 million). The merger would create the biggest Nigerian bank by assets, with N6.1 trillion ($16.7 billion) – ahead of the current leader, Zenith, with its N5.6 trillion ($15.4 billion).

U.S. private equity firm Carlyle owns a 17.75 percent stake in Diamond Bank which it bought for $147 million in 2014.

As per the terms of the agreement, Access Bank would acquire the entire issued share capital of Diamond Bank in exchange for a combination of cash and shares in Access. Diamond shareholders would receive a consideration of N3.13 per share, made up of N1 per share in cash and the allotment of two new Access shares for every seven Diamond shares held.

personalfinance,"Graduating, Catching Up On Taxes, Financial Liberation","Hello PF, long time lurker here. I come from a good, yet financially struggling family. I support myself financially and will soon graduate from a top tier American university. I have a job lined up making 6 figures in a HCOL city. I’ve read a ton of posts here (essentially hundreds of the top all time and check the subreddit daily) so I think of myself as pretty well informed and have a solid plan moving forward to transition from student to professional life.

I am a student in a full scholarship, so no issues there. However, past financial difficulties have been difficult to overcome, and I’m working to settle things in the near future and put these times behind me. Specifically, I need to catch up on taxes. Where I currently stand:

Owe $1000 in state taxes from 2016 (in collections)
Didn’t file state taxes in 2017 (filed home state and federal, forgot to submit current state of living??) Based on 2016 &amp; 2018, this will likely come out to me owing roughly $2000
Owe $1600 in federal taxes from 2017 (on $25 a month payment plan (this was a bandaid to keep it from collections))
Currently have two credit cards, both above 20% interest that were recently at $0, but have had to carry balances the last two months for rent and travel expenses, currently at: $1950/2200 and $2350/4000

At the end of March I will be receiving a $4300 check. I intend to pay rent for April and pay off my credit balances. I have two months left on my lease and will put work income towards it and should more than break even here, leaving me with a few hundred dollars extra from work.

I currently have $1500 sitting in my checking account from my recent paycheck and this year’s tax return. 

I will begin my job in August and receive about $12000 post tax (first paycheck + bonus). I will be able to pay down all outstanding debts using this, and be fine on rent and living costs in my new city. I have everything from that point forward figured out and budgeted, including high rate of savings and retirement investment that I’ve learned from this subreddit.

So the question really is, who do I pay first, and when? I think I pay down credit cards first, but then do I look to state or federal taxes first? When do I file 2017 taxes? Will they expect payment immediately? Do I wait until August and pay down all taxes then? I will be putting all food and expenses until August on these cards as well. Should I hold onto my cash and keep my balances at zero, then deal with taxes in August? Thanks in advance for all of your guy’s help you’ve provided via my lurking in dealing with my financial situation up until this point. 

I also potentially have the option to look into ThriveCash, which is a company that allows for college students at select universities with jobs lined up to take out loans (for me, roughly $4000 with a $210 fee, to be paid back in August). Would this be a good idea to pay down taxes quicker and keep my credit balances at 0?",finance

personalfinance,Can closing costs be rolled into a home loan?,"When my husband and I first bought our house in 2016, my husband had a bankruptcy that was too recent to qualify us for a VA loan. As a result, my father in law cosigned with me instead, on an FHA loan. The act of cosigning and his name being on the house has since become a manipulation/control issue. It's constantly held over our heads and long story short, we're being blamed for him not being able to buy mother in law a house closer to her grandkids.

&amp;#x200B;

We want him off the loan. We want to get my husband's name on the loan. We want to switch from FHA to VA (husband and I are both vets). The problem at the moment is that my husband is on unpaid medical leave, and will be for another 3-4 months. We got off the phone with a loan person this morning, who said the closing costs for refinancing would be about 4%. While we have that in our emergency savings, that same savings is what is currently being used to get us though this unpaid time.

&amp;#x200B;

Can we roll the 4% into the loan? And how much would it hurt us in the long run? 

&amp;#x200B;

Remaining loan balance: $133,919

Current interest rate: 3.25%

Monthly payment breakdown: $275.70 principal, $365.28 interest, 371.68 escrow

Monthly payment total: $1012.66

Re-fi closing cost: 4%

Primary residence also in east end with a mortgage of $238k with interest rate 3.55% (variable). Estimated value of primary residence is $750k. So with HELOC and mortgage I owe $388k.

My credit score is currently 700. 
I’d like to learn more about refinancing to lower my interest/monthly payments/overall amount owed and if there are any significant negative impacts by doing so. 
Additionally, I asked my CU about refinancing and they said there is a refinancing fee if they do it, and would probably not be worth the money saved on a reduced interest rate. 
Lastly, in my loan contract, I did not see any fees or penalties for paying off my current loan early. Any recommendations or input is appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,Federal Loans Payoff Advice,"I think I have it pretty good when it comes to my student loans. They are all federal and I already paid off the one with the highest interest rate... but I'm still looking for guidance on the best way to payoff the rest. I have 3 loans left with balances of $4,800, $4,600, and $2,700 with interests rates between 4.6% and 3.8%.

\- Should I refinance? (It may be too late for this and not worth the trouble since my interest rates aren't very high and don't vary much)

\- Should I continue to pay off more than necessary each month? (Current plan asks that I pay about $186 a month but I usually pay about $275-$350 a month)

\- I received a $4000 bonus (after taxes and 401K deduction) this month, I planned to put $1500-$2000 in my Roth IRA and $1000 towards my student loans and the rest in savings. Is this a good idea?

&amp;#x200B;

Background:I will be exactly 3 years removed from college in May 2019. For the first 6 months being out of school, I was living at home and paying a significant portion of my monthly income towards my loans because I thought this was the best way to do it (my sister had a significant amount in private loans so this is where I got the idea from), but this slowed down once I moved out-of-state for a job. I make about $81,000/year (not including bonus) and currently have about $20K in a HYS account, $10K in a regular savings, and recently opened a Roth IRA last month. I contribute 8% of my pay into my 401K where my employer offers a 50% match. I leased a new car after moving so my student loans are the only real debt I have (I pay off my credit cards each month).

personalfinance,"Home equity loan for credit card debt? Pros, cons, advice. We are desperate.","My husband and I own our home free and clear. It is worth over 500k. We have about 20k worth of credit card debt that is really hurting us. We both use to have scores around 800ish but in the past few months they are now closer to him:715, me:760 due to the debt. We would like to take out a home equity loan in order to pay off the individual creditors and have a much lower interest rate and then make only one payment every month for five (I assume) years. Also, we won’t be using the credit cards the way we had been before because apparently we don’t do well with them when it’s not for specific purchases. We will not be racking up any more credit card debt. Is there any reason why this would be a terrible idea? Also, where can we find the best rates? If our home is worth well over what we need to take out do we still need to pay an appraisal? Any way to not pay extra fees would be awesome. Thank you all. You are a genius group and much appreciated!

Edit to add additional info: An inheritance paid off our home and we pay $1000 a month into an account that we cannot touch for the home. It was a requirement for the payoff. Our take home was $68k last year, about 10k less than the year before and we had extra expenses.",finance

After my student loans are paid off, I will increase the amount going into my 401K...that's why I'm choosing a low 401K % for now. So far I have been paying \~$45K towards student loans per year, and I should have everything paid off in about 2.5 years at that rate (but hopefully even sooner! Just submitted an extra payment towards the highest interest rate loan this morning for $1600!).

personalfinance,I am 28 and disabled. I have received 200K net from a personal injury settlement. Advice is needed.,"Hello!
I will receive ~200k net from a major oil company. I am recent graduate who has 60K in student loans, which is only the outstanding debt I have right now. 

Because of my life-long disability, I receive SSD checks every month. I have Medicare and good health insurance on top of that. The windfall will not affect any of that.  

In the summer, I will be moving to a large metropolis in Texas to begin my career in healthcare which will begin at 55K.

I recently got approved for Total and Permanent Disability for my Federal Student Loans. Therefore, they are discharged. However, they did stipulate that I was on 3 year monitoring probation to ensure I do not earn more than the poverty line (12,500) per year. I am currently working on getting my private loan to be discharged as well. 

I have planned to use 60K from 200K to pay off that student loans (both federal and private) in case my private loan isn't discharged. I probably will end up having to pay back my federal loans due to my job salary. Plus, I will lose my eligibility for SSD because I will be making too much from my job. 

With that said, I plan to take 50K and open account with Vanguard Voyager because I am kind of guy who likes to leave his money alone and watch it grow. Every once in while, I would like to get advice from professionals concerning about my portfolios. 

That will leave me about 100K. I plan to take X amount and move to an online saving account for highest interest.

As for my future profession, there is a possibility that I will pursue a M.A. degree in bioinformatics that will push up my salary to the 80K range.  

I do foresee my SO and I buying a house in the next 5 years, although we do see a wedding on the horizon as well.

personalfinance,Debt Payoff vs Savings,"Hey all,

&amp;#x200B;

I am a 25 male in a LCOL Midwest City and have been getting heavily involved with FIRE and really figuring out how to start being responsible and get my head above water and get things prepared for my future. Here's where I need all the help I can get: 

Monthly Income: $2177.35 and will be raising to $2539.5 in the coming months.

Monthly Expenses: $950.12 (this is based off minimum Credit Card Payments)

Outstanding Debt: $4996.05 (All Credit Card Debt with varying interest rates, largest account $2563.99 @27.59%)

Debt Collect: $4796.44 , 22 payments left (was a surprise Student Loan I wasnt aware that thought was forgiven)

Savings 1: 401k 8% (company matches up to 5%, this is a new account no money in it)

Savings 2: CIT Bank $517.72 (interest earned 2.72%, must deposit $100 a month for fee free and high interest earning)

Savings 3: Stocks $190.87 (I'm +$69.89 currently, I put money in when I have extra, but dont sell, I use M2 for trading)

&amp;#x200B;

My question to you all is should I double down and pay off my debts and get squared or should I proceed with more savings now as the long term outcome would be more beneficial as I am not going to continue unnecessary spending on Credit Cards. I also currently have no House, Utilities, Car, Car Insurance, Health Insurance payments, but likely will in the next 5 years. Thank you all for your time and I will try to be as responsive and open to all of your insights as possible.

personalfinance,Unexpected W-2 And Amended Tax Return Due To Unconstitutional Withholding,"This is a United States tax question, I apologize if this is the wrong place. I also posted in r/tax but since this is a more active subreddit, I was hoping people could give me more insight here.

My issue:

Unexpected W-2 And Amended Tax Return Due To Unconstitutional Withholding

My wife and I live in Arizona. Before we were married, about 7 years ago, my wife worked as a teacher in Michigan, where there was a law that forced teachers to pay a percentage of their income towards retirement healthcare.

Apparently that law was found to be  Unconstitutional, and the schools had to pay the teachers back in 2018. They sent my wife a check and she deposited it in our bank account. Here's a link to an article about that: https://www.mlive.com/news/2017/12/michigan_supreme_court_orders.html

This year, I thought I was being extra smart and decided to do our taxes early. A week after we got our refund from both federal and state, we got a W2 from the school district in Michigan for my wife with the amount of that check as income.

I filled out an amended return last night, but I noticed that the taxes withheld on that new W2 were in the state of Michigan, not our current state of Arizona. Does this mean I now need to file a Michigan State tax return in addition to the AZ one I already did? The W2 in question was for 1100 dollars.

TL;DR: Filed taxes and received refund, then got unexpected W2 for $1100 from a state I don't live or work in anymore due to a retroactive law change. Do I have to file a state tax return for that other state?",finance
stocks,Ladybaybee recommended stock picks 2019-03-18,"[Link to imgur](https://imgur.com/a/PvUclWC)

**HOW I USE THIS:** 

1) All the stocks identified in the table are qualified as “BUY” opportunities.

2) I focus in the column “Success Rate(3m)” which shows the precision of the agents in the last 3 calendar months. I personally feel most comfortable with Rates 0.8 or higher. 

3) Then, I see the number in “Tx(3m)” which represents the number of transactions that the agents predicted for this stock in the last 3 months. I prefer stocks that have had at least two transactions during this period. 

4) Finally, I look at Growth(3m), if the agents have had a considerable growth (&gt;5% in 3 months) then I follow that trade. 

5) If a row in the table is colored green then it means that stock has been on the rise today so I purchase it immediately in order to ride the wave up. On the other hand, if the row is colored red, then I wait out until very close to market close to purchase the stock and let the price bottom out before climbing up again tomorrow.


6) After I purchase the stocks, I ALWAYS set a stop loss order at -2.5% from my buying price valid for the day. I think this is good hygiene, no matter how confident I am of my system, I still want to make sure that my losses are capped. I update this stop loss order every day. 


**BACKGROUND**

I am not a financier or economist. I am electrical engineer with equal passion in artificial intelligence and financial markets. For the past 2 years I have been working on a system that would make short term predictions of stocks. The system is rather complex, I use multiple layers which include: Convolutional Neural Networks, LSTMs and Genetic Algorithms. All bulked together produce an output like in this image. The way to interpret the image is a follows: Symbol and Date columns are self explanatory, Quorum refers to autonomous agents that decide whether to BUY/NOT BUY or SELL/HOLD a stock. Each symbol has 9 agents, and the Quorum column, counts the number of agents that recommend Buy, Selling or Holding the stock. The “Not Owned” column means: if you don’t own this stock then you should … The “Owned” column means: if you own this stock you should HOLD or SELL. The column “Growth(1 Year)” refers to what what has been the growth of this system of Agents in the past calendar year. The column “Tx(1Yr)” shows the number of full transactions that these agents recommended in the last calendar year. “Factor” is just the division of Growth divided by Transactions to get the average growth per transaction. Finally “Success Rate” shows how successful these agents have been in their recommendations in the past calendar year, success 1 means 100% successful, 0.5 means 50% successful, and so on.

Many people have been curious about the actual process that the system follows, so here it is: for every symbol (600 stocks are analyzed daily), we get the full stock data (open,close,high,low,volume) for the past 4 months. Each stock is associated with another set of “lookalike” stocks as well as major ETF’s. This initial dataset is run through a convolutional layer that extracts an undisclosed number of features. These features are then passed onto a recurrent neural network (LSTM) where sequences and patterns are extracted. The LSTM then spits out probabilities for the likelihood that this stock will have a positive, negative and neutral tendency in the next N days. These probabilities are then fed to a genetic evolution system (GES). This system essentially checks the predictions for the past N days and compares them with reality, following that the systems knows which predictions are performing the best. Once the system knows which stocks are being simulated the best, then the system automatically finds which of these best performing stocks have the biggest potential for the next few days. The system does not output explanations, unfortunately us humans are not capable of understanding (or visualizing) a problem of this dimensionality, for example the LSTM part alone works with over 10 million dimensions, not features but dimensions.

personalfinance,Maxing out 401: Are after-tax contributions (for megabackdoor Roth) worth it at the expense of pre-tax contributions?,"I have 2-3 pay periods (4-6 weeks) left at my current job where I'd like to max out my contributions before I change jobs to a company that does not offer a 401k.  At my current job, they allow after-tax contributions with in-service distributions to a Roth IRA (Mega backdoor roth).  I have maxed out this benefit (10%) but for the remaining pay periods, I'm wondering if it's worth taking advantage of this at the expense of deductible contributions, due to contribution limits, totaling 50%.  Neither situation will let me hit the 19k limit before I leave and company match is the same for both situations.  End-date at current job is not flexible. 

&amp;#x200B;

A bit of background on my financial situation: I'm expecting to be in a higher tax bracket this year due to severance payouts (32% federal + 9.3% CA-state) and most likely go back down to 24% fed + 9.3% state for the forseeable future.  I normally will max out 401k, backdoor Roth and mega-backdoor Roth.  I will be able to keep my old 401k with low fees so no impact on backdoor Roth.  I'm all set with emergency fund, no debt (except mortgage of &lt;3:1 ratio of loan to yearly salary).  Much of my retirement savings is in a taxable brokerage account due to a large payout from a previous startup I've been involved in.  I have approximately equal amounts in pre-tax and post-tax retirement accounts.  

&amp;#x200B;

personalfinance,Figuring out how to be a 1099 contractor [AK],"Hey there,

Starting 3/31 or 4/1 (hoping 4/1 for quarterly tax reasons!) I'll be picked up as a 1099 contractor. I have some doubts whether this should technically be a 1099 instead of a W2 position, but it's maritime and I'm not in a financial position to be picky as of now.

How do I go about filing every three months? If I only have costs for Jan-Mar and no income, do I still need an estimate for this quarter? I assume I'll need to siphon off 25-33% of each check to cover year-end taxes, but will I need to pay taxes each quarter or just submit estimates?

personalfinance,Bank offering a completely-free refinance?,"My spouse and I recently bought a house a few months ago. The loan officer from the bank recently contacted me and offered me a no-cost refinance to a lower interest rate. This would result in a 0.25% lower interest rate. Now, normally, a no-cost, no-point loan wouldn't raise any eyebrows from me, as typically the various costs like the origination fee, appraisals, recording fees, taxes, and so on get rolled up into the loan, minus some credits from the bank. However, the loan officer says that it truly is no cost at all to me: the loan amount is the same as my current principal balance, and the bank is offering loan credit to cover all the loan costs. The only thing I would pay is pre-paid interest for the days in between closing of the old loan and the first payment for the new loan. (This is reflected in the loan estimate document provided by the bank)

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I know there's no free lunch, and am wondering if this is too good to be true? I'm essentially getting a lower interest rate completely for free, and offhand, it doesn't look like the bank is making any money off of this. Why would a bank offer such generous terms, and is this usual? Could this be something like employees trying to sweeten a deal to get loan signups to meet monthly quotas? Also, the bank in question is Wells Fargo, which in the past has had some shady practices, which is another reason for my skepticism.",finance

She would prefer to pay it in a lump sum every year ($150-220k a year).

I would prefer to invest the money and draw from it in monthly installments to pay it off ($14-17k/month), that way I see us being able to make a 13th payment every year using the account appreciation. I also prefer this approach as we keep control of our money for longer.

My wife is paranoid about us investing this sum and losing it in a surprise crash in the next few years, when we could just pay it off and be done with it.

personalfinance,Is Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF/TEPSLF) Even Worth It?,"Here's the deal:  I've worked for a 501(c)(3) non-profit for five and a half years.  I knew this organization would qualify me for PSLF after 10 years and my student loan debt could be cancelled.   Knowing that I could verify my employer at any time, I foolishly waited until recently to actually check my qualifying payments.  It turns out my employer was fine but my standard repayment plan does not qualify for PSLF and my 5.5 years of payments did not count at all.  I acknowledge this was a major oversight on my part, but at the time I started working for the non-profit I combed over the PSLF website and did not see this important detail anywhere!  Turns out  [I'm not alone](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/29/this-public-service-loan-forgiveness-remedy-isnt-reaching-many-people.html), 99% of applicants were rejected last year for similar reasons.  The qualifications were intentionally vague.  

&amp;#x200B;

Enter the Temporary Expanded Public Service Loan Forgiveness (TEPSLF).  I imagine that a lot of angry letters gave way to to the TEPSLF, which expands the program to include non-income-based repayment plans like mine.  I will qualify for TEPSLF in 4.5 years IF it still exists or has been replaced by something similar.  It seems like a big if, but could potentially save me a fair amount of money.  I've been paying the minimum and if I change nothing and do not qualify for TEPSLF I will not have the loans paid off until 2032.  So my question to you is:  What is the best financial move for me now?  

&amp;#x200B;

I have two federal loans, standard repayment plans both at 6.125%:

Loan 1 remaining principal:  $20,061 - Currently paying $187.38/month.  

Loan 2 remaining principal:  $8,208 - Currently paying $77.66/month.

(I also have an interest-free loan from a family member that I'll pay back in full:  Currently at $18,250 - paying back at $250/month.). 

&amp;#x200B;

I know some people have heated opinions about loans being forgiven with public money.  I can only assure you that with the interest, I'll still have paid back more than the borrowed amount.  I'd really appreciate any strictly financial advice on the best way to deal with these loans.  I'll potentially hit the TEPSLF requirements in January 2024.  Should I keep paying the minimum or forget the forgiveness and pay them off as aggressively as possible?  Something in-between?

personalfinance,I am permanently disabled. How stupid would it be to take all of the college loans I can?,"So, this is probably (it absolutely is) unethical, but let me lay out my situation. I am 20 years old and going to college. I am permanently physically disabled, the government acknowledges this (USA). I qualify for DVR, a program that essentially pays for me to go to a state college as long as I maintain grades and go for a degree in an in demand field (both of which I am intending on doing). DVR pays the difference that FAFSA does not (let's say about $1200 per quarter, tuition books  and everything else included). 

* FAFSA is going to give me $2032. I'm taking 13 credits right now at a cost of $2690 (before books, and everything else, so let's say about $3200). 

* The federal direct subsidized loan is $3500 Per quarter (and begins accruing interest immediately) and the federal direct unsubsidized loan is $2224 (it begins accruing interest six months after I graduate). This amounts to $5724 per quarter in loans.

* If I maintain 13 credits, to maintain financial aid, I'm thinking it's going to average out to about $3200 Per quarter. I'm intending on a Masters degree, and do not have an AA presently, so I'm looking at roughly 5 years of school (the college I am attending offers an accelerated Masters program once you have your bachelors, if you qualify).

* If I take $1200 from $5724, that leaves me with $4524 after tuition, books and everything else per quarter.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________


If I were to take the $4524 and straight put it into a bank account with zero interest every quarter, I would be looking at roughly $90,480. Here is where my ethical dilemma ensues, because I am previously mentioned fully disabled, if I do not find a job within two years of graduation, I can write these loans off and pay nothing. So after two years of not working and living off the roughly $90,000 (I live in the middle of nowhere, rent is about $450 a month, this is totally doable) I will have a Masters degree in a field that averages $60,000 starting wage, and no college loan debt. I also qualify for the ABLE bank program, and I am able to put up to $100,000 in a bank account untaxed.

Electricity,Portable generator amperage limits,"Hello all,

First off I'm fairly mechanically inclined, I know the electrical basics - pretty good with AC and DC circuits - no expert (obviously that's why im here) but I can understand easy to medium electrical discussion.  So I don't need the water in the pipe analogy, at least I dont think so!

&amp;#x200B;

So I have a big cabin cruiser boat, purchased last year a 84 Bayliner 3270,  and I have decided I want a generator to supplement the onboard house battery bank.  I researched marine grade generators and the install costs of even used Onan or other similar models are in the 7-10k range.  This boat has a fly bridge and a very large recess under the upper helm console that runs the 6' beam of the bridge.  Its about 3.5 feet deep and 3.5 feet high.  It will fit a 4000W gas generator perfectly.

&amp;#x200B;

I got my handy dandy Harbor Freight catalog and they have a Predator 4000W on sale with 20% off discount for $219!  I really want to do to things - run my battery charger and (not at the same time) run my air conditioner.  Problem 1) I dont know how many amps the AC pump is - its a reverse heat cycle marine AC and I can't find any tags on the motor or system components to indicate the draw.  It was an aftermarket installation and the previous owner or installer left no documentation.  2) The air conditioner is wired into the AC circuit breaker panel which is normally fed from 20A or 30A shore power service.

&amp;#x200B;

My original first thought was to make up a shore power cord with a 120 plug on the end plug it into the 120 outlet and run the cord over the side and plug into the shore power connection and presto I could power anything on the boat I wanted to.  BUT the 120 outlets on the generator are 13A max and my concern is that it will not be able to power my air conditioner which is of an unknown value.  Although the breaker on the panel in the boat is 15 amps and its never popped during shore power air conditioning events.

&amp;#x200B;

So here is the electrical connection question (finally).  The running wattage of this gen set is 3120W which is either 240v \* 13A or 120\*13\*2 for the 120 sockets provided.  OR the math in reverse works out to be 3120/120=26A.  So could I swap one of the 13A breakers in one of the 120 circuits to get the full 26A out of the unit (not that I would run that much continuously)?  Seems I may have a problem because the 3 circuits (two 120s and a 240) are all split between the 3 phases of the gen so does that rule out the possibility of getting all 26A unless the 3 phases were combined?  Thats probably naive to say isn't it?

&amp;#x200B;

Preditor also has a 2000w inverter generator with a single 13A 120 circuit. I understand an inverter generator combines all 3 phases of AC converts to DC and the back to AC for a single phase output through the inverter.  Whats the benefit of having 3000W 13A vs 2000w 13A.  I understand the Watt is a unit of power but I suppose I dont entirely understand how the Watt relates to my above situation.

I know Dogecoin was invented as a fun/silly project but has flourished into something bigger than its original intention. Would a more realistic and sustainable monetary policy make more sense?

Does it require a hardfork to implement a new supply rate? How hard would it be to pull off? What would the implications be?

personalfinance,Just got approved for chase freedom. Should I use the 0% interest for 18 months and transfer cc balance and use the extra money to pay off personal loan?,"I currently spend as much as I can afford, so I don't have any credit card debt.  But I was wondering if I should abuse the 0% interest and instead of paying off the card and loan, just put the balance each month in the 0% interest, use the money I would be paying off my card with to pay off my loan instead.  Then at the end of the promo pay off all the credit card debt I accumulate.

&amp;#x200B;

loan :

**Principal:10,050.00**

**Loan Term (year):4**

**Annual Interest Rate:5.65%**

**Payments per Year:12**

**Payment:$234.40**

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I have about 7.2k balance remaining.  So i would basically be putting around $700 extra per month, but also be accumulating a cc balance but with no interest and only paying minimum.  There is a 3% balance transfer fee, but that's not that high.",finance

worldpolitics,USA in pursuit of Arctic resources,"The Arctic has always attracted and will attract the attention of investors because of its resource potential. Sergei Shoigu, Minister of Defense of the Russian Federationб back in August last year, stated that the Arctic is an object of interest for a number of states, which could be a cause for conflict between countries. According to his words, now in this region there are icebreakers not only of Russia, but also of South Korea, Sweden, Germany, the USA and China.

It should be noted that previously these lands were belonging to the Soviet Union, but after its collapse, the United States began to talk about the economic and coastal zone. The interest of the United States and the European Union in the Arctic is explained simply: according to experts, there are up to 30 percent of all undiscovered oil and gas reserves, as well as other important natural resources - platinum, gold, nickel, and diamonds.

However, until recently, little attention was paid to northern latitudes and their development. The climate there is so severe that the cost of production is very high, and therefore could not make a profit. The problem was the transportation of mined minerals. But because of global warming, the situation in the Arctic Ocean began to change. The ice is gradually receding and opens not only access to oil and gas, but also the Arctic transport routes. Experts predict that until the end of the century there will be almost no ice in the Arctic Ocean, and this will make shipping free almost all year round.

Also, there are two major areas in the Arctic: the Northern Sea Route along the coast of Russia and the Northwest Passage, which connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The use of these ways significantly reduces the time for the supply of goods and energy from Asia to Europe and North America.

Where there are rich natural resources and the most important sea routes lie, the risk of military-political conflicts is inevitable. Not only the countries that are directly adjacent to it, but also China, the United Kingdom, and even India, claim the Arctic region. Beijing officially announced its strategic goals in the Arctic as follows: China ""is a country in the Arctic zone"" and will actively invest in this region, including sending ships on expeditions in order to prepare the Polar Silk road for operation. Anne-Marie Brady, a political analyst from New Zealand, in her book «China as a Great Arctic Power» writes that China allocates more funds for the development of the Arctic than all other countries, including new polar bases, maritime infrastructure, construction of icebreakers and satellite communications .

The United States has limited access to the Arctic through Alaska. Therefore, Washington, along with other countries that do not have access to the Arctic Ocean, advocates the collective use of its resources. This is being done to prevent the Russian Federation from becoming a monopolist in the extraction of energy resources. On March 5, 2019, the commander of the European command of the US Armed Forces, General Curtis Scaparrotti, even declared that he was ready to hold back Russia in the Arctic.

But ""the United States has the smallest sector of the Arctic through Alaska and generally in the Arctic on bird rights."" Claiming free access to the entire Arctic for Americans is inappropriate and unwise: the United States does not have the capabilities and technical means to provide such access.",energy

personalfinance,"[UK] How can I move the balance from a high APR rewards card to a low APR one, on a monthly basis?","Hi All,

I  live in the UK and I'm wondering whether the below has already been  done/is doable (I've searched for it, couldn't find any reference, sorry  if this is the wrong place to ask):

* spend normally on a miles rewards/cashback card (which typically is running with a high interest rate)
* on a monthly basis move the balance to a low interest credit card, that I can service at a more leisurely pace

The  key here is the monthly movement, it doesn't have to be the full  balance, just the bit that I don't want to pay high interest on. As a  worked example of what I'm after, consider the following:

1. I spend as normal during the month, and before payday I've got a balance of £5,000
2. I'm only willing to commit £3,000 towards immediate CC balance repayment, hence my balance will be £2,000 on the rewards card
3. I'm looking to move this £2,000 to a low interest card, and pay it in smaller installments
4. On a monthly basis I'm looking to move £1-2,000 to the low interest card until I reach the credit limit

What do you reckon, is it doable?",finance
stocks,US Stocks at 5-month High Ahead of Fed Decision on Wednesday,"### US Stock Market Preview Ahead of the Open

* **US stocks index futures are climbing this morning,** even after the S&amp;P 500 closed at a 5-year high with front-month Dow Jones minis +0.41%, S&amp;P 500 minis +0.41% and Nasdaq 100 minis +0.40% 
* The **US Federal Reserve (the Fed) is set to release its decision on interest rates tomorrow** after the conclusion of the 2-day FOMC meetings. 
* The United States is set to announce final **January durable goods orders growth** at 10:00 AM. Analysts expect growth of +0.4%, in line with December’s durable goods orders growth of +0.4%. 
* The United States will also announce **factory orders growth in January** at 10:00 AM today. Analysts expect growth of +0.1% while December saw higher factor orders growth of +0.3%.   
* Oppenheimer technical analysis strategists argue that **the current rally in low volatility stocks is positive for the US stock market in general**.  While the S&amp;P 500 Low Volatility index is up +17% since the S&amp;P500 hit its lows on December 24th, it has underperformed the broader S&amp;P 500.  The divergence in performance suggests that while low volatility stocks have performed well, it is simply a function of broader re-rating of the S&amp;P 500. 
* A **weaker US Dollar will be needed to help boost the S&amp;P 500 further** according to Bloomberg.  Unless the Greenback weakens in the second half of CY2019, we may not see a strong recovery in tech and materials stocks earnings – the two sectors who saw the largest EPS declines in 1H.  
* After another “no vote” on her BREXIT Plan in the UK Parliament, **UK Prime Minister Theresa May is looking for another extension to the deadline** for the UK exit of the European Union (EU). 
* The VIX is little changed this morning and is currently at 13.1 after closing at 13.1 yesterday
* **iShares China Large-Cap ETF (FXI)** April 18 OTM Calls and **Coty (COTY)** May 2019 OTM Calls &amp; Puts are the most actively traded options contracts in US pre-market trading this morning. 
* US 10-Year Treasury Bonds are higher with yields down -0.36 basis points to 2.5997%
* The US Treasury 2s-10s Spread has widened 0.06 basis points to 0.15%
* WTI Crude is currently up 0.97% to USD$59.09/bbl with the Brent-WTI spread little changed USD$0.05 to USD$8.5/bbl
* Gold is currently up 0.36% to USD$1308.36/oz
* Current global crude **oil prices will need a further rally in the US stock market and sustained production cuts from OPEC** according to analysis by Bloomberg.  While Saudi Arabia has recently cut production targets, The Kingdom continues to produce 1mm bbls/day above CY2014 production levels.  This would suggest the current production cuts only address last year’s excess capacity and do not properly confront the impact of decelerating global growth on oil demand.

Bitcoin,Okex full of lies and unreported hackings,"So this is a story with multiple incidents. The reason i tell it is to warn other users and the fact that their funds might not be safe any longer.

1. **Internal HACK**  
My email was changed from within okex, and no ID was asked, no mail from support, no nothing.. That field has no change button on it so if possible it had to be done with special request. Okex could not provide any email or evidence that proved they received such a request. \~12 BTC were transferred off. After many mails in which they tried to convince me i changed it (although it is not freaggin possible) they gave me back \~90% of lost funds.. As i was talking with walls i decided to take what they offered. 
2. **Enabling 2FA on accounts without it by force**  
After being internally hacked and not admitting it they changed their internal policy and blocked all accounts that did not have 2FA leaving users with open trades and no access to accounts. This happened to me. I had a stupid long position open that was heading towards liquidation.   
I sent an email asking them to remove the 2FA urgently so i can manage my position on 14 DEC. They sent the request further and asked me for:  
 

We need to confirm it, you want to remove 2fa from okcoin account, right? If yes.

We can remove 2FA for you, please send those information :

Surname (Last name):  
given name (first and middle names):   
Former name(s)/Alias (if application):   
Date of birth:   
Nationality:   
Name (in local language):   
Passport number:  
Current living address information:

Offline level-2 documents required:  
1- International Passport photo.  
2- Address proof document (ID or Driver's license or Bank statement or Utility bill with your current living address which is issued within 3 months in English)  
After that, please finish video verification by skype.  
May your account or withdrawal will be frozen according to the safety rule.

&amp;#x200B;

* So after enabling my accounts 2FA, they wanted level 2 verification as well. I complied and sent them all the data in the hope that i can get access to my account to manage my position. No no on. They have the audacity to actually make me wait another 72 hours for something i did not do with the risk of me losing my position!! I was outraged.   
 

thanks for your understanding and cooperation during the process.

For security concerns, we need to freeze the account  first for 72 hours. Please provide this code: 6996ED after 72 hours, we will remove the GA at that time.

For withdrawal, we will enable it after you finish level 2 verification online.

&amp;#x200B;

* Account was restored after 72 hours with all my level 2 verification deleted... which i had to redo! (no prior announcement or anything to let me know this was going to happen)

&amp;#x200B;

**3. Tried deleting my account (yeah right!)**

&amp;#x200B;

So i decided to leave and asked them to delete my account. That is not possible apparently. You can only freeze it.. so they have your entire history and personal information which you have no say over. But this is not the worst if you can believe it or not:

* sent them an email from a different address of mine that had nothing to do with the account and asked them to delete it. A few hours later it was suspended no questions asked as of who is this new email.
* Then i noticed and asked them to unfreeze the account so i can change some information in it that is bogus if they **can't** delete the account. I received this answer:

  

[The Lie](https://i.redd.it/tz8touvre2n21.png)

* 16 Hours later still blocked and they again have the audacity to ask for a skype call and all that other BS [https://i.imgur.com/xzqUV8A.png](https://i.imgur.com/xzqUV8A.png) 
* They refused to answer me why they blocked my account from a different mail then the one registered. 
* They sent me a personal mail to my registered address hoping i won't noticed they changed it because they effed up!
* After getting a support specialist on the line that was ready to explain to me how come i was able to block my account from a bogus email but not unblock it?! they cut the chat to the whole site =))))))

&amp;#x200B;

I\`m not making this stuff up, but believe me i wish i would.. I spent many years on okex even before it was independent and the level of lies and unprofessionality i witnessed here is at another level. 

Maybe i\`m alone in this, in which case i constantly just get unlucky, or it's been happening for a while but again ppl will ignore it until it's to late. 

&amp;#x200B;

personalfinance,Savings account vs Certificate of Deposit?,"Hey guys,

I was comparing Bank of America and Chase savings account to decide which one would be better for me. I saw that BoA had better interest rates, but Chase had a higher CD. I went with Chase because I figured since I wanted to make a savings account to keep money in without touching it, I could benefit from the higher CD rate.

However, I just realized that the CD is a separate account from the savings. That is, I thought that a ""CD"" was just a form of depositing money into my savings, not a separate account from the savings itself.

My questions are:

What benefit would the CD give me over the regular savings account?

Would it be a good idea to open a separate CD account, or just close the savings and open the CD?

Any input would be appreciated!

stocks,Ladybaybee recommended picks for 2019-03-19,"[Link to imgur](https://imgur.com/a/UQW8uPx)


**HOW I USE THIS:** 

1) All the stocks identified in the table are qualified as “BUY” opportunities.

2) I focus in the column “Success Rate(3m)” which shows the precision of the agents in the last 3 calendar months. I personally feel most comfortable with Rates 0.8 or higher. 

3) Then, I see the number in “Tx(3m)” which represents the number of transactions that the agents predicted for this stock in the last 3 months. I prefer stocks that have had at least two transactions during this period. 

4) Finally, I look at Growth(3m), if the agents have had a considerable growth (&gt;5% in 3 months) then I follow that trade. 

5) If a row in the table is colored green then it means that stock has been on the rise today so I purchase it immediately in order to ride the wave up. On the other hand, if the row is colored red, then I wait out until very close to market close to purchase the stock and let the price bottom out before climbing up again tomorrow.


6) After I purchase the stocks, I ALWAYS set a stop loss order at -2.5% from my buying price valid for the day. I think this is good hygiene, no matter how confident I am of my system, I still want to make sure that my losses are capped. I update this stop loss order every day. 

Many people have been curious about the actual process that the system follows, so here it is: for every symbol (600 stocks are analyzed daily), we get the full stock data (open,close,high,low,volume) for the past 4 months. Each stock is associated with another set of “lookalike” stocks as well as major ETF’s. This initial dataset is run through a convolutional layer that extracts an undisclosed number of features. These features are then passed onto a recurrent neural network (LSTM) where sequences and patterns are extracted. The LSTM then spits out probabilities for the likelihood that this stock will have a positive, negative and neutral tendency in the next N days. These probabilities are then fed to a genetic evolution system (GES). This system essentially checks the predictions for the past N days and compares them with reality, following that the systems knows which predictions are performing the best. Once the system knows which stocks are being simulated the best, then the system automatically finds which of these best performing stocks have the biggest potential for the next few days. The system does not output explanations, unfortunately us humans are not capable of understanding (or visualizing) a problem of this dimensionality, for example the LSTM part alone works with over 10 million dimensions, not features but dimensions.

personalfinance,"Received 2018 W2 in mail for last paycheck of 2017, when I was at a different job. The job was also in a different state.

personalfinance,Bird in the hand vs. 2 in the bush? (Paying off car),"Good morning r/personalfinance. I’m a long time lurker, first time poster. I poked around a bit and found many similar posts but nothing quite like what I’m thinking so here goes.

I owe about $11.5k on my car with a monthly payment of $460/month and a 1.99% interest rate. I have the money in savings to pay off the balance on the loan in one go and still have a healthy emergency fund left over. My dilema is, I plan on starting school soon and paying for as much as I can then financing the rest. Without divulging too much unnecessary information, I’m not sure if it’s more beneficial to keep that $11.5k where it is (Savings account at my credit union, nothing special) or pay off the car and free up that $460/month, which will likely just start going into savings instead of a car payment.

Married/34/2 Kids/combined Income 150K/YR. - I have pretty much the entire prime directive set and am looking for advice about potential additional investments. I have about 6 months emergency fund sitting in an Ally savings account, but a good percentage of that is overkill; 1/3 is daycare expenses which will slowly decrease as the young one gets older.  Maxed Roth IRA every January in order to deplete over-savings, maxing 401K fed limit while wife and I both have additional pensions, and will be using our tax return to finance a safer family vehicle this summer (currently we have 1 reliable car and 2 beaters for only 2 drivers).  Even with this and budgeting for vacations/toys/fun/home improvement projects, I feel like I can and should be investing a little something extra as I am actively trying to prevent a lot of lifestyle creep; we have a great home, wife and I both (relatively) happy at our jobs, etc.  

In the coming months/years, where should I be looking to make additional investments?  My Roth is at Vanguard, I was looking at some sort of automated Index buy every paycheck... does anyone have something set up like this? I definitely want something automated I don't have to babysit or even think about. 

Another option considered is 529 plan for our kid's college, however if things continue as is we will have a large discount on In-state Universities so the amount required may vary wildly. 

I of course can choose to pay down mortgage/vehicles faster, but from what I understand investing rather than going this route has higher potential earnings, and I am probably willing to take that risk.

&amp;#x200B;

I will be graduating from college this semester &amp; have secured a job in Raleigh, North Carolina starting in June. My salary will be $85,000. This is a lot of money for someone who has only ever worked part time jobs in their life before. I've come looking for some financial advice.

&amp;#x200B;

I plan on putting 18,500 a year into my 401k (I assumed maxing would be smart but if anyone has any opinions i'd gladly hear them). My employer matches half of what I put in up to the IRS limit, which I believe is 18,500. This brings my taxable income down to 66,500. My rough tax estimate after looking at a few calculators online is 24.18%. That gives me 66,500\*.7582= $50,420.30 of actual annual income.

**Cell phone:**$80

**Cable/internet:** $100

**Groceries:** $250

personalfinance,Should I refinance my student loans?,"I am considering refinancing my student loans. I really don’t know much about it, or if it’s even a good idea, here is my situation:

I have $35,000 in student loan debt. $11,000 of that is subsidized federal loans with fixed interest rates between 3.15% and 4.41%. I’m not so much worried about these. The other $24,000 however is a private loan which has an 11% variable interest rate. 

I currently pay the minimum on each one every month ($450 total) and apply $260 extra a month to the big private one. This would help me pay my loans off in 5 years. I would ideally like to pay them off sooner as well as not be paying an arm and leg for interest.

personalfinance,"GAP Insurance, Dealer said when I cancelled that the premiums would be paid against the remaining principle.","Hopefully the title makes sense. When my wife and I bought our first car we got a decent deal. Negotiated ~ $2000 off a $14,500 certified used small SUV that was low mileage and about 4-5 years old. When had good credit (mid 700s) and had shopped around for good interest rates, but the dealer offered 3.1% which was the best we had seen. We took it! We have been very happy with the car for several years now, but with one kid and another on the way we are starting to look at minivans. 

Now, when I was negotiating with the finance office at the dealer, they were pushing GAP insurance. I was unsure if I wanted to bite, but then they told me that everything I paid in premiums towards GAP insurance would be applied towards the remaining balance of the loan if I ever wanted to cancel. We have been right-side up on the car for a while now. If we trade in we should be several hundred ahead. If we sell private party we should be around $2k ahead. So I want to cancel. But I can't find anything about this in my contract.

Is this how GAP insurance commonly works? I am going to call the dealership and financing agency soon to look into it more. If I can't find anything about this promise they made am I just out of luck?

I'm a sophomore in college approaching junior year with very little help. My parents refuse to cosign any more loans as my father's credit took a hit this year from the loans he helped me with already.

Tuition is around $11,000 and I can get $6,500 from federal direct loans. I am not independent, according to the government, as far as student loans go, so I can't apply for any more help through the government. My family makes enough that I don't get any grants or need-based aid, either.

I missed the scholarship deadline at school because I didn't realize the position I'm in- which, admittedly, was stupid.

Is there anywhere I could go to get a loan without a cosigner as a student? I have had a credit card since August and have a score of about 700, but with no history that doesn't amount to much.

personalfinance,(US/VA) How do we protect my SAHM wife's (32F) healthcare should I (33M) pass early?,"Between life insurance and retirement funds, my wife will receive ~$1.35M.

&amp;nbsp;

She has a disability (that we've been trying to get on SSDI for...it's an arduous, years-long slog), and we have a &lt;1yo child. We all rely on my primary employer's group health insurance plan. With a household income of ~$89k, we currently don't qualify for any state/federal assistance. My wife has previously worked a full-time job, but her condition (Type 2 Narcolepsy, basically she has a finite amount of energy per day) has been steadily worsening; she likely won't work again. Our long-term plan is to FI/RE so that I can care for her later.

&amp;nbsp;

But for now, I'm putting into place a plan/will/trust that'll take care of everything for as long as possible: if she wants to rent for another ten years ($1,850/mo), or she can buy a home (&lt;$200k) back home near family and have a full-service move done. Of course, it'll also payoff the remaining $40k in student loans (hers, so it won't die with me). My math says that the remaining principal will generate a SWR of ~$43.5k/yr. That gets taxed (turns into ~$3k/mo) and then combines with the Survivor Benefit (~$1.3k/mo); all-up, she'll have about $4.3k/mo to cover our remaining $2,289.86/mo living costs (food, utilities, insurance, various sinking funds, etc.). (I already have all of our financial obligations automated using Bill Pay and whatnot.) After it's all said and done, she'll have about $2k/mo to do whatever she wants to with (we've talked about things like hiring a part-time nanny, maid, dog-walker for her service dog, and someone to maintain the ESA cat's litter box).

&amp;nbsp;

But then I noticed the alarmingly large 'healthcare' hole.  
As of *today*, she is not on Disability and therefore doesn't have Medicaid.  
As of *today*, she takes a medicine (1 of 3) that costs about $8.5k/mo (THANK you, insurance, for reducing our portion to $35).  
My Google-fu can only find anecdotal stories from widows about what they did for healthcare, and they revolved around no-income (won't be the case here) and/or going back to work (cannot be the case here).

&amp;nbsp;

What can I look into?  
A thought I had last night is this. All righty, so morals and ethics aside, I think this comes down to an income/tax situation. Given that our current financial life is essentially automated, would there be a way to structure the trust so that my wife receives ""zero income,"" and she could then qualify for Medicaid? Like, she can use the credit card for whatever she wants, but the trust will own not only the principal, but also own all the bank accounts, property titles and/or rental lease, and have all the bills assigned to it?  
We are not wealthy, and we don't come from wealth, but I am aware enough to know that arrangements like this exist.",finance
personalfinance,Refiling taxes (US/Mass),"Ok so here's the deal.

Last year (January 2018), I started a new part time job. When I filled out my W-4 I put my total Personal Allowances at 0 since my mother can still claim me (Line A of Personal Allowances Worksheet on W-4) until I'm 25 and I didn't meet any of the other criteria. Since I made so little last year and didn't expect to be making that much this year, combined with the fact that I could be claimed as a dependent, I ended up writing down that I was exempt.

Over the summer I ended up working there full-time and totally forgot about anything tax related. Then this year, I left the job and went to file my taxes. When I filed, I filed as an independent and not claimed by my mother. Since no taxes had been coming out of my paycheck all year, I now owe about $2000 to the Federal Government and $80 to The Commonwealth of Massachusetts. 

My question is whether I should refile as a dependent since that's what it said on my W-4, or whether I should've filed as independent in the first place and now it's just too late.

The USDCAD pair is forming a very nice buy setup on the daily chart , after recently finding support at the confluence of a rising trendline and the 61.8% Fib level (February 27).

In March, the pair broke above a triangle pattern and completed a pullback to the upper triangle line.

The current price action is extremely interesting as a long confirmation, given that the pair formed a marginal higher high and retested the 61.8% Fib level in today's trade (the Fib tool with the semi-transparent background).

Today's candle is forming a strong pinbar candle, which suggests a strong rejection of prices below 1.3300.

Tomorrow's FOMC meeting will likely create some volatility in the pair, which is the major short-term risk for buyers.

personalfinance,"Early 40's with a huge mess, where do we even start","Brief intro:  My wife and I are in our early 40's and our finances are a mess.  Everything was mostly in order until around 2012, when a series of severe health issues (two bouts with cancer and an unrelated severe car accident) kicked us off a steady financial path and on a downhill tumble.  While she was sick we had significantly reduced income, and put a lot of medical expenses and living expenses on credit, and ate most of our long-term savings.  We're ""trying"" to get things back in order but honestly we're just floundering around, not making any real progress.  

The good:  
- We each have a steady corporate job (maybe $110k gross combined), but benefits are very soft  
- A pretty good amount of home equity (value ~260k, owe ~120k)   
- Some long-term investments (about $120k in individual stocks, but not nearly what we should have to ever be able to retire)  
- Her car owned outright  
- Cook at home most of the time, try to pack lunch to work most of the time, eat out only a few times a month  
  
The bad:  
- Like 30k in credit card debt, including $21k on an Amex that's in her mom's and her name  
- Two small debts under $2k that are in collections, and a third that hopefully is gone now (they sent us a summons, we hired a lawyer, collections couldn't provide proof of debt, our lawyer said it'd be deleted)  
- Accounts and auto-payments with all sorts of services all over the place - Our credit union, Regions, Paypal, I don't even know them all off the top of my head.  Tracking our money is like untangling wire clothes hangers.  
- Just about nothing in any 401k or other dedicated retirement, aside from the aforementioned stocks  
- My car has a monthly payment  
- She has a ton of unreimbursed personal expenses for business, so her actual net income is way lower than gross
- Federal income taxes are unexpectedly rough for 2018 because said unreimbursed expenses are no longer deductible
- Credit scores are in the low-mid 500's
- no passive income

The ugly:  
- Together we have a terrible relationship with money, even typing this post is making me nauseous  
- Undisciplined spending habits.  Penny-wise, pound-foolish, sometimes penny-foolish too.
- An unspecified/unknown amount of medical debt from an auto accident and her spine surgery (disc replacement, tons of PT/rehab, etc).  In short, all the paperwork/expenses went through our personal injury lawyer, but the insurance had a meaner lawyer than us, we lost in court and we haven't spoken to our lawyer in a couple years.  
.  
  
Where do we even start?  Ideas:  
-- Try to make a budget.  
1. try to get excel-compatible statements from banks and Paypal, to categorize income/payments.  Will Mint do this?  
2. use that to have a rough idea of our spending over the past several months  
2a. cry and drink some vodka  
3. figure out where we can cut and trim expenses  
3a. probably argue and nitpick over insignificant stuff  
4. Load that into YNAB and see what happens  

-- Stop avoiding the things that went to collections, look them up from creditkarma statements, contact them to demand proof of debt.  

-- do something about this credit card debt.  We've been paying double the minimums, on time every month, for the past two years.  Good payment history, but we're barely denting the principal.  I think we have enough equity to do a home equity loan, but our credit scores are crap so that might not be viable.  We asked our CU about a home equity loan about a year ago and they basically laughed us out of the office.  

Anyway.  Any ideas or expert opinions will be considered.",finance

&amp;#x200B;

personalfinance,Old Employer Plan ROTH 403b question,"So, I had a really good employer cafeteria plan which had multiple diversified low cost options and a GIC cash fund which for years was averaging 3-4%, (awesome in the years of 0.2% interest rates). When I separated from my employer 10 years ago, I left the funds there.  Currently in my 50's, so only a few years until I can access if I need to, but prefer not to as it is roth'ed.

So got a letter from the plan administrator that they are totally gutting the plan and reducing me from about 30 funds to THREE.  A total stock market fund, a bond fund, and a cash fund.  This does not work for me.

So, am I stuck with my old employers plan for life?  Or can I now roll over to Fidelity or whomever for a 401k ROTH.  I didn't know an employer could change the plan so drastically, otherwise I would have rolled over when I left the job.",finance
personalfinance,"I'm a college student, what are things I can start doing now to ensure financial stability once I start working full time? any easy ways to start investing smaller amounts of money?","I'm a college student in the Bay Area. I'm graduating spring 2020. I'm not going to be graduating into a super high paying industry i.e. tech but I'm good at networking and getting good references, so I am confident I will have a job when I graduate that will pay enough to not be struggling. However, I also don't want to spend all my money on rent, so I plan on moving out of state as I start my career, to a smaller city with lower living expenses. I'm open to any decently sized city across the country, but my main choice as of right now is Chicago because a job I really want would be located there. However, I know Chicago is slightly expensive to live in (cheap compared to here though) so I'm also considering Houston and Miami. I'd want to live away from California until I pay off my loans, which are going to total about $25k (all federal). I foresee that it should take about 7 years to pay them off if all goes well. I have no other debt (never bought a car or opened a credit card). I do recognize that I should open a credit card soon because I'll need a credit score, but I have mostly held off due to fear from seeing friends run themselves into debt. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ideally, I'd want to move back to California to the LA area once I'm more established in my career and have paid off my loans. I know that plan may or may not change over the years so I'm not super focused on that goal at the moment. I want to know if there are any ways to start investing smaller amounts of money now so I can slowly start building any wealth. I don't really know anything about investments and the like so I'm not sure how it even works. I know I should be saving as much money as possible right now, but with the rents here, going to school full time, and working only part time, it's kind of impossible. I do plan on stacking up as much money as I can over the summer, although whenever I've done that in the past it's more like a reserve fund for myself during the semester when I can't work as much. I'd also like advice on how to use a credit card once I do open it-- I've heard it's best to just use it to pay for small purchases like coffee and groceries? Will I be able to build a good credit score this way?",finance

personalfinance,"What's the deal with the ""rules of thumb"" on housing?","I've been confused by this for a good minute.  Maybe it's just because they are just that - rules of thumb.  Not to be followed exactly or too specifically.  But the three big ones I hear frequently are:

- The mortgage should not exceed 2-2.5x your annual income

- PITI should not exceed 28% of your gross monthly income

- PITI should not exceed one third of your net monthly income

I realize that this stuff can vary depending on your exact situation.  Your tax rate influences it.  Your insurance rate influences it.  Your interest rate influences it.  A lot of stuff influences it.  But my results are WILDLY different in theory and I don't really understand why.  Here's the scenario I tried:

Guy makes $50,000 gross annual; about 4150 gross monthly, and let's say it comes to about 3400 net monthly.  According to the first rule, this guy's mortgage should only be about 100k-125k.  With 20% down, that gives him a home price of about 125k-160k.    Fair enough.  

But the second and third rules come in significantly higher than that.  PITI on a $125k mortgage should only come out to somewhere around 20% of this guy's gross salary (about $850/month).  On a 100k mortgage, less than 18%.  And it'd be about 21%/17% of his net.  So pretty close between the second (gross) and third (net) rules.  

But he's WAY under the guideline, when using the home value resulting from rule #1.  Why so different?  If this guy followed the first rule he'd find himself in a house worth somewhere around $150k, but if he followed the second or third rule he'd be up around $230k still assuming 20% down (monthly payment would be somewhere in the mid 1100s, which would be about 28% of gross or 34% of net). 

Why the difference?  That's a pretty huge window between those guidelines, he's bought a house worth fully 50% more in the second/third cases.  For my own situation it's actually slightly worse than this since property tax and homeowners insurance is pretty cheap in my area, skewing the second/third result even higher.  And I make more than that annually so there's even more at stake.

What gives?  Have I missed something here?",finance
personalfinance,"Checkup: asset allocation between rollover 401k, Roth IRA and Employer 401k","**Emergency funds:** Yes, 5-6 months 

**Debt:** Mortgage 415k (3.25%); Auto 20k (3.29%) and 21k (2.29%)

**Tax Rate:** 22% Federal, 9.3% State

**State of Residence:** CA

**Age:** husband and wife both 33



**Contributions**

$8k to his 401k (eligible to start in April at new job; 5% company match, so $12k total)

$4.5k her 401k (6% company match, ~$8k total) 

$5.5k his Roth IRA 


**Questions:**

(1) My wife and I recently rolled over our 401k's into an IRA at Vanguard. I have $5,500 to contribute to an IRA for 2018 and we are going to move my wife's Roth at Morgan Stanley to Vanguard. Given all that, I was thinking of the asset allocation below. Does this look appropriate to you?


   **His rollover IRA at Vanguard**

33% Total Stock Market Index Admiral (VTSAX) (ER=0.04%)

12% Total International Stock Index Admiral Shares (VTIAX) (ER=0.11%)

8% Total Bond Market Index Admiral Shares (VBTLX) (ER=0.05%)


**Her rollover IRA at Vanguard**

11% Total Stock Market Index Admiral (VTSAX) (ER=0.04%)

3% Total International Stock Index Admiral Shares (VTIAX) (ER=0.11%)

3% Total Bond Market Index Admiral Shares (VBTLX) (ER=0.05%)


**His Roth IRA**

4% Total International Stock Index Admiral Shares (VTIAX) (ER=0.11%)


**Her Roth IRA**

2% Total International Stock Index Admiral Shares (VTIAX) (ER=0.11%)


**His 401k**

8% FID 500 INDEX (FXAIX) (ER=0.015%) 


**Her 401k**

16% STATE STREET S&amp;P 500 IND NL N (CMDVM) (ER=0.02%)


(2) Given the above, I should have 68% in Domestic Stock, 22% in International and 10% in bond. Since our 401k contributions are all going to domestic stock, I figured I would balance this out by putting my Roth contributions in subsequent years into International. Is 90%/10% stock/bond a good strategy for my age? I feel like my wife and I took this stuff seriously a little later than some so I feel like we're already behind.


(3) I intend to up our contributions in subsequent years as I get our finances in order. Does it make more sense to max out Roth IRA after we meet company match while we still can, or forego the Roth and max out our 401k's?

personalfinance,"Stepdad passed, has $36k in Federal Student Loans in collections. Can I get discharge?","Hello. 

Recently my stepdad passed away, and to spare my mom from dealing with any of this I have been taking on his financials. He didn't have much as far as wealth goes. The only real financial legacy is the life insurance payout that is going 100% to my mom, and that's fine with me. 

My question is, while going through his paperwork there is a letter from a collection agency stating his $36k loan from Navient is now theirs to collect. My question is, since him and my mother are married, does this go to her? She did not cosign for this. This was from before they married but were married for 25 years after that. 

For his credit cards, I have been mailing out forms and death certificates and having them discharged, and to my understanding this also works with student loans. But the special circumstance that has me confused is that it is in collections. Will the collections agency also accept the death certificate and discharge it?

I haven't reached out to them because I am afraid of tipping them off and then having them go after my mom. 

I am just having a hard time dealing with all these things so suddenly, so please forgive my ignorance on these things. Any help is much appreciated.

personalfinance,Do I actually qualify for the AOTC tax refund?,So I was recently filing my taxes through turbo tax free and I was filling out the 1098t section for my college expenses. It asked me a series of questions such as if I was a part time student or not and a few others. I answered honestly on all of them and afterwards it added \~$900 to my federal return. Considering my original return was only \~$600 I was a little thrown off. Do I actually qualify for this? I looked at the requirements on the IRS's website and I fit everything they have listed. I just don't want to file and then have that money taken away if I did something wrong or I didn't actually qualify. I didn't hear from any of my other classmates about them receiving this and I know for certain that some of them would fit all of the qualifications listed.

personalfinance,Company I work for is being sold. 28 years old.,"Hello all and thanks in advance.

The company I work for is being sold. The exact sale date is up in the air as the company is owned by several individuals and a few are against the sale. They own the smallest percentage so the sale will happen just hard to say when.

My position along with several others will be gone once the new owners take over. In order to prevent us from jumping ship they offered us significant raises. They stated we would be given at least a 3 months heads up as the sale would happen at the end of a quarter. 

My girlfriend will be graduating school in May. This will result in us moving closer to where I work so I anticipate fuel going down. This will also put us closer to a new city that has my position. After looking around in said city there are jobs available around $45k a year in my field. 

Old pay $42k a year. New rate is $60k. Severance upon termination will be $5k paid over 5 weeks.

Current Expenses:

Student loans $500 a month (6.6 % interest rate)
Rent: $400 (includes utilities)
Phone: $135
Car: $290 (18 months left till it’s paid off at 3.4%)
Car ins: $65/month
Food:$300
Fuel:$400
401k: currently set to 10% of my paycheck. No company match. Been looking at IRAs

Credit card: $4,000.00. I was hit with an injury that landed me in the ER. This is the majority of my credit card debt. 

Questions:

1) is it a bad move to stay with a company where I know I have no future despite the money or once I move should I change jobs immediately?

2) where should I focus putting the extra income? 

3) should I build up my emergency fund further in case I don’t get a new job immediately. Currently sitting on $3000.00 but aware I’ll be getting the 5 weeks severance.

worldpolitics,New Russian weapons,"Weapons that are designed and manufactured in Russia, is one of the best in the world. Russian designers make incredible weapons, which deserve special attention. For example, the Kalashnikov assault rifle, which is widely used in almost all countries of the world. In order to keep up with new products and news in the world of weapons, we need to get acquainted with new models. Russia's armament in 2019 will amaze with its practicality and power.

The rocket with its own nuclear power plant as part of a strategic complex is a fundamentally new approach that was successfully tested in 2017, and whose introduction to the troops develops in 2018 and 2019. This is a multipurpose nuclear missile of unlimited range, capable of independently bypassing air defense and missile defense. The hypersonic air-to-missile air-to-air missile complex ""Kinzhal"" has no world analogues, as well as many other developments representing the armament of Russia in 2019. It already has experienced combat duties in the Southern Military District. The missiles will be included in the arsenal of a new generation of SU-57, they are almost invisible to the radar and airborne protection of enemy aircraft at the expense of speed. Also, they are named by experts abroad as one of the main trump cards of Russian military aircraft.

Such a new weapon of Russia, like the MiG-35 of “4 ++” generation is a transitional link to the 5th generation fighter. The ceiling for work is 16 km, the range depending on the armament (cargo) is from 800 to 1,400 km. This is in many ways a very advanced development, requiring less cost than fifth-generation fighter jets, but at the same time capable of competing with them, and superior in capabilities to fourth-generation aircraft. In the meantime, the fifth-generation fighters of the Perspective aviation complex of front aviation have already been developed by Russian scientists and technicians, and the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation is beginning to acquire them.

In 2019, the Russian military will begin to receive equipment ""Ratnik-2"" with a passive exoskeleton - a lever-hinged mechanical device, allowing to reduce the load on the musculoskeletal system of the fighter. At the ""Army-2018"" forum, the Central Research Institute of Precision Engineering presented a sample of the exoskeleton, which is put on in a minute and removed in 20 seconds. However, the supply of ""Ratnik-2"" will be limited. The Ministry of Defense and specialists of the Central Scientific Research Institute of Precision Engineering are planning to re-equip the army with the equipment of the third generation Ratnik-3. The first will receive it Airborne troops. Deliveries to them can begin in 2025. The active exoskeleton repeats the human biomechanics and takes into account its anatomical features. According to the designers, on the tests of this exoskeleton the fighter was able to fire from a machine gun, holding it in one hand. An active exoskeleton will help the soldier move faster and more effectively hit targets.

Also, it became known that the ""Kalibr"" ground-based missile system is going to be developed in a variant not only ship-based, but also land-based. The reason for this decision was the possible withdrawal of the States from the INF Treaty. The new long-range version of the Russian ""Kalibr"" missile is capable of hitting targets at a distance of 4.5 thousand kilometers.

It should be noted that on February 23, 2019, the experts of the American magazine The Popular Mechanics commented on the video of the tests of the unmanned submersible ""Poseidon"", previously published by the Russian Ministry of Defense. As the author of the article notes, thanks to ""deep diving and high speed"" the Russian ""torpedo of the apocalypse"" will be extremely difficult to intercept and almost impossible to stop. The drone is designed to attack coastal targets, such as a submarine base, a port, or a coastal city. In his opinion, this Russian weapon is designed to retaliate in the event of a nuclear attack.  
 

It should be recalled that the first time on the development of ""Poseidon"" Russian President Vladimir Putin said in March last year. He said that these unmanned underwater vehicles will be able to cover intercontinental distances at a speed that is a multiple of the speed of all types of modern submarines. Such weapons can be equipped not only with conventional but also with nuclear ammunition. This will allow ""Poseidon"" to hit a wide range of targets, including aircraft carrier groups, coastal fortifications and infrastructure. Moreover, on Wednesday, February 20, in a message to the Federal Assembly, V. Putin announced that the first nuclear submarine, the carrier of the unmanned complex, would be launched into the spring of 2019.",energy

personalfinance,wanting to purchase a home without 20% down,"I currently own a home but it’s too small for what I want and the area is not very safe. There’s new construction I want to purchase within a really good school district. I’m hoping to rent my current home within several months of moving out.  I should be able to rent out my current home for at least the current mortgage cost. I don’t want to sell it because I think the value of this home will continue to increase.

Cost of mortgage: 350K

Down payment: 20K

Household income: 190K

Lender 1: will pay closing cost up to 5.5K, interest rate of 4.6% (not locked), PMI of $160/month

Lender 2: No PMI, interest rate of 4.875% (not locked)

The reason I only want to put 20K down is because I want to save a lot of money for my unborn child and for emergencies. I want to take 16 weeks off once he’s born and at least one month will be 100% unpaid. I stupidly sank about 60K into my student loans a few months back to pay it off but in hindsight, my interest rate there was only 3.2%. I should have held off longer and saved it for the down payment but there’s no point in crying over it now that it’s done. 

I’m tempted to go with lender 1 since it will save me 5.5K at the beginning. I can always pay off the PMI faster if I put more money in later and reassess the house value once the entire community is done being built.  I also plan on refinancing for a better interest rate regardless of which lender I pick. Is there something else I should be considering? Am I doing the right thing?",finance

My assignment is to create a magazine ad for a product or service that has a strong USP (unique selling point). After many hours of trying to come up with something that might be fun to make an ad for that meets that criteria, I'm stumped. I was hoping you guys might have some products in mind that have a truly unique selling point. I'm trying to stay away from the mainstream ones like Dominos, Avis, FedEx, M&amp;M's, etc; preferably something that maybe isn't so well known that has some sort of unique feature to it. Or maybe something that *is* well known but you don't see much advertising for.

Also, if you think there is a more appropriate subreddit on which I can post this, please let me know. I thought this would be the best place as it has to do with marketing. Thank you! :)",finance
personalfinance,How quick is too quick to pay of your student loans?,"So I just graduated from school this past May and started working in January. I'm an engineer and the job I have pays well and I'm happy because that makes paying off loans easier. But currently I'm putting nearly all of my money (after expenses, emergency fund, and some investing) towards paying off my debt, to the point where my savings rate is 0% every month. 

&amp;#x200B;

Psychologically, I want the satisfaction of getting this debt monkey off of my back. I've done the math and at the rate that I'm paying if off, I should be debt free by around July 2020. This is great. However, I've been told that if the interest rates of your loans are relatively low (avg is 4.24%, max is 4.66%) then it would be worth your time to extend your payment period so you don't lose the opportunity to invest. My argument is that because of monthly loan payments, you're not able to put as much toward investments (or other financial tools) as you would otherwise. So there's a tradeoff. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, is there a best way to pay off student loans to maximize your financial growth in the long run?",finance

economy,Why Turkish economy is collapsing...,"It looks pretty interesting subject in the first glance.

Actually it's not just Turkey. It's all the international banking and credit system.

Turkish banks loan great amount of credit from foreign investors.

If Turkish economy collapse, I can assure you that big American and European banks will collapse either.

That is why they won't let Turkish economy to collapse.

The problem is systematic expanding of FED's monetary policy around the world.

Many countries accumulated great about of debt in terms of US dollars.

Low interest rates in US dollars encourage many banking cooperations to prefer credit in US dollars.

The problem starts with FED interest rates hikes. 

As the interest rates increases in the terms of US dollars, credit risk of many banking cooperations around world is increasing.

To understand the scale of problem we must look at the CDS points of countries and banks.",finance
personalfinance,Thinking about converting 457 and 401a to an IRA to use for grad school instead of relying solely on loans. Is this a terrible idea?,"Currently in a physician assistant program that will be done in about two years. The program costs about 100K. Fortunately the GI Bill covered about 15k of it, but I still owe the rest. I can only take out a max of $20,500 per year of the fed unsubsidized loans, everything after that will be at the higher interest (~7.6%) grad plus loans. I have a little over $50k split between a 457 and 401a account. I spoke with them a while back and they told me I could move it to an IRA, then use it for education without paying any early withdrawal fees. I'm trying to avoid racking up too much debt, and I'd like to avoid the Grad plus loans if possible. Is this a terrible idea?",finance
personalfinance,Raise my credit sore in order to refinance student loan?,"New account because I don't feel super comfortable putting all this out there...

I'm currently undergoing a rapid series of life events and I find myself in a position where I feel like I desperately need to lower my monthly student loan payments.

I just got married + got a raise within the past 2 weeks. We currently live with a roommate who has just decided to move out for May. Finding a new place is not an option right now, we are going to keep the apartment we are in, but our rent will go up nearly $400 for each of us. This is pretty much all of my raise. As it was, my loan and credit card payments make it very difficult for me to save money and I live pretty much paycheck to paycheck. My spouse does not have any significant debt but he makes considerably less than I do.

My credit score is mostly affected by my two credit cards that are nearly maxed out (as I said prior to the raise, I have been really struggling so it was near impossible to make a dent in my credit card debt.) I don't have delinquencies and have consistently made timely payments.

I pay around $200 total for both my cards (I make payments that are over the minimum), and my total student loan payments are around $870 each month. The most problematic loan is a private one, payments for that one are $481 a month with a variable (yuck) interest rate of 9.25. However, my credit score of 618 is too low for me to even qualify for refinance. 

I'm considering doing something that I'm weary of mostly because I hate the idea of dealing with yet another loan, but I looked at getting a loan with Upstart to pay off credit card debt. My total credit card debt is \~$5000. Both my cards APR is \~23% and there is a possibility that this new loan has a lower APR. But I don't even want to apply for it to find out if this is ill-advised.

My hope is to raise my credit score, hopefully keep making around the same credit card payments $200 a month and be able to refinance my largest private student loan with the highest interest rate. Ultimately what I really want is to have a little breathing room to build up some savings since both my husband and I will need to really budget and we live paycheck to paycheck. Does this make sense? Is it a terrible idea? I may just be freaking out because of all the sudden changes and I need some outside opinions...

Please help, I need guidance!",finance

Well now I have a chunk of change and I am not sure what to do with it. I haven't really touched any of it and I've had it a few months. I know its dumb to let it sit in my savings with 0.01% interest though. So.. do I put it into CD's? Money Markets Accounts? I don't mind not being able to touch it for a year or so if it guarantees a good interest rate. what's the quickest way to turn it into more? I'm especially interested in investing in things that pay back monthly or weekly, (Ex. purchasing a trailer, and letting a company use it to pick up and drop off loads, and they give me a flat rate weekly).

I own a vanguard index fund that has a 5 year return average is 15%.

I'm trying to decide if i pay down my student loan or keep shooting money into my index fund... I know forecasting the future is probably foolish but I see political action on student loan debt - multiple big front runners are talking about lowering those interest rates and forgiving loans. I don't expect this t magically erase my student loans but I feel like maybe right now is a good time to focus on the index fund building since that interest rate is solid and higher than even the high 6.8% loan....",finance

personalfinance,Pay off student loans versus refinance,"Hello - I'm struggling with determining whether or not to pay off my student loans in full right now or to refinance them and pay a decent amount off. I have the money to pay them off, but doing so would drain roughly 40% of my savings. 

I'm currently a homeowner, but have recently gotten engaged and plan on purchasing a bigger home in a few years as we grow our family. My fear is that lump sum of money used to pay off the student loans could be used towards the down payment, closing costs, etc. But I also realize that the debt could essentially hurt me from a loan perspective. And concurrently, I'd be virtually spending relatively close to the same amount of money spread out over more years as interest continues to accrue if I don't pay down the loans.  So I think I have my mind made up on to pay them, but then I keep thinking about, ""well what if the right house pops up in the market place and I want to buy it tomorrow and don't have the funds now"".

I got approved by a new lender to refinance my loans by consolidating at a rate of 4.55%. Below are my current outstanding loans and their respected interest rates. 

I'd appreciate any perspective you could offer. Thanks in advance.

   Principal Balance  Interest Rate   

Loan 1  $ 7,017.33  5.96%   

Loan 2  $ 3,725.29  3.15%  

 Loan 3  $ 1,694.63  6.55%   

Loan 4  $ 3,690.92  3.15%

personalfinance,New college grad with no credit history but need auto loan,"Hello, sorry for the formatting as I am writing this on mobile. 

I'm about to graduate college in a month and a half, and I have a 72k/yr job lined up. I need a car to be able to drive to work and will need to take out an auto loan to pay for it. I plan on getting a certified used car rather than a new one. My family is not so great with finances, but I've been lurking on this sub and have learned a lot so I'm turning to you guys for advice. 

I have no credit history, so I'm worried about being able to get an auto loan after graduating. My dad wants us to go to our credit union and apply for a loan with him as a consignor. I don't know exactly where he stands financially, but I know he is in a lot of debt (still paying off student loans) and he is unemployed. Could him cosigning with me hurt my credit in any way? 

Another option I've been looking at is taking advantage of new grad programs that a lot of major car dealers seem to offer for college graduates in my situation. But my dad doesn't trust auto dealers. He said a common tactic they will do is that  they will check your credit history multiple times to lower your credit score, and then give you a high interest rate. I showed him this post from yesterday:

https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/b2rwmo/went_to_car_dealership_ended_up_with_4_hard_hits/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

He said the hard hits only merge into a single inquiry if the credit checks were done by the same loan company, not if it was checked by multiple different loan companies. Is this true? If I went to ""shop around"" for the lowest interest rate on an auto loan from different dealers and our credit union, would those multiple credit hits still merge as one? 

Sorry for the long post, I just feel as if I have a lot of gaps in my knowledge and I'm trying to figure things out before I graduate. Thanks for the help!",finance

personalfinance,Repaying my 401(k) loan - Should I let it default? Please help,"Hi guys, I am hoping to get some information here as my employer is having a difficult time explaining this to me.

I have been working with my current company for 13 years, and just turned in my two weeks notice. I will be moving from Ohio to South Carolina for another job opportunity, and am in the process of tying up my loose ends.

Two years ago, I took out a small loan from my 401(k) in order to get some repairs done to my car, new tires, etc. I now have a remaining balance of $1,550 on my loan (I have been paying it back through my employer, as they handle this through payroll).

My employer states that I have 90 days from my last day (April 1st) to pay off the loan in full. They said that if I do not pay off the remaining $1550 by that time, it will be defaulted, and I will receive a 1099R tax form next year, and it will have to be claimed as income, as well as a 10% fee for early withdraw (as I am not 59 1/2). There is 4% interest rate on my loan.

Since I am making a big move across several states, I currently do not have an extra $1550. Here is my question:

What is the worst that can happen if I let it get defaulted and claim it on next year's taxes? Should I not let it default?

Can someone provide me some type of insight as to what I will be dealing with please? I'm looking to see if letting it default will royally screw me, or just be a minor inconvenience of having to claim $1550, plus the 4% interest rate and the 10% fee as income next year.

All input is appreciated, and I will try to address any questions to the best of my knowledge.

Thanks so much!

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I am taking the new job because it provides better compensation. Two years ago, I could not afford to repair my car and get new tires without this loan. I am in a much better spot now. I am trying to better myself and get everything wrapped up. However, all of my extra savings are going to be used for my move. Ultimately, I will have the money soon, just not within the 90 day time-frame.",finance

personalfinance,My bank account number is different depending on which website I am using to make payments; anyone else experience this?,"The bank (credit union) I'm using is SEFCU (state employees federal credit union). I have a checkings and savings account. I am trying link my SEFCU account to my newly created Ally account. 

A year or so ago I linked my SEFCU checking account to my student loan website, Myfedloan. I've been making payments to this website with no issues. A few weeks ago I tried to link the same SEFCU account to PayPal and Ally, both times it said the account number was wrong; I used the same numbers as with Myfedloan.

Quick backstory on SEFCU: For whatever reason they make it really hard to find your account numbers. They give you a ""member number"" on your statements. I emailed once asking for my account number and they responded with something like ""your account number is 12345xxxxx0, replace the x's with your member number.""

Anyways, last night I really wanted to link my Ally account to get that nice 2.2% interest rate so I was really looking around to find my real account number. I stumbled upon a part of the website where I could order personal checks and before I went further they wanted to verify my account numbers which they displayed on the screen. The account number they showed was the same as I had except they switched the last digit to something else. 

For the hell of it I tried this number on Ally's and PayPals website and it worked; today I can see the tested transactions on my SEFCU account which were initiated from the external accounts. However I am still able to use the SAME account with a different account number for my payments to myfedloan. 

I'm so confused. Has this happened to anyone else before?",finance
personalfinance,Advice needed on mortgage refinancing,"My wife and I bought our house about a year and 5 months ago, although we did not have a lot of money to put down on the mortgage, we secured a loan that had a reasonable monthly payment for us, and a relatively good interest rate.  Last week, our mortgage servicer (Quicken Loans) cold called us to offer us a refinance mortgage.  I'm skeptical of sales pitches, and although I consider myself to be relatively financially literate, I'm confused as to whether I should be thinking about replacing our current mortgage with a new one so early after buying the home.  I'm hoping that the collective wisdom of Reddit can help me navigate this.

First, information about our current mortgage.  Under our current 30 year mortgage (taken on in 2017), we have an interest rate of 4.375%, and a principal balance of $241,000.  Our monthly payment is $1235 in principal and interest, plus $128 of escrow, and $190 of PMI for a total of $1553/month.  There are For PMI purposes, the home was appraised at $255,000 at the time of sale.  There are 97 months of PMI remaining, set to drop off in July of 2027.

Quicken is proposing 2 different refinance options, the second option because I requested them to make us an offer that has the same interest rate as our current loan.  They are summarized in the table below:

||Loan 1|Loan 2|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Initial principal balance|$245,000|$246,000|
|Loan term|27 years|27 years|
|Interest rate|4.5%|4.375%|
|Home value (no appraisal necessary)|$275,000|$275,000|
|Closing costs|$7231|$9861|
|Cash to close|$0|$1521 (paying points to reduce interest rate)|
|Total monthly payment|$1406 (1241 P&amp;I + 37 PMI + 128 escrow)|$1460 (1295 P&amp;I + 37 PMI + 128 escrow)|
|Remaining months of PMI|70 (ends April, 2025)|70 (ends April, 2025)|

The Quicken banker is arguing that the reduction in PMI payment would be the most beneficial part of this refinance.  I am skeptical of taking out a loan that has a marginally higher interest rate, so I'm trying to figure out if this is worth it.

So I put this question to you guys: is it worth refinancing this mortgage?  The red flags for me are how early it is in our existing mortgage to consider refinancing, the interest rate, and whether I will be paying more over the course of the lifetime of the loan.  I know Quicken wouldn't be offering this to me unless they were getting something out of it as well, so I want to make sure it makes sense for me.",finance

Is there any way I don't know of that could allow me to take out a private loan to pay the bill off, which would allow me to enroll and get access to school grants and loans which I could then use to repay the private loan?

&amp;#x200B;

Is there any organization that may be able to help me figure things out with my finances so I can make sure I'm making a good plan to be able to support myself, my child and finish out my degree?

personalfinance,Married tax bracket question when spouses have a large income difference,"I made roughly 90k/year. My spouse makes about 25k. Her exemptions and my exemptions are set up identically. Her work only figures her income in when determining how much to deduct from her paycheck so she paid only about 900 in fed. tax. I paid about 10,000 because my income is much higher. While in the process of filing using taxact, with my W2 we get a few thousand back. When I enter hers, all the sudden we owe a bunch of money. I assume because her income is combined with mine at a higher tax rate, but her work doesn't take that into account when deducting?

A: how can she set up her w4 to avoid this?

B: how should I file so we don't have to pay a bunch?",finance

Currently I have about 11k saved up, no credit card debt. Current FICO score is sitting at 771. I do have a car loan for 20k and a loan for 25k that equate to about $1000 per month.My girlfriend of 1.5 years who is currently living with me would be moving in as well so she would be able to help with some of the monthly costs associated with the house.

I'm trying to figure out where to start. I've been reading about first time home buyer programs, both federal and state. However their terms and requirements are confusing. I'd like to try and figure out how much I could borrow for my mortgage and how much my estimated payment for said mortgage would be.  The calculators all seem to indicate that I'd need to put down 20% which in this area is about 50K. Am I out of luck? Do I need to keep saving?

financialindependence,Retirement Savings and Withdrawal Waterfall,"Hi All - on path to FIRE in \~10 yrs time. Want to understand the inflow/outflows of retirement savings / withdrawals. Please provide comments / critique. Thanks.

EDIT: no idea how to edit this s\*\*\* to make it legible. sorry.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&amp;#x200B;

**Retirement Savings and Withdrawal Waterfall**

Key Assumptions:

A. You are looking for a simple flowchart to get you started

B. The govt tax rate brackets do not change over time

C. When you retire, you make less money than before and therefore, in a lower tax bracket

D. You have paid down your high interest rate debt obligations (i.e., credit card interest rates)

  o What’s “high”? If a risk-adjusted investment return is not higher than the interest rate, then paydown the debt

E. Your savings rate is relatively high and you have excess cash available 

F. You are likely a W-2 receiving employee

**Retirement Account Savings Waterfall**

I. Contribute to 401K up to employer matching amount / rate %

a. Tax advantage of this employee benefit

II. Max contribution to Roth IRA

a. If limited, backdoor to Roth IRA

i. Contribute after-tax to Traditional IRA and execute conversion to Roth IRA 

1. Contribution limited to $6,000 (2019 tax year)

III. If leftover, contribute more to 401K

a. Contributions are pre-tax and thus tax-deferred (good)

b. Some employers offer matching contributions (even better)

IV. Contribute to Taxable Investment and/or Savings Accounts

a. Investments of your choice (equity, fixed income, HY savings, etc.)

V. Look for opportunities to further fund Roth IRA 

a. Megaback door (with after-tax contributions)

i. Requires administrator/employer to allow for:

1. After-tax contributions

2. In-service withdrawals or non-hardship withdrawals

b. Termination

i. Rollover after-tax portion of 401K to Roth IRA

1. Pay tax on conversion

**Retirement Account Distributions Waterfall**

Congratulations, you’ve retired. 

I. Start moving money from 401K and Traditional IRA to your Roth IRA using the Roth Ladder

a. Contribute \~1 years spending into the Roth IRA 

i. Let those contributions “season” for 5 years in the account

ii. Contributions count as taxable income, so pay tax (low rate)

II. Withdraw from Taxable Investment and/or Savings Accounts 

a. Pay tax upon sale of securities/investments

i. Short-term cap gains rate (low tax bracket)

ii. Long-term cap gains rate (low tax bracket)

b. Hopefully this lasted you until 59.5 years old

i. If not, hardship withdraw and pay tax income or 10% tax penalty early withdrawal

III. Withdraw from 401K after 59.5 years old

a. Pay tax on withdrawing funds

i. Likely all long-term cap gains rate (low tax bracket)

IV. Withdraw from Roth IRA

a. Meet 59.5+ years old and five-year holding period test

b. Withdrawals are tax-free",finance

how much, didn’t know where, just set it and forget it.

 



Fast forward to now. I am 32 and making it a prime focus to ensure
I don’t end up a Walmart greeter 33 years in the future. After lurking, I now understand
hidden fees and making uninformed choices can _really_ eat into your hard work / potential earnings and was trying

me.

**Roth IRA** - $33,000 in Vanguard Target

re-tool them now before my 401k begins to grow at a much quicker pace. I’ve
read some not so nice things about American Funds and fees, but unless I am
missing something, I believe the expenses for this fund are .42%, which seems serviceable?
Perhaps because it is a class R fund?

* Other Comments:
   * I'm looking into refinancing my student loans.
   * Since I only have $345.00 worth of expenses my first two months working, I will use part of that money to buy some work approiate clothing. Therefore I have lowered my clothing budget to $30.00.
   * just to reiterate a again, my company is paying for most of my expenses my first two months on the job. As of right now, I plan on putting the remainder of that money into saving. Any other suggestions?

lastly, Thank you guys! :)

**Edit**: A lot of commenter's have mentioned that I've budgeted too little in the food category, I upped the category by $50.00. I'm a fairly small women, I doubt I need to spend any more than $250.00 a month on food. Thanks again!",finance
Bitcoin,Too Good To Be True? Novogratz-Backed Startup Offering 6.2% Interest Rate On Crypto Deposits,,cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Does it make sense to refinance my car in this scenario?,"I financed my car at 2.99% for 65 months. 
Total financed amount= 57,800+250(gap insurance)=58,050

5 months and 5 payments of $969 later(with minor extra payments), payoff is just over 53K.

I have a refinance offer of 2.50% for 84 months. 
Total financed amount=54,000 (including $470 gap insurance)
Min payment: $~700 a month.

I would've gone for it straight away due to lower interest rate, but the extra cost of gap insurance (250 + 470) has me wondering if it's worth it. 

I don't care about the monthly payments - I intend to pay over $1000 a month either way. 
Do you think refinancing with this offer is a good idea?",finance

Would it be better to take out an interest repayment plan, a fixed repayment plan, or a deferred repayment plan? The deferred repayment would allow me not to make payments while still in school, but post-school payments would be more expensive. 

Should I focus more on interest rates than other factors? The interest repayment options seems like it is the cheapest overall/lowest interest. How does that all work?

**Work**

* 28 year old with a BS and hopefully soon an MS 
* $60,000/yr plus ~$12-15k in fringe benefits (company car, gas allowance, cell/internet coverage, travel perks). 
* I put 9% into my 401k (company matches 60% of 7% and the system automatically bumps your contribution by 1% every year and I don't fight that). 
* Annual 3% COL raise. 
* $220 per month for insurance but $25 is my premium and $150 goes into my HSA

**Monthly Income**

*  $1640, semimonthly
* $1750, monthly (2% annual increase) --Guaranteed income
* I have a side hustle that brings in $400-2500 per month depending on the season (I don't include this in the totals)

&gt;*I'm a realist who leans to the pessimistic side so I am not including my SO's income in any of these calculations.*

**Monthly Costs**

* Rent = $1850 (live in Seattle so cheaper housing isn't really an option)
* All other bills = $1800 (all inclusive and over estimated)

**Debts**

* Roughly $40,000 in student loans when it's all said and done (on deferment now but mostly unsubsidized with an average 5% interest rate) -- Should I be paying into these? 
* $8200 in personal loans (car as collateral, 4.15% interest rate, paying monthly)
* $15,000 personal loan from family (so 0% interest) 

**Settlement**

* $200,000 in 2020 then $250,000 in 2025 then $320,000 in 2030 (taxes were prepaid when the settlement was set up so these are lump sum amounts).
 

**About Me**

* I'm never having children so I don't need to factor that into my plans.
*  I would like to purchase a house with land with some of the settlement (I work in agriculture and want to have a small homestead so I can provide my own food).  

What's my next step? How do I plan? Am I doing something I shouldn't or not doing something I should?

btc,Should members of Bitcoin Unlimited be expelled when they no longer follow the Bitcoin Unlimited articles of federation?,"In the recent drama around Mengerians decision resign from Bitcoin Unlimited, citing a problem with association with members that support the lawsuit against the open-source contributors he consideres his friend, I find myself asking the question: Is this the right path to take?

In an effort to think about this I decided to re-read the articles of federation to evaluate what actions are suitable for a member of Bitcoin Unlimited. Among the statements in the federation I've found many things relating to this and thought I'd go over them here and voice my initial thoughts on the matter:

&gt; The guiding principle for Bitcoin Unlimited is that the evolution
of the network is decided by the code people freely choose to
run.

Mengerian citing the reasons for why he is leaving BU shows that he is following this guiding principle - the network should be guided by people freely choosing what code to run - not by state coercion and out of fear for state violence.

Any user supporting the lawsuit then, automatically does not follow this principle, which makes me question their suitability as a member.

&gt; From the Bitcoin white paper, ""nodes accept the block only if
all transactions in it are valid and not already spent."" A block cannot be invalid because of its size.

In the same manner as the articles stating that a blocks size does not invalidate the block, the order of the transactions within it shouldn't matter either. However, the checksums applied by ABC goes against this, so any member siding with those checksums does not abide to this principle.

From the hashwars perspective, any BSV associate should now, if they believe in bitcoin as described in the articles, have come back to bitcoin cash as that is the longest proof-of-work chain - even if they refuse to run bitcoin ABC.

&gt; Any software can join the Bitcoin network because it is a
permissionless decentralized ledger. If adding code that allows
users to easily change the behavior of their node puts the entire
network at risk, than the network is at risk today. But we reject
this idea. Instead we believe that the free market and dynamic
network will eliminate bad actors [...]

If an associate of BSV would argue that bitcoin cash can no longer be seen as the real bitcoin because there are actors running Bitcoin ABC on it, then they violate both the principle that users choose what software they want to run, and the principle above stating that the free market should reject incompatible or broken implementations, not us as members of Bitcoin Unlimited.

----

Most importantly though, every member of the Bitcoin Unlimited organization has agreed to act according to their best interpretation of the principles above:

&gt; I, the undersigned, substantially agree with the Bitcoin
Unlimited Vision as defined in Article 1 and agree to
work towards the success of Bitcoin as defined by Article
1. I agree to follow the rules outlined in Articles 2,3, and
4 for all matters pertaining to Bitcoin Unlimited. I
further recognize that becoming a member of the Bitcoin
Unlimited Federation and simultaneously working to
undermine the Bitcoin Unlimited Vision will inflict
substantial harm on the other members of the Bitcoin
Unlimited Confederation, including but not limited to,
loss of Member's time quantified by the average hourly
wage of a principal engineer in the USA, loss of member
monetary donations, and loss of opportunity.

---

So that begs the question: Should members of Bitcoin Unlimited be expelled when they no longer follow the Bitcoin Unlimited articles of federation?",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,My University sent me an email saying that I owe $5000 in two months. Advice?,"So this is my first time actually creating a post but here is the long and short. Back in 2011 -2012 I took out federal loans from the University, they awarded me money to go to school and it was business as usual. Later on in the summer of 2012 as I was told that they awarded me too much money and now I have to pay $5000 to the university. I personally thought that was wild and I asked was further explanation and they said something about a computer error. So I was in a rock in a hard space. My family didn't have $5000 and I sure didn't so they made a directly university loan and made me sign a promissory note that I had to pay in the future which is two months from now. I paid to be able to continue my education but from that point they never emailed or sent any letters about this until now. I'll admit I should've kept better track of things but also I feel that there shouldve have been better communication on their end as well. Even credit card companies send monthly statements. Even a letter a year ago wouldve have helped me gather up the money. Its been almost 6/7 years. Anyways  id appreciate any advice or guidance. I accept responsibility for this I just don't want them to shaft me further somehow.",finance
personalfinance,"Refinance? home addition? HELOC? Help us brainstorm, please!","Jumping right in, husband and I owe 187,000 on our home mortgage (4.6% interest rate, 6 years in to a 30 yr fixed rate). Our home value has risen a LOT since we bought the home, and currently our estimate on Zillow is around 460k and does not reflect updates we have done ourselves to the house, so I estimate our house is worth a bit more than that based on area comps. We are exploring doing either a home addition (would probably cost about 100-150k) or refinancing to a 15 year fixed rate mortgage at 3.6% interest. What are our best courses of action here? Pay off the home faster as it is and do the addition later? Do the addition now with a HELOC? Do nothing? I’m interested in any brainstorming help or pointers as to who to speak with about this. 

Additional info - we have steady jobs with steady annual increase and our current mortgage monthly payment is 30% of monthly income. We plan on staying in this house for the long term.

personalfinance,"Stay at home father to high needs child, income/finance advice.","I am a 41 year old stay at home father to a son (K, 6yo) and daughter (C, 4yo). My son is significantly impaired by autism; and the side effects of a 3 year chemotherapy regimen, that ended almost 2 years ago.

K will require lifelong care. He is semi independent (at the 6 yo level), but needs help with toileting, bathing and eating, and cannot really communicate outside of those familiar with his speech. He also will have lifelong medical follow ups/side effects from the chemo, and must attend 3 hour evening sessions of ABA therapy 3+ days a week.

Wife agrees that my returning to the fulltime workforce is pretty much impossible. Her career pays very well (this is not an ""emergency! help me now!"" type of post) and she loves it and loves me being at home with the kids and handling the legwork of taking care of them. 

My concern is more long term. We are currently in the green by a somewhat slim margin. I am trying to keep down some expenses (and we already have an idea of what we can cut in case of dire straits), but as my neurotypical daughter gets older, her costs and needs will only go up, just yesterday she asked to start taking swim lessons. Then there is dental stuff, future school stuff, etc. etc.  Not to mention that no one really has an answer for my son long term (no society has ever really answered what you do with a person who can't work, and has the mind of a child, after their parents are gone.)

I am not even sure what I am asking, maybe forms of income (unlikely I know), or long term options for son? I apologize if rambling (or if this is the wrong sub) but I would like to hear if anyone else has experiences like this, and any advice they have to offer.

To clarify a few points: 

my son is about 2 yo mentally (and is not likely to improve much)

son has unplanned costs fairly often (he needs a new floor in his room due to urine accidents, he hurts himself occasionally, breaks objects, swallows/consumes things occasionally despite our best efforts)

My wife fully contributes to her retirement fund

My son receives medicare benefits for cancer and autism related needs 

We are well above the limit for Federal SSI benefits for a child

stocks,Ladybaybee picks for 2019-03-21,"[Link to imgur](https://imgur.com/a/CEeQ9T1)

**HOW I USE THIS:** 

1) All the stocks identified in the table are qualified as “BUY” opportunities.

2) I focus in the column “Success Rate(3m)” which shows the precision of the agents in the last 3 calendar months. I personally feel most comfortable with Rates 0.8 or higher. 

3) Then, I see the number in “Tx(3m)” which represents the number of transactions that the agents predicted for this stock in the last 3 months. I prefer stocks that have had at least two transactions during this period. 

4) Finally, I look at Growth(3m), if the agents have had a considerable growth (&gt;5% in 3 months) then I follow that trade. 

5) If a row in the table is colored green then it means that stock has been on the rise today so I purchase it immediately in order to ride the wave up. On the other hand, if the row is colored red, then I wait out until very close to market close to purchase the stock and let the price bottom out before climbing up again tomorrow.


6) After I purchase the stocks, I ALWAYS set a stop loss order at -2.5% from my buying price valid for the day. I think this is good hygiene, no matter how confident I am of my system, I still want to make sure that my losses are capped. I update this stop loss order every day. 

Many people have been curious about the actual process that the system follows, so here it is: for every symbol (600 stocks are analyzed daily), we get the full stock data (open,close,high,low,volume) for the past 4 months. Each stock is associated with another set of “lookalike” stocks as well as major ETF’s. This initial dataset is run through a convolutional layer that extracts an undisclosed number of features. These features are then passed onto a recurrent neural network (LSTM) where sequences and patterns are extracted. The LSTM then spits out probabilities for the likelihood that this stock will have a positive, negative and neutral tendency in the next N days. These probabilities are then fed to a genetic evolution system (GES). This system essentially checks the predictions for the past N days and compares them with reality, following that the systems knows which predictions are performing the best. Once the system knows which stocks are being simulated the best, then the system automatically finds which of these best performing stocks have the biggest potential for the next few days. The system does not output explanations, unfortunately us humans are not capable of understanding (or visualizing) a problem of this dimensionality, for example the LSTM part alone works with over 10 million dimensions, not features but dimensions.

personalfinance,Advice on a little bit of debt.,"Long time reader first time poster. 

I'm 32, married, with 766 credit, 47k in a 401k, and only 32k debt and a 54k/yr income between both of us.

First and for most I have a 27k mortgage that I am overpaying, I actually use my tax return to over pay it. So I never worry about it. What I'm worried about is 5k debt on a credit card. The interest seems high and am considering pulling 5k out of my 401k (distribution not loan) to pay for the credit card and eat the tax hit instead of the interest rate.

personalfinance,"I've taken on a 2nd job making an extra 12k a month (pre-tax). Questions about taxes, LLCs, personal credit improvement.","I am currently employed making 110,000k / yr. at my ""main"" full time job which takes care of all my main expenses but not too much else (I am the main income earner for a family so I pay all bills). I have also taken on a second contract position part-time in which I am getting 12k monthly, pre-taxed.

I am currently saving 30% of the 12k a mo. job in a savings account at Marcus for taxes next year. My boss has told me that I should establish a LLC so I could keep the majority of this income (I am U.S. based of course). I don't quite understand how this works fully and if this is completely true.

The money would go to this LLC business bank account monthly.... but I would pay myself? If this is correct, would I be filing taxes for myself as some sort of employee of this LLC, as well as filing taxes for this LLC separately? Also, if he is correct, is this the best course for me to take financially? It seems complicated to me but I would of course like to pay less than 20-30% to the IRS next year if possible.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, personally: My credit is horrible. I am looking to utilize this influx of money to help repair my credit and save for a down payment for a house in the future, and buy a new car.

My credit score is only 560. This is mainly because I only have the car loan with only 3 1/2 yrs credit history and 3 medical collections, but nothing else. My payment history on the car is only at round 88% on time due to a period of medical issues causing me to lose my job at the time. I plan on calling and asking if they can work with me to remove some of these late payments. I have also opened a secured Capital One card this week to have more credit history. The 3 remaining collections show as FCRA verified so I am assuming I cannot do anything about these or have them disputed at this point.

I owe about 8k on my car with a higher than normal interest rate, but it is having constant mechanical issues lately (only has 85k miles) and I am wondering if it is wise to pay this off with some of this extra income and start a new car loan to help improve credit history and amount of accounts? Or would that not help? I could keep repairing the car and drive it longer but I have a larger family now and it isn't really suited for that either.

I also have about 15k in savings currently (separate from the tax savings) and am adding about 5k a month to this.

&amp;#x200B;

I am really just looking for some insight or direction as to how to both handle this new money and my credit. I would really like to have a good chunk in savings, as well as respectable credit. Just looking for the best path to merge this.

personalfinance,To pay off student loans in full... or not to pay?,"I've tried to read up a lot on this topic, and I keep finding a divide, so I'm not really sure which way is the best way to approach the remaining student loans I have.

I owe about $10,700 on a combination of Stafford Loans, with varying interest rates from 3.4% to 6.8%.

One of the loans at 6.8% is almost completely paid off (only a few hundred dollars) while the the other is still around $2000.

The other 3 loans are 3%-4% interest.

I have enough money to pay these loans in full, and still have a very healthy amount of savings. More than 6 months emergency fund and then some. (I'll be starting on my investment journey later in the year). I thought my best move would be to become debt free. I have no CC debt.

But when I read online, a lot of sources say to only pay the loans that have a higher interest rate.

Am I better off just paying the two 6.8% loans off by themselves? Or should I pay them all off in one lump sum?

personalfinance,Path Out Of Subprime,"Hi everyone,

I have excellent news. A little less than 2 years ago I was in the 400s credit score. I followed everyones suggestions on reddit. Today my Fico score sits at 709 and Vantage I believe maybe at 670 or maybe higher. 

I basically have no inquiries in my name, no negative accounts, no collections and a credit utilization Im hoping to bring down from 25% to under 9% (due to some adversity in the family but nothing I cant fix).

Anyway, I used low tier credit cards and secured credit card to do this. However, Im tired of the bad interest rates, atrocious monthly fees, annual fees, and completely bad customer service from these low tier CC companies.  I want out! 

What is my pathway out of low tier and into higher tier cards like AE, Discover, etc.? Im trying to avoid a tank in my score. Im also trying to determine if now is the time to move up or to wait another year. What can I expect? Can I burn these low tier cards? Should I keep any? How do I know that I won’t get rejected? I want to get approved because it would be painful to see an inquiry on my report from a rejected CC company.

I've been looking into getting a Honda Civic because my current car is a 2007 Civic, and I was very happy with it.

I see on the Honda website I can get a new 2019 Honda Civic LX for $20,250 with 0.9-1.9% APR financing.

https://automobiles.honda.com/tools/build-and-price-result?modelid=FC2E6KEW&amp;modelseries=civic-sedan&amp;modelyear=2019&amp;extcolorcode=NH-731P#build-price

Yet if I want to get a used 2018 Honda Civic LX, it costs $19,998 + 4.5-6.5% APR. 

https://www.carmax.com/car/17139199

It looks like I actually pay **more** if I get the used 2018 as opposed to the new 2019 because of the higher interest rate, and even if the interest rates were the same it looks like the new one is only $250 more total.

Now if I want to get a used one with like 20-30k miles on it I can the used price down to like $18k, but they still quote a higher interest rate. And again, even if the interest rate was the same, is it $2k savings really worth the used status, a year older model, and +20k miles?

2018 Earnings: $127,004 Total Income

Total Federal Tax: $32,806

Total State Tax: $5,998

Max SEP Contribution: $23,806 (this would reduce my total tax liability by $5,713.44)

Cash Savings: $31,018

Investment Accounts: $51,532

Current SEP Balance: $10,600

&amp;#x200B;

My business has grown tremendously and I now have several employees, making it so that I can't make a SEP contribution this year, so 2018 is my last year to do so. I'm trying to figure out whether its in my interest to sell off investments (Wealthfront) in order to max out my SEP contribution this year.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm interested in rolling my SEP IRA into a Roth IRA this year, as I am now salaried and should make less money this year than in year's prior, as I'm investing income in growing the business vs paying myself. I'm thinking I should make the largest SEP contribution possible, and then rollover my SEP IRA into a ROTH this year and convert that to a self directed in order to start making real estate plays with the self directed IRA. 

&amp;#x200B;

I anticipate that this year will be one of the lowest earning years in the next 15-20, so it seems like the right time to be making some of these moves.

computers,Dell Tech Support Hell,"First off, Dell designs great machines. They just can't fix them. 

I run a Dell Inspiron 7577 with a decent processor and awesome graphics card.

7 months into my ownership of the device, it starts thermal throttling. I'm talking CPU temp at 60 degrees Celsius at idle, and spikes to 100 degrees Celsius under load. That's not good.

Naturally, I do everything within my power to fix it. I get a cooling pad (only helps idle temp, but under load it still spikes to 100)

I updated the bios, cleaned the fans, disabled in game overlays, messed around with Nvidia control panel, lowered the maximum processor state, undervolted my CPU, did a complete rollback and reinstall of my graphics drivers, and did a factory reset on the computer. Nothing helped.

I contacted Costco (got it from them) to request a replacement under warranty. I suspected it was a hardware problem and I was only familiar with software.

They said they'd transfer me to Dell. I thought... Oh no. Read tech support reviews from them and you'll know why.

I get transferred to a man and this is how it goes.

He asks to remotely control my computer and I let him. He immediately goes to Dell's website and starts looking for a BIOS update. I said: ""OH, I already updated the BIOS.""

He then proceeds to tell me that he'll handle it, and it'll work. He puts in a model number, and the wrong computer pops up.

Me: that's the wrong computer model. 

Him: I'll handle it sir, thank you.

He proceeds to download a BIOS update for the wrong computer. He runs it, and an error message pops up, informing him that it is the wrong BIOS for the computer. HE THEN TRIES TO RUN IT 4 MORE TIMES. He even opens the command prompt and tries to force it to run.

Me: it's the wrong computer. I have an Inspiron 7577, not a two-in-one.

Him: OK...

He goes back to Dell's website and clicks ""detect my pc"". After 45 minutes of this show he downloads the right driver, only to be informed that my BIOS is already up to date.

At this point I'm starting to lose my patience. This man is completely incompetent but he doesn't know it.

Then he informs me he's done all he can do and I'm going to have to send my system in for repairs. I'm like: SERIOUSLY?? YOU DID ONE THING. 

My name is Tanner. Some time later, I get an email addressed to ""Panner"" explaining that they have received my system and will begin repairs on it right away.

I face-palm.

It is now on its way back, and knowing them, they probably did a standard tune up, ran a surface level stress test, and ""fixed"" the problem. I expect to receive my computer back with the exact same problem, and then maybe I'll finally get my replacement.

I can't believe you can have such incompetent people in charge of tech support.

I'll post updates as they come.

UPDATE:

I'm pissed. Reviewed the tracking info for my laptop, and was informed that it was being sent back to sender after arriving in my city. I called FedEx and asked why, they said the specified address didn't exist and the sender provided no contact info to contact me and verify the address.

I called Dell, livid. To clarify, I'm a college student, and since I sent my laptop away I've been forced to do my homework on my phone. Imagine writing a 5 page essay with your thumbs.

Anyways, I demanded to know what happened, and why they hadn't provided fedex with my info so they could contact me. Turns out the incompetent tech support agent I talked to earlier not only got my name wrong, but my entire address.

They said they'd send it back to me as soon as it reached them.

I am pissed.

personalfinance,Surprise Medical Bill-Should I Sign Assignment of Benefits Form?,"Hello,

I looked up threads relating to this but did not see the Out of Network Assignment of Benefits Form referenced. Both the provider seeking payment and my insurance company want me to fill this out regarding a surprise bill, and I am not sure whether it will financially make me liable in anyway, or make it easier for them to bill me. 

I live in New York which has protective laws regarding surprise medical bills. Last year I had a minor ambulatory surgery performed, I made sure it was covered by my insurance and that the ambulatory facility was staffed with providers who all accepted my insurance. The day of the surgery everything proceeded normally. I received paperwork from my insurance showing that I did not owe anything outside of the facility fee and respective copays. 

Months later I received a notice from the anesthesiologist stating 

""Balance Due: $1,600
Attached you will find an Assignment of Benefits Form. We feel your insurance company is obligated to pay substantially more on this claim based on the NYS Surprise Bill law that went into effect for services 3/31/15 and later. Please mail this form to your insurance company.""

The Assignment of Benefits form states the below:
""I (or my dependent) received a surprise bill from a health care provider.  I want the provider to seek payment for this bill from my insurance company (this is an “assignment”).  I want my health insurer to pay the provider for any health care services I or my dependent received that are covered under my health insurance.  With my assignment, the provider cannot seek payment from me, except for any copayment, coinsurance or deductible that would be owed if I or my dependent used a participating provider.  If my insurer paid me for the services, I agree to send the payment to the provider. ""

When I contacted my insurance company, they asked that I fill out the same form. Since the out of network provider wants to be paid more, and I know my insurance company wants to pay nothing at all, the fact that they both want me to sign this leads me to believe I will somehow be forced to pick up the slack. I no longer have this insurance, though my remaining out of pocket maximum when covered is approximately equal to the amount they are seeking. 

Does anyone have experience with this and can advise? Should I avoid filling this out? I am conflicted as the letter quoted above from the provider was not an actual bill, just a statement that they believe they are due this. I received a voicemail from the physicians office semi-threatening the doctor ""may decide to bill me"" if I do not fill this form out. I know I am blessed this amount is not exorbitant, though it would be a financial hardship to me as I am a student. 

Thank you in advance for anyone that relays advice or personal experience. 

TL:DR Is it in my best interest to sign an Assignment of Benefits form in relation to surprise medical bills?",finance

personalfinance,Car buying question/help needed,"Hello, I don’t post very often so I hope this isn’t breaking any rules but I wanted to get some advice on this financial decision and see if my reasoning is correct.


Currently I have a 2017 Tacoma that’s running 600 a month. 49 payments left till paid off. Remaining balance is 29k. Sitting around 18k miles. This is very doable in my budget if not a bit high. The basis was that my dad wanted me to have an amazing brand new car that I could keep likely into my 30s. And that he was going to help me pay a portion of it. The problem is that he really hasn’t. In fact I’ve actually had to loan them money for an IRS tax audit. I’m in school for a second bachelors at the moment/full scholarship. So I don’t have many bills. Utilities and rent run me 550 total. I make about 2400 a month working while in school. And I have 6k in my savings. 707 credit score with very little history.  I think that covers where I’m at.


I’d like to lower my payments a bit. So the question is I’ve been offered to refinance through USAA at 4.5ish %, 72 month term. This would bring the payments to about 461.  And a dealer was offering a mustang I really like (2017 GT) to trade into at 4.9%, 84 month term making the payments 440 per month and a 30 dollar increase per month to my insurance. My current loan for the Tacoma is 3.99% with my dad as a co-signer. The refinance and the mustang are both without co-signers because I would like to keep anyone from having to sign with me. My question is if I was picking between the two, which option is best? I think it’s to refinance, but if it is, should I even be considering it? I feel like the Tacoma is going to have much more value in 5 years when it’s paid off than a mustang will and I could get my dream car down the road when I’ve graduated instead. Does an extra .5% interest rate for another two years of payments equate to the $140 dollars a month I’d save by refinancing?

I’d appreciate any insight you guys had but I’m new to financially planning and like to see how my thought process stacks up.",finance

My wife and I have a fairly normal tax return--a W2 for her, a W2 for me, and not a ton more than that. We had our taxes done last year and we received a decent refund--mostly on the federal and some from the state (NY). When we met with our accountant last year, my wife was pregnant and our accountant said that we'd likely get more of a refund this year because of our child--something to the tune of around $2k more. So this year rolls around and our federal refund is less than half of what last year's was, and we actually owe money to the state. I can tell you, I always claim 0 and can't remember the last time I owed either the federal or state. And this situation is all including our child in our taxes (which may/should have increased our refund), and now we're netting less than half of last year's. I would hate to think what it would be if my child wasn't  included. Also, I \*think\* we may have taken the standard deduction this year because I want to say they raised the amount which made itemizing less beneficial for us (I could be wrong on that...).

&amp;#x200B;

I asked my accountant about it and he said the tax withholding tables were adjusted throughout the year to reflect the new tax law, and that's the reason for such a decrease in refund on the federal level and why we owe the state. I do believe him but is there anyone else in a similar boat, and is there anything more I can do to help this, even if for future tax returns? My accountant said I should consider adjusting my NYS withholdings, but again, I'm already at 0. Any suggestions or other comments are appreciated.

To get to it I have hit a point that is the culmination of poor decisions, bad luck, more bad luck, and crap planning. I'll give a list of my debts and monthly payments, plus my average income per week (Technicians do not have guaranteed checks, each week is different.)  I earn take home roughly $1000 a week, some weeks are better, some not.  I try to assume $300 a week for food, gas, maybe one night having 2-3 drinks.

I've talked to my credit union, since I have nothing for collateral and my credit score is pretty tanked from credit limits and income to debt ratio they're no help. I have pretty much figured all loan offers for consolidation are not actually helpful, or my credit score means I'd be worse off lumping all of it together at some ridiculous interest rate.  I work Mon-Fri 8-6 and usually Sat 8-2 to make extra hours. I can't really take a 2nd job, my car doesn't qualify for Uber/Lyft (2014 Veloster 3 door) I do not have any relatives etc. I'm pretty surprised my GF still hangs around since I can almost never take her out or go do things. I know the usual advice is to just buckle down and chip away at it, but one bad week or bad luck...such as:

A month ago my clutch finally went out, I did the work myself but it was still $500, then a few weeks ago a wisdom tooth shattered that was $234 with Dental Insurance. 

I pretty much assume I'll never own a home, so I guess at this point if I get in a bind and have to choose who gets paid and doesn't it'll be Rent and Car first, I'm not sure exactly what the CC companies can do other than put me in collections and trash my already crap credit rating.  I mean just the CC's are $600 a month. 

Not sure what I'll get from this post, as from reading other post it's usually cut cost, get an extra job, etc. My current plan is to go after the highest payment lowest balance bills one at a time, though I may be retirement age (I have no retirement so when I die.) once I get there. Basically how bad could it be if I just stopped paying the credit cards and let them roll to collections other than my credit being tanked for 7-10 years?

personalfinance,Paying for college,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently a sophomore in college and thankfully only have 12,000 in debt so far.  In the past my dad was willing to pay whatever my federal loan didn't cover. This is becoming too much of a financial burden for him so I'm willing to take the entire college cost on a loan. I don't know what the best way is to go about this. Should i take my federal loan and discover loan the rest? My dad has great credit and he is willing to cosign for me. I go to a state school and live at home, it's roughly 11k a year. Fafsa is only going to cover 7,500, which is why i don't know what to do. I do work part time, and paying the remaining amount out of pocket is an option, but then i would be really strapped for cash. I would have to consider getting a second job and then my academics might suffer. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also thinking of taking summer classes at my local community college because im behind in my degree. My summer classes would not be able to be covered with financial aid and my dad is not willing to pay. It's roughly going to be 2k for the classes. I was just thinking of asking for more money on my discover loan, but then i realized that the money goes straight to the school. 

&amp;#x200B;

My parents are telling me just to ""figure it out when the time comes"" but this is my life we're talking about. I'm a very organized and scheduled person, so not knowing is making it more complicated.",finance
Bitcoin,Well that didn't take long. BlockFi already hedging on their 6.2 APY rates.,"From their recent [blog posting](https://blockfi.com/blockfi-news/creating-products-for-the-everyday-crypto-investor/?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=mar20email&amp;utm_term=firstparagraph):

&gt;Starting April 1st, only BIA balances of up to and including 25 BTC or 500 ETH (equivalent to roughly $100,000 and $70,000 respectively) will earn the 6.2% APY interest rate. All balances over that limit will earn a tiered rate of 2% interest. To clarify, if you had 25.5 BTC in your BIA account, the first 25 BTC would earn interest at 6.2% APY and the remaining 0.5 BTC will earn interest at 2%. Additionally, on April 5th, we will be adding a flat withdrawal fee of 0.0025 BTC and 0.0015 ETH.

investing,How did you react to Wednesday’s FOMC statement?,"To date I’ve only been a passive investor; this is my first time trying to react to news. I had been planning to spend $10,000 on an I-Bond, but in response to this week’s news I decided to buy a 1-year CD at 2.7%. Here’s my thinking:

* The yield curve is flattening, which makes long-term treasuries not a good idea.
* The Fed is concerned about an economic slowdown, perhaps even deflation.
* They are predicting to raise rates next year. I-Bonds would be tied up for at least 5 years, but 1-year CDs are available at rates above recent inflation.

Was my thinking reasonable? Should I have put the money into the corporate bond market instead? I’m already at max risk capacity for stocks, but wanted more return than the 2.0% I was getting in my money market.",finance

personalfinance,W2 in my name for money I didn't make was filed by my employer AND I already filed my taxes.,"I wasn't sure how to title this but its a mess and I have no idea what to do. 

Long and short of it, I work for a family business owned by my father and I have my own. 

Mine is doing quite well, my fathers not so much, and its in the same field. 

For the last few years he wasn't able to pay me regularly, BUT he cut the checks as if I was, and I had to pay the tax on money I didn't make.  Since 2013 this had added up to about 50k in taxes I payed I didn't actually get paid on.   Most of which in the last two years.  Being I felt some of those years I was overpaid I was willing to suck it up anyways.  

Now my father isn't trying to take advantage of me, but hes a really shitty business man who is good at what he does but bad at money.  He's always been that way.  So its my dad, I want to help him.  In 2016 I told him only cut a check when I'm getting actually paid.  He messed that one up a few times.  Then in 2017 I said just stop paying me all together.  I worked since December 2017 for free.  He was always promising to make up for the screw ups in 2017 (cost me a boatload) and I know he meant it but 2018 wasn't any better than 2017.

So I get a call from his *yesterday* about my W2 and working things out, this is bad, it means he screwed up again.  

Oh and I already filed my taxes, just to make things fun. 

So I stop by his business tonight  to pick up this W2 and I was paid 71k for 2018.  I never saw any of it.  It has 12k in Fed withholdings, which covers just less than half my my real tax burden on it is, basically I'd owe about 16k more. 


Oh shit.... 

I called my father and basically said WTF, he thought he paid me something in 2018 (he's quite old) and I told him no, those were 2017 checks that I couldn't even cash due to age of the check.  So he suggested I file an amended return and I blew my stack a bit and told him thats still going to be paying more and even if he covers my taxes I was suppose to get a 27k refund this year and this could bump up my tax bracket etc etc. 

So he said he would call his accountant tomorrow.

Now again just so people get it, he's not trying to screw me, its not his character, he's just kinda dumb with money and I was too trusting of him doing what I said to do.  He's always sure it will get better.  

But what the hell do I do now?  I basically under reported my income by 71k.  I don't want to screw my father unless thats the  *only* option but I really can't take this hit right now.",finance

Wapner: Were you surprised by Fed’s dovish double-down on Wednesday?


Gundlach: I think you have to be. I predicted they would go from two hikes this year to 0.5, and everyone told me there was no way they would downgrade it that far. But they went even further!
And what the heck is that “1 hike in 2020” thing about? It seems almost desperate.

Fed has gone from “we got this” to “we’ll get back to you”. Not reassuring.


Wapner: Do you still think we’re in a bear market or has the Fed’s pivot (and double-down) changed the game?


Gundlach – Yes to bear market. 
**In 2007 the Fed went from “biased to tighten” to an “emergency ease” in just a few weeks. The S&amp;P celebrated with a push to essentially a double top over the ensuing several weeks.**
This pivot from December’s hawkishness seems metaphorical to that period.
Fed says oil down is part of their motivation. Oil is up substantially from the December meeting.
Why won’t they give a reason for this that is at least factually correct?
Say Trump demanded it. Say you are worried about Europe, or China, or the yield curve, or retail sales, or GDP now.
But stop with the gaslighting.",finance
personalfinance,A little direction please,"Hello all!  I am currently an accounting/finance student and am having some trouble finding reliable source material on how annuities work.  I have an assignment where I am to create a schedule for a ""clients"" retirement planning, how much he should invest, how much he will have saved at retirement, and how long after retirement his funds will last.  In my case we are told which funds he's already contributing to, we just have to determine the best amount, that part was easy!

 I am now trying to figure out what next. The information I can find on monthly income from annuities is measly at best ($500 a month is not a livable amount). I cannot find any information on being able to set a monthly income, or interest rates. The information I do find which have interest rates don't have information on monthly payments and seem to act as another form of savings.

What I would like to know is: can a person transfer all their savings to annuities and specify a desired income? And where would one find this information because I need source material too. Also this case pertains to the US, which makes my searches somewhat confusing as I'm in Canada and keep getting a mix from the both countries in my queries.

personalfinance,Question about mortgage company contacting me to refinance.,"I just bought my first house at the end of December so I'm new to dealing with mortgages, etc.

I got a call yesterday from the lender and they said they ""have good news for me."" Then they explained that their company was bought out and changed hands at the first of the year. They said the way the new company deals with student loans on the application is different and so I could refinance (they actually kind of made it sound like I had too but I don't think they can force it). They said this would make my payment lower, reduce my mortgage insurance, and get rid of my second loan (used a first time homebuyer program to cover closing costs etc. resulting in a $10,000 second mortgage). But they never once mentioned interest rate, life of the loan, or total cost over the life of the loan, so I'm a little skeptical. I will obviously see all of this information before I make a decision to refinance but I was just wondering if this is maybe a common thing and they are trying to get more money out of me. They mentioned a couple times that this would not cost me anything, but having been in sales before I know that sometimes means it doesn't cost anything out of pocket but I could end up paying more in the long run. I'm assuming there has to be some costs associated with refinancing.

Just curious if anyone has any thoughts on the subject,

Thanks

financialindependence,Four Year Update,"Edit:  Hit character limit - see comment below for rest of the post!

I've been posting my family's net worth updates annually for the past few years (see [2015](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/308xtv/on_track_to_re_by_50/), [2016](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/4a6oww/one_year_update/), [2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/5ynkqi/two_year_update/), and [2018](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/838e92/three_year_update/) updates); I find sharing my plans and progress to be helpful for giving myself a heading check, and hope this community finds my inputs to be helpful. I realized recently that we're way past Coast FIRE, so at this point, we're just pulling our financial independence date to the left.

**Current ages: 33 and 32**. We have two kids and have been paying about \~$15k per year in childcare; fortunately, the older one is about to enter preschool, so we're seeing the light at the end of the tunnel and expect that cost to start coming down soon. We reduce those costs somewhat using a dependent care FSA and by going fairly deep down the [churning](https://www.reddit.com/r/churning/) rabbit hole, since our daycare takes credit cards.

**Combined pre-tax income**: About $185k (\~6.3% increase). I'm a civil servant who works as an electrical engineer and team lead; my wife is a Senior Manager for a regional accounting firm. That kind of combined pay for those kinds of positions probably sound a bit low to a lot of you who live in big metros. It's not - we live in a LCOL area in the Deep South and make like 4x the median household income for our area. We established a rough goal of \~$200k household income by 2020 - and it looks like we're pretty much on track!

**Assets:**

Cash/emergency fund: \~$40k (20% decrease). This went down a bit, because we finished the home renovation (described in detail under ""Home"" below). We've actually beefed up our emergency fund a bit compared to where it was before the home renovation started, to account for inflation and increased assets and risks overall.

Tax advantaged Retirement/HSA accounts: \~$430k (17% increase). Not a great year really; we put in &gt;$50k into tax advantaged accounts this year, but the total balance didn't grow much more than that. I thought we'd end up in a negative return (not counting new contributions) due to how the markets were performing late last year, but they've recovered since then to make us a bit positive.

529 accounts: \~$32k (28% increase). We're contributing about $3k/year for each of our children - our plan is to cover \~75% of the total cost of a public university in our state, including housing and food. When I did my original projections when they were born, I thought we would have to ramp this up quite a bit over time - but tuition at public universities in our state has barely budged since then! Will keep an eye on this and bump up contributions if necessary, but maybe college costs are finally turning the corner after decades of unsustainable growth.

Taxable investments: \~$12k (insignificant ). No new contributions here and the overall market barely moved. We're close to maxing out tax advantaged accounts, so eventually we'll have good cause to start investing more here. For now it's just kinda a third tier of emergency savings beyond the cash stockpile, but eventually this will help with easy access funds if we decide to stop working really early.

Vehicles: $36.5k KBB value of three cars (74% increase). We had been holding out on waiting for the EV market to mature...but then GM had to go and discontinue the Chevy Volt, right as the $7500 tax credit for GM was expiring, which led to dealers slashing prices and us finding new Volts listed at under $30k, \*before\* the tax credit. So we traded in the extra beater car and got a Volt, which is now my wife's daily commuter. I think I'm keeping the Miata forever y'all.

Home: Using MSA home index, our home value is now \~$522k (6.1% increase), using Zillow estimate is currently $585k (12.9% increase). . My wife's sister has lived with us and paid rent for the past decade, but now that we have a couple little munchkins running around, we wanted to give her a more peaceful/private space from the craziness, and give each of our kids their own rooms. So, we took out a $50k home equity loan (shown below), and converted a 1000 square foot detached garage/workshop into an apartment for my sister-in-law. It's given our home way more flexibility; definitely worth every penny we put into it. The work was legally permitted and the extra bedroom and bathroom now show up in Zillow and the County Property Appraiser.",finance
personalfinance,When to add bonds to portfolio,"Hi PF,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm seeking more insight into when would be a good time to start allocating my portfolio into bonds, specifically VBTIX in a Vanguard mutual fund. Since the market has been on a tear since the beginning of the year, would it be beneficial to add some soon as a hedge in case of a downturn? 

&amp;#x200B;

Also with the announcement of no rate hikes by the federal reserve, does that positively or negatively affect bonds? The 10 years have been at a recent low and I'm not sure how that correlates with the bond market.

personalfinance,"Getting 3k for my tax return, better to use as a down payment on a new car or pay off credit card debt?","Seems like a dumb question. My APR for my credit card is 25.49%, the car loan is about 6% for my pre-qualifying. Cars I'm looking at are around 15k. My monthly income after taxes is $4400. After expenses, (rent for $1500, school loans $400, and slowly chipping away at my credit card debt that I let get up to $8000 without even realizing it at about $500/mo) leaves me at about $1800 of disposable income. Keep in mind that is flexible if I want to put less into my debts, though if anything I am currently doing the opposite. 

It seems like a no brainer to me, put the money towards the credit card, the APR rate is higher so I want to get that lower first. Not only that, it could lower my credit score (730) and potentially lower my APR for my auto loan. 

Issue is, if I do that I won't have anything to put towards the car. I can easily do a monthly payment of around ~$500 and have it paid off in under 3 years. 

The math makes sense to me. It'd be logical to put this towards the loan that has the higher interest rate versus the one that doesn't. But something about buying a car with no money down just seems irresponsible to me, even if the math makes sense. Is there something here I am missing?",finance

With the announcement that the fed will most likely not be increasing interest rates for 2019. I don't see my savings account interest rate going up any time soon.

Now seems like the time to lock that money into a slightly higher interest rate.

With the no-penalty CD the only downsides seem to be the seven day lockout period where you cannot withdraw the funds and the fact that to access the funds you would have to close out the whole CD.

It seems like I can mostly get around this by opening three separate CD's each for $2,5xx. If I also wanted to make sure I have cash outside during the 7 day lockout period I could open them 7 days apart. But I'm more worried about not having to cash out the entire account if I needed to access it. Opening three separate CD's means I would only have to cash out one month of emergency funds out of the CD's at a time.

solar,"Who is really getting the Fed Tax Credit, installer or customer?","Hi, I've gotten 6 quotes for an install of a roughly 7 kW system. Total equipment varies but call it $12k including (permits and 10% premium). I think i have a pretty good line of sight into what these cost are.  Avg install price is $10k for what bidders unanimously state will be 1-2 days with 3 people. Taking the federal tax credit out of the install cost brings it to roughly $4k which seems much more reasonable to cover labor/profit/overhead. So it seems the FTC is really just going to installers. Does anyone else think this or am I missing some major pieces?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: In Denver, Colorado. For clarity, understood that the FTC comes back to consumer in the form of a tax rebate, but seems to me the install cost are inflated by roughly the amount the consumer would get back in tax credits.  Per comments, $12k is probably too high for materials. Using typical wholesale cost of $0.35/W for panels and $6k for inverter(s), disconnects, and misc hardware and $500 for permits and $500 for taxes, plus 10% is about $10.5k.",energy

personalfinance,Wanting to leave 403b and moving the money to Vanguard while still employed.,"Good afternoon everyone and thank you for taking out my post. I hope this answers some of my daunting questions and how about others in the process.

I work for a K12 School district in New Jersey. Ive had an account with a firm (AXA equitable) for my 403b for the last 7 years and I've been more aggressive contributing within the last year. After not seeing any growth and the high fees that come with these companies that are maintaining my 403B, I want to stop contributing to them and move them to something like a vanguard so that the money can grow with lower fees and expense ratios. In the last several years, I have not seen any growth and the value of my account is basically what I contributed. It is so frustrating that I can simply play the same amount of money in a high-yield savings account and be better off.

I have also recently learned from doing my taxes is that New Jersey is one of the few states that requires you to pay taxes on the contributions that were made to the 403B. So even though it is tax deferred at a federal level, we are still forced to pay taxes on that amount of money to the state. Realizing this got me very frustrated and I want to do something to make my money worthwhile.

I know that a traditional rollover is not possible as I am still employed by the district. What are my options if I want to move my money to a different investment option? If I were to withdraw the money, then I will be taxed and have penalty charges. at this point, I'm willing to pay any penalties or fees to get my money out of that 403b to place it in something that would generate money with lower fees. I would rather take the hit right now and place it into something that's going to generate more money than to let it sit getting hit constantly with high fees and still having to pay taxes on contributions.

Does anybody have any advice regarding this? Has anybody experienced something similar to this? There isn't much information on the web when it comes to the situation. I constantly read up on individuals that terminated their employment and then rolling it over but I want to transfer my money that I contributed and my future contributions to another company like vanguard.

I know this is a long rant and I do apologize. I hope someone can give me some guidance shed light to the topic.

stocks,Ladybaybee recommended stock picks 2019-03-22,"[Link to imgur with the picks and updated current investment ledger](https://imgur.com/a/QmwP4lg)

**HOW I USE THIS:** 

1) All the stocks identified in the table are qualified as “BUY” opportunities.

2) I focus in the column “Success Rate(3m)” which shows the precision of the agents in the last 3 calendar months. I personally feel most comfortable with Rates 0.8 or higher. 

3) Then, I see the number in “Tx(3m)” which represents the number of transactions that the agents predicted for this stock in the last 3 months. I prefer stocks that have had at least two transactions during this period. 

4) Finally, I look at Growth(3m), if the agents have had a considerable growth (&gt;5% in 3 months) then I follow that trade. 

5) If a row in the table is colored green then it means that stock has been on the rise today so I purchase it immediately in order to ride the wave up. On the other hand, if the row is colored red, then I wait out until very close to market close to purchase the stock and let the price bottom out before climbing up again tomorrow.


6) After I purchase the stocks, I ALWAYS set a stop loss order at -2.5% from my buying price valid for the day. I think this is good hygiene, no matter how confident I am of my system, I still want to make sure that my losses are capped. I update this stop loss order every day. 


**BACKGROUND**

I am not a financier or economist. I am electrical engineer with equal passion in artificial intelligence and financial markets. For the past 2 years I have been working on a system that would make short term predictions of stocks. The system is rather complex, I use multiple layers which include: Convolutional Neural Networks, LSTMs and Genetic Algorithms. All bulked together produce an output like in this image. The way to interpret the image is a follows: Symbol and Date columns are self explanatory, Quorum refers to autonomous agents that decide whether to BUY/NOT BUY or SELL/HOLD a stock. Each symbol has 9 agents, and the Quorum column, counts the number of agents that recommend Buy, Selling or Holding the stock. The “Not Owned” column means: if you don’t own this stock then you should … The “Owned” column means: if you own this stock you should HOLD or SELL. The column “Growth(1 Year)” refers to what what has been the growth of this system of Agents in the past calendar year. The column “Tx(1Yr)” shows the number of full transactions that these agents recommended in the last calendar year. “Factor” is just the division of Growth divided by Transactions to get the average growth per transaction. Finally “Success Rate” shows how successful these agents have been in their recommendations in the past calendar year, success 1 means 100% successful, 0.5 means 50% successful, and so on.

Many people have been curious about the actual process that the system follows, so here it is: for every symbol (600 stocks are analyzed daily), we get the full stock data (open,close,high,low,volume) for the past 4 months. Each stock is associated with another set of “lookalike” stocks as well as major ETF’s. This initial dataset is run through a convolutional layer that extracts an undisclosed number of features. These features are then passed onto a recurrent neural network (LSTM) where sequences and patterns are extracted. The LSTM then spits out probabilities for the likelihood that this stock will have a positive, negative and neutral tendency in the next N days. These probabilities are then fed to a genetic evolution system (GES). This system essentially checks the predictions for the past N days and compares them with reality, following that the systems knows which predictions are performing the best. Once the system knows which stocks are being simulated the best, then the system automatically finds which of these best performing stocks have the biggest potential for the next few days. The system does not output explanations, unfortunately us humans are not capable of understanding (or visualizing) a problem of this dimensionality, for example the LSTM part alone works with over 10 million dimensions, not features but dimensions.

I believe we're in a sticky situation. I believe the only things holding us up are our CONSUMERISM and our EMPLOYMENT. Everything else related to government: budget spending and deficit is rigged for the ship to blow ONCE it starts sinking. 

So the real question is: What is going to cause people to start spending less and what would cause people to get laid off? What are the catalysts? 

Tariffs. I think Trump played with tariffs at probably the worst time in history. If cost of goods increase, people will buy less and companies will be affected causing layoffs and encouraging retention of cash. 
Interest rates: If interest rates rise, investments go down, debts get magnified and may lead to unemployment numbers. 

After all this, GDP will be affected. Government will be in a tailspin due to their debts, etc etc. 

To reduce the real adverse effects: Government should be paying down debt, but we cannot risk raising rates because it is a catalyst that leads to our doom. So, only solution? We have to cut spending. 

I believe we are seeing the ""play it safe investors"" moving to bonds today causing the inverted yield curve. 

Thoughts? Add to catalysts, correct my theory, say what you will. Contribute. Is our situation right now different from other freak-outs that we had before? Has something changed?

You will notice a few things. First off, is the possibility that a short term inversion can happen and not spell any doom. There were very brief inversions that took place in September 1998, April 2000, and January 2006. In the case of 98 and 2006 there was considerable appreciation in stock afterwards. In 2000, April would have indeed timed the high well but there was a considerable distribution phase if you waited for more considerable yield inversion.

You will notice that a better signal is to wait and see a bit with the yield curve. Typically the recessionary signal will see an extended inversion that is deep and lasts for several months, then as the curve steepens again recession hits. Waiting as much as one month for full inversion will give you higher confidence in the signal. This gets you out in August 2000, and August 2006.

Corresponding with a move to bonds, waiting for a full month does seem to lose some appreciation in capital values, but you will still make out well with a bit of delay in transitioning to a risk-off strategy.

https://finviz.com/futures_charts.ashx?t=ES&amp;p=m1

So looking at the present day, we have the following factors:

Large transition into bonds as investors go risk-off for a Brexit that may not actually happen

Possible US-China trade deal as soon as April

Fed that has made a commitment to a more dovish transition the remainder of the year.

While all these factors may end up being too little too late to prevent an extended inversion and recession, I believe it is certainly prudent to give such scenario's a bit of time to play out. Any quick movement on a trade deal or Brexit news could quickly make this inversion look more like 1998 than 2000. I do think the Fed is a bit too little too late on the dovish turn, but we shall see. The tech bubble was ultimately kickstarted in 1998 when Greenspan lowered the FFR in response to flat yields. Today's Fed is not taking an accomodative stance to that degree.

The reasoning for recession with yield curves is a rather simple one, there's no term premium for bank lenders and this dries up lending markets. Think of it this way, if lending dries up for a few days it's not a huge deal. If lending dries up for a few months, that is what causes a lagging recessionary effect.

In any case, this is just to reinforce that you should not panic and give yourself time to rationally make adjustments to your portfolio, if any at all.

It's also important to note that I believe such a strategy did not work out well in 1990 to my knowledge. So depending on your timelines and risk dependence, certainly there is no guarantee that stocks see an extended decline you would benefit from avoiding. I believe the 1990 bear market was rather quick and shallow, just slightly worse than what happened from October - December 2018.",finance

personalfinance,Car Loan Advice for the WA D.C. Area,"I am in an interesting situation. I made a bold move. I decided to buy a brand new car on a road trip around the USA. Let's skip the whole ""it's fiscally stupid to buy a brand new car"" comments and focus on the problem at hand.

Below is my situation follow by questions:

**Car Financials:**

Put $2,500 down today to get the vehicle delivered to the DC area where I will be spending two weeks. Fully refundable. I can back out anytime before then.

Car Price: $45,700

Est. Amt Due: $48,453.55

\^This does not include the $3,250 tax credit which I benefit when I complete my taxes before next April 15, 2020.

* Standard Range Plus Rear-Wheel Drive Model.

**Timeline and Mission:**

\*Dual Mandate\* Vehicle will be delivered to the DC area within the next 14 days. In that timeline I have to both find a private buyer for my car and an auto loan.

Trading my 2010 Subaru Forester in excellent condition (WA State Plates) and the Kelly Blue Book quote they gave me is about $6,500. I believe I can get another grand or two on the open market if I can find a quick buyer fast enough.

I am a registered citizen of WA state (10.1% sales tax in Seattle); however, since I am buying this in Virginia I do benefit from the Virginia 4.3% sales tax. I will be swapping my WA plates onto this Tesla (yeah complicated situation, but the WA DOL said to report the vehicle sale to them so I avoid any liability, swap the plates, tell them, then I am kosher. Easier than I originally thought).

No debt on my Subaru. Clean title. Excellent condition. 92,000 miles.

**Credit Score:**

Credit Karma: 800 - Transunion and Equifax via Vantage Score 3.0

Discover Card: 803 via Transunion but it was 821 on Dec 2018 and Feb 2019.

BoA: 801  FICO® Score 8 based on TransUnion®  but it was 821 on 3/18, 6/18, 11/18, and 1/19.

Chase: 800  VantageScore® 3.0 on TransUnion date (highest it's been on that credit card).

Etc.

\--------------------------------------------------------------

**Financial Situation:**

I have the cash to buy this car outright in full. However, I do believe it may be wiser to seek an auto loan. Tesla doesn't lease this model.

I do have passive income of investment income of over $30k **a year** despite not having a job currently. I can prove to the banks that I have been getting paid month-to-month. It looks like regular income which they like). 

Tesla offers a minimum rate of 3.75%. They basically go to the big boys like Chase and Wells Fargo to get me a loan. The rate cannot dip below 3.75%, but the saleswoman said it can certainly go above that.

Forget that.

I believe with more score and financial situation I can get a loan as low as 2.5% interest rate (call me optimistic).

\-----------------------------------------------------------------

**My Questions:**

1. Would it be wiser to put $30k down and get an auto loan for the rest or pay fully in cash?
2. Will my credit score take a beating from going to multiple large banks and small credit unions to find an auto loan? (I'm hoping my shopping around for a car loan is the same as an auto loan:)
   1. For home buying - major credit bureaus structure their rating systems to account for multiple inquiries within the same one-month reporting period. While there may still be a dip in your score, grouping your credit pulls will help you minimize the damage.
3. I only bank and have credit cards with Chase, Citi, Discover, and Visa. Who do you recommend I go to in the D.C. area?
4. How do I cold approach small banks/credit unions who I have no relationship with?
5. What small banks and credit unions do you recommend in the D.C. area?
6. Based on my situation - do you think they will put a clause in that I cannot repay the auto loan immediately? I will be basically showing them that I have the money to buy the car outright, but prefer an auto loan. They will like that, but will also see that I can squash their potential profits immediately.
7. I have never gotten an auto loan before. Anything else you recommend?

personalfinance,"Aged 26 living at home, with $50k salary, $46k in college debt","Hello all,

As the title states, I still live at home and have a bunch of college debt (who doesn't).  I'm from Boston and would like to move out soon but might stay for a few more years.  Right now it's me and my 2 younger sisters (one is 13, one is 24) and my mom.  My mom has been renting for about 10 years now without a problem besides one: it's a 3 bedroom.  My 13 year old sister has been sharing a room with my mom her whole life (she has her own bed).  I'm not sure why my mom moved here if she knew my sister was going to eventually need a room but I'm assuming she thought she would have moved again by now.  I pay my mom $250 for rent and buy my own food.  Still on her car insurance.

I have $46k in federal loans (navient) and my monthly payment is $284 @ 4.750%.  I can assume that most people in this sub would advise paying more each month towards my loans to pay off sooner.  It's great advice but like most people my age I'd rather pay the minimum each month and pay them off in 30 years so that I can save or spend money on things I want.  I have a car right now (2008 Altima with 106k miles) and it's fully paid off as of last summer.  Last summer the A/C went and I had it looked at by the dealer who said it would be $2000 to fix so I had someone else fix it for about $500 but it only worked for a month.  I read a bunch online that these have bad transmissions and will most likely give out in a year or 2.

With summer coming up I would like to have A/C but it dawned on me that maybe I could get a new car.  My dream car is a WRX Limited and right now they're about $30k new.  People say they don't lose value so you're better off buying new.  I'm not 100% sure how much costs are annually but I can imagine insurance is rather high.  I'd like to put down around $5000 for down payment.  I've calculated my monthly expenses and income:

\- $2,960 (after taxes)

\- $1,240 expenses

\- $1,720 leftover (after the food, rent, drugs, phone, gym, spotify, and hookers)

\- I have $11,000 in cash right now  


Before yelling at me for even considering getting a new car with college debt, stop.  I understand it's not ""wise"" but I'm wise enough to atleast come on here and get some feedback atleast right?  I'm sure others would just jump right in and make a massive mistake before adequately weighing their options.  I have a credit score of 680 and was thinking of getting a WRX because AWD (climate in Boston) and because I plan on having it for as long as possible.  Should I go with something cheaper or not even bother getting a new car? What other cars might I look at?  Or should I wait another year to save so that I can put a decent down payment?  What should I do with the $11,000 I have sitting in my account?

All advice is appreciated! Go Pats.

edit: I understand how I’m coming off as selfish and somewhat ungrateful.  I do plan on moving out so perhaps that should be my priority. I guess now I’ll need to figure out what to do with my $11k besides fix my a/c. I’ll look around on here for a plan to budget my loans. I need to determine what’s a healthy amount. thanks guys!",finance

personalfinance,Buying a 2016 CPO BMW. Bad decision at my age?,"Hello all,

Followed this subreddit for awhile. I'm looking for a brutal reason why, in my current situation, I shouldn't buy a CPO BMW, even after accepting all of the risks.

Disclaimer: 1st time prospective Euro car owner. I understand the risks, the unreliability of BMWs, the expensive maintenance, and depreciation problems with these cars. This is about buying a toy and whether or not it might fuck me. 

Specs:

 \- 27, m

 \- Live in a medium sized midwest city.

 \- Sr. IT/Systems Engineer, 9 years, coming up on 10 in the field. 

 \- $95k gross annual salary (about 55.2k take-home)

 \- I rent. $824 monthly, gas/trash/sewage included. Yes I am aware that I am earning no equity.

 \- FICO 696 - not a ton of total credit or credit history. 2 credit cards, 3k limit each. Only one has a revolving balance of about $1500 m2m. 

 \- No college loans, or loans of any kind. 

 \- Currently drive a 2004 Ford Ranger with 167k miles on it. It was broken into last week, ransacked and radio was stolen. $800 quote to fix, I don't want to put any more money into that rattletrap. 

 \- I don't drive much but when I do, I want to enjoy it. Looking for a toy, more or less. 

 \- I'm trying to push my credit score up, to plan on buying a house in the next 3-5 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

The long and short of it is, I want to try to more or less get a CPO luxury car financed for the price that one might buy a recent model used Civic for.

My friend at the dealership found me a 2016 BMW 328xi, less than 30k miles, more or less loaded that he'd get me into for $24k even, before taxes and fees (the lowest price I've found this make/model, mileage, features and a CPO). 

I plan on putting $10k in cash down, financing the taxes/fees/registration in. Total expected loan: 15.9k

&amp;#x200B;

My financing options are a bit grim. 

5.9% / 60 months

6.79% / 72 months

Trying a credit union next, ideally I'd like a 48 month term and pay the higher monthly to race the depreciation. 

&amp;#x200B;

If I can get a better interest rate on the loan for 48 months, given the information I've provided above, and knowing I'm looking for a toy I might drive only 5-6k miles a year or less, am I making an astronomically stupid decision? Even accepting/fully understanding what owning a Euro car entails?

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr roast me.

&amp;#x200B;

Any input would be greatly appreciated.

But I owe **more than $126k to FedLoans.**

My mistake is that I ignored the consequences of interest for years, and focused on making the minimum loan payments with the plan of getting them forgiven in my late 40s while on the PAYE repayment plan.

I have no credit card debt and have **$31k in an online savings account** that serves as both my emergency fund and savings pot for investments. I also have $20k invested in between my 401k and Roth IRA accounts. While my job looks good on a resume, I only take home about $3000 a month as a 30-year-old male living in Los Angeles. I also help my mom with money and help pay for her chemotherapy since she has brain cancer.

**Here is a snapshot of what I owe FedLoans:**

* Direct Sub Stafford Loan: $2,363 at 5.60% interest
* Direct Sub Stafford Loan: $2,363 at 5.60% interest 
* Direct Unsub Stafford Loan: $2,426 at 6.80% interest 
* Direct Sub Stafford Loan: $929 at 5.60% interest 
* Direct Sub Stafford Loan: $5,547 at 4.5% interest 
* Direct Unsub Stafford Loan: $2,263 at 6.8% interest 
* Direct Unsub Stafford Loan: $21,257 at 6.8% interest 
* Direct Student Plus Loan: $59,564 at 7.9% interest 

This amounts to a total balance of $126,292, and $29,575 of that is from interest.

From what I'm thinking, here are some of my options: 

* A. Immediately wipe out the smaller loans (everything but the last two in the list) with the money I've saved and still have some for emergency fund

* B. Keep making the minimum payment for years while using the money I have toward real estate investing or side hustles to boost my income, and keep it growing 

* C. Put my savings toward the larger loans

Graphics get better all the time but AI and world building seems to have been the same for about 10 years if not more.

As Ray Tracing is starting to prove graphics are into diminishing returns. They can make the graphics as perfect as they want but you are constantly reminded that you are playing a game in other areas. Ray Tracing is an impressive technological feat but it isn't exactly reinventing the wheel. Shadows didn't look particularly bad to start with.

But with non graphical aspects of games you are constantly dragged out of the immersion.

In Fallout 4 when you wake up from the Cryo chamber you walk through the vault and see the huge gun on the wall in the overseer's office and you character says something like ""I'll come back for you later.""..........why did they say that? At that moment in the game they had no idea that the world was dead. They saw a nuke go off and then they woke up in a confused state. They saw their baby taken and spouse shot but they didn't know there were Super Mutants walking around or that it had been 200 years since they entered the Vault. They wouldn't have automatically wanted to grab the huge gun off the wall.

I was playing Monster Hunter World recently and in the start when you see the dinosaur things from the previous games and the lady says ""Hey they are as docile here as they are back home."" or something to that effect. It just so happened that at this moment I was standing in the stream with one of these things walking towards me. I thought man it would be so cool if it stopped and curiously sniffed me at that moment. It was about level with my character's head and it would have been such a charming little detail.

personalfinance,Should I aggressively pay down my student loan debt or aggressively start investing in a few months when I finish building a 6 month expense safety net?,"Hi PF. A lot has changed for me in the last two years. I am past a Chapter 7 and an inability to budget, have secured a better job in the last few months and moved to a lower cost area than I was living in. I have a secured card with a small limit I am using to rebuild my credit score, so I am working on that for a long term goal. I also closely track my spending and follow a budget to make sure I am not succumbing to lifestyle creep. Before I had no savings. I think I am setting myself up for success compared to where I used to be, but I would like to get perspective on whether I should attack my student loan debt aggressively or not. 




Age: 24

Income: $60,000.00 yearly, plus overtime (around $200-1200 - wildly depends on the month -  and discretionary bonus TBD at the end of the year).

Monthly fixed expenses: around $1,600, including minimum payments on student loan debt, rent, utilities, cell phone, insurance, and an extra 100 for incidentals. 

Monthly take home: $3,340 after taxes and 401K contribution/insurance/STD/LTD/dental ins.

Emergency Fund: a little over $3K at the moment. I know this only works for 2 months of fixed expenses, and I'm trying to get it to 6 by the end of the year with any overtime I earn since I don't factor overtime money into my budget at all, plus the minimum contributions I have budgeted to my savings from my base take home. 

401K: $1,500. This is a brand new account I started with this job in the last few months. I contribute 5% pre tax - this figure includes overtime too. 3% is matched 100%, 4 and 5 percent are matched 50%. I also get small profit sharing contributions dumped in monthly as well that are fully vested after 5 years at this company. 
No credit card debt or other debt.




My only debt is $21,300 of federal student loans. They are comprised of four loans, all by the same servicer:

Loan 1: 
Current Balance
$2,050.44
Interest Rate
4.410%

Loan 2: 
Current Balance
$6,757.52
Interest Rate
3.610%

Loan 3: 
Current Balance
$5,178.57
Interest Rate
4.410%

Loan 4: 
Current Balance
$7,333.98
Interest Rate
4.040%


I think my income versus expenses column looks good. I am trying to figure out whether after I bump a few K more into an emergency fund whether I should start investing or aggressively pay down my student loan debt. Considering the interest rates and a potential rate of return from the target date fund I have my 401K in - assuming 6-8% return yearly, doesn't it technically make more sense to prioritize 401K contributions because I'm losing money long term if I dump that money into aggressively paying down my student loans? I currently pay the minimum on these loans monthly which is around $213 with my payment plan, and my estimated payoff date is early 2030 if I keep doing what I am doing, which honestly, is a little scary and freaks me out. 


Perhaps a balance between the two? What if I make an extra payment every month of my calculated figure of how much interest accrues monthly and leave it at that? Additionally, will aggressive payment on my student loans boost my credit score more quickly? My FICO 8 is 610, and I want to be in a position to put a down payment on a small, modest house in 10-12 years through my investment income/contributions. 


Would love your perspective. Thanks guys.",finance

# **Dow drops more than 450 points, S&amp;P 500 posts worst day since January amid global growth worries  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/22/stock-market-wall-street-in-focus-as-growth-concerns-persist.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks tumbled on Friday as global growth fears and the Federal Reserve's more cautious economic forecast sparked investor angst into the weekend.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank to its session lows heading into the close and finished down 460.19 points at 25,502.32. Bank stocks led the decline thanks to a sharp pullback in long-term Treasury yields. The S&amp;P 500 fell 1.9 percent to 2,800.71, its biggest one-day drop since Jan. 3. The Nasdaq Composite declined 2.5 percent to 7,642.67 as shares of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Alphabet and Apple all closed lower.
*****
&gt; ""There's a host of worries out there and those worries continue to mount,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities. ""The fear of recession is increasing.""
*****
&gt; ""As a result, we have a market that is rethinking some of the optimism that was priced in.""
*****
&gt; Sending bank stocks lower was an inversion of the so-called yield curve. The spread between the 3-month Treasury bill yield and the 10-year note rate turned negative for the first time since 2007, thus inverting the curve. An inverted yield curve occurs when short-term rates surpass their longer-term counterparts, putting a damper bank lending profits. An inverted curve is also considered a recession indicator.
*****
&gt; Citigroup fell more than 4 percent. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan Chase and Bank of America all declined at least 2.9 percent.
*****
&gt; Friday's moves come after Fed surprised investors by adopting a sharp dovish stance on Wednesday, projecting no further interest rate hikes this year and ending its balance sheet roll-off. Though investors often dislike higher borrowing costs and rate hikes, the motivation for the central bank's restraint rekindled worries of a GDP growth slowdown. The Fed justified its more temperate outlook by cutting its U.S. economic growth outlook for 2019.
*****
&gt; ""Maybe one should think about the global economy and not pin everything on the Fed,"" Jeffrey Gundlach, CEO of Doubleline Capital, told CNBC's Scott Wapner. ""Except the Fed should operate in consideration of global conditions too.""
*****
&gt; Friday saw more weak economic data from around the world that stoked those fears.
*****
&gt; IHS Markit said manufacturing activity in Germany dropped to its lowest level in more than six years in March. In France, manufacturing and services slowed down to their lowest levels in three months and two months, respectively. For the euro zone as a whole, manufacturing fell to its lowest level since April 2013. These data sent the German 10-year bund yield briefly into negative territory, its lowest level since 2016.
*****
&gt; ""The indicators are stacking up to suggest that this is not a 2021 phenomenon, that we could actually see the possibility of a recession starting maybe later this year,"" Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, told CNBC's ""Closing Bell.""
*****
&gt; Nike also weighed on the market throughout Friday's session. The athletic apparel company's stock fell 6.6 percent on the back of weak quarterly sales growth in North America. Boeing shares dropped 2.8 percent after Indonesian airline Garuda canceled a $6 billion order for 49 Boeing 737 Max jets.
*****
&gt; Despite the decline on Friday, stocks were still up sharply for the year. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq are up 11.7 percent and 15.2 percent, respectively. The Dow, meanwhile, has rallied 9.2 percent.
*****
&gt; ""Let's not lose sight of the fact that we've had a nice rally over the last couple of weeks,"" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. ""Today is not a great day, but after a strong week or two you tend to get a bit of a sell-off.""
*****
&gt; ""Now, should you be cautious? Absolutely, because the slowdown worldwide is something people need to be cautious about.""

# Watch Out For End of March/Q1 Weakness

&gt; March markets have been rather turbulent in recent years with weakness historically later in the month, taking some mean end-of-quarter hits as fund managers often partake in quarterly window dressing and portfolio restructuring. After the big gains we logged in January and February choppy market action is not surprising, especially with the backdrop of the ongoing China trade and Brexit deal delays and what appears to be the end of the Fed tightening cycle for now. Boeing’s woes and U.S. political infighting have not helped either.

&gt; But as you can see in the chart of the recent history of typical March trading patterns with 2019 performance overlaid in dotted lines, action so far this month has not been all that unusual. With that in mind we are ever leery of another end-of-March hit.

# April Almanac: DJIA’s Best Month

&gt; April marks the end of our “Best Six Months” for DJIA and the S&amp;P 500. On April 1st, we will begin looking for our seasonal MACD sell signal and corresponding early signs of seasonal weakness. Even in historically strong pre-election years the “Worst Six Months” have been lackluster on average. 

&gt; April 1999 was the first month to gain 1000 DJIA points. However, from 2000 to 2005, “Tax” month was hit, declining in four of six years. Since 2006, April has been up thirteen years in a row with an average gain of 2.3% to reclaim its position as the best DJIA month since 1950. April is third best for S&amp;P and fourth best for NASDAQ (since 1971).

&gt; The first half of April used to outperform the second half, but since 1994 that has no longer been the case. The effect of April 15 Tax Deadline appears to be diminished with numerous bullish days present on either side of the day. Traders and investors are clearly focused on first quarter earnings and guidance during April. Exceptional Q1 earnings and positive surprises tend to be anticipated with stocks and the market moving up in advance of the announcements and consolidating or correcting afterwards.

&gt; Typical pre-election year strength does bolster April’s performance since 1950. April is DJIA’s best month in pre-election years (+4.0%), second best for S&amp;P 500 (+3.5%) and third best for NASDAQ (+3.5%). Small caps measured by the Russell 2000 also perform well with gains (+2.8%) in seven of ten pre-election year April’s since 1979.

# Russell Falls Apart

&gt; While the rest of the market was rallying and holding up, the Russell has been struggling for close to a month now. After peaking above its 50-DMA back on 2/25, the Russell has had a hard time holding onto any gains lately. Earlier this week it made a lower high when the rest of the market was making higher highs, and to close out the week, it declined 3.6% for its worst day of 2019, making a lower low. Not a pretty chart at all.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/032219-Ruh-Roh.png))**

&gt; The Russell’s underperformance can really be seen in the ratio of the Nasdaq to the Russell 2000. This week, the ratio between the two really become unglued, topping 5 for the first time since February 2001.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/032219-Ratio-20-years.png))**

&gt; On a longer-term basis, the only time the Nasdaq has been outperforming the Russell 2000 by such a wide margin was during the period from November 1998 through February 2001. And if you think the ratio is extreme now, during that period it got as high as 8.64 on March 28, 2000. In order for the ratio to get to that sort of extreme now, the Nasdaq would need to top 13,000 (assuming the Russell remained at the same level).

# Yield Curve, Yield Curve, Yield Curve

&gt; If you are anything else besides the yield curve today, the market doesn’t care. After inverting for the first time since 2007 earlier today, the spread between the yields on the 10-year and 3-month US Treasuries has sucked up all the oxygen in the room as investors, traders, and their algos fret over the ominous economic signal that an inverted yield curve historically implies. Who cares whether the onset of a recession usually comes several months or even a couple of years after the curve first inverts; investors are using this as an excuse to take profits, and take profits is what they’re doing.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/032219-YCa.png))**

&gt; Just to illustrate how captivating the yield curve has been to the equity market, check out an intraday chart of S&amp;P 500 futures versus the yield curve since very early this morning. Moves in the yield curve are clearly leading equities. When the curve started flattening early this morning, equities started heading south with the pace of selling accelerating when the curve inverted. Then, as the curve made its intraday low right after noon, the low in equities followed less than 40 minutes later. It’s like the school playground, where the yield curve is the ‘cool kid’ and equities are the followers.

# Stocks Feeling Sensitive

&gt; Investors are wondering what the right number is for the market as stocks leg lower on bad global data to close the week. Without taking a view on what the “right” price for the S&amp;P 500 is, below we show a way to organize thinking about valuation in the short-term. In the table below we show a range of EPS growth rates relative to 2018 and a range of multiples on the resulting EPS numbers. The result is where the S&amp;P 500 should trade given hypothetical earnings and how those are valued. For example, if you estimate EPS will fall 2% in both 2019 and 2020, and you value those EPS at a multiple of 15.0x, the S&amp;P 500 is almost 700 points above where it should be! Alternatively, if you think EPS will be stable but should be valued at a relatively aggressive 19.0x, the S&amp;P 500 should be trading near 3100. In the grid below, we’ve highlighted ~2800 values (roughly where the S&amp;P 500 sits right now) to show the implicit EPS growth and multiple assumptions embedded in the price. Again, we don’t know the “right” combination of multiples and EPS growth, but if you’re extremely beared up with the Friday drop or think stocks are set to surge thanks to a dovish Fed, this analysis can help you see what sort of assumptions would need to play out for that to happen.

# The Fed on Reserve

&gt; The Federal Reserve (Fed) has doubled down on its patient stance. Policymakers signaled a complete pause in policy at the conclusion of the Fed’s March meeting, with a nod to a slowing pace of growth and global uncertainty.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, Fed voting members projected (via the latest “dot plot”) unchanged to slightly lower interest rates this year, with one more rate hike in 2020 or later to lift the long-term rate to 2.75%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DOT-Plot-Aligns-with-a-Federal-Reserve-U-Turn.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Policymakers also lowered their gross domestic product growth projections to 2.1% for 2019 and 1.9% for 2020, while Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged that global weakness could be a notable headwind to the U.S. economy.

&gt; Still, Powell conveyed significant faith in U.S. economic fundamentals, noting in his press conference that “it’s a great time to be patient,” as the labor market remains strong, confidence has improved back to encouraging levels, and the outlook remains positive.

&gt; “Powell and the Fed delivered a balanced message to U.S. investors, indicating that the lack of clarity warrants a patient stance,” said LPL Research Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “We side with the Fed here in thinking that underlying economic conditions remain solid, with evidence of a slowdown at the beginning of this year from near-term temporary headwinds.”

&gt; Powell hinted that interest rates are in the “broad range” of neutral, or the point where policy is neither accommodative nor restrictive to output. That doesn’t mean that rates have hit a short-term ceiling, though. We wouldn’t be surprised if stabilizing U.S. growth and higher inflation lead to a rate hike in the second half of 2019. The Fed’s current projections give few indications of that happening, likely because of policymakers’ hesitance to pass judgment on the U.S. economy amid mixed signals from data. Because of this, we expect the Fed to carefully communicate any change in stance to investors.

&gt; The Fed also announced it would start reducing the pace of its balance-sheet runoff in May, and end the runoff entirely in September. Powell reiterated that interest rate changes are the Fed’s primary policy tool, but a larger balance sheet could help buoy risk assets and capital investments.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week ahead?

*****

Have a fantastic weekend and a great final trading week of March and Q1 ahead to everyone here on r/stocks!",finance
personalfinance,"Bought expensive house, mortgages suck, next best step?","Back in the Spring/Summer of 2018 my wife and I discussed moving into a house even though we were comfortable in our apartment. I am military and don't get to live in places too long (2-3 years max). We have a dog and taking the dog out on the leash was getting annoying so we decided to look for a house that had a backyard so we could just let him outside to pee.

&amp;#x200B;

After doing minimal research and then going around town looking at some really terrible places that needed A LOT of fixing up, we finally came to a place where the current owner had done some work in the kitchen and made the house look presentable. We got hooked and decided to pull the trigger. The house had been listed at $435K, but hadn't sold so it got bumped down to $410k. We agreed that we could afford this with a VA loan since we wouldn't have to put any money down. Well, shenanigans ensued where the realtor was representing both parties, but they knew the seller better than us the ~~chumps~~ buyers and said that the seller wanted to roll some of the closing costs into our loan/selling price. ""Don't worry. You don't have to put any money down."" Except we were in the window where we had sunk money into the appraisal and inspections and we were first time home buyers, so we were like, ""Ok.""

&amp;#x200B;

So our loan became $418,815. We closed in November of 2018. The mortgage came out to $3014. Then the Army gave me orders for a new assignment in early February of 2019. I am at my new assignment. The few good things we have going for our situation are: the house also had a carriage house with renters already in it paying $1250/mo on a 2 year contract, we found a property manager to start renting out the main house (still not renting yet), and Landlord insurance policies are cheaper than home ownership policies.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm not a complete fuck-up, I just didn't have any experience buying a house (remember I said first time buyer). We have ROTH IRAs and I'm in the government TSP retirement system. I roughly make (with renters from the carriage house) $5900/mo. The $5900/mo **excludes** a % of my income to meet $19k in my ROTH TSP annually. I rounded our mortgage payment up to $3020. Our other expenses add up to about $2301 ($5321 total monthly). So we have roughly $500 worth of Free Cash Flow/mo.

&amp;#x200B;

We are also pregnant and expecting in June. We want to buy a van (2018/2019 Toyota Sienna). All of those other expenses from earlier included diapers, wipes, and doubling our food budget from $250 to $500/mo as well as internet and charitable giving. (We're getting rid of HBO after the last season of GoT and we just canceled Audible). We're young and have a big family and our travel (read airfare) costs average out to $535/mo (which was also included).

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, our Loan to Value ratio is too high for most banks to consider refinancing. We have made all mortgage payments on time. We have $17k in pure liquid savings (thanks Ally bank!). I also have 2 non-retirement brokerage accounts with roughly $70k.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I liquidate some of my equities to pay down the principal AND put down a decent ($8-10k) down-payment on our van?

Current Principal Balance$417,174.36

Current Interest Rate 4.62500%

Payment Amount $3,014.34 (I rounded up to 3020 so we're paying an addition $5.66 in principal woot woot!)

Property Value $413,000.00

&amp;#x200B;

Thoughts? Obviously, the situation gets better when the main house can be rented out (hopefully for $2100-2500).

&amp;#x200B;

Update #1: We will be looking at buying a used van 3-4 years old without adaptive cruise control. We will also be increasing the monthly principal payments to decrease the amount of interest we pay overall.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks to everyone who was helpful with suggestions. Next time you want to comment and say, ""Get good,"" please don't.

&amp;#x200B;

Update #2: We purchased a 2018 Dodge Grand Caravan for roughly $20k. Paid $9k down. Financing $12,600 at 5.2%. $490/mo for 36 months. Our main house is going to be rented out for $2350/mo for 18 months by an older couple. We are also going to refinance our home loan with Navy Federal Credit Union. We speak with NFCU tomorrow morning. The main house getting rented brings a huge breath of fresh air and we clear our mortgage by $220. We have roughly $2200 free cash flow a month now.

personalfinance,Is a CD Ladder worth a try?,"I read online about something called a CD Ladder where you open up multiple CDs with different term lengths and put whatever amount of money in it (1 year, 2 years, 3 years, etc). 

The point is to have access to your money each year which is supposed to have collected the higher interest rate, and if you need it you use it once the term is up, otherwise you roll it into another term length.

Has anyone tried this? Would you earn more interest in the long run instead of just putting everything in a regular 2.2% savings account? The math melts my brain.",finance

My question: Should I pay my student loan back aggressively or minimum payments?

&amp;#x200B;

I was having a conversation with my boss the other day at work and we were talking about bills and money, and I told him I would love to stop paying loans each month. \*I know I do not have a lot, but I was recently unemployed and I want to be financially stable again and take myself to Europe next year\* He told me if I have a good loan, it would be wise to pay just the minimum each month because I locked the loan deal down for ""yesterdays"" money which would be different than ""tomorrows"" money... I don't remember the exact words, but getting more bang for the buck.

My plan prior was to start throwing more money at the loan to pay it back faster and be done with it. But now I'm think I should just pay the minimum because that's better? I don't know!

&amp;#x200B;

Info:

**4.66%** Average Interest rate

**$3,955.15** Principal Balance

**$9.59** Outstanding Interest

= $3,964.74 left to pay

investing,Paying off low-interest auto loan as better investment than taxed savings/CDs/bonds?,"Let's say I have an auto-loan at 2% and have more than enough means to pay it off. Conventional wisdom would say that because the interest rate is so low, you might as well invest into the market.

But let's say that I have more than enough already into the market, and now I am in the mode of saving a good chunk of my heavy cash inflow into something less risky because I anticipate needing liquidity within 1-2 years. If that's the case, rather than putting that cash into a high-interest savings account or 1-year CDs—which may be \~2.7% but its net yield after tax would be less than 2%—wouldn't it smarter to just pay off the auto loan as an investment?

BTW, I understand that i-bonds are state tax-exempt, but you can only put in $10,000 a year. I'm asking about the best strategy for the savings that are on top of i-bonds.

TL;DR – paying off 2% auto loan &gt; investing in \~2.7% 1-year CDs because of post-tax yield considerations. Am I right?",finance

personalfinance,"First time filing taxes as MFJ in NY state, but wife and I have different county residencies.","My wife and I are filing MFJ for the first time and using FreeTaxUSA.

personalfinance,Converting Business Asset to Personal Asset? What are the taxes involved?,"**Situation:**

My parents owned a 2-family house that burned down in July 2017. Thankfully no one or nothing got hurt and the only thing lost were material possessions. This house was solely a rental property and had been rented out to third parties during its entire existence so I guess it was considered as ""business use"" during its existence (although I'm not sure what documents would state this). After the fire and after some deliberation, we decided to rebuild a completely new 2-family house and what was remaining of the old structure was fully demolished in December 2017.  


Construction of the new house began in April of 2018 and has completed in February of 2019. During the rebuild process, my parents decided they will live in one of the apartments. When we spoke to our accountant, he was telling us that this is considered a ""conversion of a business asset to a personal asset."" As such, we will have to pay taxes on the portion of the house that has been converted from business to personal (aka the apartment in which my parents will reside). When I asked him how do I know how much tax we'd have to pay in tax year 2019 he said it would be a percentage on the difference between what the insurance company has given to us for the loss and the book value of the house the day before the fire for the portion of the house that's being converted.

&amp;#x200B;

**Additional information:**

The house referred to here that burned down was in NJ. The new house built is in the exact same location.

My parents are residents of NJ.

My parents are retired and don't work.  


**I have some questions:**

1. Is this true given the description above - is this considered a conversion of business to personal asset and thus we'd need to pay tax on this? What are the documents that state the house was for business use and it is being converted to personal use - is there official documentation required?
2. How do they determine the exact percentage of the house that's being ""converted from business to personal use""?
3. How exactly do you calculate the taxes to get an estimate of what is owed (on all levels) once the portion % is determined - is this example correct?: I'm making up numbers here, but lets say the insurance company gave us $100 for the loss. The book value of the house on the day before the fire was $40. The portion of the house that was converted from business to personal is 40%. The tax rate is 20%. The difference of what the insurance gave us and book value is $60. 40% of $60 is $24. 20% tax on $24 is $4.80. Would we have to pay $4.80 in taxes in this example?
4. What are the tax rates for state (NJ) and federal for this situation? Just to confirm, is this a one-time payment?
5. My parents are retired and do not work - does this affect anything?
6. Is this only taxed on a federal and state level? Are there any county or municipal taxes required?
7. Are there any other tax implications I'd need to know about?
8. What other possible expenses would I incur (in addition to the tax payment) in this situation?
9. This tax bill can be pretty hefty next year. Are there any payment plans that can be arranged or some sort of conditions that would apply that we could take advantage of?
10. What other possible information would I need to know?

  
Sorry for the long post, but I figured the more detail given, the better answer I could potentially receive. Thank you very much in advance for anyone who could help me up with more information on this. Please let me know if you have any additional questions.",finance
btc,Hi. Need advice.,"Hello. I am a software developer that primarily develops wallets and services for Bitcoin (BTC). I will not list them here, to preserve my anonymity. 

Recently I've become fed up with a lot of Bitcoiners posting just outright wrong or hypocritical shit regarding BTC. Their obsession with guns and steak and blocking anyone who disagrees with them or uses various other coins. Not to mention, I had high hopes for LN. I like innovation and new technologies, but LN is an over-engineered disaster. It's not user friendly. It just feels like it was programmed and tested by developers only and never given to average users for their feedback. Think of the scene in Silicon Valley where Richard realizes he never let average people test his software for UX feedback. 

The fees are somewhat okay *now*. But in 2017 they were awful. I've had enough. 

Quite a few people use my wallets and/or services. I have various friends within the BTC community and if I were to shift focus to BCH then I'd be scolded. I have friends I cherish and connections I want to keep but if I were to switch to BCH then I know a lot of users and people that follow me would be furious and call me a ""scammer"". I've made a BCH wallet before (will not go into detail) as a port from the same BTC wallet, and I was shamed for doing that. 

I just need advice on what I should do. 

If you manage to figure out who I am then please do not bring this up anywhere outside of this post. Thank you.

*""1989: the rate was at nearly 10% when the yield inverted in March 1989. Between that time and March 1991, the rate dropped to approximately 6% and continued to drop to approximately 3% where it stayed until March 1993.*

*2000: The rate was around 6% in April 2000. By September 2002, it was at approximately 1.7% and continued to drop to under 1% til April 2004.*

*2006: The rate was around 4.5% in January 2006. Rates would continue to rise to approximately 5.25% in July 2007 and drop to zero or near zero rate and hold those rates until 2015 before it started to rise.*

*Our current rate is between 2.25% and 2.5% and the Feds are already pressured to not raise the rates in the near term. If a recession hits, we have basically exhausted the Feds lowering rates as a tool to spark economic recovery.""*

This is quite a disturbing trend, and if it continues, eventually we'll be at 0% interest rates in the middle of a massive recession. Then what?

* The Fed prints money to reflate the economy and bring back liquidity?
* Is the possibility of hyper inflation or even stagflation a reality we could be facing?
* Could we be running into a ""lost decade"" like Japan did, or are demographics too different for that to happen in North America?

This is a scary time to be an investor. My only solace is knowing the market has been through way worse and recovered. The difference this time though is our historically low interest rates. Not sure if we've ran into this problem before and how it was overcome if we did.

These are questions I've been asking myself, and I'm not smart enough to know the answer. Hope someone here knows enough about economics and the stock market to provide some clarity on what we might experience in the next 2 years if we continue down this path.

personalfinance,How Should I proceed financially?,"So I am a 21 year old college student expected to graduate next year with a BS degree in IT, about up until the beginning of this year i had actively $20k in credit card debt due to bad spending habits and about $10k in Federal subsidized student loans with an interest rate of 3.75%, I took a years worth of break in college until this fall and I started saving up a lot of money and working more (started ridesharing and delivery driving ontop of my other job) to get rid of my debt situation. 

Today I am sitting here paid off all my credit card interest balances so I am left with $10k in credit card debt that doesn't accumulate interest until end of 2020. I also have $12k in student loans with the same interest rate mentioned above (started going back to school so it rose), HOWEVER I also have $20k in actual cash out of which i have $8k invested into Mutual Funds. My question is what should I do with the remaining $12k? 

I was thinking if throwing the remaining $12k into mutual funds as well...I know the stock market is pretty interesting right now however I would leave the money sitting in there long term as i would earn enough money from my current job to pay off the credit cards once the interest free period expires, also my student loan doesn't accumulate nearly as much interest as could be gained from even bad mutual funds, and I like having the big chunk of money available to me IF i need it for whatever reason. 

What should I do with the remaining money I have? Invest it or pay off my remaining 0% interest balances? Or should i be doing something else? I don't pay rent and I have a decent car, the only costs right now I have is my tuition pretty much.",finance
personalfinance,How does my budget look? I'm 26 and need advice,"Hello,

So I'm posting here again after doing research on how to budget.  I'm 26 and would like to move out later this year into an apartment with 1 or 2 roommates (located in Boston).  I make $50k before taxes and have about $46k in federal loans.  They have been consolidated into 2 (subsidized and unsubsidized) loans both with a rate of 4.75%.  I have broken down where my monthly $284 payment goes [here](https://i.imgur.com/booCCGJ.png).  I'm aware that I should be paying more in order to get rid of them faster but I'm trying to determine what amount given I'm trying to move out soon.   I'm just not sure which loan I should be trying to pay off first or if it matters since they both have the same rate.  I see the 3 repayment options Navient has are Pay As You Earn, Income-Contingent Repayment, and Income-Based Repayment.  I looked into them and each are 10 year terms but I don't see an interest rate, is there one? (1)  [Here](https://i.imgur.com/PuaFadL.png) are my findings for the 3 plans.  

I've put together my monthly revenue, expenses, and net income [here](https://i.imgur.com/Qw7vGEJ.png).  These are based on current situation of still being at home ($250 for rent, $284 minimum for loans).  You'll see I have $11k sitting in my ""bank right now and what I plan on saving for an emergency fund (expenses for 4 months).  ""Move"" is my monthly income x 3, is that a good amount to have when you move or is that included in emergency fund? (2)  I hope to spend no more than $1,000/month for rent.   

My expenses total to $1436 calculated [here](https://i.imgur.com/5GKGyNH.png), and I have calculated what my running total is for my ""bank"" [here](https://i.imgur.com/giPD88m.png). This is essentially savings for move mixed with emergency fund.  By November I should have atleast $20k saved for moving.  I don't pay car insurance right now but I think I might when I move out since my car shouldn't be too much.  It's also already paid off so no more payments on it which is good.  (3) Should I get an IRA?  I read about the benefits of them and wasn't sure if I should also be contributing towards my 401k as well.  (4) Am I in decent shape to move out in the Fall?

personalfinance,Parents might be moving and offered to sell us their house.,"Apologies in advance for the wall of text, and obligatory ""I'm on mobile"" disclaimer. TLDR at the end.

I guess I'll start with some info about our current situation. I'm in my mid 20s, my husband is in his late 20s, and neither of us have ever owned a house before. We currently live in the same building as some friends (they also own the building). Our apartment should probably be condemned honestly, but when we moved we were desperate. Plus I can walk to work, and our friends are understanding if we need to pay rent late.  We haven't moved yet - the oversimplified reasons are money, location (downtown, and like I said, I walk to work), and jobs/transportation if we were to move.

Anyway, my dad got an out of state job offer, and my parents told us they'd be willing to sell us their house if they move. I'm not sure what the square footage is but it's got 3 bedrooms (master bed has an attached office space), 2 baths (maybe more like 1½ bc the master bath is tiny), attic, car port, and a screened in porch. It's in a good neighborhood and is in good condition. The kitchen has been remodeled, they replaced the windows maybe 10 years ago, I **think** they replaced the roof within the last 7ish years, and my mom is meticulous about upkeep.

My dad said they'd sell it for $85k, $10k more than they paid for it 12 years ago. **edit: $85k is right at market value, so they're not even giving a family discount...** He said that by his math, with a 30 year mortgage our payments would be a little less than $400 a month. (That's less than $100 more than we pay for the tiny shithole apartment we're currently in, however we don't pay any utilities.) My credit is fair, around 650, and I work at a bank, so I can get a good interest rate on a loan. My husband's credit is poor but I don't know what his score is. I'm not sure if it's necessary for him to be on the lease with me or if him being on the lease would affect the interest rate but I'm willing to leave his name off if it saves us a significant amount of money.

We would have a LOT more space than we do now, and I think moving to a nicer place would probably do wonders for our mental health. The opportunity makes me really excited. I almost feel like it's too good to pass up.

I have some concerns, though, the biggest one being that 30 year mortgage. My husband and I have considered moving to [City], which is 45 minutes away and has more job opportunities and more things to do. We've also talked about travelling or moving out of state or even out of the country. Those things are expensive, though, and moving far away isn't really practical at this point in time. But what happens if we do buy the house and decide in a couple years that we want to move? Maybe we could rent it out? I know selling houses can be difficult and I don't want to be stuck for 30 years.

Also, a house is quite a big responsibility and could potentially need a lot of maintenance down the road. We really want to move, but when we talk about moving, we usually talk about renting a condo or duplex or something like that - something we don't actually own and aren't tied to for a long time. One of the reasons we haven't taken that route is that the there aren't a lot of options here, and housing is more expensive in [City].

Another thing is that my parents would be moving because my dad can't find a job in this state. Granted, he just graduated at 60-something with a masters in theology, so his options are limited. Our city isn't exactly known for its jobs though, so if either of us wanted to change jobs we might *have to* look in [City].

**TLDR:** My parents might be moving out of state and offered to sell their house to me and my husband. I think it's a great opportunity to get out of our shitty apartment but I'm concerned about a long mortgage tying us down and the responsibility and expenses of owning a house.

So, PF, what do you think?

Edit: I got the objective advice I was looking for. I think we need to save up and move to another rentable space in the city. Thanks everyone!",finance

personalfinance,Buy a house or rent another year?,"Hey guys, second time asking for help here. Last year I was given some good advice, so thanks!

My wife and I live in Orlando, FL and make decent money (130k gross combined). We have 30k saved up today. Our apartment is raising rent to 1600 a month starting July if we sign another year.
We're trying to decide if we should just buy a house (because we intend on living in this area for the long-term), or save another year to have more for a down payment, closing costs, backup, etc.

We went to Chase to talk about what we could get approved for, and with out credit score (around 720), and having basically no debts (car payment 400, and student loans 200), we got approved for up to 500-600k house. 

Obviously, we wouldn't go anywhere near that. We're looking more in the 325-350 range, which looks like, even with PMI, our mortgage would be around 2000 a month.

We're being told interest rates are really low right now, and unsure if they'll rise by July next year. I also hear upcoming elections can negatively impact this as well. Would it be better to wait another year or look seriously now?

I'm making 70k with a 401k employer match of 6% dollar for dollar and currently contributing 6% to get that match. I have an emergency fund of 6 months. After all my bills, I am able to put aside $2000 a month to put towards debt/savings.

So now the situation. I have my car loan (only debt I have) with 16k left on it at 2.9%. My parents have 60k of parent plus loans that they took out for me at 4%. They have told me that they would pay for it and they are paying a couple hundred more than minimums on. I know legally it is not my problem but morally I would like to show my appreciation for everything they have done for me. They have sacrificed so much for me and my younger brother, especially after having me when they were 17. He'll be going to college within the next couple years so I know that they'll have to worry about paying for that too.

Should I put that $2000 a month towards their parent plus loan or just knock out my car loan? I plan on helping them no matter what, my main question is just whether I should take care of my car loan first or help them first. If they didnt have their loan, then what I would do is make the minimums on my car and invest the rest since the interest rate is so low, so this logic is why I'm thinking about helping my parents first.

And just to be clear, the $2000 a month is after making the minimum payment on my car.",finance

Assuming I make smart investment decisions and get average performance, is there an interest rate for my loan that would make you say it's worthwhile to pay that down as quickly as I can, pay into my IRA as quickly as I can, or split payments?

Vanguard seems to indicate that a decent portfolio would have averaged 8% over the last 90 years or so, and my loan is lower than that by a good bit so it seems like filling the IRA as quickly as I can makes the most sense, but I want to see what this sub has to say.",finance

My takeaway:

- Stop spending so much on food and gas

- Cook meals at home and don't eat out 

- Don't use tollways unless it's absolutely necessary 

- List all services we pay for and see where we can cut some

- Call my bank and make sure the escrow withdrawals match the county tax bills 

- Look to special budget and spending programs, such as Dave Ramsey

- Pay the credit cards with high interest more than the 0% interest rate cards

I think we can do this without giving up our home so I'm gonna do as much as I can before considering listing the home or going bankrupt. 

I appreciate all of your advice! I'm much more hopeful and am shifting my priorities with credit card debt obliteration as a top one! 

***

When I logged into my mortgage account and saw the increase, I immediately phoned my mortgage servicer to see what happened and it turns out they under-charged us for escrow for the entire first year of our mortgage and now we're making up for the shortage.

I'm used to maintaining a daily budget for family expenses (about 100/day)and this increase in mortgage brings us down to about 60/day which makes me feel very uneasy. We also have over 40k in credit card debt, we both have student loans and are finishing paying my car as well. This pushes us in an even tighter corner and is going to keep me from making additional payments to help pay down our credit card debt. My wife is afraid we may need to consider downsizing, but that's a tough option because houses are sitting on the market for months in our city and area now (DFW, TX). 

Without having to consider selling, what would be some of my options to help relieve some of the pressure and drastic change in expenses immediately? 

Could I technically contribute a daily amount to my escrow to help relieve the shortage they've described to me? 

Is bankruptcy chapter 13 or 7 an option if I'm not too concerned with damaging my credit for a bit? What would these options mean for my mortgage if I want to keep paying the mortgage off and keep my home? Is that even possible with bankruptcy? 

Sorry if this seems like a silly problem, I'm just looking for a little bit of guidance as we feel a little lost when we're so used to having our finances in order :/",finance

personalfinance,IRS Requesting Form 8962 and 1095-A. Lost and stressed.,"Hey all,

So here's the situation. My wife enrolled in the Premium Tax Credit health insurance program for the year of 2018, and she was definitely eligible as far as I can tell because she was making $7.50 at the time. We weren't married yet, but got married at the end of April. We didn't have any idea of how the credit worked, and honestly didn't give it a second thought. We then moved to a different state in June and she got a job making much more ($12.50 up to $16 by the end of 2018). I canceled her health insurance in October as I then put her on my employer's health plan.

Come the end of February, I did our taxes as I normally do using TurboTax. Not knowing much about filing statuses, I figured we would do Married Filing Jointly because, well, we're married! After going through the process and entering her form 1095-A, TurboTax we said we would owe over $2000 for the tax credit. This freaked me out and I wasn't entirely sure if it was because of the PTC or not. So I tried out Married Filing Separately instead. Lo-and-behold, instead of owing, it said that we would be getting a refund! So I submitted our taxes (using a different website because of fees) using Married Filing Separately.

We owed a little bit but were getting a decent amount back. As it stands right now, the IRS took out what my wife owed ($80), and the State took out what I owed and gave us her refund. Our old state, however (where the tax credit was used) still has not refunded anything and the IRS hasn't refunded me my small federal refund. 

Today I got a letter in the mail from the IRS (letter 12C) saying that me or someone on my tax return was reported as using the PTC and needed to submit both form 1095-A and a completed form 8962 and I am at a loss. I am now reading about the PTC and realize that I probably messed up by choosing MFS when I did our taxes, but I had no idea. I trusted the stupid programs that I was using to guide me and explain things. So now I need to submit these items but I don't understand - I included the 1095-A on her portion of the taxes, so all the information should be there. 

I'm just at a loss. I guess my question is, do I need to amend our tax returns? When I plugged everything in that first time, it said we would owe a little over $2000. But the tax credit is for almost $3800 and I guess if we use MFJ we have to pay all of that back. Do I amend? Do you think the letter was in error since the information was included on her return? Any information or help on what to do next would be so greatly appreciated. Thank you all so much for taking the time to read this.",finance

- 30k interest rate is 6.8%
- 11k  interest rate is 3.4%
- and the one I can pay off is about 4.5% 

I understand the value of paying off the highest interest one first but I feel I wont be getting anywhere with that large loan until I make some financial changes in september.

personalfinance,Am I a candidate for debt consolidation?,"Hi all,

Before I start--seriously, please, no need to rip into me. I've been in bad shape for the last ~6 months, I know that my situation is kind of shitty, and I'm posting here looking for answers, not ""DUR HUR CREDIT CARD DEBT IS BAD WHY U STUPID OP"".

So, last year I went to treatment for alcoholism. Last time I worked in 2018 was in May. In June I took a LOA from my work as I didn't feel right going back go a job i had just started when I was unreliable due to mental health issues, those issues being exacerbated a ten fold by alcoholism, and missing days due to call outs/staying in the hospital for over a week when I had only been at the job a couple weeks.

July and August I spent in inpatient rehab. Late August I moved to San Diego for outpatient treatment, I got financial help with rent from my aunt and uncle for Sep/Oct/Nov. Before rehab I had already been living paycheck to paycheck making $10 and paying fairly pricey rent, and had around $900 cc debt--i had a paycheck that I had planned to use to to pay off a good chunk of that, only to have to spend that entire check on other urgent matters.

I did outpatient for September and most of October, and since outpatient is basically a full time job, between that and meetings I wasnt able to work.

November I nearly got a job, but when it didn't work out (due to dumb shit with trying to get a fucking ID!!) I then put off searching for another job as I knew I would be moving soon due to aunt and uncle not being able to help anymore, and i had no clue where i would end up, so while I scoured around for a place I could afford, I continued to accrue debt.

Dec 1 I used Paypal credit to get into a new (shitty as hell) place that was over an hour train/bus ride to where I used to live and where I had a support system. So I had no clue, again, where I could get a solid job that was possible between transportation and staying near my support system, which was 90% of the reason I was desperately trying to stay I'm SD. I was able to work a little bit in December and January, but only netted around $1700.

Long stort, I'm back living with my mom in UT, since rent just made it impossible to stay in SD. Between expensive medical treatments/doctors visits/meds, rent, food, transportation, and other expenses I'm in pretty bad debt. Since I got home, I have also been helping my mom a lot with bills, gas, and food as she is a single mom with no degree, realty is her career, and her business has been EXTREMELY frustrating lately and brought almost nothing in. Other than that, I am not paying rent.

My current debts are:

$3400 chase visa
$2000 mountain american visa
$1200 PayPal credit

I also have ~$1600 of medical bills left to pay, I think I can get $1200 waived if financial aid goes through.

Expenses are:

~$150 personal food (I cant eat most of what my mom buys, due to my eating disorder; also, I dont want to eat my mom's/brother's food since my brother is 15 and eats fucking everything and also she refuses to buy cheaper foods--always HAS to buy name brand snack foods, lots of frozen/ready meals, wont buy produce on clearance or adjust meals to match sales...this is nonnegotiable, trust me, I have tried talking sense into her).

$500 helping mom with expenses (rough estimate)

$100 other things (shoes and clothes when absolutely necessary, occasional entertainment (RARELY go out), hobbies. Honestly not even sure I spend that whole amount.

$60-100 meds and copays

My credit score is around 670. My two credit cards I am not entirely sure of the interest rates but I dont think they are particularly high. My paypal credit will not have interest kick in until late may, so paying that off is my priority.

Sorry for the wall of text. Anyhow, am I a good candidate for debt consolidation? I am finally working a solid job, making $9/hour since Utah pays shit and I am 22 with no schooling yet. I get 40-50 hours per week. Taking on a second job is not an option, I work 3 or 4am until anywhere from 10am to 1pm, and I already walk 7 miles total to get to and from work--our house is kind of out of the way and there is nothing closer. So between transport and weird hours causing lack of sleep, and the high risk that if I stretch myself too thin I will have a mental breakdown, it's not in the cards.

My mom's business is finally starting to look up (sounds crazy but her energy healer told her her business had been cursed by one of her clients which I wrote about in r/paranormal if you're curious; she said she blocked the curse but that was only about 2 weeks ago). I do not expect her to pay me back, neither do I plan to ask her to do so, although she offers to help when she can). So that will be several hundred off my expenses each month. As for food, I've spent a lot lately due to eating disorder (yay bulimia) but I've been able to fight that better lately so food costs should be &lt;$100 from here on out.

Geez. Again, sorry for rambling.

personalfinance,How do I calculate how much an extra payment per month should be on my auto loan?,"Not sure where to post this so I am starting here.

Hi all,

$28k auto loan debt on my vehicle. My interest rate is 2.99%. My payment per month is $557, the principal amount is $471. 

Is there a way to calculate either...

1) How much extra I need to pay in principal per month to have the vehicle paid off by X (whether that’s March 2020, July 2020, etc). 

or

2) If I pay X amount in principal per month, let’s say... $200-300, when would it be paid off by?

Should I pay them off?,"I (28F) started with $110k of student debt, I have a relatively high paying job for my age, and I only have $51,000 left to pay off. I tackled all the higher interest rate loans first and I refinanced about one third of the outstanding balance a couple years ago to a fixed rate loan when I realized all of my loans were variable, I wanted to refinance high interest loans anyway, interest rates were going up, and a coworker suggested I “hedge.” I am rounding the outstanding balances for simplicity:

5.530%, Fixed, $18,000; 
5.350%, Variable, $2,000; 
4.750%, Variable, $22,000; 
4.250%, Variable, $3,000;

Some of these are Stafford Loans, however, I am not eligible and will never be eligible for loan forgiveness. There are no prepayment penalties associated with any of them.

I was saving for a down payment on a house but my fiancé and I have jobs that could change location. We are holding off until we get married, start a family, and settle down.

My backstory: I am about to finish my second year of three year medical professional graduate program. Due to the nature of class and clinical schedule, as well as school work restrictions, I am unable to work outside of the program. 

I’ve taken out the max of student loans, unsubsidized and gradPLUS loans, to pay for tuition and living expenses. When I graduate, I’ll be around $110k in debt with these loans. I have a 5 year plan of paying off my loans entirely that I plan on sticking to. The field I’m getting my degree in is highly profitable and in demand, with starting salaries in my area at $160k base, plus the option for additional call pay. 

I currently own a home with a mortgage of $160k, monthly payments of $1200, and the home value at $310k. Additional monthly expenses including transportation to clinical sites, food, utilities, and general expenses are around $800, putting my total monthly expenses right at $2k. 

I recently, and unexpectedly lost my fiancé that I lived with and shared living expenses with to tragic circumstances. Three weeks later I found out I was pregnant. I’ve now gone through any and all savings that I had trying to manage my expenses on my own. By my estimates, I will be around $9k short of covering my living expenses for the next year of school, including anticipated child related costs I have yet to incur. 

I’ve applied for a private student loan that the school is denying due me already being maxed out on federal loans based on their estimated cost of attendance and living. I’ve tried to take out a home equity line of credit, but since I have no monthly income I was not approved. I’ve applied for state and federal low income assistance, but don’t qualify since I am considered employable and already have a bachelors degree. 

My only debt is my mortgage and my student loans. I have a credit score greater than 790, with great credit history. I currently have two separate 401k accounts, one with 50k and the other with 15k. 

Dropping out or delaying school is not an option, neither is selling my home or getting a roommate due to me expecting a baby in the next few months. 

What is the best option in order to get through the next year? Try and find an 18 month zero interest credit card that I can delay paying interest on until I can pay it off right after graduation? Cash out my lower valued 401k? Any additional ideas?",finance

personalfinance,What’s the purpose of life and disability insurance connected with a personal loan?,"I am looking at getting a small personal loan for a term of one year that I plan to pay off in about 8 months. I’m fine with the interest and such, but the documents came back with life and disability insurance forms. I had spoken to a bank employee on the phone and none of that was mentioned. The forms do say that I’m not required to take out the insurance but it came in one form with the yes boxes already checked so I’d have to ask them to remove it. 

I’m wondering if it’s for my benefit or the bank’s and whether I should reject it. I don’t have any personal reason to want it (no dependents to worry about and the loan is quite small so I don’t care if it comes out of my estate), but I could picture them wanting it to protect their interests—if they get the payout if I die before the end of the year. Would it possibly change my interest rate or terms if I say no? Or is this just a really jerky way to get people to sign up for life insurance?",finance
personalfinance,Should I file for Chapter 7 or just default on my unsecured debt?,"To start off, I’m 26 years old and live in the United States, in Pennsylvania. I’ve been through the wringer over the past year: I’ve struggled with severe mental illness all my life but back in March, I had a nervous breakdown that left me jobless and uncertain of my future. My illness was extremely aggravated by my breakdown and basically set me back at square one in my recovery, with new debilitating symptoms.

My parents agreed to pay my debts and let me live with them rent-free until I got back on my feet. The problem is that I’m not sure if I’m ever going to get back on my feet. We don’t have enough money to provide me with the treatment I need, and as of this past week I was booted off my health insurance after aging out of the AHCA. I was denied disability benefits, then denied Medicaid. The cheapest insurance we can find through the government Marketplace that will cover my medication is a PPO at over $500 a month, which would financially cripple the family.

Because of this sudden expense necessary to keep me alive and relatively stable, I’m going to have to get rid of some of my debt, and I simply can’t pay it back. I have $5500 in debt across three credit cards and a line of Amazon credit, plus a credit consolidation loan I took out six months before my breakdown, which had originally been a loan for $5400 but with its interest rate it has ballooned to a balance of $7600. We plan to keep paying the consolidation loan only because my father had to co-sign on it and we don’t want his wages to be garnished.

I wound up in this situation because of compulsive spending related to obsessive compulsive disorder. My parents are now fully in control of my finances to prevent me from further destroying my life.

To be able to afford my health insurance, I have to stop paying for the credit cards. I’ve considered filing for a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, but I’m not sure if we’d be able to afford to eat the lawyer fee, plus a Chapter 7 would stay on my credit for ten years. Just defaulting on my cards and changing my phone number would only stay on my credit for seven years, but it would be four separate strikes against me. But I wouldn’t get harassed by debt collectors for years if I go bankrupt.

I’m pretty sure that I’m considered “judgement proof” to creditors that would try to come after me for assets. I don’t own a home or a car or even a damn bike. I have less than $3000 worth of personal belongings. The only things I have of any value are a computer, my cell phone, a Nintendo Switch, a TV, my mom’s old engagement ring, and a pearl bracelet. I might have $100 worth of books, plus a few t-shirts, two pairs of jeans, three pairs of shoes, and some blankets. I’m most worried that they’d try to take my computer because I need it to write, which is my only potential source of income. I don’t have a job, and no savings. My bank account has $6 in it.

Should I just say “fuck it” and default on my credit cards, or go to the trouble of filing for Chapter 7?",finance
personalfinance,Can someone tell me why permanent life insurance is not a smart investment?,"tldr at bottom.

I’ve heard it again and again, but when thinking about it by the numbers it makes sense to me. You can put away money in a tax shelter that (according to the policy I am looking at) supposedly increases by about 6% per year. And it increases regardless of market fluctuations. 

The monthly premiums for the $1mil policy start at $43/month then triple at about age 30 and so on. But it seems like dividend and cash flow increase faster. And if I’m not mistaken you can withdraw money you’ve put in like a bank account but with a much higher interest rate. It’s through NW mutual. 

I’m very hesitant because this sounds too good to be true and I’ve heard a lot about how permanent policies don’t make the most effective use of your investment funds. But given the aforementioned information including the hedge against market risk, high interest rate, and other things I’m struggling to see how it’s a bad idea for an investment. 

I should mention i get life insurance through my job and have no dependents (am also healthy to my knowledge) so I’m looking at this primarily as a wealth generating opportunity that diversifies my portfolio. I’m already maxing out my 401k and Roth contributions ($25k a year) so this would be in addition to that. 


tldr: 

My question is, does it make sense then to use permanent life insurance to build wealth? If not, can someone break down to me why or point me toward resources that can? Thanks.",finance

gaming,creating the cheat free zone,"what i've experienced in video games is upwards to horrific at times &amp; i blame the lack of supervision/guardianship.

at worst, i've seen players rummage around in scripted fashion, clearly proving their every movement matches that of an input bot.

from that being said, contrary to such a situation would be a chemist whom has gone mad scientist touching the outside world (something they aren't supposed to do) while going at some abnormal pace.

in their defense, if they could but aren't - they don't deserve to be treated as though somebody else is, regardless of being an input bot matching the description.

&amp;#x200B;

from there, i've seen a lot of lag box use where the data stream going into their client software is manipulated in that it injects new data, while blocking the valid data sent to it - because the calculator isn't respecting time stamps in conjunction to jitter.

&amp;#x200B;

filtering jitter can rid both the lag box &amp; the teleporting &amp; repeated lightning smooth scripted movements.

the military should love this project because as the people are combed through - there are tricks that casual people can't comprehend &amp; they aren't creative enough to acknowledge the angles of trump.

an example would be some movement the person claims was natural, but the FDA knows the support for such a movement is weak &amp; the person's ID photo doesn't assist in aiding the movement any.

if a person is not lining up smoothly with data packets that match what was received from the other player, a test can be performed using one of the other players connections that is known to be good, based on what the calculator has received.

if all connections are showing up bad, the calculator can push a flag out that tells their maintenance people the server is experiencing problems (because either the input is bad, or the circuit board can't keep up with it's task).

then if the results prove the person was falsifying their connection, or even if the jitter remains, the player gets banned &amp; the only way to get unbanned is for their internet service provider to provide proof it was their fault.

the military loves it again because people want to work for the internet service provider &amp; get paid to lie, but there isn't any form to create for them to manipulate what is on the form as it is already created in proprietary form that the lower employees aren't able to decode because it is outside of the food table the FDA supports &amp; any chemist attempting to aid them is considered an alien\\terrorist.

but they've got a bunch of emotional responses learning that said fact late.  


getting a report from the ISP would be something the higher ups would enjoy doing anyways, because each time they say no it was a lie - they get a praise for being there for the people in a reliable way.  


they also need to increase the polling rate, turn off the 1500 MTU size &amp; let us turn of the nagle algorithm in the settings of the operating system.  


when it comes to time, the calculator forces everybody to wait as it claims itself as reference.

then rather than build a list of priority based on the ping response of each player connected, the calculator prioritizes itself as the master.

it only needs one string to be master &amp; the second string is the hook for the next page, which should be the beginning of jitter filtering that is sealed with an action that is asking one of the players and|or an outside source to hitup the server to test itself (and that fluid additive can be scaled to follow along with how much added or subtracted the player's data packet is based on the number of players near &amp; hold a regulation to 1500 bytes for ending the need to turn off nagle's algorithm at a single packet's worth).  
the testing itself can use a transform function that uses other server calculators to use their player list as a source to complete a test, since it would be as easy as somebody else playing a video game - regardless of it being the same game since the data is expected to be the same if you don't count a longer player list from games that have more players in the match.  
the test itself could be ran to a null &amp; people in I.T. are expected to know that is very good for defense.

people proclaiming the test result could be spoofed are apparently blind to the fact that the calculator on the server is the only process creating &amp; blocking the game process from being pinged (or simply maintaining the erratic data flow) is going to get the person banned anyways., but we can get the operating system manufacturers to include the ruleset for another port that can be pinged - tied into a process that they won't want to deny with a firewall because of what the process does (and on the allowed list by default with all the major anti-virus softwares).

*Finances*

*This situation with our finances seems to get more complicated all the time.  As I see it now there are several intertwined issues:  Our Joint Banking Account, wife’s bank accounts, The payday loans that are scheduled to be withdrawn on the 1st of each month, The car accident, the debt settlement firm*

*The debt settlement corp decision*

*Wife and I spoke with Greenpath.  This is a debt counseling firm that I have used before.  They will call all the creditors and negotiate a payment plan.  Their plan lowers interest rates and schedules payments to the creditors that will pay all accounts in full.  The offered 36 months at $690 a month.  We would have to send them that first payment up front.  Their fees would be waived because I’m still a member of the credit union in past city, or so they think.*

*We also spoke to Credit one.  This is a debt settlement firm.  They negotiate with the creditors to reduce the debt and stop all interest.  In order to do this the debts must be 3 months in arrears.  Then they can negotiate with the creditors for a reduction in the amount to be repaid.  They proport that they are usually successful at reducing the amount owed by 50%.  They charge a fee of 25% of the total debt.  That means that we save about 25% of the total owed plus interest is stopped.  Joshua, the representative we have been paired to described how they approach this process.  I have to stop making payments on the unsecured debts.  I contact each creditor, Joshua makes the call and conferences me in.  I talk to the creditors and he records the call.  I get the last date payment was made, the amount of the payment, the account number, and the current balance.  The creditor gives this on the phone, and it is recorded.   This will be the amount at which the negotiations will start.  They predict the percentage of reduction based on the ratings they have compiled on each creditor.  For instance, Capital One will only negotiate a 30% reduction, Chase will usually negotiate 50%.  Lendmark is known by this company and they have had success negotiating with them, but I don’t know the percentage.*

*If we sign with them I will begin making payments of $260 a month.  This money will go into an escrow account and then when the creditors close the accounts and before they go into collections, CO will begin negotiating with them. I an account goes to collection before the three months, Joshua said that they would immediately begin negotiations.*  

*PAY DAY LOAN DIFFICULTIES WITH ANY PLAN*

*The tricky part about the payday loans is that they are scheduled to come out of our joint bank account on the 1st of each month.  That’s because they think I get paid on the 1st and there is no way I can protect that money.  Actually I get  paid on the last day of the month, so I think I can withdraw the payment and make their draws bounce.  I just don’t know if I’ll eventually get in trouble for fraud that way.  I tried to open a new account but I’ve waited too long and there is an account into collections.  I don’t know which one that is yet.  The bank won’t let me open another account.*  

*NOTE:  I should have three bank accounts.  1) a savings for the direct deposits,  2) checking for  and paying debts  3) checking for ATM debits.   That way I could merely close the checking for paying debts and no payday loans could get any more money.*

*There are two payday loans that have yet to draw their first payment.  I have to let them get that payment or it would be clearly fraud.  The other three that are actively being paid were willing to give an extension this month to the 8th.  I will allow the direct deposit for this month on March 29, the 31st is on Sunday.  The last payment on the BMW $760 will come out on the 29th.  If this isn’t paid, we lose the car.  That payment is scheduled.  The two payday loans that need to get paid once will take about $650.  ATT has to be paid $242.*  

*I have to finish our taxes on Wednesday and hope for a positive return.*

*I will withdraw the available funds from the account leaving only enough to cover the overdraft fees for when the 3 PD loans attempt their draw.  That will put these three into default,  It will be the first of the three months of planned missed payments.  The other two PD loans will go into default one month later and will be added to the settlement account when they do.*  

*I really don’t see another option to this settlement program.  I’ve listed below the accounts I plan to enroll with the company.*

*PayDay accounts  Unsecured Credit*

*PD 1 3800   Lendmark 2100*

*PD2 1200   Capital One 1800*

*PD3 763   Chase  4030*

*PD4 667   American Ex 1821*

*PD5 820   Care Credit 2285*

*PD6 678   BGE     353*

*These are estimates  7220   12,389*

*So the amount that I might be reduced will be $5000  The charge from CO will be $2500 which will be a savings of $2500.  CO does not collect it’s payment up front.  They get paid as they produce and at the end of the contract.*  

*ONE IMPORTANT QUESTION*

*After I get this program going all of these accounts will be closed.  I will have no access to credit and then restoring credit will be a long process.  I am wondering about the Capital One account.  They only will settle for a 30% reduction and I still have to pay the payment to CO of 25%.  That only is a savings of 5%.  That’s a $100 over 5 months.  Since I will need to rebuild my credit when this is over and one of the major measures of calculation is amount owed as a proportion of credit available.  I think it would be better to keep the Capital One credit account open and pay that off myself.  Then I would have a credit card with a lower balance and start with a higher baseline 6 months from now when I can start rebuilding credit.*

*WHY I CAN’T JUST CLOSE THE bbt ACCOUNT*

*All three of my direct deposit payments for retirement are connected to this account.  I can’t open another account to have these payments directly deposited.  Therefore, I have to withdraw the funds on the last day of the month to avoid availability for the PD withdrawals.  That is workable as long as nothing fouls up on the last day of the month or its not bank fraud.*

*My social security check arrives after the 8th or before the 15th (2nd Wednesday of the month) so it’s safe.  The pension retirement arrives on the 1st.  The only way to protect that deposit is to move it to wife’s account.  Fortunately, these forms do not require verification from the bank.  We can change this immediately and will do so on Monday.*   

*Wife is looking into opening another savings account with my name on it to receive the other two Direct Deposits.  That will insulate our income from expenditures.*

*WHAT ABOUT THE CAR SITUATION?*

*We still haven’t heard whether they will repair the car or total it.  Either way our cost will be $500*

*If they repair it, we will have the car for vital transportation needs.*

*If they total it the insurance will only pay the KBB value of a trade in.  that’s about 21,000.  We owe 33,000.  When I bought the car I also bought “Gap insurance” for this very possibility.  The Gap insurance will cover the rest of the balance of the loan.  We still pay $500*

*However, if this is the case, we will need another working vehicle*

*I haven’t proofed this, but I think it gives a good overview of the complications we are facing.  Something to talk about.  Ideas and reactions will be great.  Wife has been a great help in making me think and not act out of panic.  I think this might be a great opportunity for us to get even and then ahead, but this situation is also filled with severe consequences if we mess up.* 

*Text us to tell us when we can talk.*

personalfinance,Pay off Balance on Car Loan w/ Credit Card?,"I financed a used car about 8 months ago. The loan was taken out for 2 years. I currently owe \~$4700 on the car loan. Right now I have 3 credit cards, which all have a 0 balance. I use them occasionally to pay bills, and then pay them off in full every month.

I've been working on repairing my credit for the past several years, and I've done a good job. My credit score is almost 800, which a few years ago I would have never dreamed of having a credit score this high.

I was carrying a balance on two of my cards up until a few months ago when I finally got them fully paid off.

So I've been thinking about using one of my credit cards, which has a $4700 limit, to pay off the balance on my car payment. This way I can drop the insurance down to the much more affordable minimum coverage, instead of the full coverage that I currently have. This would save me over $140 a month in insurance bills. I would also have more flexibility with paying off the credit card, compared to paying on the car loan, which has a minimum payment of $280 per month. The interest rates are similar either way as far as I  tell. Although my credit card, the one with the $4700 balance, is currently running a promo which I've opted into that drops my interest rate down the 3.99%, for 8 months or something.

I'm worried that my credit score will take a hit if I load up that large of a charge on my credit card, even though all I'm essentially doing is moving debt from one source to another.

Is it a bad idea to pay off the car loan with the credit card?",finance
gaming,The Bastion soundtrack brings me to tears,"It makes the game real.

Games don't often mean much to me outside of a fun way to pass the time.  I'm the kind of person who skips cut scenes even on the first playthrough

It's been a while since I've played Bastion but every time I hear Setting Sail, Coming Home, I imagine the Bastion world, and it makes me want to cry.  The song makes the characters real in a way no voice over or cutscene can.  I imagine the city crumbling, the hopes and aspirations of each character, the lives they may have led.  It makes them feel oh so human.

I remember the dreams of each character, with drops of narrative fed throughout trials of chaotic combat.  My struggle in parallel with theirs.

I know Bastion is old news by now.  And I know I'm certainly not the first to fall in love with the soundtrack, but I want to thank Supergiant for making an experience that has stayed with me for years, unlike any other game I've ever played.",technology

personalfinance,50 grand lie idle.... In Russia,"Hello. 
I am a 30 years old data analyst and SAS specialist programmer in a state corporation in Russia.  

I don't have any debts and I have my own apartment (540sqf) in Moscow, not far from the center, and a good car.  

I have about $25k in Russian Bank with an annual intrest of 2%. This deposit is ""protected"" by federal Russian law. If the bank will be bankrupt, government promise to return the deposit under $25k (but in rubles). 

Additionally, I have $50k in cash. This lump of money doesn't work and this is a big concern for me. I want to use it properly.

I don't want to exceed the level of protected deposit. Russian retirement programs are scam. Investment in Russian market is a very risky thing. So I would like to ask you, if you know any reasonable investment options, outside Russia, for a normal Russian guy who is willing to save his money?",finance
personalfinance,Military married 25yr old trying to save with college debt,"So I’m trying to figure out the best way to go about saving for a future home (my wife and I plan on renting for a while since military moves a lot), saving for retirement, possibly invest in some index ETFs to for bigger returns, pay off student loans in a timely manner, AND not go crazy in the process. 
I have ~55,000 in private loans all with 5.75 interest rate and ~33,000 in fed loans which under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness will be forgiven tax-free after 10 years of public service. 

My pay with BAS and BAH is: ~4000/month

Rent: 1,390

Sewer/water/trash: 65

Electric: 60

Gas: 50 

Wifi: 44

Car insurance for mine and my wife’s car: 255

Fuel:~200 |CA gas prices+30mile commute :(

Tithing: 200

Groceries: 370 roughly

Restaurants: 125

Misc things for the apt: 145

Private Loans: 490+150 of additional payments
(no fed loan payment with income driven plan)

Savings: 200

We put the minimum amount into BRS Roth IRA to get the full match which ends up being only ~100/month. 

Emergency fund is 5000 in a USAA savings account but looking to start long term savings in a high yield account. 

Would it be better to put more towards my Roth IRA before trying to invest in an index ETF or saving for a house? or would it be better to put more emphasis on student loans? I’m afraid it will be too late to start saving for a home or invest by the time the student debt would be paid off. 

Also my wife owns a small business that does very well but her income fluctuates so it’s hard to factor it into the monthly budget so we figure hers out on the fly each month.",finance

personalfinance,"Parents asked for a loan, not sure what to do. I truthfully believe they wouldn't intentionally try to screw me over but I'm unsure whether I should agree to help or not.","Hi everyone, first time poster here so I hope I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm in need of a bit of advice on what I should do.

Background: I'm 18M, living in Toronto, Canada and my parents are, to the best of my knowledge of 18 years living with them, trustworthy. I have never been abused in any way by them, there's always food on the table, and their actions and motives have always been in my best interest. I truthfully believe that they would not intentionally try to financially screw me over.

That being said: I have approximately $12k in the bank right now, intended for use during university (I'm almost done my last year of high school. The money was in GIC/investments that matured about half a year ago; at the time of maturation the bank offered me a savings account with high interest for the first few months so my parents and I agreed to keep the money in the savings account until March, at which point we would set aside some money for my first year of university and then put the rest into another investment.

Just today, my mom asked me if she and my dad could use the $12k in my bank account to help repay their debt. They have taken out loans before for legitimate reasons related to small business. It's not MLM or anything financially unsustainable; it's a family business. Apparently, the interest on their loan had gone up and they want to repay their debt ASAP.

My mom promised me the following two conditions should I agree:

1) **This will not affect my education whatsoever.** For example, if I tell my parents I need $1k for purposes related to my studies, they will immediately send me the $1k, **even if it means taking out another loan**.

2) They will repay me the entirety of the $12k back within a reasonable time after my graduation.

Being 18 now, they need my consent and my signature to do anything since the money is in my account, under my name. We will be going to the bank on Wednesday regardless of my verdict.

As I have said previously, I truthfully believe that my parents wouldn't intentionally try to screw me over. That being said, this situation has the potential to completely derail my future. Reddit, I need advice. Should I say yes or no, and why?

#**Update**
I am submitting this update 7 hours after originally posting this.

I have spoken with my mom, and she has revealed a few things that change the whole situation.

1) I actually have another $62k in an [RESP](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/registered-education-savings-plans-resps.html) which alone should be more than enough to cover my education should I remain in Toronto. The $12k was apparently meant to serve as an emergency fund. I apologize for the factually incorrect statement regarding what I originally thought the $12k to be for; this is what happens when there is a lack of communication between parents and child.

2) My parents aren't deadlocked in some bad credit situation. They have three banks from which they have varying levels of debt: let's call them bank A, B, and C. From Banks A and B, they are steadily repaying their loan of a few thousand dollars per bank. As for bank C, they owe approximately $20k, which they have been making minimum payments on (while repaying banks A and B), but the bank, seeing only minimum payments decided to raise the interest rate, and sent my parents a letter saying so. My parents now therefore want to pay off the loan from bank C ASAP. Which brings me relief, as if I do need to dip into the $12k, they can still loan bits of emergency money from banks A and B. **But this also raises one new question: is this explanation bullshit or does this really happen? Do banks really just increase your rates because you're just making minimum payments?** I can probably also ask to see the letter.

~~Finally: I will be deleting this post and all of my comments here when this is all over or when I feel I've decided on a course of action.My parents didn't want me to ask anyone outside of the family for advice as they're naturally skeptical of online safety, and I can't persuade them otherwise that Reddit is actually quite trustworthy as far as things go. Despite this, I needed advice, so I had no choice but to ask.~~ **EDIT:** Okay, fine, people are saying not to; I won't.

**To everyone who has replied, or will reply, thank you so much for your support and your advice.** It means a lot to me, especially at such a critical time in life.",finance

personalfinance,"24 years old Brazilian, trying to get out of debt, any advice?","Hey reddit, hi. So, i’m kind of an asshole with money, and now i’m trying to deal with the consequences of it. Basically i have a good job since i was 18, but i wasn’t very good with finances, and this just caught up to me. I just got a new job which is paying me well so i can afford living even with this debt, but it would be absurd to not try to pay it all because my interest rates are absurd. In my financial life, i made some loans. Some because of emergencies (my mother needed a surgery and i got some money to pay for it, i bought an apartment, etc), and others because i was dumb (hey, i’m traveling, let’s just get this money to have fun).
Right now, i’m sitting on something like this:

Making about R$7.600 a month in cash (taxes already deduced)

R$ 768 on FGTS (That’s a government fund from which i can tap every 2 years to pay for part of my apartment)

An additional yearly bonus of about R$ 18.000

- Then these are my debts

R$ 1.303 monthly for my apartment (That’s a 20 year payment with interest rates of 0,64%/month)

R$ 1.844 monthly in loan #1 (3 year payment, 2.3% monthly)

R$ 560 monthly in loan #2 (3 year payment, 2.0% monthly)

- Also my monthly expenses

R$ 500 in gas/ public transportation (work + just hanging out, but 90% work)

R$ 400 in groceries

R$ 700 in bills (electricity, internet, water, gas, sister’s health plan and education)

R$ 250 in recreation

So, monthly, after this, i have about R$2.043 left. Which could be R$4.447 have i not made loan 1 and 2

I don’t have any credit card debt, and i’m willing to spend as much as i can from this money to erase my debts as soon as possible.

I don’t know if that’s how it works outside of Brazil, but i get a discount if i pay my debt as soon as i can. (For example, i’ll pay R$ 560 every month to one of my loans, but if i pay one of the last payments, it costs me R$ 250).

My current plan is to get a different type of loan 3 months from now (It’s one associated with my job, but i need at least one year of experience to ask for it). This loan can be paid in up to 72 months and has an interest rate of 1% per month. Then i’ll use that bonus of mine every year to chip away whis debt, besides paying a bit more every month with that spare cash. Once i’m free from these loans, my plan is to start saving every month some money to chip away my apartment debt (as i said, i can pay for some of it in advance every 2 years, and i’m planning to use some cash besides that government fund).

My question is: Is there a more intelligent way to do this? Am i missing something? Any suggestions? Once again, i know i’ve been dumb. Just trying to figure out the best way to get back on tracks. Thanks in advance!",finance
personalfinance,How do I approach paying off my student loans?,"I graduated May 2018 and moved to a new city August 2018 to start a paid three month internship. The internship ended in December 2018, which is when my grace period for my student loans ended. OSLA emailed me and told me that I need to pay $422 and I called them and told that I was searching for a job and couldn't pay it. I applied for the income-driven repayment plan and I was told that I did not have to start payments on my loans until December 2019.

&amp;#x200B;

I have now found a temporary six month job that pays $18/hr, and I would like to start making payments. One of the customer service rep from OSLA told me to start paying off the loan with the highest interest rate because my payments will be much higher starting December 2019. Should I do that or should I do the snowball method? I have $43,000 in student loan debt. I really need advice because I don't want my minimum payments to be like $600 or whatever.

I will net about $60k. My income is $40,000/yr and have $153 in collections. My credit score is 580 and I currently owe the IRS \~$1000 and a hospital $1500.

My car is a rust bucket that I purchased a few years ago at an 18% interest rate and pay in total about $550 a month and still have a $7200 balance

Here is what I am planning with the money so far.

I refuse to spend 7 grand on my car a barely driving 2010 Corolla. I will be making superficial fixes and selling it for as much as I can, eating the difference. In total vehicle expenses with not exceed $10. At the tail end of all this my goal is to have a car that is payed off and will be reliable for the foreseeable future.

I would like to purchase a property with my VA loan, but will need to raise my score to get a good interest rate. I am thinking of renting an apartment for about a year so I could focus on my score. However a one BR Apt here in an area where I will feel safe will cost about $1200/mo, and that is money down the drain.

Finally I will  use about 5K on some wants (A good bed and a decent computer are the big ones). With what is left I would like to invest half and save half. I will also pull the trigger with my brother and mother at starting a business.

I would like some advice on all this thought. How does my plan sound? What would you do differently? I have never had this much money before and dont want to waste this opportunity that was given to me. Thanks for your time in reading all this.",finance
personalfinance,26 and stuck between a rock and a hard place. Torn between a dream job and a new better paying job.,"Currently working in TN making 43k. The beauty is that there is no state income tax, the bad is that sales tax is ~10%. The area is amazing, my job is amazing, and the people I work with are amazing. The problem being is I’m living paycheck to paycheck due to having a good deal of student loans. I recently refinanced my loans to get the interest rate down, variable to fixed, and to shorten the payback period. Another issue is I’ve currently only been at my job for 2 months but the stress of paying bills is killing me because I’m not saving much. 

I was recently offered a position back in my home state of MD for $20k more. Similar job title. Close to family and old friends. The perks seems good enough and I would have more financial stability.

Throwaway account. I'm in a situation and need some advice on how to get me out of the debt I am in the fastest. A little overview of why I am seeking this. I'm 31 and feel like my time is running out. I've been dating my girlfriend for 2 years now and we both have some debt, but one day I would love to propose to her and also be able to afford to get a house in the near future 2-4 years is my time frame.

&amp;#x200B;

I currently put 3% towards 401K with 50% match.

I currently have $1500 in savings. I am able to put anywhere between $0-$150 a paycheck into my savings. I am paid Bi-Monthly (15th and last business day of the month) so my paychecks are either 80, 88, or 96 hours.

&amp;#x200B;

My monthly bills add up to a little over $1000. My total debt/Minimum payments are as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

College Loan 1: $7556/$217 Per month

Credit Card 1: $1113/$42 Per Month

Credit Card 2: $1576/$46 Per Month

Credit Card 3: 670.97/$27 Per Month

Loan 1: $3400/$100 Per Month

Phone: $950/$40 Per Month

Rent: $372 Per Month

Electric: $100 Per Month Currently

TV/Internet: $55

Other Expenses: $20-$40 per pay go into a vacation jar (planned a trip in October for Florida and using this money to pay for it)

I usually save myself $400 to spend after all my bills and moving X amount over to savings. This is for groceries, gas, and other expenses like eating out (which I desperately need to cut back on.)

My question is should I be focusing on paying down my higher interest rate credit cards, build up my savings a bit and then pay them down, getting another loan with 0% interest out to pay off all the credit cards with high interest?

20k in car debt (2% interest rate)

40k in student loans (\~6.5% interest rate). Because of my job, I qualify for the 10 year loan forgiveness program and have about 8 years left on it. I'm on a salary based repayment plan and I make 47k per year so my current payments are pretty cheap (\~210/month), but most of that is going toward interest and very little is going toward the actual principle.

Does it make any sense to pull the money out and pay off any or all of my debt even though it will be taxed and possibly subject to a 10% penalty for taking it out before I'm 59 (not completely positive about the penalty, still looking into it). 

Would I save more money continuing with the 10 year loan forgiveness program, rather than paying it off early? 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, what should I be doing with the money that is not going toward my debt? I'm in my early 30's, not married, no kids, and no mortgage because I currently rent.

personalfinance,Logistics of wedding savings,"GF \[25\] and I \[33\] are recently engaged. We've discussed financing for the wedding, including contributions from her parents and mine. We're planning for September / October of next year, so we've got plenty of time to save. We've worked together to come up with a funding plan that should suffice nicely if we keep our spending in check. I put in X amount each month, she puts in Y, tax refunds and work bonuses go into the fund at Z%, etc. The question now is logistics. 

We've both agreed that having everything together in one place would be preferable and that both of us having access is important. We don't have a joint bank account yet and I'm not sure we will for a while (she really likes her bank, I really like mine). We've looked into maybe doing online banking with someone that gives us a good interest rate (2+%). We both have Discover cards and like the savings account they offer but it only allows for a certain number of transactions a month which seems limiting. 

We're both accountants, so we're great at budgeting and tracking. We're looking more for convenience and transparency. I want us to be able to see how much each of us is contributing and how much each element of the wedding costs. I feel like splitting things / alternating purchases / having one person pay and the other reimburse a portion distorts your perception of how much you're really spending and might lead to some scope creep.

For those of you that have gone through the process, how did you make it work?   


Clarification: This is not a topic about advice for wedding budgeting. We have an idea of what we want to spend already. Every discussion I've seen on that topic ends up with 30+% of people being smug about having a courthouse / super low budget wedding, 30+% posting a dollar amount and getting frantic comments from people judging them for spending that much, and 20+% talking about how they received help from family / some insider connection from a friend / free access to \_\_ that simply doesn't apply to most people.

computers,Dell Tech Support Hell - Update,"First off, Dell designs great machines. They just can't fix them. 

I run a Dell Inspiron 7577 with a decent processor and awesome graphics card.

7 months into my ownership of the device, it starts thermal throttling. I'm talking CPU temp at 60 degrees Celsius at idle, and spikes to 100 degrees Celsius under load. That's not good.

Naturally, I do everything within my power to fix it. I get a cooling pad (only helps idle temp, but under load it still spikes to 100)

I updated the bios, cleaned the fans, disabled in game overlays, messed around with Nvidia control panel, lowered the maximum processor state, undervolted my CPU, did a complete rollback and reinstall of my graphics drivers, and did a factory reset on the computer. Nothing helped.

I contacted Costco (got it from them) to request a replacement under warranty. I suspected it was a hardware problem and I was only familiar with software.

They said they'd transfer me to Dell. I thought... Oh no. Read tech support reviews from them and you'll know why.

I get transferred to a man and this is how it goes.

He asks to remotely control my computer and I let him. He immediately goes to Dell's website and starts looking for a BIOS update. I said: ""OH, I already updated the BIOS.""

He then proceeds to tell me that he'll handle it, and it'll work. He puts in a model number, and the wrong computer pops up.

Me: that's the wrong computer model. 

Him: I'll handle it sir, thank you.

He proceeds to download a BIOS update for the wrong computer. He runs it, and an error message pops up, informing him that it is the wrong BIOS for the computer. HE THEN TRIES TO RUN IT 4 MORE TIMES. He even opens the command prompt and tries to force it to run.

Me: it's the wrong computer. I have an Inspiron 7577, not a two-in-one.

Him: OK...

He goes back to Dell's website and clicks ""detect my pc"". After 45 minutes of this show he downloads the right driver, only to be informed that my BIOS is already up to date.

At this point I'm starting to lose my patience. This man is completely incompetent but he doesn't know it.

Then he informs me he's done all he can do and I'm going to have to send my system in for repairs. I'm like: SERIOUSLY?? YOU DID ONE THING. 

My name is Tanner. Some time later, I get an email addressed to ""Panner"" explaining that they have received my system and will begin repairs on it right away.

I face-palm.

It is now on its way back, and knowing them, they probably did a standard tune up, ran a surface level stress test, and ""fixed"" the problem. I expect to receive my computer back with the exact same problem, and then maybe I'll finally get my replacement.

I can't believe you can have such incompetent people in charge of tech support.

I'll post updates as they come.

UPDATE:

I'm pissed. Reviewed the tracking info for my laptop, and was informed that it was being sent back to sender after arriving in my city. I called FedEx and asked why, they said the specified address didn't exist and the sender provided no contact info to contact me and verify the address.

I called Dell, livid. To clarify, I'm a college student, and since I sent my laptop away I've been forced to do my homework on my phone. Imagine writing a 5 page essay with your thumbs.

Anyways, I demanded to know what happened, and why they hadn't provided fedex with my info so they could contact me. Turns out the incompetent tech support agent I talked to earlier not only got my name wrong, but my entire address.

They said they'd send it back to me as soon as it reached them.

I am pissed.

personalfinance,Life after college,"Hello all, 
First time poster here so if I'm missing anything, please let me know. I am currently in my third year of college in CA and am expecting to graduate in December of 2020 meaning I have 3 semesters after this current one. I'm majoring in Civil Engineering.  I have secured a summer internship which pays $20 an hour for 50 hours a week. it should run around 12 weeks. Recently my friend signed with a company for $70,000 before taxes after graduation since he is a senior so I'm expecting a little less since he is living in LA area and I'm living in the central valley or Bay Area of CA. I was wondering what appropriate steps would I need to take after graduation to become financially stable. In particular in paying off my student loans. I currently have 13,500 in student debt with an interest rate of 4.5% and I'm hoping it doesnt rise anymore since I dont plan on taking out another loan. I also dont have any credit cards or form of credit so how can i start building that. Thank you",finance

personalfinance,Should we consider refinancing our 5.25% 30-year fixed-rate mortgage?,"We were cash poor when we purchased our home a couple years ago and also might have chosen a bad no-PMI option. I'm curious what r/personalfinance thinks about refinancing in our situation:

- 30-year fixed-rate loan, 5.25% rate
- Credit score ~765
- ~$107,000 owed
- Current monthly payment ~$785, we usually pay extra, $1100-1300 total each month. About $6000 of extra principal paid in the first two years. 
- The high interest rate is due to low cash on hand for down payment when we purchased + a no-PMI option I chose (and now regret since we are paying down more quickly than scheduled).

Six or nine months ago I talked through with an agent the possibility of refinancing. He promised that switching to a 15-year fixed-rate at the then-lowest interest available (~4.385% iirc) would save us a bunch of money, but he couldn't demonstrate that with written documentation – and I'm not inclined to trust salesmen if they can't back up their claims. Once I saw the cost of refinancing would be ~$6000, I got sticker shock (I was expecting half that for some reason) and just didn't move forward. 

I've noticed that interest rates have dropped further since then. How can I figure out if it's a good move for us to refinance or better to just keep paying a few hundred above the minimum on our not-so-great loan?",finance
Banking,Double refunded 2k$ by a major electronics company - not sure what else to do from here...,"On March 18th, I ordered some camera gear from a major retailer. In short, they kept messing up my billing address after several email and phone communications, so I decided to simply cancel the order and buy somewhere else. 

On Saturday, I login to my banking and notice a similar refund for around the same price. I immediately called the major retailer to tell them that they’d refunded me twice. Honestly, I was already pretty fed up with them because my transactions with them kept messing up due to the billing situation earlier, and I’d thought I was done with them at this point. Anyways, the rep starts getting mad at me because “there was only one refund”. After a few minutes of arguing, I even emailed them and simply got a “your order has already been cancelled and refunded” type of message. 

I called my bank thinking that it could be an issue with them, but nope, it was really the merchant who refunded me twice for different amounts and for what looked like different purchases. The banking rep told me that this kind of stuff does happen VERY rarely, and that I should hold off until Thursday just to make sure they won’t reverse the refund, but that he’d even gone through something similar and ended up being able to keep the money. (Not sure if he was just bsing)


I’m a little hesitant because this purchase and double refund was for 2,000$+.


TLDR; refunded twice by merch for 2k/ea, was only supposed to be once. Merch basically told me to stop calling them about it as they only saw one refund. Bank says to hold off till Thursday and money is pretty much mine. I’m worried af.


Advice?? 

Edit 1: 

Sent this to the company this morning and got a response as follows

“I’m writing to you again because another refund seems to have appeared on my credit card. It doesn’t show who it’s from, but runs roughly around the same as the amount given back to me by your company. I called on Friday or Saturday and the rep wasn’t very helpful but told me that I wasn’t double refunded (I don’t think that he even checked). I’m just sorting out my finances and want to make sure that you guys only refunded me what I was due. I just don’t want a nasty chargeback or anything unexpected. Please let me know ASAP. “ - my email


Their response: 
“Thank you for contacting the Customer Service Department at B&amp;H Photo Video and Pro Audio.


Your card was not charged for this order. We only placed a Pending authorization on your card at the time of purchase.

(We have not issued any refunds to your card). 


Please let us know if you require any further assistance. “

Edit 2:

I've sent the following AGAIN to them:

""Hi B&amp;H,

Okay - so just to confirm; I will not be charged back or receive a communication in regards to any amounts owing due to a billing issue on your end?

I'm sorry that I'm being so thorough about this, just trying to make sure that everything's good.

Thanks,""

Got this response this AM from them:

“Hello , my name is Izzy:

That is correct.

Edit 3:

personalfinance,Taking out a Student Loan for 19/20 School Year,"Hey Reddit, I want some perspectives on a potential plan I might have for next year.  


A little background info on myself, I am a rising senior in college majoring in Computer Science and Statistics. I have a pretty good resume built up, so I am confident in my ability to secure a job after graduating. Even if I don't get a lucrative high paying software job quickly, I am currently employed and could continue working there. Currently I live at home with my parents where my living expenses are minimal, however I would really like to live closer to campus my senior year.   


Now to the plan. Basically I am looking to take out a $10,800 student loan which is what I estimate my living expenses (rent, utilities, food, etc.) will cost if I decide to move out. This would be a $5,500 subsidized loan and a $5,300 unsubsidized loan. According to the government provided student loan calculator, worst case scenario that loan becomes $13,726 after 10 years, or $115 a month after graduation. During the school year I will continue to work and save up money. Since the federal loan payments would start in May 2020, if I start to save $830 a month I would be able to pay off that loan right away and be done with it. This comes out to $208 a week, which is below my current weekly income of $250. This leaves me with $42 a week in savings which comes out to about $2000 in year. I would use these savings for extra expenses like tickets, car repair, or the occasional beer money. In theory I believe that I could manage this loan responsibly, however I would like to get some insight on flaws in my plan and overall if the risks could be worth it.

personalfinance,Should I max-out 401(k) and withdrawal whenever I need money?,"Hi,

I am about to graduate and I am lucky enough to be hired by a company that matches 50% of my contribution. I would need to contribute around 19k to max-out 401(k) and my state+federal tax rate is around 32%. So theoretically, if I don't contribute to 401(k) at all, I would take home 12.9k. And if I max-out 401(k) and withdraw immediately after the company vested and take the early withdrawal penalty. I would receive (19k+9.5k)\*0.68\*0.9= 17.4k. That is a 35% return, risk free! It sounds too good to be true.

I understand that one downside of maxing out 401(k) is that you will take a 10% penalty if you withdraw before 59.5. However, it seems you will still receive more money even if you do early withdrawal. So why shouldn't everyone simply max-out 401(k) and treat it as a saving account that automatically match 35% of your post-tax deposit?",finance

personalfinance,What is wrong with my federal tax withholdings?,"My wife and I got hit with a good size tax bill last year.  I know a lot of people did, but she also had a job change last year that might be driving this.  We have no children, had the same exemptions for years, always paid enough in and even had a small refund each year.  Below are the highlights of my situation:

\- I make $50,000 per year.  I claimed 0 and had federal withholdings of $4,421 (about $170/paycheck bi-weekly).

\- My wife made $123,464 during the year.

\- At her previous job (worked through end of May 2018 and made $52,433 during the first five months) she claimed 2 and had federal withholdings of $8,972 (about $710/paycheck - she had a bonus in there which was taxed higher).

\- Here's where I think the problem is.  From June through end of the year at her new job she made $71,031, and while still claiming 2, they only took out $9,189.  So while making nearly $20,000 more, they only took out an extra couple hundred dollars.

At the recommendation of our tax person we changed her exemptions this year to 0, as we were told that would completly offest it and we would not be paying in at the end of the year.  But here's the rub, after changing her exemptions to 0, they're taking out $547/paycheck, while at 2 they were taking out $526 (it was set up for 2 + $50 as I knew we were going  to be a little short, just not AS short as we were).

&amp;#x200B;

So, what is going on here?  At her old job with claiming 2 (least withholdings) they were taking out $720/paycheck.  At her new job while claiming 0 (most withholdings) they're taking out $547...  At this rate we will fall substantially short again.  After the married $24,000 deduction our taxable income is about $150,000. putting us in the 22% tax bracket.  Her HR department checked and rechecked today and they said they are absolutely pulling it out correctly.  We live in the U.S.  Her old employer was U.S. based, but she now works remotely for a Canadian company (if that matters).

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't see how in the world this is anything but how they are withholding federal taxes.  For the last several years she claimed 2, I claimed 0, and we still got money back.  Now at 0 and 0, we're pacing for only about $19,000 withheld, which will put us several thousand short again.  We need to get up to about $25,000 paid in to avoid taxes and penalties.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this just the way it is now with the U.S. tax system?  I've heard about all the issues with employers no longer withholding enough.  Am I expected to put all our exemptions at 0 and then go above and beyond to figure out how much additional to take out each paycheck?  Do I really need to do 0 on mine and 0 + $200 on hers just to make it equal out?  I was always under the impression that putting everything at 0 would lead you to not pay in at tax time and likely receive a refund as you would be over-taxed throughout the year.

My husband and I own a 3 bedroom townhouse in the outskirts of the GTA.

The house is worth an estimated $380 000. With prices only going up. We originally paid $283 000 with 5% down. Over a 25 year amortization. We pay bi-weekly so we're already down to a 17 years 2 months amortization period. 

We've been in the house for 5 years. We'll owe: $229,731.93 on their mortgage renewal date. Our current interest rate is 2.89%

We have two options we're considering: 

-       4 year closed fixed term 3.14%

-       5 year closed/fixed term 3.39%


4 year term/17 years 2 month amortization- payments of $664.39 bi-weekly (plus property taxes) with a final balance of: 186,275.67

5 year term/ 17 years 2 month amortization- payments of $677.32 bi-weekly (plus property taxes) with a final balance of: 175,542.36


Additionally we currently have a $40 000 personal loan (will be $38 000 on renewal date), which is currently at 9.52% interest (ouch). The primary reason we are going with this lender is we can lower the interest and roll it into a mortgage segment, so it's secured against the house at the lower 3.14% rate for a 4 year term/ 5 year amortization. It rolls into a line of credit after the 4 years. Bi monthly payments of 361.32. 

The personal loan helped to fix a serious issue with the house, and it was the only option at the time.

&amp;#x200B;

The new position I would be getting is a lead position where they have offered me $4064 a month, a 4.2% increase. Of course I will be negotiating, my question is how much is too much? I would prefer to be at the top of my possible range, maxing at $4400 a month. A 10% increase would be at $4332 a month. Seeing as how I have never had a raise before with this org, how likely would it be that I would be able to negotiate to the top end of the introductory range? The position itself maxes at around $5400, but I am not sure how I would get raises to get there at this point.

personalfinance,Refinancing my car soon because I got an awful interest rate when I first got it.,"I have a 19.67% interest rate on my car loan. I have had the car for a year now and made all of my payments on time. My credit was awful when I first got it (420 or so), now I'm sitting at a 607 TransUnion and 635 Equifax, according to Credit Karma anyway. My credit card utilization is a bit high right now (86%) on a total of $800 credit limit between 2 cards. I am going to be paying these off completely in the next month or so. I expect that to raise my credit up a bit more, but not sure how much. 

Would paying off that debt effect my score enough to warrant waiting to refinance my car? Or am I better off just doing it now. I have yet to call lenders because I don't want a hard inquiry just yet. I am also curious what kind of interest rate I can expect to get with my current score? 

I was told by someone I should get a 5 year loan instead of 6, and that will keep my payment roughly the same but I pay back less, which makes sense, but $325 per month car payment is a bit rough, so I'd rather pay more overall (longer life of the loan) than have to stretch my paychecks out. I also do not intend to let the loan live for 5 years anyway. I am going to pay it off completely ASAP, hopefully within the next year or 2.

Long post, hopefully all the info you guys need to steer me in the right direction is there.

personalfinance,I'm a student who made around $1600 (after expenses) in 2018 as an independent contractor. Why am I still having to pay $227,"Hi, so I'm a 24y/o law student and worked as an independent contractor doing legal work. I received my 1099-misc and I earned around $2000, but after my deducted expenses it's around $1600. My expenses were primary mileage and court fees. 

I'm using TurboTax to file, and they calculated that I need to pay $227 in federal taxes. (My state doesn't have state taxes). I'm just surprised I have to pay anything given that the standard federal deduction is $12,000 and I made significantly less than that. 

For previous years, I've always been an employee and had a W-2. Typically I get a full refund because I usually only make a couple thousand.

I have often wondered if pix2pix could be used for something like this.

personalfinance,Help? Filing Taxes After A 'Withholding Compliance' Letter,"Hi Reddit.  (anon account, etc.)  

I know this will sound dumb but I don't know where to turn.  

I have always paid my taxes.  I've worked for the same (very large) company for ten years and they've always taken Federal, and then State taxes after I moved, from my paycheck.  I was working away blissfully until I received a notification from my employer that the IRS is changing my claims with a ""withholding compliance"" letter.  I read through it and several posts online but I wasn't sure how it applied to me...

Until I realized you had to pay AND THEN ""file"" your taxes.  And that's when I realized the disconnect.  Please don't flame because I've just started to find out about all this.  Apparently, you have to ""pay"" your taxes again at the end of the year even after ""paying"" them to your company.  For years I've heard co-workers talk about ""getting their refund"" but I've always kind of ignored it because I felt like they were lying and I didn't want any part of it.  One co-worker claims 10 on his W2 but only has 3 kids.  He also claims his house and his car and his cell phone and his gas.  And that's just one person I know.  Others write off their house or their rent and their moving expenses or their insurance.  Some even their food.  I just don't understand how my rent should be a ""write off"".  

I've always felt like ""filing your taxes"" meant getting away with any lie the IRS would believe, but I've recently learned I was the one in the wrong.  My dad used to write everything off until the IRS showed up with guns pointed at my mom.  I was too young to recall everything but I know I was terrified when it happened.  My mom still talks about when she found out about ""their"" other house because the IRS was claiming taxes on it.  

I moved to GA from NV in 2016 and I support my mom back home.  It's hard because she always needs more since she's disabled and unemployed.  I make ~$76k/year.  I send ~$14k/year to my mom.  I receive ~$24k/year after taxes and 401k (~$5k/year).  How can I owe the IRS so much when I pay them so much?  I am massively--MAAASSIVELY--in credit card debit because I need to make ends meet (nearly $50k).  I just downloaded my W4 from this year and my company is claiming ~$89k paid to me.  I'm not sure what's up or down at this point, but I bet I owe GA a lot of money too that I don't even know about.  

What should I do?  I've called around and no private tax preparer wants to help.  I've canceled so much.  I pay $1,100 for rent, $100 for power and ~$75 for gas for my car.  I've cut my insurance from ""OMG NEVER CANCEL THIS CRAZY GRANFATHERED PLAN"" down to state minimums.  I just bought at least a year's worth of TP from Costco for $16...

What do I need to do to save myself from the IRS?  Thanks as always Reddit.

personalfinance,"18 year old wondering about a $6,399 motorcycle loan","I live in an area that is warm enough to commute by motorcycle ~9 months out of the year. Last year riding my motorcycle, I paid only $19 a month on insurance and $60 a month on gas. However, my motorcycle was very old and I had to replace parts on it constantly, so I sold it last month. Now, I would like to buy myself a new motorcycle from a dealership for $6,399. I have $1,200 I'm able to use as a down payment. 

I got multiple insurance quotes for the bike, and they are all around $40 a month. If I were to get this bike, I would un-insure my car, and keep it on my property, saving me a couple hundred a month. 

(All of these numbers in the next paragraph are monthly costs)

Currently, I'm working full time and making between $1500 and $1700 a month after taxes. I pay no rent, but I do pay $174 in insurance, and around $110 in gas for my car. I usually spend anywhere between $100 and $150 for food, and another $100 for other things I might need. I also put $125 into my IRA.

I'm very new to loans/auto financing, and I'm just wondering what it would look like if I, an 18 year old with no credit, were to make payments on a 6 and a half thousand dollar bike.

(2) Federal Student Loan - $16,000, $250/month, ~3% interest
(3) Car Loan - $20,000, $350/month, ~3% interest

worldpolitics,"Russian ""missile trains"" as a response to the US withdrawal from the INF Treaty","At the meeting of the «Valdai» International Discussion Club in October 2017, Russian President Vladimir Putin, referring to Russia's retaliatory steps toward the US withdrawal from the INF Treaty, stated that from Russia «the respond will be instant, I want to say and warn about this, instant and mirror respond». V. Putin stressed that Russia is keeping its commitments «as long as the American partners comply with the terms of the previous agreements».

As it is known, the successes of the USSR in missile technologies prompted the United States to impose in 1987 the General Secretary of the CPSU, Mikhail Gorbachev, an agreement on their limitations. In addition to them, Washington didn’t like the «Molodets» ballistic missile railway complex, which was put into service on November 28, 1987. Because the strategic missiles with nuclear warheads «rolling around» by rail were quite difficult to distinguish from simple passenger or freight trains, but it was even more difficult to resist the launch of the missiles. It should be noted that by the end of 1989, a total of 56 launchers were deployed in the territory of the RSFSR and the Ukrainian SSR.

The second reason for «dislike» for the Russian ballistic missile railway complexes was purely technical. The fact is that at that time, the US experts understood their problems with the development of modern intercontinental ballistic missiles, and indeed with some military developments. For example, attempts to create an analogue of the «Molodets» by specialists from «Boeing», «Martin Marietta», «Westinghouse Marine Division» and «St. Louis Refrigerator Car Company» did not succeed. Also, the subsequent collapse of the USSR in 1991 contributed to a change in the views of the Pentagon’s leadership on such projects, which resulted in their stopping. And an important reason was also the high cost of the projects and complexity in construction.

However, the collapse of the USSR directly affected the fate of the «Molodets» ballistic missile railway complex. First of all, the rockets that were used by the «Molodets» were produced at the plant, which remained on the territory of Ukraine. Secondly, ballistic missile railway complexes that were on duty in Ukraine were removed from it since 1992 and sent for recycling. Thirdly, the two treaties on the reduction of strategic offensive arms, signed at the time by Gorbachev and Yeltsin, first limited the movement of the «Molodets» through the territory of Russia, and then completely completed his combat duty.

Therefore, in our days, against the background of the already complicated relations between the USA and Russia, the government of V. Putin decided not to try to restore the project «Molodets», but to immediately develop a modern version – «Barguzin». According to the tactical and technical requirements issued by the Ministry of Defense of Russia to the Moscow Institute of Heating Engineering, the new ballistic missile railway complex should have included cars that are indistinguishable from standard refrigerator cars not only in terms of dimensions, but also in terms of weights. The fact is that to ensure the combat duty of the «Molodets» ballistic missile railway complex, the railroad workers had to take measures to strengthen the railway lines, and this flew into a large penny. Therefore, the new launch complex with a missile had to fit into the specified parameters in order not to carry out additional costly measures. Consequently, it was necessary to solve the main issue - to choose the appropriate rocket.

The RS-24 with a weight of 49 tons was selected as a missile (it has only 4 warheads, but the «Barguzin» has twice as many launchers, and the RS-24 warheads are able to overcome existing and advanced missile defense systems), which allowed the base of a standard freight wagon with a carrying capacity of up to 68 tons. Thus, the new ballistic missile railway complex was not only easier, but also became truly indistinguishable for all types of air and space intelligence of a potential enemy. So, one can undoubtedly consider «Barguzin» ballistic missile railway complex as yet another hypersonic response to NATO and US strategists.

Why did the United States insist on the destruction of the «Well done» and now are very unhappy with the «Barguzin»? It is all about the concept of war: if Russia always plays from defense (retaliatory strike), then the US military doctrine is always attacking (preventive disarming strike). Therefore, against such an attacking strategy, «missile trains» is a very good «antidote», since they cannot be destroyed with an accurate strike, and in response to the aggression, «Yars» missiles will arrive at the exact address of the aggressor.

It should be recalled here that on February 1, 2019, the US president Donald Trump, in his official statement, announced that the United States will begin the process of withdrawing from the INF Treaty on February 2. Also, D. Trump blamed Russia for allegedly «violating the treaty with impunity, secretly developing and deploying a banned rocket system that poses a threat to US allies and American troops outside the US», but there was no evidence provided, but only bearing no meaning, conjectures and conjectures of the American government.

Currently, work on the «Barguzin» complex has been suspended, but the US withdrawal from the INF Treaty can give this project the green light - and then powerful and destructive «rocket trains» will travel along the Russian railways, ready to give an «instant and mirror response» to the phenomena representing a threat to the security of the Russian Federation.",energy
worldpolitics,The US recognized Russian Missile Cruisers as the Deadliest in the World,"The famous American information and analytical publication ""The National Interest"" praised the Russian missile cruisers ""Peter the Great"", ""Admiral Nakhimov"", ""Kirov"" and ""Admiral Lazarev"" (of the Orlan project). According to the authors of the material, these combat ships are among the most deadly in the world and are not inferior in their firepower to Western opponents.

Military experts from the United States say that these surface ships have become a serious means of confrontation for the “status quo” in the Asia-Pacific region between the leading world powers. In the course of last year’s congratulations to servicemen, shipbuilders, engineers and veterans on the Day of the Russian Navy, Defense Minister of the Russian Federation Army General Sergei Shoigu recalled that the Russian navy was over three hundred years old. Also, the defense minister said that the fleet, as before, ""was and remains a symbol of the power of the Russian Federation and serves as a reliable pillar of its national security.""

Moreover, Sergei Shoigu in early March 2019 reported that the Russian Navy in 2019 will receive new ships: the frigate “Admiral of the Katasonov Navy”, the corvette “Gremyashchyi”, the large landing ship “Peter Morgunov”, small missile ships “Mercury” and “ Ingushetia "", patrol ship ""Dmitry Rogachev. He also spoke about two new nuclear and one diesel submarines, which will also strengthen the Russian fleet. In addition, 11 ships and vessels will pass through factory repair.

In «The National Interest», journalists from the United States noted the large size of Russian missile cruisers, as well as their high firepower. As an example, they cited ships of the type ""Kirov"" of project 1144, which are up to 250 meters long and at the same time reach speeds of up to 32 sea knots. Such excellent speed characteristics are provided through the use of a combined nuclear-steam power plant.

Oleg Ponomarenko, a military expert of the Russian Center for Strategic Conjuncture, agreed with the assessment of Western experts in relation to these missile cruisers and noted that ""their lethality is correct.""

«NI» did not forget to mention that in the near future, the Russian Navy cruisers «Peter the Great» and «Admiral Nakhimov» will receive the latest Russian hypersonic anti-ship missiles «Zircon». Modern weapons will significantly increase the combat capabilities and firepower of these ships, since the «Zircon» has a tremendous speed of up to 8 mach. It should be recalled that the latest tests of the new cruise missile on December 10, 2018 proved its enormous potential. The main feature of the «Zircon» is the impossibility of its interception by modern anti-missile and air defense systems.

It can be concluded that due to its unique characteristics, regular modernization and the newest weapon system, Russian cruisers will continue to be the most deadly warships and will continue to ensure the protection of Russia's state interests in the world arena.",energy

On top of this, this year my previously well-paying job started shutting down, and now I’m making about $40k a year as opposed to the $55k I was making this time last year. 

I have tried desperately to find something else, but I was considered overpaid for a young adult in my field (laboratory) with no degree. I have put out hundreds of applications and only gotten calls back for junk sales positions. I also am going to school full time, so I have very little free time. 


I’ve just gone back to school, and I would like to graduate free from cc debt so my student loans (thankfully only for last two years as I can pay my associates out of pocket) don’t hurt so much.

personalfinance,Inherited $700K 3 years ago. Am I doing the most with my money?,"My mom passed when I was a young woman (24) and due to a falling out with my father, wrote everything in her estate to me (I'm an only child). I got the life insurance, the house, etc. I sold the house a year later. My father came out well too, he got her pension and many bank accounts. The total cash sum I ended up with was about $700K. Now I am 28 and I have barely touched that money. I'm at a top MBA program on a full ride and I've used about $40K for living and travel expenses. I have a $120K job lined up (with $20K additional bonuses) and plan on renting (not buying.. someone please advise whether this is a dumb decision) so don't see any reason that I'll be touching these funds in the near future. None of my friends know my financial situation. They know I have some money from inheritance but not the actual amount. Only my boyfriend of 3 years knows.

I have the bulk of this money ($550K) invested with my family financial advisor. I told him I'm cautious with money so he invested accordingly. It seems to do fairly well and the accounts earned about $50K last year and $30K this year. They held strong with the economy took a dip back in December.

I have about $120K in my personal bank account (citi gold) that I use for personal expenses while I'm in school. I wonder if there is a better place to hold this money with a better interest rate. I think my current rate is less than 1%. I've been spending a LOT recently since I'm in my last semester of MBA (if you have an MBA you know that this is the time everyone travels and parties) so I've been traveling a lot and splurging on restaurants. I will probably spend another $5K on travel before I start work and possibly $20K on a new car (I need a 4-wheel drive for where I'm moving). I also donate about $200 a month to various charities.

I have a retirement account that only has about $10K in it. I plan on putting my max salary deduction into this plan when I start work.

I'm moving to a mid-size city in the US where houses will probably cost me \~$1800 for a nice room. I plan on sharing a 3 br house with a friend from undergrad so we're looking at splitting something that costs about $3400. I also want to get a dog since I think my lifestyle, funds, and work hours will make it an ideal time.

Lastly, is there someone whose job it is to advise people on liquid assets? I really feel like I have no idea what I'm doing and may be missing out on valuable investment opportunities.

Also, my grandfather (mother's father) recently passed away so I'm expecting a small inheritance from him shortly too.

I fully realize I am playing life on ""easy"" mode, but trust me, I'd rather have my mom.

**tl;dr: Inherited 700K, put most of it with my financial planner who grows in modestly. Keep some of it in the bank. Should I be doing something differently?**",finance

personalfinance,Question about estimated taxes,"When I got married, I changed my W4 to select married. Like an idiot, I also put a ""1"" in the box that says I can claim my spouse as a dependent or she wasn't working. I got hit hard on my taxes last year and was assessed an underpayment penalty. I own all of that, and I've settled with the IRS for 2018.

Now for 2019 - I've corrected my W4 with my employer but they still haven't changed the withholdings. I know this because my paycheck has been the same and my federal tax line is the same. I'm currently working on this.

What I want to do in the meantime is pay the IRS for the difference in what I owe. I was thinking of just looking at how much federal tax I paid before the W4 switch to what I'm paying now, multiplying by the number of paychecks so far this year, and sending them a payment for roughly that amount.

Does that sound like a good idea? Any advice appreciated.

Thanks.",finance
personalfinance,(UK) I've got £40k and I don't know what to do with it.,"As a bit of back story, my dad died when I was 13 back in 2011. He had good life insurance and had a good job and so was able to leave my mum with a nice amount of money. My mum put £35K of it into a savings account under my name seeing as it had the better interest rate. I'm now 21 and so the interest rate is no good (0.5% p.a.), so my mum basically told me to move it to something better. Of course, this is the largest amount of money I've had to deal with and so I'm a bit lost.

One thing to note is that I don't need the money. I'm lucky enough to be going into a job straight out of uni with a starting salary of £65k, and right now I'm living off of money I earned in an internship last summer. So this money can stay as savings for the foreseeable future.

I'm open to the idea of investing it, or if people think it'll be better off in a savings account somewhere then that's what I'll look into.

Anyway, I want to do something sensible with the money so that it can be there if we need it in the future, but I also want it to be doing something for me in the meantime. Even if it's just a ""here's what I would do with it"", any advice would be welcome.

Thank you in advance!",finance

personalfinance,"[M] 22 interited $10,000 with more soon to come and I don't know what to do with most of it.","For background, my dad passed away few months  ago.  Dad left me just under $10,000. I don't know what to do with it, but I do know that I don't want to waste it.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll break down my current financial situation for you now.

&amp;#x200B;

I am an corporal in the United States Marine Corps. My net pay per month is $2,100 or $25,000 per year.  I'm on track to pick up sergeant in May.  At which point I'll take home about $2,500 per month or $30,000 per year. I have 16 months remaining on my current enlistment and I am considering reenlistment right now. I have no dependents and only a few expenses that I'll outline later.

&amp;#x200B;

I have $7,000 in debt $2,700 of which is a car loan that will be paid off at the end of this year the rest is the two credit cards I use.

&amp;#x200B;

My expenses are as follows (per month):

270 on car payment

330 on credit cards

140 on insurance

110 on phone

100 on internet

100 on home goods

roughly 80 on gas

I don't pay for food or rent. That is automatically taken out of my pay and was not included in the $2,100.

I pay over the minimum per month on my both my credit cards.  I didn't account for expenses like entertainment and clothes, but I don't spend in these areas often.

&amp;#x200B;

I burned through my savings handling my dad's funeral.  So I want to put $3,000 back into my Ally savings account. I know I could use the rest to pay off all my debt, but I don't really think that's the best option.  I'm not struggling to pay and my interest rates aren't high.

&amp;#x200B;

So realistically I have $7,000 and no idea what do with it. I will also be receiving money from life insurance and the sell of my dad's property, but that will most likely be several months from now.

personalfinance,Paying off Student Loans with 401k. Smart or not?,"I have a Parent Plus Student Loan that has an interest rate of 6% and a balance of about $5500. 
I am 26 years old and have worked full-time since I was 19 while always contributing the amount that was matched by the employer to my 401k. 
At this point, I can easily either take out a loan or withdraw $5500 from my 401k to pay off this parent plus loan but is that a smart decision?
I obviously do not want to withdraw the money as there are fees associated with that and I have no problem making the monthly payment.
With that in mind, I am leaning more towards taking a loan from my 401k however since I have not done this before I am hesitant. My understanding is that there will still be an interest rate but that I am technically paying myself that interest instead of the current loan holder. Also I am not sure what sets the interest rate.
If any of this makes sense, is it a smart move?

personalfinance,Continue to save or pay debt?,"A quick background on my family’s financial situation and curious how you would approach whether to stay the course and save or aggressively pay debt.

Financials:
Monthly take home - $8,600
After bills/living expenses we have roughly $1,200/left over.  

Savings:
Lower than we’d like maybe could survive 6 weeks if we both lost our jobs at the same time. (Wife’s job extremely secure, I work in finance so you never know but I’ve been here 4 years so i feel stable).  

My wife also has a pension and contributes 3% additional into a 403b, I put 8% into company matching 401k.

Debt:
A lot of dumb decisions when we were younger, but we haven’t added any debt in over 24 months; so we’ve completely reigned it in.

$7,800 @ 6.25%
$7,500 @ 6%
$9,400 @ 9%

Home Equity:
Conservatively we have around $275,000 in our home right now.  I can probably sell for between 530-550 and we owe around 250k. I’d rather not dip into the equity to pay off consumer debt although it’s not out of the question if interest rates continue to drop and I can get a decent refi. 

My major question with the type of equity i have in our home, would we be better served pushing that extra 1,000-1200 a month into our debt; or stay the course and continue to save until i have a full 6 months emergency fund (25k or so).",finance
personalfinance,Transfer 403b to Thrift Savings Plan,"I need some guidance. I currently have ~$21,000 in a 403b through AXA Equitable and ~$35,000 in the Ohio SERS (School Employees Retirement System) program. I have since left education and took a job with the federal government where I can contribute to a Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) and Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS). I was in education for seven years, so I am not vested in SERS.

I would like to consolidate my funds and transfer my 403b and SERS balance into my TSP. I verified this is possible by filling out a TSP-60 form. However, AXA Equitable is going to charge me ~$770 to withdraw my 403b even though separating from my previous employer is a qualifying event according to the IRS. They said I need to leave my 403b open with them for six more years in order to avoid the $770 charge. They said I can transfer my SERS balance into this 403b.

My question is is it worth it to consolidate these and roll them into my TSP? To be honest, I am a little upset with AXA and am almost willing to eat the charge to avoid giving them any service fees for the next six years, especially since my account in 2018 performed at -8%.

Any guidance on this would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",finance

personalfinance,"Paid off $70k in debt, hesitant on ""final"" $23k","So I'll try to keep this short -  the story begins around late 2013 early 2014. My wife and I got together and totaled up our ""consumer"" debt. We realized we had about $93K in debt. At this point we were newly married (about 1 year), and were renting a small apartment for about $650 per month, so we didn't have a mortgage to factor in. Our combined income was somewhere around $50k / year, so we weren't making much. The debt was comprised of about $80k in student loans and about $13k in credit cards. The minimum payment on our student loans was pretty crushing.. around $850 per month. The interest rate is fixed at 6.8%. 

Needless to say we knew we had a mess on our hands. In looking for answers and a way out, we discovered Dave Ramsey's baby steps. We followed his plan with one major exception - we bought a small house for a great deal (it was a dirt cheap foreclosure that was essentially destroyed) in late 2014 as the market started to improve. Our payment on a 30 yr fixed was about the same as our monthly rent.  

Other changes over the years - part of the motivation to get out of the mess was to start a family and not be drowning in debt. We have done this and now have 3 young kids. My wife doesn't work right now, mostly due to the fact that during pregnancy she is basically bed ridden with morning sickness. 
I also changed job fields and completed my bachelor's degree, getting steadily promoted along the way. My income is now three times what it was when we started this journey. 

Over the past year or two, I've started to sour on Dave Ramsey a bit. I began to realize that he is excellent for getting out of debt, and getting back to a net worth of zero, he has a much different mindset than those in the ""FI"" or ""FIRE"" community. I still 100% credit him and his community for the progress we made, but I am thinking about whats next.

Fast forward through all the struggles, hard work, and emotions to present day: We have paid the debt down to about $23k. During my wife's most recent pregnancy (2018), we stopped paying extra to the debt and saved it instead. We accumulated about $31k in cash. 

My issue is this: for some reason, we are struggling to finish off what we have been working towards for about 5 years. I know that it is completely relative as to whether or not $31k is ""a lot"" of money, but to me, its more than I've ever had in cash. I am wondering what to do here. There are those in the FI community who would say to invest the money and use investments to pay off the debt. There are others who would say that we should finish getting our financial house in order and then invest. I have analyzed this to death and am now in the ""paralysis"" phase. 

Other notes: 
-We also broke one other Dave Ramsey rule and contributed to my 401k up to the match. 
-I consider our mortgage to be ""safe"". Our balance is roughly 50% of the property value (through a ton of repairs we've made as well a some appreciation)
-the payment on the student loans is now about $390/month 
-we don't have any other debt other than our mortgage. 
-our ages are 29 and 30

• Life too chaotic over the past years to have a clear pattern, but we estimate we're able to save between 1 and 2k per month. Might go up or down

• Very demanding work life, little mental space, easily overwhelmed, can't deal with the complexity and quick turns of day trading and such things

* **Retirement:** 12% employer contribution ($7.4k thus far)

&amp;#x200B;

I have been living relatively frugally in New York City, trying to make a dent in my student loans. I have a rather anxious relationship with money, so instead of rationally making payments ahead of time, I've ended up emotionally accruing a far-too-large emergency fund (about $26,600 at the moment). I realize with interest charges I'm just leaving money at the table. My goal is to pay off my student loans once I've reached $30,000 in savings, so I would be left with $10,000, enough for 6 months of living expenses. 

  
Is this a bad idea? I realize I could pay all of my loans off now, but psychologically I like the idea of having this safety net and would be fearful of only having a $6k or 3-4 month emergency fund. Are there any better uses for the money I've accrued?

* I am not happy at my job and am looking for a new role for the fall, once my retirement income vests.

personalfinance,Should I lease or buy a used car? (Student),"I’m a 20 year old student who works part time at a dental office and waitresses. I make on average $1,300 a month and I live at home with my parents so I don’t pay for rent. I am financially independent as I don’t have any bills, other than my gym membership and spotify. 

I have been using the second car my family owns to commute to school and work, leaving my mom carless (she works from home). This is becoming a problem because she has to wait until my father or I come home which tends to be usually late to run errands. My parents are in no financial position to buy another car, and due to my income it makes sense for me to pay for another car monthly. My original plan was to continue saving money for a summer class, and possibly for next semester (if i can avoid taking out a loan, the better). 

As of right now I only have $2k saved and the problem is it’s going to take time to save up more money for a downpayment, except my mom is growing impatient. She said she would help me with the downpayment. Now that’s $1k from her and $1k I can put down, but now my question is should I buy a used car or should I lease a car? 

My worry with buying a used car is, because of my age, short history of credit, and proof of income does not depict how much I actually make (tips arent 100% reported), my interest rate will be high thus monthly payments will be a lot. On top of what the car may need repaired once bought, I am skeptical. I don’t want to feel like I am putting my money into something old. Realistically it will have to be a car $10k or less. 

I don’t like the idea of “renting” a car by leasing and “throwing” my money away like that, but its hard to justify making a $250 payment towards an old car rather than a brand new leased car.

This second letter is dated March 5th and gave me 30 days to respond or have action taken against me for the proposed amount. The issue is that I only lived in DC for 45 days in 2015 and earned nowhere near enough to justify that amount. I reached out to the office of tax and revenue in DC and was referred to a revenue officer. I reached out and she responded by asking for my state return for 2015. I replied that a transcript request from PA would take 4-6 weeks to process and explained that I have proof of residency in PA until Nov 2015. She simply replied by repeating word for word her previous email asking for my state return for 2015. 

I'm following through on the request from PA, but any ideas on what else I can do? I'm trying to understand how this happened and the only thing I can think of is that maybe I mistakenly put DC as my residence when filling out the 2015 return but it's strange that it took till now to receive anything. Has anyone else experienced a similar issue? I filed with TurboTax but apparently they only keep records of federal taxes and not state. Any insight would be much appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,All of my credit card rewards points were stolen.,"Hi everyone, I hope I am posting this in the correct sub reddit. 

&amp;#x200B;

As the title reads, all of my rewards points with Chase were cashed out and transferred to an outside institution. I really don't know how this could have happened and has left me confused. Chase has records says they received a call from my phone number asking my points to be consolidated and initiate a transfer. The thing is, I never called Chase. They also said I had given them the verbal password in order to get this executed. From their understanding as well as mine, my phone number was somehow ""spoofed"" to appear as the call was coming from me. However this does not answer how they obtained my VERBAL password. I have reported this to Chase and am in the process of getting points back but this whole situation made me uneasy and question if I was a victim of identity fraud. I've since put out credit monitoring alerts and had to change my phone so any calls with my old number would be flagged. Its been a real pain, cancelling everything and setting up new accounts. Luckily, the points were the only thing that was stolen. I still don't have any clue what identity information of mine is leaked or if this is a one off. Please check your banks/points balances of suspicious activity everyone! Has anyone been in a similar situation?   


TL;DR - My phone number was ""spoofed"" to call my bank to cash out all my rewards points. Don't know how this could have happened.",finance

personalfinance,Am I crazy for trying to get an apartment for 50% of my income?,"About Me:  I earn about $2600 a month as my take home.  My regular monthly expenses are student loans at $218, car insurance at $98, a credit card payment of roughly $400 a month (including food, gas, haircuts, and cellphone bill).  So very roughly I have $1882 to start with.  I am absolutely sick and fed up with roommates and refuse to consider the idea.

I'm looking for an apartment but the only 'decent' apartments in the area are $1200+.  The apartment I looked at has a starting price at 1250, but is closer after fees to be around $1300 which is hitting my 50% mark, and that is BEFORE i even account for electric and cable.

The location is very convenient being 5 minutes outside of my work.

The only other living options is about 20-30 miles away and many of the apartments are in the $1000-1100 range and estimating on gas and car wear would be around $1200-1250 by my estimates. 

Is this a good idea?  Am I setting myself up for a big fall?  Or can I get through this with adequate budgeting without extreme measures?

Update: I just want to say thank you for the responses and helping me think about what I could be getting myself into.",finance

personalfinance,Have not received 2018 tax return and it is past estimated date. Cannot get any info from IRS,"Greetings all, 

I hope this is the right place to post this, if not, please let me know. 

I filed my taxes on Feb. 14th this year and I have already received my state return within weeks of filing. I have not seen my federal return. The estimated date was March 7th. That date came and went. I have used the tool on the IRS website for checking on the refund status and it tells me it has no data even though I enter the info in exactly as it shows on my return. 

I did change my filing status from single to head of household, and this is my first time claiming a dependent. Would either of those make a difference in the length of time it takes to get my return back? I have double checked my filing and both returns were accepted so that would make me think the return should be on it's way, right?

I also filed a 1099 for investments that I had not had in previous years. I have tried calling the 800 number on the IRS website, but it's just an automated version of the 'Wheres my refund' tool on their website. I have not seen anything in the mail and have not had any emails or phone calls stating anything like an audit or anything like that. 

I would just like to be able to talk to an actual live person to be able to figure out what is going on and I haven't had any luck finding a way to do so, it seems like the IRS just employs robots. 

Hopefully someone out there will have an idea of how I can deal with this and find out where my money is! Thank you all in advance!",finance
energy,Trump Acts on Critical Infrastructure Resiliency Against EMP Threats,"President Trump today signed an executive order (EO) to boost coordination for and national resilience against electromagnetic pulse (EMP) threats—both from nuclear warfare and natural events like solar superstorms. The action suggests new federal mandates to protect critical infrastructure against EMP events and attacks may be on the horizon. 

One expert testified in February that hardening the grid—including power plants, which aren't included in the FERC GMD standards—could cost $50 billion-plus. But that would pale in comparison to losses suffered if an EMP event or attack blacks out the system, he warned.

personalfinance,Invest medium-term savings in bonds?,"Hi PF, wondering what my best option here is. I’m currently saving up for a down payment on a home, but due to our income restrictions and personal situation, between all the things we have to do and waiting to find the right home it will be - at minimum - 3-4 years before we actually start being seriously ready to commit and move in. Meanwhile the down payment I have started squirreling away is more or less just sitting in my bank account, generating virtually nothing for me.

Given that I already have an emergency fund stashed away, and don’t need this money to be particularly liquid, would it be a good idea to place this money in treasury bonds? Given the amount I have saved and will continue to save over the coming years I could get a few hundred dollars per year in addition to the rest of my savings, even only investing in bonds between 3 months and 2 years in length.

That being said, I’ve never personally invested in such bonds; am I overlooking something? Is there a better use for the cash? Citi has also been offering a high-interest savings account since I have a card through them, but I haven’t looked into the actual fine print of that and the interest rate isn’t quite as high.",finance

I want to refinance them but the only lender that will refinance drop outs is Citizens Bank (or so I’ve found in my research) but they require 12 on time payments to your current lender, and I’m working on that. I started making payments in December when my grace period ended. I’m about $18K in debt at ~12%

In January I got the PNC Cash Rewards card with a credit limit of $500. I use it for the cash back rewards and to help build my credit up. I never spend more than I have in my checking account, try to keep to 30% of my limit, and pay it off weekly, never kept a balance. I would like to increase my limit so I can maximize my rewards without going over 30% of my limit.

$325 - Rent

personalfinance,Turning 30 soon and I’d like to know how I’m doing,"As the title says, I am turning 30 soon and would like input on my financial situation.

Currently have $25k in the bank
401k sits at roughly $22k.  Contribute 8%

Yearly salary - $63,500
Take home, biweekly - $1,681

I just received a 3.75% pay raise today (bringing me to the $63,500 number above).  I also received a $4,200 bonus today as well, again bringing me up to the $25,000 in the bank number above.

Monthly expenses as follows:

Rent - $715 - cable, internet, heat, hot water, everything but electric included
Electric - $25
Motorcycle payment - $360.   My bike makes me incredibly happy and isn’t going anywhere...
Student loan -$372- I pay exactly double what is required.  Currently paid through February, 2022
Phone -$50
Credit card - $500 - this encompasses gas, food,  eating out, clothing, concert tickets, everything.

Expenses on a yearly basis as follows:
Car insurance - $750
 Motorcycle insurance -$550 
Registration for car and motorcycle -$500

Current debts:
Motorcycle loan -$20,000. 4.24%
Student loan -$18,200. Low 4% interest rate

No desire for kids so that expense is off the table.

Two questions.
1- how am I doing for myself? I know my motorcycle loan is an albatross and I want it gone ASAP.
2- is it a smart idea to pay off my student loan? With my current bank balance, I can pay my motorcycle payment and rent at the beginning of April and then pay off my entire student loan debt and still have roughly $7,000 leftover.  Smart?  My living situation is solid and rent hasn’t gone up in the almost 6 years I’ve been here and doesn’t give me any indication to think it will (obviously not something I can’t fully control but I am very good friends with my landlord and he has told me my living situation will not change)

My current pay plan, paying 2x what is required, has me on track to pay off my student loan in roughly 4 years.  I have never gone full term on a loan and would likely pay off the loan when it got down to 6 or 8,ooo anyways, but is it a smart move to pay it off even earlier to save all the interest?

I suppose I could take the same logic toward paying off the motorcycle loan, they are very close in principal balance and have very similar interest rates.

 My living situation is so cheap and thus makes it really hard to consider leaving it, which makes the idea of home ownership and the cost associated with it, very uninteresting. 

 My thought is that I have a decent sum of money in the bank not doing much for me so I might as well save myself even more future interest on the student loan.  I would then take a few months to build my bank account back up now that I wouldn’t be paying the $372 for the student debt and then start to roll over much of that to the motorcycle loan, or the other way around...

Am I being smart? Am I doing well? Where can I improve?

personalfinance,Foreigner in the US trying to setup line of credit and cash back.,"Hey PF, 

&amp;#x200B;

Been reading and learning from this sub for a long time and finally have a situation I wanted to ask your collective help on. 

I am a registered alien living and working in the United States. I am debt free, (home country had affordable college, which I worked through plus, government grants and family support got me out with zero debt.) I cash bought a 15 year old car from a family friend when I moved here. Through some good savings and great luck of being at the right companies at the right time I have just over $500k invested in a portfolio that is making about %8 a year with a combination of ETFs and individual investments. And a Capital One credit card which I pay down every month. The only negative being I still have very little credit history within the US. 

  
Overall this is all wonderful and I feel so fortunate and lucky to be stable and not stressed out of my mind with regards to finances. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, I need your help on a two things. 

Due to a poorly timed trade on my part I realized about $30k of gains in January 2018 and have a tax bill against them due soon. This amounts to about $13K. I will be able to get the funds together to take care of this by the end of April with limited interest, but realized; I need to try to develop a stronger financial position to deal with the unexpected cash events. 

So my initial thought is to get a line of credit from a bank that I can use as needed for unexpected costs like this. Ideally get it setup before the April 15th so I can pay off the tax bill at a lower interest rate and set myself up for future bumps. However, my current bank which I really like offers only brokerage and limited banking services (no personal lines of credit). I am not interested in switching banks, but is there a way representing my existing asset position to another more retail bank to ensure I can get a line of credit setup given my limited credit history in the US?   


As well, outside of the Capital One card, I've been unable to get any other credit cards approved and after reading the amazing post today breaking down which cash back cards are the best. I'd like to find a way to better position myself to be able to get one so I'm not leaving money on the table.  So following the same ideas as above, how do I take my current financial position to best position myself to qualify for a good cash back card? 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Best way to setup a line of credit and get cash back card with limited credit history but zero debt and $500k assets invested?

personalfinance,Should I pay off my motorcycle with my credit card?,"I know, sounds like a stupid idea, right? Well let me explain. Last year I bought a 1000cc motorcycle on which I still owe about 8k on the loan. The interest rate is right around 8.5%. My credit card has a far higher interest rate of 17.24%, but it's currently paid off in full.

Here's the problem though- the insurance premium for full coverage on this motorcycle is an absolutely astronomical $1,750 per year even with a perfectly clear driving record. 

I probably ride the motorcycle about 10-15 times per season, and I don't drive like a maniac, so I'm not super concerned about dropping full coverage on it, BUT I can't drop full coverage on it while there's still a loan out on it, as full coverage is required by the lender until the loan is paid off.

Should I just pay off the balance of the loan with my credit card and then drop the insurance down to a fraction of what it was? (I think the regular non-full-coverage insurance is something like 120 bucks a year. Yeah...big difference) Would that save me money in the long run?",finance

Currently, my spouse and I's income is reduced, due to me not working a regular 9-5, and we really don't want to throw ~$350 a month at insurance for a short period before I qualify for the my future employer's plan. I am in my early 30's, healthy and take no medications besides birth control (which is easily affordable out-of-pocket).

As the federal penalties for not having coverage go away this year, that's not a concern either. It's very unlikely I'll have a major health event in the next couple months, but accidents are a bit more of a concern, as if course, you can only prepare for an accident but so much.

Would taking out accident insurance be worth it, in place of a health plan? Would disability or life insurance make more sense - again, in place of (for a couple months, anyway) a health plan? (I already looked in to short-term health insurance and those policies don't appear to be worth the paper they're printed on.)

* localhost:8001 to load up Rstudio

I generally write scripts in Jupyter-lab or Rstudio and once testing is complete I open up a tmux shell on the server and run code straight from the command line -- I use tmux so I can monitor it throughout without the need for being connected to the VPN. This has worked well so far but it still feels a bit clunky. Ultimately, I think a vim-python in one tmux pane and ipython in another would be ideal where I can Ctrl+enter send commands using vim-slime. I've tried this setup and it works, but the config is somewhat of a hassle and I need access to quick plotting to check data processing commands and model run outputs, which is not possible with ipython in the command line. An `ssh -X` would solve this, but now I'm adding things that seem excessive.

This setup is certainly better than my previous workflow. I'd like to see what other data science workflows look like when using a remote server.

personalfinance,New college grad with a moderately high paying job: Budgeting/savings help!!!,"Hello friendly advice-givers.

As the title suggests I am about to graduate college. I landed a new job just outside Washington DC. I was looking at apartments and I realized I have no idea how much I should plan on spending on rent. I began trying to budget based on my new income, but quickly became overwhelmed - as neither I, nor my parents have ever made anywhere close to this much money in my life!

&amp;#x200B;

I was hoping you all could give me some advice on the following: 

1. How much should I spend on rent?  (I have read 30% of net income, but how realistic/optimistic is this estimate?)
2. How much should I invest in 401k? (and how should I split between pre-tax and ROTH)
3. How much, if any should I invest in HSA?
4. How much should I put in a personal savings account?
5. How much should I put towards paying off my student loans?

&amp;#x200B;

**Gross Income:**

* $35/hr  \*  40 hr/wk = **$1400/wk** (I calculated it like this because I will be getting paid weekly)
* $1400/wk  \*  4 wk/mo = **$5600/mo**
* $1400/wk  \*  \~50 work wk/yr = **$70,000/yr** 

&amp;#x200B;

**Deductions:**

* $70/wk for healthcare deductions (including health, vision &amp; dental)
* \~$375/wk for state and federal taxes (at 22% federal tax rate, %4.75 MD state tax rate)

&amp;#x200B;

**Net Income:**

* $1400 - ($375 + $70) = **$955/wk**
* $955/wk \* 4 wk/mo = **$3820/mo**
* $955/wk \* \~50 work wk/yr = **$47,750/yr**

&amp;#x200B;

**Additional Info:**

* \~$25,000 in Student Loan Debt
   * I would like to pay this off in 3 years or less
* Employer matches 10% of 401k contributions
* I have an HSA through my employer (IRS max = $3,450)
* I have the option for voluntary Disability Insurance and Life Insurance
   * I am not super inclined to take advantage of these because I am young and working as a Software Developer, so the likelihood of injury is low. I feel like I can worry about these further down the road
* I am considering taking a small car loan (&lt; $5,000) after I graduate
   * I need a beater to get me around, nothing fancy
   * I would like to not take this loan, but I currently do not have a vehicle and extenuating circumstances have prevented me from saving enough to buy one
* I will almost definitely have a roommate, who will help with rent and utilities
* I am completely uprooting and moving to DC from PA, so my moving expenses will be high (security deposit, first &amp; last month rent, moving truck, etc.) and I will have some additional expenses for the first few months until I get settled (furniture, kitchen ware, etc.)
* I imagine there will be some scaling over time in terms of how much money is going where, but I don't know how to conceptualize this
* I can deal with eating PB &amp; J and pasta every night for awhile, as I am coming right out of college

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice is greatly appreciated. I understand that this is a very broad request for advice, but even a good place to start would be extremely helpful.

Bitcoin,Know how the Fed works,"The Fed is run by very scientifically minded economists who draw from 500 years of economic history to determine current economic and political conditions and command current monetary policy. The heads of each federal bank are selected politically, but with very heavy pressure from the community of the Fed banks. They elevate internally, and the folks qualified to run the Fed are always chosen from the top candidates that have elevated through its ranks. It is not questionable, that the vast majority of officials climbing the ranks in the Fed system seek minimization of unemployment, and maximization of economic growth. They seek to make us all, as a whole, wealthier. They don't operate in the realm of politics, but the top fed officials are selected through the political system. This is not ideal for any particular party or person, but it's ideal for the greater good..., if economic growth is that greater good. Their system is not to boost the stock market. If that was the case, it would be a lot higher (or would've crashed horribly) by now. It it's meant to foster genuine growth, and even it irrational market movements.

Not that complicated, however trying to understand taxes did frustrate me, but I got through it. 

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Turbo Tax\*\*

I have been using TurboTax for about 3 years. This will be my third and possibly last year I will use them. When I first used TurboTax, I was invited by a friend saying, ""It is so easy to do your taxes!"" Before this I was going through an at-home-tax preparer in my state, where I learned about him from my workplace online classifieds. He was good to the point that he apparently had photographic memory of everyone's tax information, email communication, and can remember last years taxes, which was both scary, but impressive. I was paying him about $60, but the reason I stopped going to him was because he was somewhat out of the way to get to him, and I did not feel I was getting the full amount of tax returns from him. Nothing against the guy, it was just that he lived far and I was suspicious of the tax information, but as I learn now it was me that was the problem. 

I started using TurboTax to try to get the most  of the tax returns, and it provided a good way to understand how taxes are done. The first year, I received slightly more, than I did the year before. However, I paid more to TurboTax because I was living in one state, but worked in another. The previous year I was working in the same state, so I only received one state income state. But the job recently made me move to another state, and so I received two. 

For the first two years of TurboTax, I paid around $90-$120 for preparing the taxes. This was even with a discount, but only on the Federal returns. Since I had two states returns I was paying like $45 each on the state returns. At the time, I did not care because I just wanted it to get out of the way, and the ease of use TurboTax made it that simple. 

This year, I am in that mode to penny pinch everything and throwing money to pay off my student loans, as quickly as possible. I received an email to do my federal returns for like $29.99. Normal price is like $60, for federal only. I'm thinking, ""okay, that is cheap."" Then suddenly, when I completed everything, and reach the end with federal and state taxes, my total was like $120 for preparing my taxes. (Mind you, my one state income refund was only $130, so I would only be getting like $10 from my state income tax refund.) I'm thinking ""no way I am going to pay for this!"" So, I only did the federal, which was the $29.99 only. This was TurboTax Deluxe.

After that, I learned there was a free edition of TurboTax, and I can just get free state tax returns. Sad to say, the ""free"" edition, is a joke to begin with on TurboTax. My tax situation was too complicated for TurboTax ""Free"" Edition to comprehend. The free edition of TB, will not file taxes if you have 1099-INT or students loans. These tax incentives are NOT included in TurboTax Free Edition. When you complete the entire thing, you will not be able e-file because your student loans are on a Schedule 1 Form, and you cannot removed this without affecting your state income taxes. For example, in my case, if I removed the forms of both 1099-INT and Schedule 1 forms, your state income refund would be only $1. And, I believe, this $1 came from a 1099-G form which I overpaid taxes in 2017! Or, from something on my W-2 form, I really don't know why only $1. So, you cannot file unless you have that type of situation where you do not have any of those things. TurboTax Deluxe version can do all that, however you will pay for your state income taxes separately, unless it is noted in the product for both ""Federal + State"", but even that is dubious wording from what I have been reading in forums. 

Pro:

\-Easy to use

\-Convenient for both ""Free"" edition and Deluxe

Cons:

\-Expensive (Deluxe Only)

\-Free edition will not do Student Loans or 1099-INT if you have them

\-Have to pay for Federal and State separately (Deluxe)

I will not be using TurboTax for next years taxes, as it is too expensive to do them, for what they are worth. Yeah, it is way easy to use, but paying $120, in my situation, is unrealistic to me.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*HR&amp;Block\*\*

HR&amp;B is very similar to TurboTax, to the point that I believe they have been trading developers for years. The layout, the questions, and other aspects of the online suite are very similar. I found out about doing free tax preparers through \[IRS.gov\]([https://apps.irs.gov/app/freeFile/](https://apps.irs.gov/app/freeFile/)), and one other \[site\]([https://christianpf.com/free-state-income-tax-filing-online/](https://christianpf.com/free-state-income-tax-filing-online/)) to help me try to get my state tax returns for free. At first, I was researching on how I can complete them myself, but IRS, and some other researched sites, pointed me to go to HR&amp;Block. Ok, round 4, or was it 5, times I went through my taxes. HR&amp;Block will do everything for free, provided that you are under the $66,000 income threshold, which I am below that limit. Anything higher than that and you are going to pay HR&amp;B, find another CPA, or better yet, do them yourself. Either way, you are going to pay money, or time.

The process was seamless and very similar to TurboTax. It did not complain about my student loans or 1099-INT, which I have multiples of.  If I had to say, I completed my taxes within about an hour and a half, but I only breezed through that since I have been familiar with what to enter from TurboTax. Once everything was done, I paid nothing to HR-Block to prepare my taxes. Saved the PDF, and printed and everything seems to be in order. 

Pros:

\-Free, as long you are below the $66k income bracket. 

\-Easy to use and similar to TurboTax

Cons""

\-May have slightly different question wording

\-You may have to enter everything manually

I believe I will use this again for next, unless they stop allowing free preparations for taxes, or change the income amount, I don't know, but so far, I like what I see, and I paid nothing to them. 

&amp;#x200B;

All in all, I paid the $29.99 to TurboTax, but if I sat back and researched more, I would have saved those $30. But, what can you do, hopefully this information may help people who are in the process to complete their taxes. If you are in a similar tax situation, like me, this may help you get your taxes done for free. I am only writing this because I am angry that I spent the $30 and could have done all this for free, and saved my sanity. I implore people to also read this \[Vox\]([https://www.vox.com/2016/3/29/11320386/turbotax-boycott-lobbying-tax-filing-season-tax-day-april-15](https://www.vox.com/2016/3/29/11320386/turbotax-boycott-lobbying-tax-filing-season-tax-day-april-15)) article about both HR&amp;Block and TurboTax.

personalfinance,Pay off Debt vs. Have Liquidity?,"Hi r/personalfinance

I have been going through a dilemma, with deciding on whether to pay off my entire student loan debt vs paying it off monthly to have liquidity.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is a breakdown

* $16.4k Student Loan Debt
* 6.4% Interest Rate
* With paying back in 10 years, I would pay $5850 in interest
* I have $26.6k in Cash (Mostly in Index funds)
* Currently renting, and finishing my rent in a few weeks to go move to a new city.

&amp;#x200B;

My lifestyle right now is a bit difficult because I do not have a job and I will be moving cities to be looking for a new job. I am in a pretty volatile spot right now, and having the liquidity and having set monthly payments allows for a sense of structure and leniency when it comes to my finances.

&amp;#x200B;

Would love to hear your thoughts if I should just pay off all of my student debt to not rack up interest, or if I should have monthly payments to have a sense of stability.

Thank You",finance

personalfinance,Pay down debt or save for a potential recession?,"I'm single and 27, live in a relative low cost of living area and make 105k/year. I have ~32k in federal student loans (@ 4.3%), a car ~29k (@ 8%), and a private student loan ~17k (@ 6.899%).

Total debt is roughly 80k. I've been able to put away 2k/month into savings, but I just made a budget and realized I can turn that into 4k/month. I was wondering if it was better to start paying off my debts, or if it's better to start squandering away money for the next potential recession? I have about 6.5k saved up right now. If I start paying them off aggressively, I can have everything paid off by October 2020.

This is my first big boy job and I've had it for about 1.5 years at this point. I have no family to fall back on if I do get laid off. I was wondering what everyone's opinion here was.

I know you're not supposed to try to time the market, etc, but with the news of the inverted yield curve I'm worried that it will turn it into more of a self-fulfilling prophecy and make it happen sooner than the average ~300 days it takes for a recession to hit after the inversion. Since more investors these days look at those numbers now.

The reason I am asking this is because while I do work at a very large company, they've been having to do a lot of restructuring over the past few years to remain somewhat relevant. While my manager says that my job isn't at risk (right now), I don't have too much faith in the company as a whole.",finance

MachineLearning,[P] I hooked up OpenAI's gpt-2 to reddit's API for fun and had it respond to random writing prompts and ask reddit questions with ... interesting ... results.,"GPT2 is [openai's text generator](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2) based on a transformer network. This is the generator that was hyped as being ""too dangerous for the public"" so they released a much smaller trained version of the model on their github. The model was trained using news articles and random links from the internet.

For fun, I just took their model, and fed it random text from reddit (on /r/AskReddit, /r/WritingPrompts, /r/AskScience, /r/copypasta, /r/AskMen, /r/riddles, and /r/ShittyAskScience) to condition its output. I sandboxed its generated responses in a subreddit [here](https://reddit.com/r/DeepReplies/) after it got (correctly) banned for directly responding to stuff.

I've found that it can sometimes generate coherent on-topic text, but sometimes falls into hilarious repetition or reciting random web pages. It also of course sometimes generates offensive content.

One of the most interesting things that this model does is that when prompted with two characters having a dialouge, it generates a script which more or less sticks to the two characters. It also seems to be able to generate scientific-sounding articles and will append random fake citations to the end of them.",technology
personalfinance,What to Do with Inherited 401(K)?,"Hey all,

My dad passed away a few years ago and I was the beneficiary of his 401(k). I left it alone during college (perhaps unwisely) to try and be responsible. I was required to take a few minimum distributions checks which I do not really understand. Am I correct in calling this an inherited 401(k)?

Now, I just started a new job after college, and have my own Roth/Traditional 401(k) ($0) and Roth IRA ($5500). I believe rolling my dad's 401(k) over into either one of these would be good.

My questions are: Can I rollover the 401(k) into either my own 401(k) or IRA? And if so, which one should I choose? 

Lastly, does it matter what type of 401(k) my dad had and what I have? I was honestly having a hard time figuring out what type of 401(k) he had when logged in to ADP--it said contribution type Employee Before Tax for around half the balance, and Safe Harbor NEC for around the other half. The investment is in a Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund - Investor Class that hasn't done well--my accounts are all in Fidelity with recommended index funds and a small amount of bonds and international. 

Thank you for the help, and let me know if you need more information.

personalfinance,Down Payment vs Debt,"I've recently been asked by my work to relocate.  We haven't gotten down to brass tacks yet in terms of the financial incentives to move, but I will start immediately saving $320/bi-weekly on my normal paycheck and when accounting for commissions and bonuses $450/bi-weekly by moving from Ohio to Florida, which will be a nice bump in income all by itself.  I currently have the following in terms of major bills  


  
Mortgage - $2168/mo current home value and possible sale price at $330,000 with net proceeds of $42,000 after sale after paying off the mortgage and a HELOC  
Vehicle 1 - $685/mo

Vehicle 2 - $880/mo

CC Debt - $1,160/mo ($66k total)  
Other (utilities, subscriptions, phone etc) - $954/mo  


My Net take home in Ohio is $8,000/mo on a base Salary of $137,500 and would raise to approx $8,630/mo factoring in the tax savings.  


Now to get to my actual question.  I am a director at my company and I am eligible for both commission payments and annual bonuses (which totaled $70,000 last year.  In April I will receive a commission check for $30,000 as well as an annual bonus of $40,000.  After taxes, I anticipate that this will net approx. $36,000.  Combining this with the net proceeds from the sale of our current home that gives a total liquidity of $78,000 to work with.    


Option 1) Pay off all of the CC debt, but that would leave very little towards a down payment on a new home.  We would prefer to not rent and then buy in another 12-24 months to keep from moving our kids to new schools more than once.  Are 100% financed mortgages where you close on a 80/90% first mortgage and at the same time take out a HELOC for the remaining 20/10%?    


Option 2) Keep as much of the $78,000 available for a down payment as possible.  This would result in a high interest rate and cap the value of a home without PMI kicking in to around $400,000.  My plan is always to be able to support all of the standard bills on only my base salary so $450,000-$500,000 would ultimately be the maximum ceiling for a home  


This move was in the cards, but I had not planned on it happening for another 18 months or so, at which time we would both have all CC debt already paid off and have over $100,000 ready for a down payment.

personalfinance,Not sure where to allocate extra money each month,"My husband and I are in our mid-20s and have a combined income of $115k. We net $6,100 per month. After our mortgage payment, bills, groceries, etc. have about $1.5k left over each month. I'm not sure how we should allocate that money.

**Emergency Fund**

We have an emergency fund that's sitting at $16k (~4 months of expenses). My short-term goal is to get it to $25k (6 months of expenses) and the long-term goal is to get it to $35-40k.

**Retirement**

Currently, we each contribute 5% to Roth 401k plans through work. His employer doesn't match, but mine contributes 6% (traditional 401k, fully vested but employer contribution is only disbursed once per year). We didn't save for retirement during our early 20s because we were focused on saving for a house and paying off two large debts. I would ideally like to contribute 18-20% of our gross income to retirement. I am very fearful of not saving enough to retire.

**Debt**

We have relatively little debt (precluding our mortgage), as follows:

-My student loan: $6k balance, 3.6% interest rate. Monthly payment is $100.

-HELOC: $4k balance, variable rate but currently 6.25%. Monthly payment is $20 (interest only).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have 3 main goals at the moment:

1) Build up the emergency fund.

2) Create Roth IRA accounts for each of us and max them out.

3) Pay off the the HELOC due to the variable nature of the interest rate. I'm not prioritizing paying off my student loan because I've hit the point in amortization where most of the payments go to principal - only ~$200/yr goes to interest.

Some things to consider:

-One or both of us will need ""new"" (used) cars in the near-ish future. He drives a 2005 Honda with 300k miles, I drive a 2009 Hyundai with 150k miles. Both are paid off.

-We are actively trying to start a family. I'm not pregnant yet, but it could happen any time. I intend to continue working after I have a child, so daycare would be necessary.

Any advice on how to prioritize the extra $1.5k/mo would be greatly appreciated! Thank you.",finance

My credit score is 757 but I could raise it about 30 points by reducing $8k in debt.

The $8k is currently in a money market account. Rainy day / emergency fund. There are additional funds in a non-retirement investment account I can pull from if necessary.

The credit card debt is a 0% APR promotion that expires next March. I was planning on paying it off then, or gradually over the course of this year. Not sure if this matters in terms of credit score, but this particular card is nearly maxxed out. It represents maybe 15% of my total credit available.

I think my options are:
1. Pay down the credit card to maximize my score. If an emergency comes up, I use that 0% card or pull from other investments
2. Assume 757 is good enough and use some of that money for the down payment
3. Keep the $8k in the money market, hope for the best rates, and put the minimum down they'll allow. Pay off the card in March as previously planned.",finance

My employer is desperate for younger employees so they set up a corporate account to help pay for people to go back to school. I'm the first to actually make use of this, so my tuition is paid for by the company. I'm currently attending a local community college for an Associates in Cybersecurity, which I would like to turn into a 4 year degree.

However, there are some issues with this. I'm a full-time employee and a full-time student. I have to be a full-time employee on the books in order to use the corporate account. My current schedule effectively locks out 3 days of the week for solely work, as I'm at the office from 8:00am to 6:30pm. This locks me into only attending night classes on the other two days, as there are no day classes offered which fit. This also poses problems with rescheduling tests or attending in-person exams, as the instructors often schedule things during my work days.

My workload ranges from mundane to mentally exhausting, depending on how my boss and the clients feel that day. We are involved in healthcare auditing, and my duties consist of secretarial work, account management (medical coders at hospitals), travel accomadations for a sister company, along with other tasks which are randomly assigned. Some days I have time to touch my classwork, some days my brain is fried by 5pm. Suffice to say, it's not the best enviornment for a full-time student. I'm concerned that over a long period of time, the schedule may have an adverse effect on my health and relationships with others.

Now onto the financial question. Right now my spouse and I make a little under 90k before taxes. If I stopped working to attend school full-time, it would be 65k before tax. Is that ""too much"" to qualify for financial aid? I'm an older student (26), and I would greatly prefer studying full-time, rather than pulling this double full-time gig *or* working full time while progressing toward my degree at a snail's part-time pace. My experience with FAFSA has been lackluster, as (back when I initially tried college) my parents were considered just middle class enough to get 0 help. I'm worried that I'll receive the same answer if I go that route again.

personalfinance,Should I pay off loans faster or start saving?,"So I started a new job back in December and have started making a little more money, about 36k/year after taxes. I've also got $31,412 (principle) in student loan debt that I'm currently paying more than the minimum on. See budget for breakdown. I have been living at home with my parents but just signed a lease to get a place with my partner of 6 years. New commute is gunna suck but I've actually had worse. My current budget looks like this:

Average Monthly Income: $2,735 (Four weeks after taxes)


Rent: $495

Minimum Student Loan Payment: $375

Extra Loan Payments: $120 ($30 per paycheck)

Gas for commute + tolls: $320

Estimated Bills: $200

Estimated Food: $250

TOTAL: $1797


Income - Expenses: $938

Current money in the bank: $1500

I'm planning on opening a savings account soon, currently have TD for checking but might be moving to a credit union soon for ethical reasons.

Now I'm expecting a bunch of that money sitting in my bank right now to go to moving expenses (we're moving in slowly over the next couple weeks) but we are getting lots of second hand furniture, etc from our parents and we've got lots of stuff already (both of us have lived on our own at some point). But with 940 bucks leftover every month, probably less as fun stuff will take a good chunk of that, how much should I be putting away in a savings account / should I increase my student loan payments to pay of my debt sooner?

At the moment, if I only payed the minimum payment on my loans it'd be payed of Aug. 2027. At my current rate, with the extra 120ish per month I'm putting towards them, I should have them payed off Apr 2025. Is it worth dedicating more of my paycheck to my debt or building a larger savings? How much money should I be saving per month? I'd like to build a nice comfortable emergency fund, but how long should it take to build that and how much do you think that should be?

EDIT: I have a variety of loans all with different amounts and interest rates. Is it better to pay high interest rates off first with my excess payments even if they are for lower amounts? Example: I have a $5,395 at 3.61% and a $2,350 at 6.55%. The math ends up being that the lower interest rate loan accrues interest faster. Is it worth paying that one down until the higher interest rate starts accruing faster or vice versa?",finance
personalfinance,Is it normal/legal for an apartment complex to not send me a copy of the lease renewal without automatically renewing the lease? South Carolina,"I live in South Carolina and have lived at the same apartment complex for the past 2 years.  I'm looking at buying a house in the summer, but my current lease ends at the end of May.  I ran the numbers and it makes the most sense to sign a 12 month lease and pay two months rent to break the lease than to do a short term lease.  I also don't know what will happen with the overall market and interest rates, so I want the flexibility to break the lease when I want and not be tied down to a specific date.

In my communication with the apartment complex, they have said that they can't send me a copy of the new lease to go over without me automatically renewing it.  They have also said that while the new lease and old lease are pretty identical, there are some differences in the format and layout.  I wanted to get a printed copy of it to sit down and go over, but they said I can only go over the new lease at the office with them.  This seems fishy to me, especially since now that I've asked to see the lease, they have said that they can negotiate on the monthly rent.  I don't want to sign something that locks me in for 12 months without the ability to break the lease.

Am I wrong for thinking something weird is going on?  Do I have rights as a renter to get out of the lease (assuming I will have to pay a fee/penalty in doing so)?

Retirement: about 65k

Credit score: 800+

&amp;#x200B;

I've been thinking of buying a house, but not sure if I should hold off or not until I have more capital.  Right now, I pay around 1100 in rent, and am looking at houses between the 200k-230k range (although I think I can afford up to 250k, I don't want to be house poor).  My rent is pretty low currently for my area because I've been in the same house for so long, usual rent is probably closer to 1300-1800.

&amp;#x200B;

I've played with the calculators and most say to buy, however I'm worried that I don't have enough savings or I'm taking on unnecessary debt.  Closing costs in my area usually cost about 5% I believe, which would lead me with 5% down payment and would roughly leave me with about 10k left over for an emergency fund.

&amp;#x200B;

I would wait another year, but if interest rates rise even just a percent, it will completely negate any additional money I put down not to mention paying another year of rent.  I talked to some banks and I can easily qualify for a 4.1% interest rate with 5% down payment.

personalfinance,Should I be participating in my firm’s ESPP?,"My firm offers an opportunity for any employee to purchase their NYSE-listed stock at a 15% discount.   

How it works:
I can have any amount (up to a total of about $21,250) of after-tax salary withheld from my paycheck. The funds sit in a non interest-bearing account for a period of 30 days. At the end of that 30 days, the company buys shares for me at 85% of their market value on that date. The only catch is that I have to hold the shares for one year. 

My current investment strategy is to only contribute the 6% required to get my maximum employer 401k match, while aggressively paying down my student loan debt (which is at 5.8%). 

I have been tempted to enroll in the employee stock purchase plan, but assumed PF consensus would be against it due to the riskiness of the stock and the “immediate return” of instead directing those dollars toward the student loans. 

However, I’m wondering if there is any way to immunize myself against the riskiness of the stock. I think selling call options would be the ideal answer? It’s a low volatility stock with commensurately low option prices, but if I were selling them with a 1-year time horizon, that’d still be some significant extra cash. Is this something an average Joe can do if he owns the shares? Is that legal given that I’m an employee of the firm? I understand that the math could get a little complicated. I think options contracts are always for 100 shares, the stock price of the firm is low (like $15), and I could just sell a 12 or 13 month option for each 100-share block that I own as I obtain them throughout the year. 

Some notes:
90k student loan debt - all federal - I don’t qualify for any forgiveness programs

115k salary

Salary too high to deduct student loan interest and/or I don’t itemize anyway

Contributing any amount, up to the maximum $21k per year, would not cause me any liquidity concerns or result in new borrowings. It would just be less that I could devote to student loans each month. 


TL;DR: Most important financial goal for me right now is paying off student loans, but damn that stock purchase plan looks attractive. Any way to make it work?",finance

CryptoCurrency,Locking and Staking on 0Chain: A New Approach to Blockchain,"As the 0Chain network nears its launch, many people have been wondering how economic protocols and inflation will impact the value of ZCN. 0Chain has implemented a brand-new token reward protocol that uses a *locking and staking*approach.

## How does the network function?

When using 0ChainNet, both clients and service providers (miners, sharders, and blobbers) are required to use their ZCN. Clients will *lock* their tokens while service providers must *stake* their tokens, which includes a risk. By requiring staking, service providers are not only encouraged to engage in proper activity, they also risk losing part of their staked tokens if they misbehave and intentionally disrupt the network. For clients, this interest can be used to pay service providers to store data.

Here’s a look into how the rewards are distributed to miners, blobbers, and sharders based on the information provided in the [service provider brochure](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YMU5AQmuW8bDiTesOKKCZ7hqctlXb2g1/view):

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/myr6ulmjiqo21.png

In the graph below, you can see the payouts for the each type of service provider. There are miner rigs (M rig), miner and sharder rigs (MS rig), and miner, sharder, and blobber rigs (MSB rig). The graphs compare payouts when ZCN is valued at $0.10 and $1.00 in that respective order.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/yduillbkiqo21.png

## How does interest correlate to time?

Upon locking/staking tokens, the tokens will be unmovable for an agreed upon period of time. For instance, a one-year locking term will result in a 10% interest rate while a 3-month term (likely the minimum length) may result in a 2–2.5% interest rate. While locking/staking reduces the number of available tokens from the current supply for a period of time, the total supply increases.

## How is the interest paid out and what is its impact on the supply of ZCN?

Locked and staked tokens automatically yield interest. If a client locks 1,000 ZCN for one year, they would be rewarded with 100 ZCN, a 10% interest. Since these **interest-generated tokens are provided upfront**, the clients can then do whatever they want with the new tokens, including sell them, lock them, or use them for network activity.

For another example, a service provider wants to stake 10,000 ZCN. By agreeing to stake their tokens, 10,000 ZCN is removed from the available token supply for one year and replaced by the interest. While these staked tokens still exist, they are no longer able to be unlocked nor moved for the whole year. These service providers are then able to re-stake the interest-generated tokens, sell them, or use them for services on the network, like storage.

Locking and staking on 0ChainNet requires users to invest in the network. Through this new protocol, 0Chain is able to maintain the integrity of the network, encourage reputable service providers, and promote healthy token economics. The community is anxiously awaiting the release of this project that has the opportunity to redefine the blockchain space.

My DTI is around 30%.

\-250/mo in Student Loans (half of that payment is a parent plus loan that I pay for my mom)

\-300/mo for credit cards

\-120/mo for car insurance

I have around $7,000 in Credit Card debt. Approximately half of it is on a card that is not reported to a credit agency. The interest on this card is atrocious and I'd like to move it to something a bit better. The other half is split among 6 cards at around 50% usage.

  
I was thinking about a couple of options:  
\-Refinancing all my debt onto a personal loan with a lower interest rate. I'm hoping that I can get a loan period that will lower my monthly payment (and lower my DTI in the process) while also saving me money on interest. My fear is that if I do this my lender will want me to close accounts (I get why the lender would want this but I also know that would hurt my credit score). I also worry that having a large personal loan with all those accounts may scare potential lenders as well.

\-Moving my large card (around 3500) over to a personal loan. My fear here is nearly the same, I worry that having this big chunk of money suddenly being reported may hurt my credit as well. 

I could pay off most of this debt this year, but I live at home (I'm very lucky). But I'd like to save up a down payment and move out as soon as possible.  


As for even getting approved for a mortgage loan in the first place. I have a co-borrower with similar income/DTI and good credit. As well as a cosigner to back the loan. We're looking at a 10% down payment. Maybe that won't be enough, but I still want to try. I'm hoping to improve my odds as much as possible in the meantime. So I guess, I'm kind of lost. Do I leave everything as is? Shift all the debt to one loan? Only move one over to a loan? I don't know which is the best option for my scenario/future.

personalfinance,"19 Years Old, Living on Own For the First Time, Budgeting Help?","Throwaway for privacy reasons.

I'm a college student in Oklahoma, currently a junior in terms of credits. I've received an internship offer for $18/hr over the summer, working 40 hours a week. The company is in the same city as my university, approximately a 14 minute drive.

My family lives about an hour and a half away, so I'll have to stay here on my own if I accept the offer (as I really want to). I don't believe $18/hr is going to prevent me from starving or anything, but I'd like to just get an idea of what I should be budgeting as an adult living on my own.

I live in an on-campus apartment, which I can stay in over the summer for $3200 total or $2200 if my roommate stays here over the summer.

Let's just be cautious and assume he won't be here, so it'll be $3200 over the full summer. This is for the months of May, June, July, and August. So, breaking that into monthly payments, I could set aside $800 a month for rent. 

The monthly electric bill has been averaging $60-100 depending on the weather, I expect it to be somewhere in the middle, $80 a month. (Again, if roommate is present we'll be splitting it, but best to plan for the worst)

Threw my wage into some online calculators that would account for tax withholding etc, came up with making approximately $570/week.

That'll be about $2280 a month, if my math is right (There's exactly 16 weeks I'll be working, so 16*weekly pay/4 months)

If I budget $100 a month for electric, $800 a month for rent, that leaves me with about $1380 a month, not yet budgeting for food, gas, savings, or other expenditures.

For a single male, planning to cook most of my meals myself, about what should I be budgeting for groceries each week/month? I spent Spring Break at my apartment and cooked for myself for the first time, groceries for the week were about $100, but that was on the high end since I had to purchase a few things I didn't otherwise have (spices, etc), and I still have food leftover from that week. Also, I shopped at Walmart, but have heard Aldi's has significantly better prices. There's an Aldi's in my city which I will probably get my groceries from. 

Gas I have no real idea how much I'd be spending. I rarely drive currently, although I'll be making about a 7 mile commute (14 both ways) four-five days a week. Thinking I'll budget about $40 a month and see how far that gets me?

I'm still on my family's phone plan, and I don't foresee that changing. Internet is university internet, so no internet bill. I have no other monthly expenses that I can think of. 

I plan to put aside a decent percentage of my income for an emergency fund (I have ~$900 to my name at the moment, not necessarily in an EF, but I rarely spend money, it only gets used when I occasionally eat out or need to purchase something for school), but that exact percentage is going to depend on how much I have left after expenses I expect. I definitely want to build up an emergency fund just to be safe, and potentially have money leftover for next school year. 

I have student loan debt, approximately $6k at the moment total I believe. It's all subsidized federal loans, so interest won't accrue until I graduate in two years (junior in credit, sophomore year-wise). I don't think it'd make a lot of sense to start tackling that now, but if that's not the case I'd be glad to hear why.

Any advice on about how much I should be budgeting for food, gas, other things I haven't thought of? Cheap, tasty meal suggestions are also appreciated (I plan to make plenty of chicken and rice, don't worry). Any responses are greatly appreciated, thank you! (:",finance

Here is how it all breaks down:

**Income**: \~$2000 per month 

**Rent/utilities/phone/transit**: $920/mo

**Student loans**: $200/mo

**Credit card #1**: Balance of $2200, APR of 24%, I have been paying $200 a month on this and can't seem to get it under $2200.

**Credit card #2**: Balance of $620, APR of 28%, I have been paying $100/mo

**Credit card #3**: Balance of $200, 0% APR, I have been paying $100/mo and nearly done paying this off.

This leaves me around $250 left over for groceries and necessities every paycheck, which is usually stretched pretty thin in my household. What concerns me the most, however, is the money that I am soon to owe. 

**Taxes**: \~$400, this is because of a second job that I took on last year to help pay down my credit card. I was hired on as a 1099 and learned that lesson the hard way, but was able to use the money I made from this job to pay my credit card down from $5,000 to $2,200.

**Out of town wedding**: $600-$800. I have to fly out of state for my boyfriend's brother's wedding, and because I don't make as much as he does, he is paying for my ticket and letting me pay him back in installments, most likely \~$200/month.

&amp;#x200B;

So basically, I'll have nothing left over after paying bills/credit cards/taxes/wedding, and have been considering taking out a personal loan with a lower APR than the cards I currently have. My credit score is 733, and through the research I've done, I have found several loans of $4,000 with an interest rate between 8% and 13% over a term of 36 months, which I would easily be able to pay off before the term is up. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I honestly have no idea what I'm doing and am just looking for a way to consolidate all of my credit card debt with a lower interest rate. I feel like I have been treading water and I just don't want to drown anymore. It's at the point where I feel like no matter what I do, I'll never make any progress and I'll always be a slave to credit card companies. Even taking on a second job has ended up costing me. If anyone has any other advice, I all ears! Thank you very much if you read all of this.

personalfinance,Commercial Fisherman: Pay off student loan OR leverage debt to better financial standing?,"As the title states, I am a commercial fisherman and recently wrapped up the end of a season. This leaves me with a nice chunk of pre-tax cash. I don’t have any debt outside of just under 9k in student loans. These were government loans at an interest rate of 4.9%.

I was thinking of paying monthly with my credit card and paying it off after each statement to earn the rewards (air miles). 

The “OR”that first crossed my mind is maxing out my yearly allowed contribution to an IRA account. I’m sure there are other savvy options out there that I just don’t know about - I’m very open to suggestions and strategies!

Note: I plan to begin the home buying process at the end of the year. 

Questions for you smart folks: 
1. What are your suggestions regarding my loans and their repayment?

2. What should I 100% be doing with my pre-tax cash?

3. What else do you have to share? 

Thank you all!",finance
personalfinance,Roth IRA withdrawal,"I recently opened a Roth IRA account with Vanguard. I was initially planning on depositing 1000$ into my account but wanted to take some time to research what kind of fund to put my money in. Vanguard doesn't let you view what kind of funds it offers unless you first make a deposit so I linked my bank's checking account and deposited 50$ dollars into the account. The money was automatically deposited into Vanguard's Money Market account, I let the money sit there for about a month, I then decided that instead of depositing the 1000$ into my Roth IRA account I'd rather use that money to help pay off my student loans earlier. 

I wanted to take back the 50$ I had deposited into my Roth IRA and after a couple of Google searches I learned that I am allowed to withdraw my contributions (and not earnings) without any tax or penalty. My account showed as having a total of 50$ (no earnings) so I withdrew my 50$ from the Money Market and transferred it back into my bank's checking account, Vanguard asked me if I'd like to withhold state taxes to which I selected No and also if I'd like to withhold federal taxes to which I also selected no. Vanguard notified me that my withdrawal in considered an ""early distribution"" and so they will have to report the transaction to the IRS.

Two days later I received an email from Vanguard notifying me that a statement is available for me to view. I checked the statement on the website and it show that 50.07$ were transferred into my bank account, 50$ being my initial contribution and 0.07$ being dividends. When I selected the amount to withdraw I only entered 50.00 not 50.07, the 7 cents were not even shown in my account.

I am a recent college grad and know very little about taxes. My question is how do I handle my contribution withdrawal when it is time to do my taxes? Are there any additional forms I need to submit? And also does Vanguard report to the IRS that I withdrew earnings not just my contribution since there were 7 additional cents? Does such a small amount in earnings even reported to the IRS or is it just an algorithm that checks if B the amount withdrawn is greater than A the amount contributed and just report it as earnings? Should I just re-deposit the money just for the sake of avoiding any complications (or would that make it even worse)?

I know these questions could be considered silly and stupid but I just want to make sure I do the right thing and not get into trouble with the IRS. Even though the amount I deposited and withdrew is pretty small, it causing me a great deal of stress and anxiety. 

Any advice would be much appreciated. Thanks

personalfinance,Unusual tax situation. I don't think I need to file. Should I file anyway? Do I need to?,"* Was not employed at all in 2018. Made no money the traditional way.

    * No federal tax was withheld.

It's my understanding that the long term Capital Gains rates indicate I don't owe any taxes because my income was below $38.6k

Long-term capital gains tax rate|Your income

Source: https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/taxes/capital-gains-tax-rates/

I could claim the $15 short term loss as negative income, but I don't even know if that's worth anything. In previous years I did tax loss harvesting and got large refunds, but this year I've paid no taxes, so there's nothing to refund, right? Not that I would even file to make back the $5 or whatever.

So, do I need to file? Should I? Is there anything I'm missing?

EDIT: I forgot to mention I live in NC, and I'm also unsure about state filing.

Bleh, looks like NC has a flat 5.499% capital gains tax rate.  Long or short term gains, it doesn't matter. Seems like I'll have to pay them $406. Maybe I'll do that with a paper form and skip buying tax software this year.",finance

worldpolitics,Japan in vain attempts to return the Kuril Islands,"For many years, the Japanese government has been strongly shaping the opinion that there are supposedly territories belonging to Japan by the right of historical discovery to the north of the Japanese islands, for some reason forgetting that it was the Russian Cossacks who discovered them. The Japanese leadership does not like to recall the fact that later in 1905 Russia transferred the Kuril Islands to the Japanese side as an annexation, but as a result of the World War II the islands were returned under the sovereignty of Russia.

For these lands, the Japanese even coined a special term «northern territories», which, according to the Japanese leadership, includes the southern islands of the Russian Kuril Islands Ridge. A part of Japanese historians officially declares that the annexation of the southern Kuril Islands by the Soviet Union as a punishment of the Japanese aggressor at the end of the World War II is in fact an illegal occupation of the «northern territories» of Japan.

Therefore, in the late 60s, Japanese nationalist forces, driven by a thirst for revenge, began to form public organizations bearing the high-profile names of «leagues», «associations» and «unions» on issues of the «northern territories». Thus, in Japan, the post of Minister for Okinawa and the Northern Territories appeared, a Council for Relations with the movement for the return of the «Northern Territories» was formed, through which centralized management and funding of these same «associations» and «leagues» is carried out at the expense of funds from the state budget.

Since 1969, these public associations were legally entrusted with conducting so-called «educational propaganda» on the «problem of the northern territories». The Japanese government was tasked with convincing the world community that a territorial problem exists with Russia, and the Japanese impose a national idea «to return to their homeland» of seized mythical «northern territories».

It should be noted that the forms of activity of non-governmental organizations are becoming more sophisticated. These events are often attended by members of parliament, members of the government, and mayors of cities. In addition to meetings and signatures for countless petitions, exhibitions, conferences, «study tours» are organized along the southern islands of the Kuril Islands Ridge, in which members of the cabinet of ministers also take part.

Moreover, special attention is paid to young people. For schoolchildren, for example, a special magazine about the «northern territories» is published, short animation films are produced, in which the Russian people are shown as «barbarians» and invaders. A striking example is the government project «Giovanni», in which the animated film «Giovanni Island» was created in 2014 for rental at international film festivals. The cartoon tells about the love of a Russian boy and a Japanese girl, separated by Soviet soldiers who occupied the mythical island «Giovanni».

Also, the annual culmination of the activities of anti-Russian non-governmental organizations becomes February 7, when Japan celebrates the national Day of the «Northern Territories». In Japanese cities, cars with loudspeakers are plying, from which there are demands for the return of Japan to the islands and the music of military marches. Various meetings and marches are held, which, ultimately, contribute to the formation of Russophobia among the Japanese.

In 2011, there was even a case when during the rally of Japanese nationalists the flag of Russia was desecrated. Despite the fact that under Japanese law, such actions are criminalized, the government refused to investigate the case. Impunity of the antics of nationalist organizations, their cover-up, as well as financing, may sooner or later lead to sad consequences for the country.

The network of anti-Russian nongovernmental organizations has actually become part of the mass information system of the Japanese population, in whose mind they have been forming the «complex of the people humiliated by the Soviet Union» for a long time and provoking revenge.

But no matter what principles the Japanese government is guided by, whatever policy it pursues regarding the Kuril Islands and whatever resources it spends on shaping the image of the Kuril Islands as Japanese territory - any person, at least a little familiar with history, understands that all these attempts are ineffective. After all, the facts prove the historical identity of the islands Iturup, Kunashir and a group of islands of the small Kuril Islands ridge of Russia. The Kuril Islands finally became part of the USSR, the successor of which was Russia, legally following the World War II and are an integral part of the territory of the Russian Federation, as Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly stated.",finance

personalfinance,"No debt besides 30k in federal student loans, have the opportunity to attend flight school at 60k, need advice.","So a little background, I'm 24, parents separated, dad left very young, mother raised me until I was 17 then moved to other side of country. I've lived on my own since then and slowly chunked away at a degree in Engineering while working full time. My mother and I have SIGNIFICANTLY improved our relationship since when she left.

I currently have an associates in applied sciences. I have 0 credit card debt with a 10k credit limit, and a 2012 dodge that I have paid off in decent condition. My credit score is 719 with 6 years of history. The only debt I have remaining is 30k in federal student loans, deferred as I am still in school and have about 50 credits left before a bachelors. The only derogatory marks I have are a few late payments on my car. 

While I do have an interest in engineering, my passion has always been and still is aviation. I have my private pilot's license. I have an emergency fund built up but my savings went into paying off all of my debt, so only about 3k cash. Will have around 8k when I plan on leaving.

My mom has offered me to drive out to her in Florida, and stay with her rent- and bill-free while I attend flight school. It is approximately 6 months of no income and costs a 60k student loan, deferred while in continuing education. I will then fly as an instructor for a year @ approximately 35k, then have an opportunity to fly for a regional airline starting at 57k. The airlines offer ~17k in tuition reimbursement after signing.

In this time I plan on prolonging my degree, or working at it slowly while I'm flying, part-time at like 6 credit hours online. This will also defer my student loans from flight school.

This would be a very healthy lifestyle change for me, as I'm fairly alone where I am now and have been for years besides romantic relationships. None of my family lives here anymore, they all moved to Florida.

When all is said and done, I'll be at approximately 73-80k in student loans, with a starting pay of 57k, with a potential career in something I love. The pay also increases significantly after the first year.

My alternative is staying where I'm at, rather unhappily, making about 36-40k (although about 900/mo in bills) and slowly working towards my bachelor's, which I honestly have kind of lost interest in.

Does this seem like a sound decision or is this alot of financial risk?",finance

At the time, the bank told me to keep the original line open with a zero balance as it would increase my available credit (with a lower usage rate). 

Flash forward and both lines are at zero, very low credit card revolving balance (paid off weekly), and paid off school loans (for both my wife and I). 

I no longer need either line of credit and both of the interest rates have gone up substantially. Does it makes sense to keep both lines open (total available $27,000) to keep a higher available credit number, close one of them out, or close both of them out?

business,How can you help your sales teams hit their targets?,"The sales target; the monthly figure that divides the winners and losers of sales teams across the globe. Providing the target figure is achievable but not easy then it is an incredibly useful tool for sales leaders. There is no perfect formula for getting your team to all hit their targets all the time but there are some useful tools I have used and honed throughout my career. I fully accept that many of these tools can be found within Sales/CRM packages like SalesForce but many leaders do not use these and many of those that do still use management documents in addition. If you prefer sales software then great but the range of tools that follow probably won't apply to you. I'll be publishing these tools over the coming days in my blog posts so please do follow me.

**The Pipeline**

The sales pipeline is typically a spreadsheet that details all the live opportunities currently being worked by the salesperson. The spreadsheet should be updated daily and saved to a cloud based server for the Sales Manager to access as they need.

The spreadsheet should include the following columns;

Client Name

Client Contact

Brief description of the sale items

Order Value

Date of first meeting

Date of last meeting

Date proposal/quote issued

Date of last contact &amp; method

Date of next contact &amp; method

% chance of close in current month

Comments

It is important that all sections of the pipeline are completed as this will provide the Sales Leader with the core information required to assess progress and to highlight potential issues.

So, let's break down the benefit of each section;

**Client Name and Contact:** Obvious

**Brief Description**: This is a summary of the deal; What service or equipment is being proposed.

**Order Value:** This is the value of the sale in whatever format the salesperson is targeted. If they are targeted on profit then this figure should be the profit element of the deal.

**Date of first meeting:** So you can understand the duration of the deal so far

**Date of last meeting:** So you can understand when your salesperson was last in front of the prospect.

**Date of Proposal/Quote:** This will tell you how long it has been since the customer received the numbers and whether that was at the last meeting or before or after.

**Date of last contact &amp; method**: This will tell you when the salesperson last contacted the prospect and by what method.

**Date of next contact &amp; method:** This will enable you to understand the next course of action planned by the salesperson.

**% chance of close in current month:** A percentage figure that gives you an insight to the salesperson confidence in this deal and its timeline.

**Comments:** An area when the salesperson can add other relevant information.

The purpose of this pipeline is to:

Enable sales leaders to evaluate the overall status of a salesperson in their team.

Ensure there is a broad mix of opportunities

Ensure there are sufficient opportunities to on short, medium and long term orders

To highlight and deals that are dragging or that are of such value that the leader may wish to get involved in.

**The most important part.**

The most fundamental item in the pipeline is the total of the Value column and as a rule, this should always be at least 12 times the monthly target. So, if your salesperson has a monthly profit target of £10,000 then the total of all live sales should be maintained an no less than £120,000 and this should ensure that the targets are met on a near consistent basis. The multiple of 12 rule works in most targeting systems, if they have to win 10 new customers a month their working prospect list should not dip below 120 customers, if they should be getting ongoing revenue of £2,000 per month then they'll need to be working £24,000 all the time, as a minimum.

Now, there will be lots of instances where these multiples don't work for your business so just change them accordingly. The point is to ensure that your sales machine continues to be fed and that the salesperson applies as much attention to the front end of the sales process as they do the back end.",finance
personalfinance,Banking Fees - Pay attention to them!,"I know this is well-worn ground, but I thought it would be worthwhile to mention once more. If you haven't done so in a while, take a look at the fees your bank charges, and see what other banks are offering - you may be able to save a *substantial* amount of money.

I've been a happy member of USAA since I turned 16 and got my driver's license. In 2008, I opened a checking account with USAA, and it quickly became my primary bank account. By 2010, I had closed out all of my other accounts, and I've been happy ever since. I can't deposit cash, but that's a small price to pay for what I've grown accustomed to. 

Last week, I opened a Citizens account so I could take advantage of their $600 bonus, and I am only now realizing how spoiled I am. I haven't done all that much with it yet, but I've already discovered some substantial differences in costs between Citizens and USAA...

investing,"Question on the logic behind bond valuation: why do 1-year US treasury bonds have higher yields than Municipals, Corporate (AAA) 1-year bonds, and European treasury bonds. Seems counterintuitive.","My intuition says that the yield of bonds is essentially how much risk will you tolerate for a specific yield. Riskier loans should have higher yields.

I always thought the order of ""risk"" would feature US treasuries at the very top end, followed somewhere by other developed nation treasuries like Swiss and other euros, followed by AAA Corporate bonds etc... So I would expect that for a given maturity length, US treasuries would have the lowest yield and increasing from there.

However, according to my brokerage and other places, the yields on 0-1 year bonds are:

\- US Treasury: \~ 2.4%

\- Corporate (AAA): 1.44% (I assume this is some kind of average or whatever)

\- Corporate (A): 2.1%

\- Municipal (AAA): 0.67%

and so on....

Add to that, European national bank yields are around 0% as far as I can tell (from ETFs that hold various European bonds). So does this mean that all of these bonds are perceived as less risky than US Treasuries, and by such a huge amount? This seems completely counter-intuitive to me. But I must be wrong somewhere.

So what does this imply, that US Treasury bonds are perceived as way more risky than I thought or what? Am I missing something? I would have thought that if the US goes bankrupt, then US Municipal bonds, and most Corporate, even AAA bonds, will probably be in a bit of a pickle themselves.

Essentially, I can't see what's driving the prices. If an investor can park his money into US Treasury bonds and get a 2.4% yield for a 1 year maturity, or something much smaller for Corporate, Municipal, or European national bank bonds, why would he do anything other than buy US bonds?

And who is actually lending to the European treasuries at 0% interest rates? Why wouldn't they lend to the US instead for a much better deal? Does the expected EUR:USD exchange rate play a role in this? Is it expected that Euros will gain value relative to the dollar in the future? That's the only thing I can imagine would explain that.",finance

personalfinance,At what rate should I pay off my car loan?,"I just recently bought a newer used car for 10k (2k down, 8k loan). It was a private sale, loan is through my local credit union. Payments are $206 per month with a 6.74% interest rate. I have the money in my account to pay it off outright but I'm trying to build credit. 


I have no other debt-I pay off my credit card every month, and paid off my student loans last year. I have about 20k in the bank at the moment. I'm 26, bills are pretty minimal- total $5-600 per month, making about 2k a month if any of that matters. 



I was given the advice- by a family friend who used to set up car loans- to make minimum payments for 1 year and then pay it off outright- which would supposedly give me the max credit boost for this loan. I'm just trying to see what is the best way to do this- I am financially illiterate so any advice is appreciated. Obviously I'd like to build as little interest as possible- but I also want to maximize credit built through this loan. 


Would it be better to make larger payments so I build less interest and pay it off sooner without having to make a large lump sum at the end? Should I stick to minimum payments? Longer/shorter than one year necessary?

personalfinance,"I'm returning to school for a second degree, and need help deciding which option makes the most sense financially.","I graduated in June of 2018 with a BA in psychology. In September of 2019 I will be returning to school to complete a BSN to become a registered nurse. My top choice program (school A) is an accelerated program that is 2.5 years in length. The rest of the programs I applied to (let's collectively call them school B) are all 4 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

School A's tuition is \~$4,000 per year. School B's tuition per year is between $7,000 and $8,000. So if I choose school A, I will be saving a ton of money in tuition fees alone, not even accounting for the fact that I will be able to work as a nurse a full year and a half sooner. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, due to the location of school A, I will be paying significantly more in living expenses across my 2.5 years of studying there than I would be at school B. From what I've seen, rent for a decent 1 bedroom is anywhere between $1000 and $2000 a month. I will have enough saved by that point to cover tuition completely, and a month or two of rent, but that's all. Although I qualify for federal student loans, the amount that I qualify for will not be sufficient to cover living expenses for the duration of the program. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have good credit, and am looking into taking out a student LOC (variable interest rate, but currently 3.95%) to be able to live somewhat comfortably so that I can go to my first choice program and graduate a year and a half sooner. The only debt I have currently is the \~$16,000 I owe on my federal student loan for my first degree, with a floating interest rate of 6.45%. I will not have to make any payments on this loan when I go back to being a full time student. 

&amp;#x200B;

Basically my question is, would it be smarter to choose school A where I will have to take out a LOC to help cover my living expenses, but where I'll be graduating and working a year and a half sooner?

personalfinance,"Mortgage Lender offering to redo our mortgage for a lower monthly bill, same time frame, higher interest rate. Good idea? (USA)","Hello,

We recently bought a house about two years ago with a first time homeowners FHA loan, 30 years at 3.875%. Of course, we had to get the PMI insurance.

We originally had a total bill of about $2120 the first year, then about $2250 the second year (because we weren't putting enough into escrow for taxes and homeowners insurance). This year they warned us it's going to go up to about $2300 to cover the taxes that are going up and such.

We called and asked if there was someway we could lower the bill.

Here are the details they gave us:

We can refinance with them for free. Our house has gone up in value from $310K to $350K, we still owe about $300K on the house.

They will move us to a lower costing PMI, but we will have to change our interest rate from the 3.875% to something around 4.1 - 4.2% (fixed). The length of the loan is the same as the length we have left on our current loan (a little under 28 years). Neither loan will have any pre-payment fees and we can pay either one off early.

They crunched the numbers and it works out to a savings of about $30 a month, which, while not super significant, is tempting.

What we currently do is throw a little extra money to our mortgage each month (about $50, so.... $2300).

But starting next month our Mortgage WILL be $2300 (or $2270 if we refinance) and it will be difficult to throw any extra cash towards it.

personalfinance,Does capitalisation of interest affect my student loans if interest is compounded daily?,"Basically, I noticed something weird when looking at my student loan statements: they appear to be in deferment even though I've been repaying them consistently since graduation. I haven't been as diligent in my record-keeping as I should have been, but I noticed that some outstanding interest appears to have been capitalised recently, as the principal has gone *up* in the last few months.

My googling has turned up conflicting results: on the one hand, sources are telling me that I only pay interest on interest once that interest is capitalised. On the other side, I was always taught that interest is calculated based on the whole amount, not just the original sum? This is the formula I've been using, for a 6.41 interest rate compounded daily:

&gt;=\[Existing balance\]\*(1+(.0641/365))\^d,

where d is the number of days between payments. Based on this formula, capitalisation wouldn't make a whit of difference because I'm *already* paying interest on interest. What am I missing here? And, should I be lighting a fire under the hindquarters of my student loan provider for randomly deferring my loans *without* a request and then capitalising the interest, or should I let it slide since I'm still 'paid ahead'?

MachineLearning,[D] Why is MLP working similar to RNN for text generation,"I was trying to perform text generation using only a character level feed-forward neural network after having followed [this tutorial](https://machinelearningmastery.com/text-generation-lstm-recurrent-neural-networks-python-keras/) which uses LSTM. I one-hot encoded the characters of my corpus which gave a vector of length 45. Then I concatenated every 20 characters and fed this 20\*45 length vector as input to an MLP with the 21st character's one hot as the output.

Thus my X (input data) shape is -&gt; (144304, 900) and my Y (output data) shape is -&gt; (144304, 45)

Here's the output from my code:

personalfinance,Sketchy but profitable (200$) offer from local credit union,"Hey!

So today I got an offer in the mail for a local credit union, Air Academy Federal Credit Union. 

[They also have the offer online.](https://aafcu.com/doublemoney)

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: the offer is that if you open a checking account with them with at least 200$, if you make 4 purchases with their debit card (according to the fine print, it doesn't seem like there is a minimum amount for this, any purchase counts), they will invest 50$ back into your checking account for a total of 200$ (max 4 transactions apply to this deal).

&amp;#x200B;

It sounds great! As soon as I saw it I visited the site and started to sign up. But then I caught myself a bit... Paused the application, and looked up reviews online. They are TERRIBLE. They have multiple locations and every one of them has a 2-star average rating or WORSE, with plenty of bad reviews to read. This obviously sketched me out a bit, but the deal still looks good. 

&amp;#x200B;

If I were to open this account, I am only doing it for the free money. I don't want to actually bank with them. I'd just open the account, satisfy the requirements to get the free money, and withdraw everything and close the account as soon as I could. I read all the fine print on their site and the physical mail-offer, and nothing I could find on there was alarming, however the seeming lack of information in the fine print and the fact that this is such a good deal with a credit union that has terrible reviews makes me wary of this offer to say the least. Can anyone provide me with some advice, or maybe someone has had an experience with this credit union they would like to share? 

&amp;#x200B;

Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks

The last few months I've had a good chunk of change left in my account that I just let linger, figure I should do something more productive with it.

 \- Car (I owe about 10k left and I've been doing 2 payments a month @ 350 each)

Should I just take everything I have left over in my checkings and throw it at the car then the HELOC? The car is a really low interest rate (3.7) and the HELOC is 4.5 for a year however I cannot pay more than the base minimum for a short period.

I'm a 20 year old business student with ~$20k in federal student loan debt. I'm in the 3rd year of a 5 year program at my university which offers a co-op program (6 months of full-time work at a company that you interview for and then go back to classes). I've already done 1 co-op and have already accepted another offer for the next cycle which begins in July. I also plan on doing one more from July 2020 - December 2020.

I've saved up a lot of money from the first co-op and will be earning ~$34/hr from my second. I plan on contributing the $6,000 max. towards a roth IRA ($1,000 per month). I'd like to know if I should be spending the rest to become debt-free until the Spring 2020 semester (coupled with my current savings which should cover over half of what I owe).

personalfinance,Time to get serious about student loan payments.,"I have a large amount of student loan debt, roughly 90K spread over 5 loans. Looking at NerdWallet they recommend: Education Loan Finance, Commonbond, Earnest, SoFi, LendKey, Laurel Road, PenFed, and Citizens One.

Is it more beneficial to consolidate my loans into one or to refinance each one individually? I'm unsure if this makes a difference. I have above 750 credit and make about 70K a year.

personalfinance,I bought too much car. What are my options?,"Facts: 

2016 Dodge Grand Caravan SXT purchased **NEW** in 2016.

60,000 miles 

Original Loan length: 8 years 

Payment: $454/mo 

Interest rate: 3.49% 

Original loan amount: $33,600

I currently owe: $22,258 

Expected payoff date: June 2024 

KBB value: $11-14k

Story Time: We bought this with the plans to grow our family. Financial situation changed and we decided not to expand.

Starting to feel like this is a waste of cash.

I asked my local dealer what my options are with them and they said there is nothing they can do unless I trade it in for another new car since it has an outstanding loan balance. He said this is because they can roll the remaining balance over to the new loan. But they can't do that if I wanted a pre owned car because rolling over a loan isn't allowed by law when purchasing a pre owned vehicle. Probably bullshit?

So I'm wondering, what are my options to get out of my commitment without impacting my credit score? This monthly payment is killing me and freeing up half the payment would help.

My plans are to purchase a used car (cash) for less than 10k but would it just be wiser to pay $10k on the loan and then trade in for something more economic?

TIA

Update to address some of the questions from comments: 

* Yep. I realize that this was a stupid decision. Thanks for pointing it out.
* Earlier I said that I paid $37k for the van. I just checked my loan origin paperwork and it turns out I actually financed $33,600 for the car (minus trade in valued at $2k) so the total paid was $35,600, which includes a regrettable couple of upsells: a LOF plan for $300 and gap insurance for $900, which was a requirement of the lender. Again, stupid decision.",finance

personalfinance,How to proceed from here?,"To start, I have looked at the sidebar and flowchart. I am still feeling like I know next to nothing about finances at all. 

Am currently 20 years old, am married, and in the military. I make ~3500/month take home pay. My wife works part time and makes anywhere from 500 to 1000 a month. I am paying for all the bills/expenses (aside from a few meals and the cat) which in total have came out to around ~2800. Leaving me with ~700 left. Since I pay for the majority of expenses I like to only account for my pay when planning. 

The debt I have is my car loan, I have ~5300 on it left with a 6.14% interest rate. I pay much more than minimum required. In about a month and a half I will be getting a bonus  of around 8K (heavily taxed though so only taking home around 5K) and was planning at knocking out this car loan with the bonus.

I currently invest 10% of my gross pay and the military matches up to 5% for a total of 15% to my TSP.  I don’t really know what an IRA is or if I need one since I already have TSP.

I have about 2.3K  in a savings  account but it has low interest rate. Have heard of Online HYSA but don’t know much about those either (I’ve seen Ally recommended a lot with a 2.2%, but I’ve also seen a Marcus account that hasn’t been recommended with a 2.25% rate). I also have 3K in a mutual fund account with USAA, hoping it can grow so I won’t be touching it. 

As stated, I don’t really know what to do to put myself in a better state financially, would appreciate any advice I can get and I can add more details if needed.",finance

personalfinance,Cannot get my FICO score up for the life of me,"I've been sitting at 730 for awhile now. The past year two years I've graduated college, earned a salary (which I have listed), paid off over 8 student loans, etc.

Briefly my credit went up to 760 for awhile, but in the past six months I'm down to 720 and I cannot figure out why.

I use my credit card for gas about twice a month and pay it off immediatly.

I've been paying off loans at a crazy rate...I've noticed my score will drop like 10 points, stay there, maybe move up 5-10, then go back down, etc. 

I figured whatever 720 isn't bad...But my brother showed me his and it's almost 800....He hasn't paid off as much of his student loans as me and makes less money...I don't get why his is so much higher. He does have like 3 credit cards though. I only have one. (Maybe that's part of the reason?)

My only remaining loans are a car loan and a student loan I took out when I was 18.

My mother wanted to pay it off herself since I had a lot more student loans (federal, some other private ones)

One thing with this credit union is they do not do online payments. You have to mail a check or go in to a branch with a check.

I've noticed her saying things like ""here's the due date, but it's not really late until they charge a fee"" (2 weeks later)

I guess she's been going to a branch a week or two after the payment's due to pay the loan in both our names. Has that been hurting my credit?

I paid off all of my other loans and just told her I can take it over. She was hesitant say ""no, I want to pay it off"" etc. 

I'm not mad at all, she has good intentions and was trying to help. I took it over, plan on going into a branch three times with huge checks and just paying the damn thing off (it's roughly $2,500, but 6 years left on term)

Another thing I've noticed with them....I have a car loan with them and have to pay them checks through the mail. Every time they cash it, they cash it a day after it's due. It's due the 28th of every month. I get it about the 20th-21st. I send it out (dated) usually the 22nd.

I noticed its not cashed until atleast a week later. I can look online to view payment history and it's consistantly cashed one day after it's due. Every time. The 29th. Could that be hurting my credit as well?

...Also, how can I look into my credit history/accounts open under my name? I think it's time to do a check on that as well.",finance

MachineLearning,"[P] Documentating my Machine Learning Journey #1, 2, 3: Choosing Neural Machine Translating as my project, preprocessing the data, and building the model","Hey, I decided to start documenting my Machine Learning journey. I have just finished a few courses in Machine Learning, and I feel like I am prepared to create my own projects, build my own model, and make actual usable products! 

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to share these to reddit, because I know there's a lot of people subscribed to this subreddit that are fascinated by Machine Learning. However, they are just pondering and wondering and simply not taking action. But I will be here posting everyday on my progress, and maybe you will see me for 100th day posting in a row and finally deciding to learn Machine Learning yourself :) 

&amp;#x200B;

Alright, here's everything I did and learned in the recent 3 days: 

&amp;#x200B;

Since I just finished [deeplearning.ai](https://deeplearning.ai), I am still familiar with sequence models, and I decided to choose to build neural machine translator as my first project (specifically Spanish to English). I quickly found a tutorial on it, from [machinelearningmastery.com](https://machinelearningmastery.com), it covered text to text generation from gathering the data =&gt; cleaning the data =&gt; building the model =&gt; evaluating the model. I usually like to implement these tutorials just by copy and pasting first, then reading it through once, then opening a new file and trying to implement the project with just pseudocode. 

Data preprocessing was probably the hardest part programmatically, the dataset I used had pairs of English =&gt; Spanish translation separated by tabs and every single pair is separated from another pair with a line. After refreshing myself on python functions such as split() and strip(), I learned how to turn that specific dataset into a 2d array where each element in the 2d array is an array containing a pair of translation. Then, I just used Kera's tokenizer and turned those strings into integers so our model can learn from it. 

Onto building the model, this just can't be easier. It was really just 5 lines of code with Keras. I refreshed my knowledge on the Encoder-Decoder neural machine translation model when I was trying to implement the tutorial from scratch. And there was basically a bi-directional LSTM network that accepted embedded words as inputs, the output of the this LSTM network is fed through an attention network, the attention network outputs context, and those contexts are fed into the 2nd LSTM network. The output of the 2nd LSTM network are fed through a softmax layer to finally get the output we want. Everything is pretty intuitional. We use word embedding to give words features so they actual have a mathematical meaning. We use LSTM because texts are sequential data. We use an attention layer because we want to capture what words and how many words do we want to look at when generating the output of a specific timestamp. In Keras, these are literally done with model.add(Embedding(...)), model.add(LSTM(...)), etc. 

I then ran [model.fit](https://model.fit)(), and the results quickly came back, it wasn't the best because it was just a test run and I only used 10,000 examples, so the model probably haven't seen half of the words I am feeding in for it to spit out a response. 

I think a quick project like this really makes me think about the macro of ML as a whole. I still have a long way to figure out what the center of ML is in, what are the real challenges of ML (I really don't know if it is getting the dataset or scaling it up or reiterating and improving the model, I feel like it is highly situational ofcourse).

personalfinance,Should I refinance my 4.35% APR FHA loan into conventional loan?,"My spouse and I originally financed our home back in 2013 with FHA loan at 3.625% interest rate. We streamlined the loan in 2015 to lower the PMI. Same Interest rate with APR of 4.35%. Recently my mortgage company called to ask if we wanted to refinance. I dismissed the idea thinking interest rate would be higher and would only remove the PMI (currently $238 per month). I have been reading that rates are really low now but not sure how low it would be. A google search shows interest rate is approx 4.25%.

At the time we did the original mortgage we put down approx 15% of loan. We were naive and did not research or know what PMI was or even if we can get approved for a conventional loan. We also did not have the additional $20,000 to meet the 20%. Thinking back, I could have ask family for a loan. I kick myself for not doing so. This option is not available now.

If we are to refinance, I believe we have two options. We can take the additional funds from 401k to meet the 20% to avoid PMI or have the home appraised for a higher value and our equity would meet the 20%. 

The original purchase price is $420,000 with $60,000 down at a 3.625% Interest rate. Would it make sense to refinance to get rid of PMI or wait another six years where supposedly the MPI should be removed. 

When the mortgage company called I thought it would be best to ride out the current loan but I am not certain. Any feedback is greatly appreciated.

Thank you!

personalfinance,Collection agency charging an extra 3K on student debt!!!,"Hello there, general audience. Allow me to give you some background.....

Along time ago, in another state far, far away... after enduring years of physical and verbal abuse, my father threatened to kick me out of the house if I didn't go to an expensive, private university he assured me he was going to pay (or so he could brag about he was paying). 
Guess what! He paid one semester, told me to continue on the next semester by taking a private loan promising me it was only a temporary problem he will pay and promptly take care of it.
Guess what he did next!! Yeap, he didn't paid crap. 
I was left in in a perfectly balanced shitty situation, as all things shouldn't be. On one hand, I could not continue my studies at said university because it was too damn expensive, and on the other, I couldn't transfer because said university wouldn't release my transcripts until I paid what I owed. To top it all off, this was back during the financial maelstrom of the late 2000s.

After nearly dying from an illness, but on my feet again, I find my self being able to paid this debt. A collection agency recently took away my federal return. I called said CA (collection agency) and said I owe 10k. Now, after calling the University I previously went to, verifying that I owe 10k and them providing them with the number of CA. I called again, but now they want an extra 3k!!!! They said the University is charging me that extra amount.
Can they do that, extra fees for what?

Should I request a letter from said university telling me what is the actual debt I owe.
Should I request a letter from the CA, telling me what is the actual debt and also, shouldn't both of those numbers match?

Here's a list I have compiled with reasons why CB is in my opinion a great exchange:

* Partly decentralized exchange built on the Bitshares blockchain.
   * Trading takes place on the Bitshares blockchain, i.e. is fully decentralized.
   * Deposits and withdrawals are currently centralized via the CryptoBridge gateway (basically CB is holding your funds and issues you correspondding I-Owe-You Bitshares assets).
   * Federated gateways are on the roadmap and will further decentralize CB as everyone will be able to run a similar gateway to process deposits and withdrawals. However, federated gateways will not launch any time soon.
* Due to the blockchain trading, trading is 100% transparent. You see every trade of every user (which can help to make educated guesses when trading), which also means that no fake volume is possible and market manipulation can be easily spotted.
* Has a [market maker program](https://crypto-bridge.org/market-maker-program/) where you not only pay no trading fees, but you even get paid a bit for maker offers.
* Has  a native coin, [BridgeCoin BCO](https://crypto-bridge.org/bridgecoin/), which you can stake to earn a share of  the exchange's profits. Currently 75% of all trading fees paid are  distributed to BCO stakers.
* Has a ton of coins listed, both top marketcap coins as well as small/new coins.
* Has a quite powerful UI.
* Has very active developers who are also close to the community (discord channels).
* Has a very active community on discord.
* Offers live support on discord.
* Is working on a phone app (currently paused to focus on more important things).
* Publishes weekly [development updates](https://crypto-bridge.org/category/development/) and large [quarterly reports](https://crypto-bridge.org/category/development/quarterly-reports/).
* Wants to improve the overall cryptocurrency market/community with many educational initiatives, such as a partnership with [DARC](https://crypto-bridge.org/2019/01/19/focus-on-quality-darc-partnership/), to rate/analyze new coins (basically judging whether new projects are ""legit"" or just money grabs), quite detailed [information about some of the listed coins](https://crypto-bridge.org/category/promotional/) and also some blog posts and videos about Bitshares and CryptoBridge.

personalfinance,"State seized my tax return, need advice","I'll try to keep this short. I lived in Ohio in 2017 but moved away. Apparently they either never got the check I sent for my 2017 taxes, it bounced, or it's possible I forgot to pay it (I generally don't owe taxes so the latter is a possibility as I'm not used to it). The balance owed was 120. Between then and now I never got any letters or calls about this throughout 2018. Yes, I do look for state  marked mail. 

This year my entire federal refund was ~~garnished~~ offset due to this debt. If I did owe $120 I'm not contesting I needed to pay that along with a penalty, but my federal return was close to $1700. This seems excessively high for a $120 debt. What are my options here?

I am still waiting on the office the Ohio AG referred me to who is handling the debt to call me back. Any advice is appreciated. I still don't know whether they consider the debt satisfied in full or not.

EDIT: Refund was offset by the entire amount, not garnished. Also removed a ranty phrase.",finance

personalfinance,Help predicting a budget?,"Hello! I just got a job offer for when I will be graduating college in May. I will have maybe $300 in savings after paying off my tuition balance that student loans didn’t cover. 

My offer is for $41,500 a year. I will be eligible for overtime at time and a half (30/hr) but it isn’t often available. I am also eligible for a quarterly bonus but that’s heavily performance based and I don’t want to rely on that money. I want to act as if it isn’t there, and if I get it, throw it towards my student loans. 

I have had parental support for health insurance and phone bills but it will be abruptly stopping the day I start that job. My rent will still be free for 6 months. 

Can anyone help me estimate what a budget would look like on that salary, and what typical expenses would be?

Relevant information: I have multiple preexisting conditions, so I don’t have any idea how astronomical my health insurance will be, and my benefits package will be revealed to me a little later down the line. That’s my main concern. I have $75 a month in prescription copays on my current plan. I have $40 a month in copays for standing medical appointments and that’s not including $80 every three months for lab work- but again, this is all under my parents plan, and I don’t know how it will change. And this isn’t covering anything unexpected, this is all bare minimum to keep me alive. 

My rent will be free for six months, but after that a rented room within commuting distance of my job will be at minimum $800 a month. I want to get renters insurance as well. My research indicates most roommate situations around here include utilities in the flat fee. I will need first/last/security by the end of my six months. 

My car insurance I’m already paying for and is about 125/month. I own my car free and clear and average $60 a month in gas, but I only work part time, so since I’ll be commuting more often I’m guessing it’ll go up to $80?  

I’m not sure how to find the cheapest phone plan but I typically use about 7-8 gigs of data every month. Granted I use more lately because my current job is very, very slow and doesn’t have WiFi, so once I’m working a more fast paced job I’ll probably go back down to 5ish. The ones in my area average around $70 a month. 

My student loans are $71 a month for my private loans, and I’ll have $7423 for my federal loans, but they haven’t told me how much monthly that’ll be. I’m guessing my total minimum payment will be around $250, but maybe someone here has a better way to estimate that. (My parents have agreed to pay about $20,000 of additional loans off, but they’re unreliable at best. I have written documentation of their agreement to pay but I don’t know if it’s legally enforceable. So, if they screw up, my payments spike a lot higher, about double if I had to guess. So I need to have that room in my budget.) (I also have excellent credit and can’t risk them messing it up because they are technically in my name!)

I have no idea how much I could estimate my food costs to be. I do not eat out much, but when I do it’s always socially. I never eat out for fun. I spend maybe $50/month eating out, and that’s a quality of life expense I’d like to keep in my budget if possible. I generally am happy eating pretty cheap, I love this gourmet ramen that’s like $1/serving, I eat a lot of rice and pasta, eggs, etc. 

I don’t know how much I’ll be paying in taxes or how to estimate those withholdings. I generally for all my jobs have been having the maximum withholdings taken, because it’s a built in savings in my mind, and I’d rather get a refund than risk owing money I don’t have. I’m in MA. 

Lastly, I want to have enough money saved so that if I want to move away in a year or two I can. So I want to have more than just an emergency fund saved up, because I want to be able to pack my shit and take a job across the country as soon as I’ve been with my future employer either long enough to get a good reference or a transfer to a different location. So I don’t know how much that would cost, but saving for that comes right after emergency fund and retirement. 

I have been told if I really, really can’t afford to move out on my own, especially because of the health insurance and copays, I can stretch the six months thing, but honestly the situation I’m in is extremely emotionally toxic and the sooner I can get out the better. Six months is a firm but not absolute deadline. 

What am I forgetting to budget for? How much can I afford to contribute to retirement? How much do I need in savings? I’m pretty financially naive and awkwardly enough I got my job offer to be a “licensed relationship banker” so I’m sure I’ll learn a lot real quick but these first few months will be really rocky. Can I even live on this salary in such an expensive area? I’m kind of panicked about this honestly!",finance

However, my student loans never showed up for the questions. I clicked none of the above for everything and it failed to verify me.

personalfinance,Debt Settlement - Does It Work?,"Good morning - first time posting here (friend recommended it).

As of yesterday, I am enrolled in a Debt Settlement Program with Clear One Advantage. I am about 30k-ish in debt and with my monthly payments, I have more money coming out than I have coming in.

It was a desperation move and it all happened so quickly from applying to approval, that I didn't do my research. I've been reading a lot of reviews on the programs and just the company in general and it seems the basic structure is about the same for all of them, but I'm honestly super scared right now. I have read stories of success, and I have read stories of people being sued, garnished wages, property being taken, etc. even whilst in these programs and at this point.. I have no idea what I need to do..

Do these programs work? I've read to the best that I can about them and it seems that I am given a savings account to ""save"" money to pay off the settlements they negotiate, but during that time, no payments are being made. It's all so confusing. And even if the company chooses to never settle, I'm stuck with interest, the full charges, late fees, and just all the other BS that comes with being in default with a creditor.

Help?

EDIT: I'm based in Tennessee because I know that matters somewhat.

EDIT 2: I went with this because it seemed like a better option than bankruptcy, but now, I'm thinking that actually might be the best way to go.  


UPDATE: Finished a call with ACCC and they want to enter me into a debt consolidation program. It'll save me money in the long one since one of my creditors lowered my monthly payments as well as my interest rate. It's either this or bankruptcy.",finance

personalfinance,Refinance Offer Less Than 1 Year After Buying House?,"Hello PF!

&amp;#x200B;

I have a bit of a strange situation. I bought my house in September 2018 and had a mortgage of $252,000 with an interest rate of 4.75%, 30-yr fixed. It's with a local credit union, but I'm not particularly inclined to keep their patronage as they were not very good during the home-buying process.

&amp;#x200B;

Chase just offered to refinance to 4.334%, 30-yr fixed if I pay 1 point (which I can afford without compromising savings). It seems like a great opportunity to save quite a bit of money (based on what I have left, it's around $25k) over the life of the loan, but it also seems insanely early to refinance on the loan.

&amp;#x200B;

At the same time, I am wary of interest rates potentially going up in the future, so I don't know if I might have an opportunity to refinance at a later date.

&amp;#x200B;

Are there any reasons why I should refinance this early? Are there any reasons I should not refinance this early?",finance

stocks,Ladybaybee recommended stock picks 2019-03-29,"[Link to imgur showing picks, details of picks and ledger (8 images total)](https://imgur.com/a/HumtCYU)

**HOW I USE THIS:** 

1) All the stocks identified in the table are qualified as “BUY” opportunities.

2) I focus in the column “Success Rate(3m)” which shows the precision of the agents in the last 3 calendar months. I personally feel most comfortable with Rates 0.8 or higher. 

3) Then, I see the number in “Tx(3m)” which represents the number of transactions that the agents predicted for this stock in the last 3 months. I prefer stocks that have had at least two transactions during this period. 

4) Finally, I look at Growth(3m), if the agents have had a considerable growth (&gt;5% in 3 months) then I follow that trade. 

5) If a row in the table is colored green then it means that stock has been on the rise today so I purchase it immediately in order to ride the wave up. On the other hand, if the row is colored red, then I wait out until very close to market close to purchase the stock and let the price bottom out before climbing up again tomorrow.


6) After I purchase the stocks, I ALWAYS set a stop loss order at -2.5% from my buying price valid for the day. I think this is good hygiene, no matter how confident I am of my system, I still want to make sure that my losses are capped. I update this stop loss order every day. 


**BACKGROUND**

I am not a financier or economist. I am electrical engineer with equal passion in artificial intelligence and financial markets. For the past 2 years I have been working on a system that would make short term predictions of stocks. The system is rather complex, I use multiple layers which include: Convolutional Neural Networks, LSTMs and Genetic Algorithms. All bulked together produce an output like in this image. The way to interpret the image is a follows: Symbol and Date columns are self explanatory, Quorum refers to autonomous agents that decide whether to BUY/NOT BUY or SELL/HOLD a stock. Each symbol has 9 agents, and the Quorum column, counts the number of agents that recommend Buy, Selling or Holding the stock. The “Not Owned” column means: if you don’t own this stock then you should … The “Owned” column means: if you own this stock you should HOLD or SELL. The column “Growth(1 Year)” refers to what what has been the growth of this system of Agents in the past calendar year. The column “Tx(1Yr)” shows the number of full transactions that these agents recommended in the last calendar year. “Factor” is just the division of Growth divided by Transactions to get the average growth per transaction. Finally “Success Rate” shows how successful these agents have been in their recommendations in the past calendar year, success 1 means 100% successful, 0.5 means 50% successful, and so on.

Many people have been curious about the actual process that the system follows, so here it is: for every symbol (600 stocks are analyzed daily), we get the full stock data (open,close,high,low,volume) for the past 4 months. Each stock is associated with another set of “lookalike” stocks as well as major ETF’s. This initial dataset is run through a convolutional layer that extracts an undisclosed number of features. These features are then passed onto a recurrent neural network (LSTM) where sequences and patterns are extracted. The LSTM then spits out probabilities for the likelihood that this stock will have a positive, negative and neutral tendency in the next N days. These probabilities are then fed to a genetic evolution system (GES). This system essentially checks the predictions for the past N days and compares them with reality, following that the systems knows which predictions are performing the best. Once the system knows which stocks are being simulated the best, then the system automatically finds which of these best performing stocks have the biggest potential for the next few days. The system does not output explanations, unfortunately us humans are not capable of understanding (or visualizing) a problem of this dimensionality, for example the LSTM part alone works with over 10 million dimensions, not features but dimensions.

personalfinance,Car buying conundrum,"Went to Brandon Honda in Tampa Florida to get a 2012 Nissan Pathfinder Silver 4wd. During the test drive I noticed an odd vibration when applying the brakes. Sales guy said that all cars go through a 188 point inspection.  I told him to take it back again and check the brakes. He came back and said they found no issues and that it must be the ABS system I was feeling.

I stupidly agree and we purchase the vehicle. I drive it back to Gainesville FL, and have it checked out at Fischer's Auto, and they say that the rotors are warped, the pads are low, and the calipers may be dragging. Which would explain that vibration when slowing down.  We call Brandon Honda and their service people say to take it to the Honda dealer here in Gainesville to repair them. The guys at the Honda dealership in Gainesville also agree that rotors and pads need to be replaced.

I get a call today from the guys down at Brandon Honda that the original loan didn't go through and that they need us to sign a loan application for another bank (which at least has a lower interest rate).  I have the form filled out and ready to send back to them at the moment.  Do I have any leverage on them to follow through with paying for the brake repairs before I send them the application form for the new bank? Or is my head in their vice?

personalfinance,Sanity Check on Refinancing Student Loans,"I graduated in May 2016 with a engineering BS degree. My parents and I were confused about loans/ paying for college and took out \~180k in Stafford and Parent PLUS loans (all federal). I'm thinking about refinancing two of their PLUS loans into my name in a private loan and am coming here to see if I'm missing anything.

&amp;#x200B;

**What we have left (all Parent PLUS federal loans):**

$37,132.65 at 6.16%

$24,291.81 at 6.96%

$49.52 at 6.96%

$21,037.63 at 6.59%

$19,581.52 at 6.59%

(Total $102,093.13)

&amp;#x200B;

**Income:**

$5367/ month after taxes and a little extra because I tutor on the side (maybe $100).

My salary is 101k and my parents are both high earners as well. My company contributes 8% to my 401k (not a match - 8% regardless of what I put in - so I don't contribute anything right now). 

&amp;#x200B;

**Monthly spending:**

I live at home in NYC. I basically only pay for food, transportation, and entertainment, but have tried to live super lean because I was throwing every extra penny at the Parent PLUS loans.

\~$300 on expenses

$5100 to student loans every month

&amp;#x200B;

**Assets:**

Cash - $28,519.87

Retirement Accounts - $19,729.90

No liabilities/ debts

&amp;#x200B;

I am thinking about refinancing the 24k and 19k loan into my name. I found First Republic and they have really great rates. If I have a 5 year term and leave 5k in their checking account, my interest rate will be 2.2% with no origination or account fees.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are the two courses of action I see:

1. Continue throwing $5100 at the loans per month and finish what I agreed to pay before the end of the year. I would also throw 20k of my cash at the loan immediately.
2. Refinance and pay about 1k/ month for four years. With First Republic, you get reimbursed on the interest you pay if you pay off your loan within 4 years. I would invest 20k of my cash and continue investing any extra money at the end of the month.

&amp;#x200B;

I am 24 and would like to move out at the beginning of next year. This would add some huge expenses (around 2k for NYC), but I think I would be able to afford it even if I refinance my loan. I love math, so I ran some simulations and it looks like I come out ahead 2.2k if I refinance assuming a 4.5% ROI. Is this worth the risk of losing federal protections? There is also some contention with my dad over how much I should pay back. It's a long story, but I think I have some valid reasons which add to why I'm hesitant to refinance but also might be a good reason to separate our finances once and for all.

&amp;#x200B;

personalfinance,Just saved 0.375% on our mortgage that we would have missed due to lender being lazy!,"If you're closing on a mortgage in the near term, make sure you press your lender for a rate adjustment.  Per WSJ article from yesterday (3/28): "" The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage fell to 4.06% this week, its lowest since January 2018, according to data released Thursday by Freddie Mac, the mortgage-finance giant. The rate was down nearly a quarter point from a week earlier, its biggest drop in over a decade. ""

I pressed our lender on a rate adjustment two days ago (3/27) after the news that the Fed had no plans to raise rates again in 2019.  Our lender claimed that ""Freddie was holding rates steady"".  I forwarded the quote above and asked him to explain.  After some back and forth we're now closing and **4% vs the 4.375%** we were quoted a month ago.  This will end up saving us **$5,500** in interest over our estimated hold.  We will close a week later but given our circumstances this isn't an issue.

I trust that this was laziness vs malice as he now needs to have it underwritten again.  Aggravating and deceptive nonetheless.  Just a reminder to watch out for yourself.",finance

In the last few months, my wife and I leased two cars from Volkswagen. We entered both leases being upside down on our previous vehicles, about $7000 on each. The dealership told us we had to lease since our credit was too low for a 72 month loan. Long story short, I decided to refinance both cars under 72 month loans through VWCredit a few months later to avoid the rent charge eating up half of our payments and our terms are $610 for a 2019 Jetta S with a current balance of $34019 and $814 a month for a 2019 Tiguan SE 4Motion with a loan balance of $45,443. Both loans are on a 8.69% interest rate. I know I’m severely upside down on both cars, I’m wondering what I should do to minimize the damage or what can I plan to do in the future? Credit unions won’t refinance us because of how upside down the cars are. My wife and I currently take home around $4000 a month and our bills are around $1500 a month for rent, $260 a month for car insurance, and $205 in credit card debt.",finance
personalfinance,Use Credit Card Cash Advance To Pay Down Underwater Car Loan?,"tl;dr - After rolling along negative equity from multiple vehicles, I ended up paying $34k for a new vehicle worth \~$24k. I have paid the vehicle loan down to $25,500, and can do a shortsell at CarMax/Carvana for \~$20k. (Private sales near me are going for \~$1500 more, but not worth the headache to me) Should I use my credit card cash advances to be able to sell this vehicle immediately, and not continue to fight against depreciation/mental burden?

&amp;#x200B;

Now for the real post: I am 25 years old working in digital marketing with a salary of \~$48-55k/yr. My major debts are school loans and my car, which are at $14k and $25.5k, respectively; and no personal/credit card debt. 

&amp;#x200B;

Although I am happy with the vehicle purchases I have made over the past few years since entering the work force (CPO Camry, to CPO BMW 3-series, to new Ford Mustand), I am beginning to look to the future, and the allure of home ownership and no vehicle debt is really appealing. I'd like to start saving for a larger apartment (currently 560 sqft for 2 people), as well as eventually for a home down payment. I understand the negative equity I've been rolling along with these car purchases has been a major burden on my finances, but I have been able to successfully manage my debts and to me, this cost is worth the experiences I've enjoyed with these vehicles.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to sell the car as quickly as possible. After a recent credit card approval (thx FICO score of 790!), I now have the available funds as credit card cash advances to pay it down and sell it this weekend.

&amp;#x200B;

Savings: 1100

Credit card cash advance 1: 3000 @ 27.24 APR with 5% fee of $150

Credit card 2: 1100 @ \~27% APR and 3% fee of $33

Credit card 3: 600 @ \~28% APR with 5% fee of 30

&amp;#x200B;

So when putting it all together : 25500 - 1100 - 3000 - 1100 - 600 = $19700, which should be low enough to sell quickly. I would accumulate fees of &lt;$250, but I predict that is equivalent to the amount I would pay over 6 months of additional depreciation. 

I would be fighting off higher interest rates for the cash advances, but with an aggressive payment schedule I would have these resolved in about 5 months.

My family has several vehicles I can choose to drive, all older fully paid vehicles with lower insurance rates.

To finish painting the full picture, here are my monthly expenses, which I am including to satisfy any curiosity, but am aware of what can be cut back and changed.

Rent: 768

Student loans: 175

Car payment: 440

Car insurance: 138

Phone: 55

Utilities: 50

Internet: 90 (could be cut back but I live my life on the internet :D)

Food, entertainment, all other expenses: 600 (working on cutting back on this)

remainder goes into savings and investment accounts and some few fun things

&amp;#x200B;

My thought process goes like this: although I could earn a bit more from a private sale, I don't want the burden of dealing with the bank and a private seller, nor do I really want to spare the time doing this outside of work, so it's a small price to pay for the ease. And although I could simply continue to pay the car aggressively while owning it, the idea of having no car loan (and a much lower monthly minimum) feels like a great warmth from a safety blanket I could achieve in just a few days. I know there are better options if I just had some patience, but I just wanted to get the thoughts from Reddit before I tried anything. I hope you understand where I'm coming from, and how the allure of removing a huge debt feels like a great burden being lifted, but if you think the idea is truly too stupid to attempt please let me know and I'll try my best not to take it personally :P",finance

investing,"In Ethiopia Crash, Faulty Sensors on Boeing 737 Max Are Suspected","&gt;A similar series of events involving faulty sensor data and an automated system suspected in bringing down a Boeing plane in Indonesia may have also caused the crash of the same type of jet in Ethiopia in March, according to people who have been briefed on the contents of the black box in Ethiopia.  
&gt;  
&gt;Data from a vane-like device, called an angle-of-attack sensor, incorrectly activated the automatic, computer-controlled system, called MCAS, which pushed the nose of the plane down, eventually leading to a crash that killed all 157 people aboard.  
&gt;  
&gt;The black box, also called the flight data recorder, contains information on dozens of systems aboard the plane. The black boxes on both planes, Boeing’s latest generation of the 737, survived the crashes, allowing investigators to begin piecing together what caused the disasters. Both investigations are ongoing and no final determinations have been made.  
&gt;  
&gt;There are two angle-of-attack sensors on the Boeing 737 Max, one attached to the fuselage on the pilot’s side and another on the co-pilot’s side. Investigators in Indonesia, who have produced a preliminary report and released some of the information from the box, saw that one sensor produced a reading that was at least 20 degrees different from the other as the plane took off and began its ascent.  
&gt;  
&gt;The system was programmed to use data from only one of the sensors, which on that flight was malfunctioning. With the bad data, MCAS was activated, erroneously pushing the nose of the plane down. The pilots on the Indonesian flight tried repeatedly to override the system, but after about 12 minutes lost their battle and the plane crashed.  
&gt;  
&gt;None of the people briefed could say whether the black box data indicated how or whether the Ethiopian pilots tried to counteract the system. But the same bouncing, bobbing trajectory of the plane seen in the Indonesian flight as the pilots tried to save the plane is apparent in publicly available flight data for the Ethiopian plane.  
&gt;  
&gt;Air traffic controllers in Ethiopia also said they saw the oscillating trajectory before the plane crashed. The pilot radioed back that he was having trouble controlling the aircraft, but did not give details on what systems were causing problems.

I'm looking for a new bank or credit union to set up a checking account (that I can join as a nondescript individual in the SF Bay Area...). Primarily I would like to be able to *easily* send ACH transfers to my landlord (not wire transfers, not mail checks, not use a bill pay service that will actually mail a check, not send a carrier pigeon with gold coins, etc; you get the point).

Requirements:
- Must be able to send outgoing ACH transfers with just a routing and account number (account name is fine too, whatever). Very very very preferable to have this process be available through a website or app.
- Must *NOT* have a complex setup procedure (verifying small payments and all that nonsense).
- Should not use a third-party provider like Zelle which has absurdly low transfer limits. If it's at least a $6k daily limit, I'll consider it.
- No minimum balance fees, or other nonsense.

Desirable features:
Good interest rates on savings, or even checking accounts.

-I understand that Ally Bank appears to allow this. Correct me if I am wrong, please. Looking for other options still though!-

Also *please* spare me the ""ooh the US banking system is so backwards, in Europe it's so easy"" nonsense. Yes I know that. No I do not currently desire to move to Europe. See the problem?

Thanks for the help!

**Update:** Opened an Ally account. Turns out their representative on the phone lied to me. You need to verify the recipient account before you can initiate direct ACH transfers. Their version of Zelle is unusual in that it accepts an account+routing number, but that comes with a much lower limit of $5000, as mentioned in the comments.

I am currently a Software Engineer. Salary of 62.5k, expecting a raise soon, just hitting 2 years out of college at 24 years of age. I work my butt off and take overtime any time its offered. I also am starting to pursue my masters degree, fully funded by my company. I've been with my current company 7 months, very stable government work, no I can't discuss it in more detail. I am not afraid to jump around if it makes more money - however I have to stay at my current job at least 1 year after I complete my masters degree, or I contractually must pay them back.

Here are some numbers.

&amp;nbsp;

**Monthly Pay After Taxes and Deductions**

* $3480

**Investments/Retirement Fund**

* 401k - 4% contributions with company match.
* Roth IRA - $4,000, not currently contributing (rolled over previous 401k from last job)

**My current expenses (estimates):** 

* Truck: $24,000 Remaining - $380 per month

* Ezpass Tolls: ~$100 per month ($5 bridge toll per day) 

**Student loans remaining:** 

* $23,000 @ 7.35%
* $5,700 @ 3.61%
* $7,350 @ 4.04%
* $4,900 @ 3.51%

* Fun money: $100 per month - this includes eating out, game purchases, etc 

**Total: $1550 per month** 

**Leftover: $1930 per month**

&amp;nbsp;

**Additional information:**

* As you may have figured from my budget, I still live with my parents. They are very well off and pay for my food, insurance, and phone bill. 

* I dont use or have a credit card, however I do plan on getting one soon to reap the rewards while treating it like a debit card (immediate payoff).

* My ""minimum"" loan payments are actually not accurate. I setup auto-deposit for an amount above the minimum, so no matter what I always pay more than minimum. Auto-pay also netted me an interest rate discount.

* Currently I have a small amount in an emergency fund ~3k. I have not been building it further because I have wonderful parents who will help me with emergency expenses.

*  At the end of each month, any excess savings i have get dumped into my highest interest rate loan.

* My starting debt was 115k of student loans - I received no financial aid due to my parent's status, however my parents paid for 1 year of my loans upon graduation.

* At the end of each month, I dump my excess savings into my highest interest rate student loan.

* Any bonus or overtime money I recieve buys my girlfriend and I a nice dinner, the rest gets dumped into a loan.

* I really don't vacation much. I feel as if I don't have the money. I take extended weekends occasionally and hike, camp etc. Not large money pits.

&amp;nbsp;

I already know what the first thing everyone will say is. Get rid of the truck. 

Heres some more info on that: 

* My parents own the truck outright, I am paying back an interest free loan to them on it. Parents have agreed I can pause or resume payments whenever I like - but I love my parents and want to pay them back. 

* I also am currently commuting 3 hours per day. (1 1/2 each way). Reliability and comfort are very important because of this. (Hence new and large)

* It is was purchased brand new in mid 2017, a near base model with 4x4, which is very useful here, it snows a lot.

* I already put 42k miles on it and had to put on new tires. 

* Sitting upright in a truck helps to eliminate my back pain.

* Average 22mpg on my commute - not terrible, but not great.

* I've become the family member and friend that helps people move big things, truck has been very useful.



&amp;nbsp;

I really don't want to budge on my truck. I love it. However in the coming years I do plan on looking into trading for a hybrid/electric pickup truck when they start releasing in the next few years.

&amp;nbsp;

**Plans for the near future:** 

I plan on moving into an apartment in the next few months with 3 long time friends as roommates. It's looking like I will be spending $500 + split utilities (currently making our final choice of apartment). The area we all agreed on will cut out 30-40 minutes off my commute. This will also mean I need to take over my food expenses, I am estimating $250-300 per month. Side note, I will still have the EZ-pass toll. Its unavoidable in my current situation. Bypassing it takes 1 hour of extra commute time. I also cannot move closer than this, as my friends and I have all agreed to make our commutes as equal as possible. 

In addition to these plans, I would like to take over my remaining expenses from my parents to become fully independent - however this may be dragged out until my student loans are complete. That would include health insurance, car insurance, and phone bill. Again I am very lucky to have the parents I do, so I can delay this - within reason.

&amp;nbsp;

**Major goals in life requiring money I want to plan for:** 

* Buying a house within the next 3-5 years. Trying to be ready for the next housing market crash to get a better deal.

* Dog(s). House must come first however.

* Owning a new Ford Raptor. Excessive? Probably. But its a dream I would like to make reality. I like offroading and trucks.

* Owning a travel trailer to travel around and visit places around the US. I enjoy hiking and general outdoor activies. I would use it often for vacations

* Staying somewhat up to date with technology. This includes upgrading my gaming PC, occasional new consoles, TV's, VR headset, etc.

* Visiting Europe &amp; Japan a few times. Again, a dream of mine.

* MAYBE 1 kid. Still up in the air. Currently have a GF, but we keep finances separate. Please don't factor her future money in here.


&amp;nbsp;

**My Questions**

* I suppose my current main goal is to buy a house, however, I cant decide how to save up a down payment. I would like to have **at least** 15-20k for a down payment, looking at ~150k houses. Saving this up would mean I'm not dumping my extra money into my loans. It almost seems like a terrible idea. I could definitely use guidance on how to accomplish this.

* I'm kicking myself for moving out before my debt is gone. I could have the rent and food money to put towards my loans instead. I could save up to purchase a house more easily. I am getting an easier commute, and I get to live with some life long friends that I love to do things with. But I still am so torn, what is the right decision? Is this even a question anymore or me just ranting.

* I have no idea what to do with my Roth IRA and how to factor it into my plan.

* When and how should I start saving for my other goals? What strategies should I use?

* Am I being reasonable?

* Am I doing anything wrong, or is there anything I should be doing additionally?

&amp;nbsp;

I am also thinking very broad in scope here. Feel free to narrow it down to give advice. Criticisms are welcome as well of course, I would actually appreciate them just as much as advice so I know where I am making mistakes.

If you made it to the end of this thanks for reading and any advice you can give. Sorry for how large this became. Let me know if you guys need more details that don't include my social security number or drivers license.",finance
personalfinance,Refinancing Car,"So this isn’t really a life altering decision about debt, but just trying to save wherever I can. Anyways, my ex and I split up so we are currently working on refinancing our cars to get each other off our auto loans. I’m currently trying to decide on a 60, 72, or 84 month refinance with taking into account other debts.


The total refinance is for $36,500. The best rates I’ve found (after searching 5 different places) are: 


60 mo - 3.69%

72 mo - 3.94%

84 mo - 4.44%


My predicament is that I also owe $65,000 in student loans (Am a RN). Two of those loans total over $16k and have an interest rate of 6.8%. All the other student loans vary in the 3.2-4.2% range. With that said, it looks like I’ll save roughly $174/mo (minus extra interest) if I renewed my auto loan with an 84mo term instead of the 60. Does it make sense to pay the extra interest there so that I can redirect those savings towards my higher 6.8% student loans? 


Again I know it’s minimal amounts I’m talking about but any savings is still a savings. Any input is greatly appreciated. Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,High Student Loans,"First off this subreddit as been very helpful to me and thank you all for contributing. 

I am a 33 year old doctor. Like most, I graduated with crushing debt $200,000, but I have been able to bring this figure down to $100,000. I can refinance this amount at around 3 to 4% interest rate. (Currently it is at 5.5%)

Currently have a savings of atleast $240,000.  I would like to use this to save for retirement in either SEP IRA  as well as invest.

Now my employer that I have no benefits from is giving me the option of being a 1099 and being self employed. Currently I take a W2. IF 1099 I will be paying my own taxes, and since I am being paid on a percentage of collections, he is willing to increase my pay from 28% to 30% of collections. My gross pay last year was around $200,000. 

Here is my question, should I keep my student loans and invest my savings as well as put it in a retirement account (SEP IRA which I can max out at $55,000 per year)? Or should I pay off all my debt? If I refinance to a sub 4% interest rate, is it wiser to invest a big chunk of my savings that can yield a higher rate or return?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR 

Saved a lot of money, but also have a lot of debt. Opportunity to be self employed and invest, as well as refinance my loans to sub 4%. How do I use my savings wisely?

solar,Comparing Solar Quotes and Related Questions,"I live in NE Florida and there aren't many reputable PV installers in my location from what I can tell. Not many companies offer SunPower, LG, and Panasonic panels. I was able to get quotes from 2 different companies. One offers both SP and Panasonic, the other only offers SP.  The Panasonic panels are much cheaper, but SP is offering an additional $1040 rebate until 4/15 which makes the price/W slightly more comparable. I'm installing these on a south facing standing seam metal roof. 26-30 panels would be on a two story roof and 4-7 panels on a 1 story roof.

I have a limited knowledge of solar installation, mostly only from browsing this subreddit. Is the SP 25 yr warranty on everything worth the upcharge? It sounds like the panels themselves from Panasonic are only marginally worse, but from what I read the panels are the least of my worries and the array materials and monitoring equipment is the bigger worry.  However, the SP monitoring equipment still only has a 10 yr warranty. Please let me know if you need more info. I'll try to figure out the exact panel models if that helps. Do these prices seem good? Do solar installers usually give a flat charge and it's their best price or is this negotiable? Do the proposed Year 1 production kWh make sense for the DC wattage listed? I'm not familiar with the DC to AC conversion. I have helioscope PDFs if that helps.

Supposedly more info on SP A-series panels will be available in April or May. Maybe that's why there is a rebate now to still entice people to use the current equipment? I've heard the A-series panels could be cheaper but I can't find an actual listed price on them yet so I don't know if that's true. I've asked both companies and they both said they'll likely have info in Q2 but they can't guarantee that, and they both assume the price won't change and said they hadn't heard anything about them being cheaper.

Thank you in advance!

Forex,Avoiding The News,"Hey all,

My trading strategy used daily and weekly chart analysis, which means that my trades are usually longer term (0-2 weeks). Based on what I’ve studied, I think that it’s a good idea to stay out of news events that can whipsaw the market. However, looking at forex calendars, there always seems to be at least one high impact news event every single day. 

This means that if I’m holding a trade for a week or so, there’s bound to be some high level news event on that currency, forcing me to close a trade early even though the “high impact” news event doesn’t really affect the market that much (like FOMC meetings). So, I’ve decided to make a list of the news events that nearly always cause market swings or trend reversals. The only ones I have at the moment are the US NFP interest rate announcements, and speeches. Is there anything else you all recommend to for sure avoid?",finance

1. The 2 lead federal investigators of Ross Ulbricht are serving a combined 16 1/2 years in federal prison for crimes committed during and after the investigation of the Silk Road. 

2. The corrupt actions of the federal agents were kept out of Ross’ trial and appeals. 

3. Ross has no appeals left. Without clemency, he will die in prison. 

4. Both federal agents were re-arrested after their their arrest and conviction.  One, after his plea, stole millions in bitcoin from the US Government. The other was arrested for attempting to flee the country. 

5. One federal judge told the corrupt Secret Service agent that his actions were a “betrayal of trust” and “among the worst of crimes”. He was the US Government's top expert on the anonymity protocol Tor. The other agent worked for the DEA. 

6. The founder of Silk Road 2.0, a former SpaceX employee, was not prosecuted for his crimes. 

7.  Ross is a non-violent first-time offender. He holds a degree in physics and studied material sciences and engineering in a Masters program. He is best described as an idealistic naive hippie who launched a libertarian free market. 

8.  The younger generation views Ross’ case with overwhelming support. Clemency could garner and galvanize support for Republicans in the tech world which ideally could lead to more open access for conservatives in Silicon Valley companies.    
9.  Ross isn’t likely to re-offend. He currently teaches yoga in prison.

personalfinance,Urgent help needed: forgot to file 1099-misc and 1099-r after filed tax return and accepted,"I am currently in overseas due to family emergency, not sure when I can get back to the States yet. Will need some serious &amp; professional help, any suggestions, advice, sharing/experience will be greatly appreciated

Situation:
After I used Taxact electronically filed the tax returns (Federal, LLC(single member)/Schedule C and 2 states) two weeks ago, statues shows accepted for all Returns couple days ago. I have Just realized that I forgot that there are two more needed to be filed (see below).

Two 1099-MISCs (Total is ~$5000) [ I added this amount on Schedule C if I recall correctly since I didn't get these 1099 when I filed the returns)
One 1099-R (more than 20 years Life Insurance Surrender taxable amount ~$10,000) (Distribution code 7)

I have read similar issues on reddits and google, Two general suggestions:
a) File amendment 1040X and supporting documents
b) Wait for IRS sent you notices (adjustments, or tax I owe, etc) or even audit

My questions are below:
A) If I file 1040X.
1. I don't how should I fill out the 1040X, which fields/lines/where on 1040X I should put in for 1099-MISC nonemployee compensation and the 1099-R taxable amount ?
2. Do I simply put in the exactly amount? or I will have to recalculate everything?
3. What other documents I should mail along with 1040X? Original? and New One? and copies of the 1099-MISCs and 1099-R I received?
4. For Federal I recalled I need to mail the 1040X form and documents by mail. Since I am not in the States, would that be a problem?
5. For the Two States, How should I file amendment? and what forms I should use? or I can use Taxact to do state amendments?

B) If I wait for IRS sent you notices (adjustments, or tax I owe, etc) or even audit
1. Should I? or I would be picked for audit??
2. Will I get any issues coming back to the States?
3. How much do I really owe for the Federal and States based on the amount?
4. Any things I should pay attention?

personalfinance,Is 60k in college debt worth finishing my degree?,"I'm 24 and trying to go back to school to finish my undergrad. I've been applying around and the best offer I've received would put me around 20k in debt for my remaining 3 years. (No current debt)

I'm comfortable with a little bit of debt but hesitant on taking such a big amount. My degree would be in environmental science and resource managment. I've been fortunate enough to get a job in the field already and have worked in conservation for a few years, but my future options are limited without that piece of paper. 

I'ts more expensive for me to attend instate (illinois) than the offer I received out of state (in wisconsin). Instate schools ranged from 25-40k per year and no scholarships whatsoever, while the outofstate school in mind is around 40k and offered 19k in scholarships/grant, with another 9k in federal loans. I maintained a 4.0 GPA from my last university so I'm looking mostly at academic based scholarships. 

I did some classes at my local community college (still maintained my 4.0) but my experience was terrible. The students and teachers didn't care or try and I want to continue learning in an environment where people care about their education.

After my first year at the new school, I could probably expect other academic based scholarships like Dean's list, but I dont want to assume that I'd get an more than currently offered. 

Parents and family are not willing to help with school, which is why I'm really looking to go back now that I'm 24 and considered independent for all my financial issues, but 60k (over 3 years) already feels like a pretty heavy weight. From what I've seen personally, jobs in the field start around 30-60k (the latter is more science and research based)

Im just not 100% comfortable with debt like that. I might be over thinking it, or might be getting in over my head. Any insights or opinions are greatly appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,A good Wells Fargo story (loan amendment for a lower interest rate)!,"I know there’s plenty of Wells horror stories out there to go along with the fraudulent account fiasco but I did want to share something good that they did for our mortgage. 

tl/dr: Our Wells mortgage broker monitored rates for us and helped us get a loan amendment instead of having to go through a refi that shave a half percent off our rate and save ~$230/mo with no fees. 

We bought our house last year in August and were fairly happy with our 4.25% rate (30yr fixed) from Wells (we had used them for our previous mortgage and the broker we worked with was really great to work with) thinking we had hit bottom with the prime rate starting to creep back up and the pending trade war and other Washington insanity. 

As a result I had stopped tracking rates and figured we were in a good spot until earlier this year a coworker mentioned she was able to get a 3.750% rate from Wells on their new house. I was shocked and called our broker who said rates had been coming down but they most likely got an “existing relationship discount” to get to that rate (Wells will knock up to a half percent off if you have between $200k-$1M+ in assets on deposit with them) and we might be able to shave 1/8 percent off with a refi. We agreed it wasn’t worth the fees and hassle at the time and he said he’d watch things for us. 

Low and behold I got a call 2 weeks ago that rates were still dropping and we could qualify for a sub 4% refi (3.875) but would need to pay some points. I wasn’t looking to pay anything beyond appraisal and title fees so we agreed he’d keep watching for us. 

Over the weekend I get a voicemail from him (he was seriously watching this for us!) that rates had still been coming down and to call him Monday and we can see what we can lock in. We saw that we could get a 3.875% and a lender credit that would mostly cover the refi fees or 3.750% and no credit. At that point he let me know that he had been seeing Wells offer “loan amendments” to established customers with excellent credit and a perfect payment history that we’re applying for a refi. Essentially we’d start the refi process (but not pay any appraisal or other fees yet) and if selected, we’d just sign a 4 page document that lowered the interest rate to what we locked in and lower our monthly payment once it took effect and the refi application would be canceled. 

He was stressing he couldn’t guarantee this would happen for us but we were excellent candidates with our credit and payment history across our 2 mortgages we had had with them. He did say an application where Wells was going to pay a lender credit would have a better chance but I was only interested in the lowest rate. We agreed at this point that I’d talk it over with my wife and we’d decide the following day. 

Next day he calls me and let me know the 3.750 rate now came with a lender credit that, if we didn’t get the amendment would cover about half the estimated refi fees but also made our application extremely likely for the amendment. We also confirmed we still had an out since they typically make the amendment decisions within 3-4 business days of the application being started and we had about a week to pay for the appraisal. We pulled the trigger and signed everything to start the process. 

2 days later (or yesterday if you’re reading this today :) ) I got a call that we had been approved for the amendment and we just needed to sign what ended up being a 2 page form lowering our rate to 3.750% effective next month saving us ~$230 off our payment each month and not changing the maturity date or other aspects of the loan. 

Just wanted to share a story of a Wells employee doing the right thing by the customer and that it’s always a good idea to ask about alternative options to the traditional path (refinancing in this case)!",finance

&gt; But the markets also face a reality check in the week ahead with some key data that could help clarify whether the economy is losing steam or just stumbling through a soft patch. The key release is Friday's March jobs report, with economists expecting 170,000 new nonfarm payrolls, after February's deeply disappointing 20,000 jobs, according to Refinitiv. There is also important manufacturing data from China over the weekend and the U.S. on Monday.
*****
&gt; Lyft Inc's big IPO Friday on the back of Levi Strauss the week earlier has boosted some optimism for a year of new offerings that some analysts say could rival or surpass the more than $100 billion record of new issues in the year 2000, if conditions remain good.
*****
&gt; ""The Levi Strauss IPO and the success it had last week encouraged many of these companies to accelerate their timing,"" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Advisors. ""IPO issuance has been modest relative to history for the last couple of years, so the fact we're finally seeing some companies come to market may signal some kind of optimism or confidence, but it's far from the type of thing we've seen historically in terms of the euphoria surrounding it.""
*****
&gt; Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Alliance said with $700 million in potential offerings in the wings, this year could surpass the all-time record reached in 2000, when the new issue market was viewed as overheated and many companies without earnings or prospects made it into the public arena during the tech bubble.
*****
&gt; ""In general, big IPOs tend to drive general enthusiasm for the overall market until they don't do well,"" said Hogan, noting the follow through trading in Lyft, the biggest IPO since Alibaba went public in 2014. Lyft, priced at $72, surged about 20 percent on the opening but closed up just about 8.7 percent at $78.29.
*****
&gt; Stocks were higher in the past week, and the S&amp;P 500 turned in its best first quarter performance since 1998. The 12.9 percent gain was also the best quarterly performance since the third quarter of 2009, just as the now 10-year-old bull market took off. The S&amp;P is now less than 4 percent from its record high.
*****
&gt; Earnings season kicks off in the next several weeks, and between now and then there could be some high profile warnings on the first quarter, expected to be the first quarter with negative earnings growth in three years.
*****
&gt; Arone said while earnings are expected to be weaker, revenues are expected to grow by nearly 5 percent, a positive sign.
*****
&gt; ""That needs to be reconciled form my perspective. It wouldn't shock me if companies doe better than expected, and end up with positive year-over-year comparisons,"" said Arone.
*****
&gt; Trade talks with China remain the overriding issue for markets. Chinese Vice Premier Lui He comes to Washington to meet with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who traveled to Beijing this past week.
*****
&gt; Analysts expect a deal in the coming months. ""We're likely to get some type of negotiated deal that both sides can claim victory on, where China will buy more U.S. goods, where there is some progress on U.S. intellectual property and technology transfers...But I don't see a deal that's going to be a game changer...a big move in one direction. I think the market has accepted that reality,"" said Arone.
*****
&gt; In the past week, stocks were higher but so were bonds, to the point where the 10-year yield reached a low of 2.34 percent before returning to the 2.40 percent level. Yields move opposite price.
*****
&gt; The week earlier, the 10-year yield dipped beneath the yield on the 3-month bill, meaning the yield curve was inverted. When that happens and long-term rates are lower than short-term rates, it is viewed as a recession warning. Practically it would mean lenders, who borrow on a short term basis, would be lending at the lower longer term rates.
*****
&gt; The bond market also moved to price in a Fed interest rate cut this year, after pricing in a hike just several months ago. That was in response to the Fed's forecast for no more rate cuts this year, released after its March meeting. It had been forecasting two interest rate hikes previously. The fed funds futures now is priced for a quarter point of easing this year and another next year.
*****
&gt; Markets calmed down as the week came to a close, but every piece of data has become more important. On a positive note, weekly jobless claims data, the most current look at the labor market, showed a downtick and the four week average is now 217,000, the lowest since January.
*****
&gt; The economy's growth definitely slowed down in the first quarter and growth was tracking at about 1.5 percent, after the 2.2 percent gain in the fourth quarter. Economists have expected the weakness in the first quarter, both due to the government shutdown and bad winter weather, to be temporary but the question is whether growth can get a jump start in the second quarter.
*****
&gt; ""The jobs number is key here,"" said Wilmington Trust chief economist Luke Tilley. The February report showed just a tenth of the job creation many economists had expected. ""Our best thinking it it's statistical volatility, and it's not a real indication of what's going on in the labor market, and it will bounce back. That's the most important thing that's coming out next week....We think about 200,000 jobs were added. I think there's some upside risks to that.""
*****
&gt; Tilley said manufacturing data in the week ahead will be important, as it could show whether the sector remained sluggish at the end of the first quarter. March ISM manufacturing and PMI data will be released Monday, and durable goods, which includes business spending data, is important when it is released on Tuesday. Monthly vehicle sales are also released Tuesday.
*****
&gt; Economists expect ISM manufacturing at 54.2, unchanged from the month earlier. China was also to release manufacturing PMI data over the weekend.
*****
&gt; February's delayed U.S. retail sales report is also expected on Monday. Retail sales are expected to have gained 0.3 percent in the month, up from 0.2 percent in January and December's shocking decline.
*****
&gt; Steve Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Securities, said he's watching for any sign of inflation in wages when the jobs report is released Friday. The Fed's preferred PCE inflation index showed sluggish inflation growth, up just 0.1 percent in February.
*****
&gt; ""I don't think [the data] is as big an issue as it was when the Fed was actively talking about raising rates,"" said Massocca. 
""They said publicly they're not going to raise rates for the rest fo the year.""
*****
&gt; There are just a few Fed speakers, who will be of interest because of the change in market expectations for Fed interest rate policy. Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester speaks Thursday, and Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic speaks both Wednesday and Friday.

# What Does A Big First Quarter Mean?

&gt; With a day to go, this is one of the best first quarters for the S&amp;P 500 Index ever. Of course, it comes on the heels of the worst fourth quarter since the financial crisis and the worst December since the Great Depression. Still, you have to be impressed with the overall bounce back after the big drop late last year.

&gt; “A big start to the year historically has suggested the bulls could remain in charge the rest of the year,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “In fact, 9 of the past 10 times the S&amp;P 500 was up at least 10% during the first quarter, the rest of the year was also in the green.”

&gt; As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, continued gains the final three quarters of the year were quite normal after a big first quarter. It is worth noting, however, that extreme gains might not be in the cards, as the average return for the final three quarters of the year is 5.8%, which is actually lower than the average year’s final three quarters of 6.3%.

# April Almanac: DJIA’s Best Month

&gt; April marks the end of our “Best Six Months” for DJIA and the S&amp;P 500. On April 1st, we will begin looking for our seasonal MACD sell signal and corresponding early signs of seasonal weakness. Even in historically strong pre-election years the “Worst Six Months” have been lackluster on average. 

&gt; April 1999 was the first month to gain 1000 DJIA points. However, from 2000 to 2005, “Tax” month was hit, declining in four of six years. Since 2006, April has been up thirteen years in a row with an average gain of 2.3% to reclaim its position as the best DJIA month since 1950. April is third best for S&amp;P and fourth best for NASDAQ (since 1971).

&gt; The first half of April used to outperform the second half, but since 1994 that has no longer been the case. The effect of April 15 Tax Deadline appears to be diminished with numerous bullish days present on either side of the day. Traders and investors are clearly focused on first quarter earnings and guidance during April. Exceptional Q1 earnings and positive surprises tend to be anticipated with stocks and the market moving up in advance of the announcements and consolidating or correcting afterwards.

&gt; Typical pre-election year strength does bolster April’s performance since 1950. April is DJIA’s best month in pre-election years (+4.0%), second best for S&amp;P 500 (+3.5%) and third best for NASDAQ (+3.5%). Small caps measured by the Russell 2000 also perform well with gains (+2.8%) in seven of ten pre-election year April’s since 1979.

# First Trading Day of Q2: DJIA and S&amp;P 500 Higher 75% of the Time

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c2517e648cdac3635e6063406fd1de2e/tumblr_inline_pp5990Be4E1spdppr_500.jpg))**

&gt; According to the Stock Trader’s Almanac 2019, the first trading day of April is DJIA’s fifth best first trading day of all months based upon total points gained. Looking back at the last 25 years, in the tables below, we can see DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have both advanced 75.0% of the time (up 18 of last 24) with average gains right around 0.4%. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have slightly weaker track records but are both still up more frequently then down. Last year, April’s first trading day was dealt a blow with losses exceeding 2% by S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000.

# Good News Indicators

&gt; The Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index (LEI) is one of our favorite economic indicators. It is designed to predict future movements in the economy based on a composite of 10 economic indicators (like manufacturers’ new orders, stock prices, and weekly unemployment claims) whose changes tend to precede shifts in the overall economy. Last week, the LEI expanded for the first time in five months, along the way tying the all-time high set September 2018. Additionally, it is up 3% year over year (YoY).

&gt; The combination of continued weak economic data around the globe and various parts of the yield curve inverting are leading many to surmise that a recession is likely imminent. The good news is that the LEI has not turned negative on a YoY basis, which it has done prior to every recession since the 1970s. And even when it has turned negative, it was another eight months on average before a recession officially occurred (with a median of six months lag time). For this reason, and because of its solid track record of predicting recessions, the LEI is a component of LPL Research’s Five Forecasters.

&gt; As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the LEI remains well above the 0% YoY threshold, which would be a definite negative—on multiple levels.

# 11 Things You Need To Know About The Yield Curve

&gt; Well, it finally happened—the yield curve inverted. Now note that it was the shorter end of the curve that inverted, as the 3-month Treasury bill (and 1-year T-bill) now yields more than the 10-year Treasury for the first time since 2007. This matters because an inverted yield curve is the bond market’s way of saying there is a potential recession on the horizon. “The yield curve inversion is something that nearly everyone is talking about, given its perfect track record at predicting recessions,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “At the same time, however, we simply aren’t seeing other areas of the economy that would confirm a recession just yet, so there is more to this story.”

&gt; Please note that there is no one true “yield curve,” as the yield curve simply looks at the yields of a shorter-dated fixed income instrument and compares it to a longer-dated one. In fact, the more commonly discussed 2-year/10-year yield curve spread hasn’t inverted, and it is actually above the early December 2018 lows.

&gt; Here are 11 things worth considering regarding the yield curve.

&gt; * Each of the past 9 recessions back to the 1950s saw the 1-year/10-year yield curve spread invert approximately 14 months on average before a recession.
&gt; * Although a yield curve inversion preceded all 9 previous recessions, not all inversions led to a recession. For instance, the 3-month/10-year yield curve inverted in 1966 and 1998, with neither leading to an immediate recession.
&gt; * The shorter end of the yield curve has inverted, but the longer end is actually steepening. For instance, the 10-year/30-year yield curve has steepened most of this year. In past recessions, all parts of the curve inverted before a recession took place.
&gt; * Financial conditions aren’t tight, as tight conditions coupled with the yield curve inverting, historically has led to a recession. Investment-grade corporate and high yield spreads remain calm, however, suggesting that not all parts of the bond market are worried about an impending recession.
&gt; * Market participants have fully priced in a Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cut within the next year, potentially further flattening the curve. Should the economy gain steam during the second half of this year (which we think is possible) it will likely avoid a Fed rate cut, which should lead to a steeper yield curve.
&gt; * We have found that a spread between the 3-month/10-year yield curve has become much more predictive of a recession at -50 basis points (-0.50%). So this still is a clear concern, but a marginal inversion may not be so worrisome.
&gt; * Yield curves aren’t always perfect: Japan has had long stretches of inverted curves that didn’t lead to recessions. Additionally, both the United Kingdom and Germany have had inversions without recessions.
&gt; * The fed funds rate has been significantly higher during previous inversions. In fact, the fed funds rate has averaged more than 6% when the 1-year/10-year yield curve has inverted. It is only 2.4% currently.
&gt; * The previous 5 recessions began an average of 21 months after the 2-year/10-year yield curve inverted. Stocks actually did quite well initially after inversions as well, with the S&amp;P 500 Index not peaking until over a year after the inversions and gaining nearly 22% on average at the peak.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/7-16-18_Blog_table1_0319.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; * Various yields around the globe continue to sink, with nearly $10 trillion in global debt now yielding less than 0%. The German 10-year Bund, for instance, is beneath 0% for the first time since 2016. We think this is due more to a concern over the European slowdown, which has forced many to look to the United States as a safe haven for sovereign debt, thus pushing our yields much lower along the way. This concept is discussed in more depth in our latest episode of the LPL Market Signals podcast.
&gt; * As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&amp;P 500 has actually outperformed the average year the previous three times the 2-year/10-year yield curve inverted. To reiterate though, the 2/10 spread hasn’t inverted yet.

# The Bespoke Report — Good, Bad, Or Ugly?

&gt; Stocks have basically held the line this week despite huge moves in interest rates and an ongoing rough run for global economic data. Curve inversion has many forecasting a recession, and we’ve seen a number of recent data releases that make us much more nervous about that outcome than we have been in almost a decade. On the other hand, the pivot to dovishness from global central banks, the relatively modest size and scale of yield curve inversion, some nascent signs of bottoming in global growth, and the nature of the plunge in interest rates are all reasons to not panic. Besides, despite all of the negativity US stocks have held up admirably well, and markets that trend higher on bad news are generally regarded as strong, rather than weak. In short, the outlook could be Good, Bad, or Ugly…depending how you read the tea leaves!

# A Strange Trip With Some Strange Leaders

&gt; With sentiment where it was at the end of last year following the Q4 rout in equities, it’s safe to say that not a lot of investors were expecting double-digit gains in the first quarter. That’s exactly what we have seen in US equities, though, as the major averages are all up over 10% YTD heading into the final hours of the quarter. While the Dow has lagged many of its peer indices this year, it too is still on pace to finish Q1 with a gain of just over 10%.

&gt; In the table below, we show how each of the 30 components in the DJIA have performed on a YTD basis as well as how much they have contributed to the index’s total gains. Remember, the DJIA is a price-weighted index, so the sole determinant of a stock’s weight in the index is its price. Looking at the table, you’re likely not the only one doing a double-take at the two stocks that top the list of best performers in the index so far this year. That’s right, Cisco (CSCO) and IBM have been the index’s two top performers in 2019 with gains of nearly 24%. Behind these two stocks, United Technologies (UTX) and Apple (AAPL) are the only two other stocks that are up 20% or more. To the downside, just five stocks in the DJIA are in the red on a YTD basis. Leading the way lower, Walgreens Boots (WBA), the newest stock in the index, has declined over 7%, but none of the four other stocks are down more than 3%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/032919-DJIA-Performance-1.png))**

&gt; Because the DJIA is price-weighted, the best-performing stocks in the index haven’t been the biggest contributors to the YTD gains. The chart below shows how many points each stock in the index has contributed to the YTD gains. Looking at things this way, you may be surprised to see that Boeing (BA) still tops the list. With its 17% YTD gain and very high share price, BA has contributed 374 points to the DJIA’s upside this year, beating out the next closest component (AAPL) by 160 points! All else being equal, BA could fall another 23 points (6.0%) and it would still be the largest contributor to the DJIA’s YTD gains.

personalfinance,Large Home Improvement Project Advice needed,"Hello,

**Summary:**

I have a house build in the late 1970s with original cedar siding. Woodpeckers have heavily damaged it, and I need repair or replacement or I'm worried I'll do permanent damage.

**Options:**

1. Repair/Repaint. I've received bids from $6,000-$10,000. If I went this route, I'd probably have a goal of replacement before I had to repaint again in 3-5 years. **Downside:** Delaying the inevitable replacement.
2. Replace using HELOC. All of the resources I've consulted have said if you're replacing siding, you should do windows (Also in terrible shape) at the same time otherwise you negatively impact both when replacing. Bids for windows+siding are **\~$40,000**. House is valued @ 380k, mortgage is @ $295k remaining. **Downside:** Incurring additional debt @ \~6% interest. 
3. Replace using a second mortgage? Same negatives as above, I do not know if a HELOC or this is superior. It seems like 5-6% is general interest rate.
4. Do nothing and save for a year, putting minimums on student loans? **Downside.** Risk permanent damage to the house by waiting.

**Budget Details:**

\~$10k combined monthly income after taxes, 401k, etc. I have a $10k emergency fund. I use zero-based budgeting, so any ""extra"" money always goes towards student loans right now.

* $1.3k goes towards everything associated with vehicles (2x car payments @2.1% interest, gas, insurance, repairs, etc)
* $0.5k goes towards food (Restaurants + Groceries)
* $2.9k goes towards everything housing related (Mortgage, Utilities, Home Repairs, etc)
* $0.8k goes towards various entertainment (Internet/TV, sporting events, vacations, general fun)
* $0.7 goes towards other (Pets, personal care, cell phones, medical issues, various saving, etc)
* $3.7k is  paying down student loans  (75k remaining @ 3.45%, min payment is around $0.5k)

**Questions for** /r/pf**:**

Given my budget and financial status, what option makes the most sense? What other information should I be thinking about?

Federal: 18.80% (long term capital gains rate, including the 3.8% obamacare surcharge)

State: 6.57% (state income tax level)

Local: 3.88% (NYC income tax)

This substantially changes the math and the moves the needle towards prioritizing paying off debt as opposed to throwing money in the stock market. Obviously, this only applies to money after you've maxed out your 401k, since the tax issues don't impact that.

Having never done this, the first year flew by quick with us doing some of the demolition, planning, and searching for a contractor.  The whole house had to be taken to the studs, we found a team that told us it'd be a 4-6 month job, in the end it was more like 9 months.  So there goes almost a 2nd year.  We pretty much end up dismissing them from the job in the end and hiring others to do some and did some ourselves.  We didn't live in it, our parents had considered moving there as it had a larger piece of land and similar size, higher value, and selling their own house to give us a portion of instead and getting what they loaned to us back.   We end up listing it and selling it a few months later, which is recently.  So I'm wondering how we're gonna get taxed on this, as the process didn't go how we thought it would.  Basically sold at $113k, $103k after closing costs.  The property, our own money into it, family loan, was basically around $78k ($88k with the closing costs? cause that counts as another expense doesn't it?).  We're in Texas, this wasn't our job, but neither of us had a good source of income either as we would usually work together doing carpentry and then our own separate things inbetween, this house slowed that down and seeing as so much time passed I'm confused on how this will be taxed.  We've got stacks of receipts and I'd like to get the tax stuffed figured out but thought I'd ask here first and figure out my options and not be lost at H&amp;R or wherever I go.",finance

I know I owe ~$500 dollars in federal taxes and I don't know about state, but I think I don't have to file because I have made less than $6300 in earned income.  But do I have to file regardless since I owe money to the government?

personalfinance,Turning 50 and Finding Myself in Debt,"A bit new to Reddit, but was wondering if you all would offer some help.

&amp;#x200B;

I just recently turned 50 and am finding myself accumulating debt on credit cards. I don't spend recklessly, but end up needing to put necessary purchases like unexpectated expenses and medical expenses on credit. We don't live quite paycheck to paycheck, but quite nearly. Living debt free is my biggest goal in life and I'm serious about changing things around to make that happen.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently I have three credit cards open.

&amp;#x200B;

CareCredit (26.99% APR)

Account 1: $7,000

Account 2: $2,000

&amp;#x200B;

Chase (20.49% APR)

Account 1: $7,000

&amp;#x200B;

I make roughly $1,000 a week and my wife makes around $500 biweekly. Totals to be $5,000 a month in income. Our mortgage is $910/month, but we also help our son with student living, food, and gas while he's at college paying half of his rent ($365/month). We do not have car payments, but do pay for basic utilities, electric, and car insurance. Health and life insurance is provided as a benefit through my wife's work. We pay just over the minimum payment on each credit card and our son helps by putting a monthly payment on one card as well. In total we spend $225 (on CareCredit1), $100 (on CareCredit2), $250 (on Chase). Our son contributes $120 monthly on CareCredit1 as well for a total of $345/month.

&amp;#x200B;

Income: $5,000

Mortgage: ($910)

Son's Rent: ($365)

Car Insurance: ($650)/6 months

Electric: ($200)

Utilities: ($20)

Credit: ($695)

Groceries: ($700)

Eating Out: ($370)

Gas: ($700)

Remainder: $390

&amp;#x200B;

The remainder generally rolls over into next month so we build slowly, but something generally comes up and we need to cover it.

&amp;#x200B;

We are slowly but surely paying off the debt, but it's a slow uphill struggle. I was wondering if I had any quicker options? Would it be faster to transfer some of the debt to a new 0% introductory APR credit card? My wife and I both have fantastic credit as well so we were also considering taking a bank loan with a lower interest rate. Our son will be graduating college soon and starting full-time, but we are doing what we can to get it cut down so that it doesn't start snowballing.",finance
personalfinance,"Worked in three states, resident of a fourth. Do I understand this?","I think I have this figured out, can anyone give this a quick read an tell me if I am on the right track?

The situation is hypothetical for anonymity, but is realistic and congruent to my personal tax situation.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Earning a small amount in three different nonresident states is a recipe for owing a bunch of money to a fourth resident state.

&amp;#x200B;

Consider a worker who worked for four months in Ohio, Michigan and Oklahoma, but is a resident of Wisconsin. If she was paid $20k in each of the three states, she would have a total income of $60k for federal tax purposes.

**Non-resident State Taxes:**

* Michigan would not tax her income because of a reciprocity agreement with Wisconsin. She could file a Schedule NR form to have any money that was automatically withheld returned.
* Ohio would tax her income at $188.47 + 2.476% of the excess over $16,300. ($280)
* Oklahoma would tax her income at $171.50 + 5% of the excess over $7,200. ($811)

**Wisconsin State Taxes:**

* Wisconsin would tax the entire $60k income at $1,126.28 + 6.27% of the excess over $22,900. ($3,452)
* This entire amount would be owed to Wisconsin, as it would not have been automatically withheld by her employer.
* Our worker could file a Schedule OS form to receive a credit for the tax payed to Ohio an Oklahoma, reducing her tax owed to Wisconsin to $2,360.

It is my understanding that this situation is a recipe for having to owe state taxes to Wisconsin because both Oklahoma and Ohio were taxing only $20k, and at lower tax rates. Do I understand what I have described above?",finance

Lets get down to the nitty-gritty as I could use your expertise!

The Details:

I am a first-year medical resident making $55k/year (about $3.6k/month after tax). I have about ~2-5 years of residency left (depending on whether i choose to specialize) making about $1-2k more each year. 

Salary: $55k/year (about $3.6k/month after tax)

Age: 28

Kids: none

Marital staus: single

Debt...

Student Loans: -$151k at 5.39% average interest rate

Student loan payment: $0/mo (currently on REPAYE)

Credit Cards: Happily paid off every month on time

Private loan: none

Monthly expenses...

I live at home which has helped a ton

Car: loan of $4987 with 4.94% APR, I am paying $1000/month on it (really trying to get rid of this one soon).

Rent: $390/month

Gym: $21/mo

Gas: $80-100/mo

Cleaning: $20/mo

What I have done with my money so far...

Roth IRA: I have maxed out both 2018 and 2019 Roth IRA via Vanguard

My employer does not offer a 401k match, but I am enrolled in 457b plan in which deducts $500/month from my paycheck.

I have my checking account with Chase and savings account with Ally. I only have about $5k as emergency fund put into my Ally account seeing that I am living at home and can ask for help from family if I end up needing more than $5k.

What should I do with any extra money that I have? I am torn between so many things... should I, - pay off car loan? - expand emergency fund? - start a brokerage account and invest in individual stocks, or ETFs, or mutual funds? - start making payments on loans? - put more money in to my 457b? Get a Roth 403b?

Also, I do not have my own disability insurance or life insurance plan. Residency has some coverage, but I know that this is not sufficient.

personalfinance,"I just bought a house, interest rates rapidly dropped, is it stupid to refinance?","Basically my situation is that I got approved for a loan at the beginning of December 2018 with an interest rate of 4.75% and bought a house that I closed on at the end of 2018, have a $300K 30 year fixed rate mortgage.  when I bought the house, the 4.75% seemed like a fair rate and it seemed like interest rates were going to keep rising.  But now I'm reading that interest rates actually have dramatically dropped over the last couple of months and have hit 4% again.  I'm sort of feeling like I bought at a terrible time and entirely got screwed on my loan because if I had waited a couple of months my interest rate would be dramatically lower.  My question is when is re-financing really worth it?  There's a lot to consider... I get that if I re-financed that I would have to pay like $10K in closing costs again... which I already just paid.  But it's also $48K less that I would pay over the 30 year life of the loan if I were to refinance.  But I also get if I just took that $10K and put it in the market and let time value of money take care of it, that $10K would be worth more than that $48K ($38K net after paying $10K) I'd save by refinancing.  

&amp;#x200B;

I think one thing that I can take solace in though is that I believe the mortgage interest deduction helps to make this somewhat of a moot point, because even if I'm overpaying in interest, I'm still able to deduct 100% of it and have it reduce my tax liability... so maybe net it doesn't really make a difference?  For all of these reasons, I'm leaning towards not refinancing, but just wanted to make sure that I wasn't missing any considerations or just rationalizing this in a way to make myself feel better.",finance
financialindependence,Need some thoughts on my idea to stop funding my retirement,"Wife and I are 40.  I predict we will hit 1 million in retirement accounts between 2 401ks and 2 Roth IRAs in the next couple years. We currently max these 4 accounts.   I am planning to retire with a pension at 55.   To me this is retiring early. She will most likely retire at 60. Our house will be paid off when I retire. When I plug the numbers into a compound interest calculator, if I stop contributing all extra to work iras except the match, and stop the Roth’s when we hit one million, we will still have around 2-2.5 million in 20 years depending on interest rates.   This would free up around 40k a year which I would plan to basically enjoy life with our kids before they are grown. Vacations, home improvement, whatever we want.  If I’ll have 2-2.5 million at age 60, plus my pension, why keep throwing all my money into the market.  Talk some sense into me please.",finance

***Metro Exodus*** is a first-person shooter video game developed by 4A Games and published by Deep Silver. It is the third installment in the *Metro* video game series based on Dmitry Glukhovsky's novels. It follows the events of *Metro 2033* and *Metro: Last Light*. *Metro Exodus* is a first-person shooter game with survival horror and stealth elements. Set in the post-apocalyptic wasteland of the former Russian Federation, the player must cope with the new hazards and engage in combat against mutated creatures as well as hostile humans. The player wields an arsenal of hand-made weaponry which can be customized through scavenging materials and a crafting system. The game features a mixture of linear levels and sandbox environments. It also includes a dynamic weather system, a day-night cycle, and environments that change along with the seasons as the story progresses. It is set over the course of one whole in-game year.

I have always been a huge fan of Dmitry Glukhovsky's “ **Metro “** Novels and than when a game was made on it, i felt in love with them and now after 6 years we got a 3 installment on the Metro game and……….. **THIS GAME IS AWESOME, IT'S FANTASTIC THAN AWESOME**, Lets not waste any time and get into the review, **Here is my Thoughts / Review on “ Metro: Exodus “:**

**Pros:**

* **Story:**

**Metro Exodus** story continues right after **Last light**. **Artyom** has a dream, dream where they could live outside those darkly, creepy metros and he believes that there are people still alive in the surface and that's where they story starts. The way they get to know that there is indeed life outside metro and starts their adventure to find a home is what a great story ‘ Metro: Exodus ‘ has to offer. The adventure is how they get out, what happens during their adventure which twist and turns all around makes it the best story “ Metro franchise “ has as of now and i could not talk much more of it as i HIGHLY RECOMMEND to play it yourself to found out as it deserves to be played non-spoiled.

* **Semi Open-World:**

**Metro: Exodus** took a bold move to leave the liner story and make it open-world for the players and while many might hate that move ( I don’t and love it ). I loved walking around the map and get to explore points of interest it had to offer ( And Obviously had to do it for my 100% run ) and it's worth it. With the difficulty as Ranger-Hardcore ammo is rare and you have to count your bullets as well as explore to find more and these points had many to offer with many more important upgrades you can get only by exploring the map ( not main-mission ) like Night-vision goggles or attachments for your weapons and there are many optional side-quests where a good reward is given to you and you get to know more about the world and the characters you meet and that made the open-world move worth it. I am simply thankful for 4A Games for taking this bold move and doing it the right way.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/ecvj2u5ppfp21.jpg

* **Aurora:**

The best parts of the story are found in chapters between the action where you simply hang out aboard the Aurora, the train that functions as headquarters. Here you have the chance to tune the radio to eavesdrop on transmissions that play off of in-game events or listen to some sweet tunes as well as get to know more about your crew.

&amp;#x200B;

[\* Aurora is the place where you relax during chapters \*](https://i.redd.it/bkum8ylupfp21.jpg)

* **Characters:**

The Characters in “ **Metro: Exodus** “ are so perfectly voice-acted and well written that you will love those who are made specifically to be loved and hate those who are made to be hated by the developers, You get to know more about your crew at your HQ named Aurora. Its a train where you travel between jumping to another chapter and here it's your opportunity to unravel the endearing personalities that make up your crew. These characters are brought to life with an impressive amount of dialogue they say that seems to go on forever, but because the moments of levity have a degree of charm and earnestness, it made me want to stay and listen.

&amp;#x200B;

[\* Characters in “ Metro: Exodus “ are well written and voice acted \*](https://i.redd.it/w13gfs23qfp21.jpg)

* **Metro-Touch is there:**

Even if this game make it a open-world to explore, 4A Games knew that they could not leave the metro liner style out of it as **Last-Light** and **2033** was unique for that and i am thankful for that decision that they did not made it open-world only. There are missions in between the chapters which are carefully laid out where you get to experience that moments you had in previous games ( Especially the 3rd and final chapter. )

&amp;#x200B;

[\* Metro: Exodus still has those creepy moments like previous one \*](https://i.redd.it/ehpzmmviqfp21.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

* **“** **The Ending Experience** **“** **( Non-spoiler ):**

Let me talk about the experience i had during the end of “ **Metro: Exodus** “ ( **NO SPOILER** ), The ending was something else, The way the game thinks you one way and than BOOM! Something else happens made me tear up like a small baby at the end, And this is my quote i always believe in “ If a game makes you cry, it's more than a game and is something else” and this one was definitely something else. You should definitely finish the game if you have started

* **Be Good or be Bad, Your choice:**

Metro: Exodus makes the return of hidden morality system from Last light and 2033 and your choices will matter and explicitly does not revealing itself, Many choices are given to you during the main-story and if orders to do it that way and you don’t, than it has huge impact on the storyline while others choices can be done during optional side-quests which will increase the chance to get a good ending at the end cause if you don’t than bad ending awaits you and while i did got the good ending, i thought that the bad ending will simply change some dialogue here and there BUT NO! It was a completely different redesigned ending and i loved that touched by the developers. Basically what i meant here is that your choices matters in “ **Metro: Exodus** “ and it will have an impact in your storyline and you will get either the Good OR Bad ending based on it.

* **Weapon Customization / Combat:**

**Workbenches and your backpack** are now your saving graces in **Metro Exodus**, since there are no longer any shops to buy equipment and items. Gone is the awful system of trading in military-grade bullets for critical items; in its place is a crafting system that's both manageable and fitting for the survivalist mentality Exodus instills. You'll accumulate scrap metal and chemicals to craft medkits, filters, and ammo, and maintain weapon condition. Even when you're juggling systems such as keeping your flashlight charged and changing out gas mask filters, You find new weapons by killing enemies and looting them where you can separate attachments from them ( Great example can be given as if you have a silenced revolver and are going to clear a base silently but things get out-of-hand and at that moment you can change that same revolver into a sniper-rifle with adding scope and other attachments without going back to base or pausing the game ) and it never becomes overbearing and adds an enjoyable challenge of gear management even as you're fending off foes throughout.

&amp;#x200B;

[\* Turn your revolver into a sniper-rifle without any loading screen OR menu \*](https://i.redd.it/rh378zmqqfp21.jpg)

* **Graphics:**

This game LOOKS BEAUTIFUL, i mean when looking at this game when **RTX** is on ( i don't have RTX card yet so i played on just simply HIGH ) I thought “ WOW! How games graphics has come a long way “, I used to just stop at moments on top of a roof and for at least 2 minutes take in the beautiful environment before continuing my adventure. This game graphics is something else indeed. 

&amp;#x200B;

[\* This game is beautiful \*](https://i.redd.it/b5d8n8ourfp21.png)

* **Soundtrack:**

OH THE **SOUNDTRACK** IN “ **METRO:EXODUS** “ is my best favorite **soundtrack** of 2019 as of now, It gets intense when you are in combat or creepy in the tunnels and gets peaceful when exploring around and just staying at your home to reload your weapons and craft stuff. My favorite soundtrack in Metro:Exodus is the “ Race Against Fate And “ Dawn of Hope “ but i would recommend to play the game to experience it than just youtube it

**------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

**Cons:**

* **Somewhat Bad Animation:**

While the game looks beautiful with **RTX** been on and people will now definitely use this game than they used in “ Last Light “ to benchmark their computers, wither it was my computer or its a game issue but i had some bad lip-syncing as well as body animation of the characters. 

* **Point of Interest part that i did not liked:**

When i was doing my 100% run as to find all notes, all postcards as well as clear all the map i found one thing in particular annoying and it was those point of interest thing. In the open-map, you can go to the high play and use your binoculars to mark areas ( “?” would Appear in the map ). Those “?” would be of 2 types ( Enemy base / Place to sleep or monster nest ) and while i loved silently clearing out enemy bases to get a epic reward in it. I HATED THE MONSTER NEST places as they were a open place of monsters walking around and all you had to do is to loot a body and run away and it would get checked marked on our map. I did not enjoyed that and think the developers should have either added something else to explore than those monster nest places.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/vx19sligsfp21.jpg

* **Boss Fights:**

Now this is not a big con that i hated or gonna reduce my score for it BUT i think boss fights could have used some work and let my explain why. So now i am playing this game on **Ranger-Hardcore** difficulty and in this difficulty the ammo, grenades is rare. There would happen to have some sections of the game where after you silently get through a place and after an story event you are left in a small room with one big enemy using a machine gun to kill you and you had to just waste all the remaining ammo on him. Now YES! You can find more ammo by exploring but if there is a gamer who plays this difficulty only to run on story missions than exploring. He would be in big trouble and i feel like boss fights areas should have been changed to be little bit open and you had a chose to do it silently ( either silently get him or escape ). A lot of you might not agree with me but its my Opinion soo…. We all are different ( Thankfully there are not a lot of boss fights in “ **Metro:Exodus** “

* **Technical issues:**

It's worth noting that there were many technical issues i faced throughout Metro Exodus. In one chapter, i knocked someone out and that that same time the game saved so i got stuck on not showing up my weapons and even i restarted the game many time and did lot of stuff, i hard broke the game and had to restart the chapter ( thankfully i was at the start of it so i did not waste much of a time ) and started the make a backup save each hour. There is also noticeable framerate drops at modest settings i noted ( might be my old 980M graphic card ). I also can't speak about PS4 or Xbox One Version as i have not played there.

* **Epic-Store Exclusivity:**

I am not gonna talk about too much of this game 1 year **“ Epic-Exclusivity “,** Yes it sucks that they ( Deep Silver ) made this awful decision. The exclusivity will make 4A games less money, will get less Consumers but i pre-ordered it on Steam so i did not face that issue. I am not gonna talk about it and all i am gonna say that YES! Exclusivity sucks and I HATE IT………… thats all 

**( Little-Bit Spoiler ALERT!!!! )**

* **No Dark Once:**

Now again, not a huge issue or something i hate a most and will reduce score of it ( No i will not ) but the first 2 metros game had “ **The Dark Once** “ in it and i loved them in the storyline, but they are nowhere to be seen here in “ Metro: Exodus ” as they are here only in 2 easter eggs on them ( TV and the Building ) and theory about them helping you at the final chapter might be true but i miss them here, The Developers might have specifically left them for the next Metro Game and if that is the case than i am fine with that as they can play a huge part after Exodus ending.

\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------/

**FINAL VERDICT:** 

**9 / 10** **(** **Fantastic** **)**

**( A DEFINITELY MUST-TO-BUY )**

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/2qer9q7ysfp21.jpg

I was so close to give “ Metro: Exodus “ a solid **10/10 ( Masterpiece )** cause of outstanding story and characters but i think i should be fair and square and give a the closest score i can give which is a 9 ( would have been 9.5 but i can't do that as per my own rule ).

**Metro: Exodus** for me show what a true **FPS hardcore** game it is and this game was **HARD** on its

“ **Ranger-Hardcore** “ difficulty. It's a perfect sequel to “ **Last Light** “ and the best in its franchise as of now, **Metro: Exodus** offers Fantastic story, fantastic characters and its development as well as solid combat with crafting, good open-world to explore and much more. I definitely recommend you buy it if you love the metro and wanna experience a **HARDCORE FPS** game. **This game is easily my GOTY as of now for 2019**

CryptoMarkets,CryptoBridge: An exchange that deserves more attention,"Disclaimer: I am not affiliated to CryptoBridge (CB), I'm just a passionate user and think more people should give this exchange a chance as it offers some quite unique features and has a super passionate dev team. It essentially really lives the crypto spirit and doesn't just want to make money :)

Here's a list I have compiled with reasons why CB is in my opinion a great exchange:

* Partly decentralized exchange built on the Bitshares blockchain.
   * Trading takes place on the Bitshares blockchain, i.e. is fully decentralized.
   * Deposits and withdrawals are currently centralized via the CryptoBridge gateway (basically CB is holding your funds and issues you correspondding I-Owe-You Bitshares assets).
   * Federated gateways are on the roadmap and will further decentralize CB as everyone will be able to run a similar gateway to process deposits and withdrawals. However, federated gateways will not launch any time soon.
* Due to the blockchain trading, trading is 100% transparent. You see every trade of every user (which can help to make educated guesses when trading), which also means that no fake volume is possible and market manipulation can be easily spotted.
* Has a [market maker program](https://crypto-bridge.org/market-maker-program/) where you not only pay no trading fees, but you even get paid a bit for maker offers.
* Has  a native coin, [BridgeCoin BCO](https://crypto-bridge.org/bridgecoin/), which you can stake to earn a share of  the exchange's profits. Currently 75% of all trading fees paid are  distributed to BCO stakers.
* Has a ton of coins listed, both top marketcap coins as well as small/new coins.
* Has a quite powerful UI.
* Has very active developers who are also close to the community (discord channels).
* Has a very active community on discord.
* Offers live support on discord.
* Is working on a phone app (currently paused to focus on more important things).
* Publishes weekly [development updates](https://crypto-bridge.org/category/development/) and large [quarterly reports](https://crypto-bridge.org/category/development/quarterly-reports/).
* Wants to improve the overall cryptocurrency market/community with many educational initiatives, such as a partnership with [DARC](https://crypto-bridge.org/2019/01/19/focus-on-quality-darc-partnership/), to rate/analyze new coins (basically judging whether new projects are ""legit"" or just money grabs), quite detailed [information about some of the listed coins](https://crypto-bridge.org/category/promotional/) and also some blog posts and videos about Bitshares and CryptoBridge.
* Has no withdrawal limits.

I completely disagree, what does r/personalfinance think?

I recently started Dave Ramsey’s baby steps and am really buckling down on my budget and paying off debt. All I have left are student loans I wasn’t planning on paying but Dave Ramsey really pushes being debt free.  I have 20k saved up, and according to the baby steps I’m suppose to throw that all (except $1000 emergency fund) at my debt.   I could have all my student loans paid by the end of the year, and have a 3-6 month emergency fund and a down payment for a house by the following year. 

As a side note I have 20k in available credit Incase any emergencies come up. That $1000 emergency fund doesn’t make me feel comfortable. And my student loans have an interest rate of 4% so I don’t necessarily feel that paying $36,000 in student loans is mandatory right now.

investing,WSJ: ‘Fear of Missing Out’ Pushes Investors Toward Stocks,"As major indexes continue to rise toward last year’s records, investors say they are increasingly wary of missing further gains

Optimism about trade talks and the Federal Reserve’s signaled halt to interest-rate increases propelled the S&amp;P 500 to its best quarter since September 2009, even as investors wrestle with issues ranging from slowing global growth to uncertainties surrounding Brexit. As the rally has continued, powering major indexes toward last year’s records, investors say they are increasingly wary of missing out on further gains.

Stocks quickly stabilized last week after longer-term Treasury yields fell below those on shorter-term debt, a development known as an inverted yield curve that often presages a recession. The shift rattled markets briefly earlier in the month, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the quarter with a 1.7% weekly advance. One reason for the recovery: investors’ wagers that a U.S.-China trade agreement will stabilize the world economy, boosting corporate earnings.

Ed Leventhal, a 58-year old who manages a family investment office in New York, said he has been buying shares of some companies hurt by trade tensions such as Ford Motor Co.

“There’s no question we’re going to get some resolution to this,” Mr. Leventhal said. “There’s reason to believe that the U.S. economy will continue to do well.”

Investors this week expect to monitor trade discussions that could further swing markets, with U.S. and Chinese officials meeting in Washington. Manufacturing data and retail sales figures could also shift expectations for U.S. growth.

Many are also looking ahead to earnings season, which begins in earnest at the end of next week with reports from JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Wells Fargo &amp; Co. S&amp;P 500 companies are expected to report their first decline in quarterly profits from a year earlier since 2016.

Despite downbeat earnings projections for the January-March quarter, some investors have already grown increasingly optimistic following the Fed’s cautious shift. After investors pulled money from U.S. stock mutual and exchange-traded funds at the start of the year, more than $25 billion flowed in during the week ended March 13, the largest weekly inflow in a year, according to EPFR Global.

Investors withdrew money from such funds again during the weeks ended March 20 and 27, but they still increased their allocation to both stock funds and stocks in February, according to an American Association of Individual Investors survey. More than 80% of active traders say it is a good time to invest in U.S. stocks, a Charles Schwab survey found.

Some analysts say greater investor demand for stocks could join robust corporate buybacks in supporting major indexes. S&amp;P 500 share repurchases in the fourth quarter rose to a record $223 billion, a 63% increase from a year earlier, according to S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.

Buybacks make corporate profits appear stronger by lowering the number of shares outstanding, buoying per-share earnings beyond strong profit growth.

Some analysts remain confident stocks will rise even though the Fed recently lowered its economic growth projections for 2019. In response to the slowdown, the central bank signaled it likely won’t raise interest rates this year. Treasury yields, which fall when bond prices rise, have slumped to their lowest level in 15 months following the Fed statement.

At the same time, several said growth is slowing but sturdy, and a pause in interest-rate increases could still lift major indexes.

“There is that fear of missing out, which along with a tempered Fed creates the belief that we’re not going to be retesting those December lows,” said Leslie Thompson, managing principal at Spectrum Management Group.

Ms. Thompson said she has been buying shares of companies that pay higher dividends such as Darden Restaurants Inc., as well as technology stocks like Apple Inc.

After another weekly advance, the S&amp;P 500 is up 13% for the year and sits just 3.3% below last September’s all-time high. Some analysts have been caught off guard by the durability of the early-year rally because S&amp;P 500 companies are expected to report a nearly 4% drop in first-quarter earnings from a year earlier, according to FactSet.

Sectors that have led the market, such as technology, are expected to report double-digit percentage earnings declines. Even cyclical stocks tied to the health of the economy such as industrial and energy shares continue to power markets higher as growth slows, an illustration of the conflicting signals being sent by stock and bond markets.

Craig Hodges, portfolio manager for Hodges Funds, said he has been buying shares of faster-growing technology companies such as Twilio Inc., in addition to beaten-down materials firms including Commercial Metals Co.

“To me the backdrop is still pretty good,” Mr. Hodges said. “There have been a lot of excuses for the market to go down and it really hasn’t.”

With earnings estimates falling even as stocks surge, major indexes have gotten more expensive relative to companies’ earnings for the next 12 months. The price/earnings ratio of the S&amp;P 500 based on profit estimates for the next year, a common valuation measure, just logged its largest one-quarter increase since June 2009, according to a Dow Jones Market Data analysis of figures through Thursday.

Still, some analysts say current valuations are appropriate following the fourth-quarter selloff and swift recovery. The steady nature of this year’s gains also continues to placate nervous investors.

The S&amp;P 500 fell more than 1% in a session just three times in the first quarter, minimizing the outsize gyrations that made market observers so anxious late last year.

“People are trying to get really aggressive now,” said Benjamin Lau, chief investment officer of Apriem Advisors. “Clients do not want to miss out on the upswing in the market…The hard part is keeping their expectations in check.”

personalfinance,Looking for advice on joint credit card/checking/savings,"Hi PF,

My GF and I are closing on a house together soon and want to create a joint account to pay shared expenses out of (mortgage, utilities, groceries, etc.) as well as put a little extra away to save up for home improvements and emergencies. I want to maximize cash-back rewards and interest rates on the savings, while still keeping the money available to us. I'm thinking about opening the following:

\- Joint Citi Double Cash card to pay as many of the expenses as possible with

\- Joint Ally checking and savings accounts to pay the full balance of the Citi card every month and mortgage. Any extra   
  goes into the savings.

We would each contribute a set, equal amount to the account every paycheck or every month, and still retain our personal accounts for non-house stuff.

What do you think of this plan? Is there a better way, or a better credit card or bank to go with?

Thank you!

personalfinance,[16 y/o] What bank account should I get?,"Hey everyone. This summer I’m applying for a job, I’ll get my license, my parents are giving me a car, and I’m going out of town without them for a while. It seems like I’m slowly becoming more independent.

My parents are great so I don’t need to worry about them pulling something on my finances. My dad says I have a kids account leftover from when I was little at Dearborn Federal Credit Union. Neither of us have any idea how that account’s structure changed since then. I don’t really know much about bank accounts.

personalfinance,"Been planning to buy condo/townhouse in a few months. In light of the interest rate drop, should I jump now?","I've been planning to buy a condo or townhome by the end of this year. I'm in an awesome but temporary situation where I don't have to currently pay rent until I do buy a place. 

However, in light of the sudden fall of mortgage interest rates, I worry that I should try and purchase a place now. I don't feel quite ready, I wanted to save a bit more for closing costs and moving in costs, but have talked to two finance officers and they say everything looks great on their end (did not have my credit actually pulled, this was just a discussion). 

I'm a first time home buyer and still trying to figure out the best way to do this and still learning all the ins and outs of this process. Any suggestions about this would be helpful. 

Edit to add:
One reason I'm biting my fingernails over this is because my budget is fairly tight (because I choose it to be so I can try to pay this off in 15 years instead of 30, though I'm going for a 30 year loan). Lower interest rates mean better for me, right?",finance
personalfinance,How soon to refinance? should I refinance?,"Hello Everyone..

I just bought a new (used) car.

The dealership really pushed for the extended warranty ($3100) and Gap insurance ($800). I don't mind the gap but I plan on cancelling the Warranty after about 45 days. Just to make sure this car is reliable after sitting for 4 years. (2014 VW Jetta SportsWagen TDI (Repaired SmogGate vehicle) with 50k miles.

When I cancel this warranty, I will be refunded aprox. $3000 Since this total was added to the loan amount I am not sure if the refund will goto the loan or back to me. Either way I will apply it to the loan.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently my loan payoff is about $20k with my payment at $299 for 6 freaking years @ 10% 

My goal is to pay it down by at least $500 per month. I was told there are no pre-payment penalties and payment amounts over the amt due will be applied to Principal. (to be verified after 1st payment)

&amp;#x200B;

The dealership says I should come in to refinance after 6 months? Why would they suggest this?

&amp;#x200B;

I am thinking that after I cancel the warranty I should refinance to the lower amount, shorter term and higher payments? and possible better interest rate. Maybe even put some extra $$$ in also as I have $1500 coming from selling my old car.

Is this a good idea? or Should I wait to refinance? or should I just not bother with re-finance and pay off early. (30-40 months)

Any other suggestions?

financialindependence,Our journey to our third 100k (milestone update),"This is an update to an ongoing series of posts, the previous one can be found here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/8kv6xi/our\_journey\_to\_our\_second\_100k\_milestone\_update/](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/8kv6xi/our_journey_to_our_second_100k_milestone_update/)

&amp;#x200B;

It's been 10 months since we hit 200k and I was very surprised when I logged in and saw that, since it seems like much longer. The last few months have really dragged by slowly, watching how imperceptibly my account balance was rising I honestly thought that it was taking longer to get to 300k from 200k than it took to get to 200k from 100k, when in reality it was 5 months shorter. I think that this must be the start of the long, slow climb in the middle, after the initial rush of seeing money accumulate has worn off and long before you actually have enough to retire.

&amp;#x200B;

Of that 300k, my net worth increased from 145k to 198k and my wifes increased from 55k to 102k (we track our accounts separately, with a joint account we pay expenses out of). These numbers reflect cash, equities, and other liquid assets, they don't include home equity, vehicle values, etc. Roughly 55% of it is in domestic stock indexes, 15% in foreign stock, and the remainder in bonds, CD's, savings accounts, etc

&amp;#x200B;

Seeing that it was only 10 months is encouraging, but I don't expect the pace to pick up at a similar rate moving forward, my wifes job is pretty much peaked out as far as earning potential and I'm not sure how much higher mine can rise either.

&amp;#x200B;

My company recently elected to give me a title upgrade following up on our discussion during my review last year, it hasn't gone live yet and we'll see if it comes with a salary bump or not, but at the very least it'll look good on a resume. In an interesting turn, one of our larger clients approached me privately with a proposition to work with them directly, cutting out my current employer and potentially having some equity in their business. I'm meeting with them to discuss details, but I see pros and cons to giving up my well-paying job where I'm good at what I do and appreciated for it, for the moonshot potential to go from ""well-off"" to ""stupid rich"" (for context, the most recent sale we made for this client, of which I orchestrated a number of key parts through my current position, made our clients about 4.5 million in profit, split amongst the handful of current partners).

&amp;#x200B;

Another reason we don't expect to see net worth continue to rise at the same rate is we're seriously trying for kids now, which will undoubtedly supress earnings for a while when they come along. 

&amp;#x200B;

Looking ahead, I fully expect that the climb to 400k will be a long one, possibly multiple years if the over-valued state of the market and the recent yield curve inversion are precursors to the next recession.

&amp;#x200B;

On that note I've been trying to dial back my exposure to equities from 80-20 to 60-40 equity-bond split, and the rising fed rate was helping to accomplish some of that by bringing bond and CD rates up to reasonable levels, some CD's were as high as 5% before the fed paused rate hikes. At this point I'm roughly 90k (30%) in bonds, CDs, and high interest savings accounts. Not quite at the 40% allocation yet, but I already sleep much better knowing that I don't have as much at risk in the next recession.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm aware that what I'm doing is market timing, and that's a valid criticism. It's certainly a possibility that I'm wrong and that the bull market will continue, but I'm not willing to put all my eggs in that basket, which tells me maybe my higher net worth is revealing my appetite for risk is not as high as I thought. Until the market has some time to cool off I don't think I'll be adding much to my equity positions.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

In the past year we've only loosely continued to budget, catching up on our budget tracking only a few times to check where we're at. And as a result that should surprise no one, our expenses have increased as a result of the laxidasical oversight, we blew our $53k budget out of the water this year with a whopping $68k in expenses. Much of the excess has been fueled by a home reno project that started as knocking down a few walls and has evolved into redoing the entire kitchen, in a textbook example of mission creep that any homeowner would be familiar with. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fortunately our incomes have also increased this year. We just barely cleared $200k in gross income, and the new tax code resulted in only a 17% effective tax rate, so we were able to sock away the remainder and still maintain a savings rate of 50% (pre-tax)/60% (post-tax).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Some takeaways from the past 10 months:

&amp;#x200B;

\- One of the key things that has allowed me to have the ability to explore things like the potential opportunity with this client is knowing that I have $300k backing me up and I don't need to worry about whether I can pay the mortgage (I could pay it off entirely at this point) or afford groceries. This has given me the balls to do things in my career that I never would have otherwise. If you don't have money you don't have options, so when opportunity comes knocking you aren't equipped to answer. Whether I pursue this new opportunity or remain where I'm at, either way I realize I'm privileged enough to be free to choose.

\- My wife has seen a similar effect - knowing that we have that much money in the bank, has allowed her to feel emboldened to ask for additional benefits at work; she is also prepared to walk away if her boss is not willing to negotiate.

\- Our budgetary diligence has been shit since we stopped tracking our expenses monthly, allowing things to balloon even more out of control. Going forward I need to make an effort to watch this monthly and keep a better eye on our expenses or lifestyle creep is going to get the best of us.

\- Overall, the biggest benefit of pursuing FIRE so far has been knowing that we have that much money to our name. We never worry or argue about money and are confident that if an emergency or an unexpected expense crops out, it won't phase us much. Just having that peace of mind, especially seeing friends and relatives living pay check to pay check, is huge.",finance
personalfinance,IRA Certificate Offer,"Hey /r/personalfinance!

Just a quick question to see if this is ""worth it"" for me.

My credit union (Navy Federal Credit Union) is doing a ""special offer"" of a 40 month IRA Certificate at 3.75% APY and I was just checking if this is a good deal.

For me, I'm 20 years old and I've got about 18K in savings, another 4K in checking, a 2K certificate that matures in may, a 8K certificate that has about another year left, no debt, credit card paid off monthly, and I contribute 10% to my TSP with a 5% match.

I would probably throw about 2K in the IRA cert to start off and then toss some extra in each paycheck (just a couple hundred) plus when my other certificate matures put that in there. Or is there something else I could do that's better/wouldn't lock that money up for 40 months?",finance
personalfinance,Is it worth refinancing student loan if we're aggressively overpaying?,"A few years ago, my wife refinanced her Parent Plus student loan over to SoFi. The rate is 5.625%.

Our credit union, Navy Federal, is running a promotion for fixed rates as low as 4.25%. We both have 775+ credit scores per Credit Karma (""excellent"") so I would think that if I cosign for it on top of her application, we'd get that low rate, or pretty darn close.

That said, the balance is currently $9k. The minimum payment is $350/month, which we pay, but we're also averaging about $1k in overpayments each month since we're currently making good incomes.

If we're so aggressively nuking it with the intent of probably decimating it by the end of CY2019, is it even worth refinancing over to NFCU to save \~1.5%? Are we really going to see the difference there? Or would it actually damage us more by closing an account to open another, resulting in inquiries and low average account ages hitting our credit?",finance

However, when redeeming that I saw I had points that were going to expire, so I figured I'll try Far Cry 5. So, I got that for a discount as well.

gaming,I tried to get support from Epic Games to delete my account. This is the series of emails I got in response,"https://imgur.com/gallery/EQT7th7

Note that this is my first time using imgur so let me know if something looks wonky!

I decided that 20 emails a day that my Epic games account was being accessed across the world was enough, so I jump through the 1000 hoops in their support site to find where I could delete my account once and for all. I tried this early last summer but I literally got a response after a 50 question long form that said “You really don’t want to do that.” I got so pissed that I stopped trying, until a few days ago. I don’t play any games on it anymore, and haven’t done so in more than a year so I figured why not. When I finally found the place to request a deletion, they sent me an email to confirm it. You can see I confirmed it, but suddenly got a response from someone saying that I never responded. A little miffed due the fact that they might not let me delete it again, I sent back that response that says that I had literally responded to that email saying what needed to be said to confirm the deletion. Then, today, I get that last email. I’m just floored because I don’t think my name is Alfredo, I’m almost certain it’s Nathan. But who know better than Epic and their amazing platform.

Btw, the main reason for me deleting my account is simply the security issue. Like I said, I got so many emails a day about my account being accessed even after I’d change my password that I’d decided it’s too much of a risk to keep around. I learned how to make a email spam filter for this, so I’m a little sad to see it go

Edit: just noticed the order of the pictures are off, but it works because it’s best to read these emails from the bottom of the last picture upwards. Sorry!",technology

personalfinance,Starting new job – Looking for general budgeting and retirement/tax planning advice.,"Hey everyone! Burner account.... I'm starting a new job and I want to take this as an opportunity to carefully structure out my finances. I have been reading a lot of the wikis PF and feel that I have a pretty good idea of what I need to do, but I just want some confirmation/ outside perspective. Really hoping some of you would dive into this puzzle with me....TIA for any info or help! 

&amp;#x200B;

So.. I'm a 28m with no debt (except for \~2k credit card balance which I'll immediately pay off once I start/after tax return), cheap rent (680), reliable car, and basically not a lot of life expenses. I have around 10k in a Roth IRA and 2k in an individual brokerage all invested fairly aggressively. For the past 2 years I have made around 25k annually. I'm about to accept a job that offered 65k (hourly equivalent) + potential for 15% eoy bonus....full benefits, etc. There is a 401k and I'm pretty sure it matches but I haven't seen the details yet....for now lets assume theres they do a fairly average/standard match. I plan to try to maintain a pretty similar lifestyle after starting, although I know I will be tempted to spend a little more on random luxuries considering I will have the means to. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Budgeting:** 

I just signed up for Mint....linked is the breakdown of my spending for the past 3 months. Total spending in that time was 7200 (\*I cant figure out if this is including the reimbursements I get from my roommates for utilities). I think this might be a little higher than normal, but ultimately I think it's fairly reflective of my lifestyle and average costs. Obviously the notable thing here is how much I spend on food (I'm a big fit guy so I eat a lot, and I just appreciate good food). Gas is high because I drive to go ski a lot. I plan to really break down a budget moving forward but I just wanted to make sure that this distribution looks fairly standard at first glance.

&amp;#x200B;

**Investing/tax planning:**

Ok, on to the fun stuff :D

I live in Oregon where the state tax rate is 9%. Delineation for 2nd and 3rd fed tax bracket is $39,475 for 2019. So, my plan (And one thing I'm struggling to account for is the fact that I won't actually make 65k this calendar year given that I'm starting in March...but for the sake of this exercise lets assume I will and then I'll get more specific to this year later.): 

\- Max 401k to reduce tax liability to as close to 39,475 as possible. Theoretically this should get me to around 46,000.

\- Open traditional IRA and max my contribution to that to get my liability down to 40,000.

\- Then based on some online tax calculators, I would take home around 31,000 after tax at that point. 

\- Then I would probably start to chip into my ROTH with whatever I have leftover on a monthly basis....

\- Then, if the bonus comes through, I would aim to max my ROTH then maybe put any leftovers into my individual brokerage, start building an emergency fund, buy some steaks, trade some crypto...who knows...shit might get wild. 

&amp;#x200B;

Few things to note: 

\- I am very lucky and my parents are very financially stable, and while this feels snotty to say, I frankly don't feel that I need to prioritize an emergency fund. Convince me otherwise? 

\- When reading the flowchart, it suggests maxing a 401k up to the point in which you get your match and then switching towards a trad or roth IRA. I read in another thread this is because most 401ks don't provide good low cost fund options....but it seems to me that reducing my tax liability would be more important, correct? I understand that compounding 1.2% expense ratio is a killer but avoiding 10% tax on 20k also seems valuable. Ultimately I will just have to wait and see what my 401k plan is like.....

\- I'm a bit confused as to whether I can put 6,000k into a trad and ROTH IRA or if it's 6000k combined between the two. This would obviously change things. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I feel very fortunate to be in the situation I am in. I'm looking forward to saving more and getting more structured and proactive with this. Please feel free to point out any stupid/confused/misguided thinking on my part. Thanks again for reading and any input you might have.

I'm 22 and I just graduated from college and have been working for almost 3 months now. I've been using YNAB to track my budgeting and spending and would like some input on how I have things set up so far. 

I've italicized budget categories that I'd like specific input on, but if anyone sees anything they'd like to comment on please let me know. **How does my budget look? Is there anything major I'm missing?** I've been on this budget since mid January when I started work, but **are there any categories that you'd recommend I'd adjust?** At the moment I'm trying to throw everything I can at my student loans while also not living like a frugal hermit. 

**Extra info, skip if you want:**

I feel like with my salary I should be able to dump a lot more into my loans, but it seems that everything else just adds up to more than I thought it would. At this rate I can get my loans paid off within ~6-7 years, probably shorter depending on how lucky I get with job hopping/raises. Unfortunately this also means I won't be able to move into a house for ~10 years as I can't really save for a down payment while paying off my loans.

In &lt;2 years when my emergency fund is up to $10k I'm going to put that $300/month towards my student loans. In 4 years when my car is paid off I plan to continue putting $224/month into savings for a future down payment on my next car. In ~6 years when my private loans are gone, I'm planning to continue paying the minimum on my federal loans until they're gone, increase my retirement funding to 15-20% of my income, then put whatever extra into a down payment for a house. Also FYI, as I'm under 26 I'm on my parents' health plan, so for the time being I wont be paying for my own health insurance (thankfully). 

EDIT: I made adjustments to a few categories based off comments received.",finance
personalfinance,Lowering Monthly Payment for FedLoans,After paying down my student debt and fitting extra payments towards student loans into my biweekly budget I changed the due date on MyFedLoan.  I found out that every time I change my due date it recalculates the monthly payment to fit a 10 year standardized plan.  I went from owing 271.98 a month to 92 to 85.34.  I’m still paying the usual amount but I’ve lowered my monthly debt obligation.,finance

personalfinance,How do I know if I am ready to buy a home?,"Im a 22 year old guy and I left college about 9 months ago and started working immediately after that. My job is in a different city so naturally I needed to rent. However my parents have been suggesting me I should stop renting as quickly as possible so I'm not throwing away so much money and have some kind of return.

My job is in Tysons Corner, Virginia, about 20-30 minutes from Washington DC. This area is surprisingly expensive (to me at least) to rent, with reasonable rents ranging from $1300 to $1500. My lease runs out in 2 months (June) and I've been leaning towards purchasing a condo or townhouse instead of searching for another place to lease. My current lease is $1550 per month but its going up to over $1700 so I will definitely be moving in some way. However I can't help but feel like I'm being rushed into it and would appreciate some guidance about the situation.

The main reasons I'm leaning towards purchasing is due to low interest rates and fairly reasonable townhomes in the area. Im not sure how legitimate interest rate predictions are but I've read that the first half of 2019 has fairly low interest rates but will increase to over 5% later on or in 2020. I don't want to end up needing to pay way more in interest just because I'm hesitant about purchasing now. I have a fairly good credit score (760) but my lack of work history might be an issue. 

I've also been looking at reasonably priced homes in the area, mainly under $300k and my parents are willing to lend me ~10% for a down payment. I'm aiming for around $2k per month with mortgages (including tax, HOA, homeowners insurance and PMI due to low down payment). This is 50% of my monthly paycheck and is what I can reasonably pay per month for housing after budgeting in living expenses, loans and various savings goals. I was able to find a few townhouses with lower HOAs that have a monthly estimate of $1800-$2000 on Redfin (30 year fixed, ~4%). I'm pretty frugal with money and have around $6k in emergency funds and will increase that as time goes on. On the other hand, I do have about $20k in students loans that I'm pretty aggressively paying off right now and I planned to finish paying it off around November 2020. If I do purchase a home then that date would obviously be pushed back some. Additionally, desirable homes in my area go pretty quickly (from newly posted to under contract in about 10 days on average) so I would basically need to move pretty quickly if there were something that I liked. 

In terms of long term plans, I plan on staying at my current job at least a few years, I think after that I would start to look at different companies in the area but I wouldn't be opposed to moving to a different city for work. At that point, I would basically need to sell the home or keep it as rental income, both of which I am willing to do. I would imagine that selling the home at that point would be better than spending ~$20k a year on rent. I would also have more stable housing costs and not have to worry about needing to move whenever the rents rise.

While I have been doing research for a few months, Im not really sure if I am missing something or really ready to start looking for homes. I have looked at Mortgage brokers and banks in the area that offer home loans but I've been hesitant to actually do the hard pulls to get pre-approved. I don't know if I actually have everything in place to start or if I am just being way too cautious about the situation, as I tend to do about a lot of other things. I don't want to make any mistakes or regret my decisions now further down the line.

Am I getting ahead of myself and should slow down or should I go ahead and start looking really soon? Do I go for the 30 year fixed to lock in the interest rates or should I go for ARM in hopes that in 5/10 years, the interest rates go down? As a first time home buyer, what are things I need to know in term of the buying process itself? I know some of the usual things (home inspection, shop around for mortgages) but what are some things to keep in mind in the process.",finance
personalfinance,USA: Does paying off a student loan hurt my credit score since I have one fewer account open? Is it wise to pay off three student loans on a single payment or should I stagger them to be paid off at different times?,"I have three student loans. They all have the same interest rate, and at this point they all (basically) have the same balance. As I understand them, the snowball and avalanche methods won't make any difference in terms of my repayment.

But does paying off a loan hurt my credit score since I have one fewer account open?  I fear that closing three accounts all at once might hurt my credit score, in which case I might want to plan ahead so that I pay each loan off a few months apart from each other.",finance
personalfinance,"Bank Messed Up, now have 2x money, what do I do?","Hi /r/personalfinace,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in the US. I recently realized that my interest rate on my savings account (let's say at Bank A) was utter crap compared to other banks / the option of putting some money away into a CD / investing. I already have a Roth IRA with Bank B that invests the money for me and is a pretty hands off, so I don't have to think about it too much. I decided to open a regular investment account with them and put a few thousand in. I also wanted to have some money that isn't at risk, so I had another few thousand I wanted to find a high interest savings account for.

&amp;#x200B;

I looked at a service recommended by the Wall Street Journal, and it had me open an account with Bank C at a pretty high interest rate. This had me sold. The service (pretty much an intermediately) tried to do the first transfer Tuesday night, but I guess Bank C was doing maintenance and the transaction said ""failed."" (not pending). This was a bit finicky and I realized I didn't know much about what I was getting into, so I messaged Bank C on Wednesday saying I wanted to close my savings account, which had a balance of 0 at the time (no money transferred in yet). They replied the same day confirming the account closing would happened within 2 business days. After that, I decided to move the same amount of money into a savings account at Bank B instead. It has a slightly lower interest rate compared to Bank C but at least it was better than my old savings account at Bank A, and I trust the bank B as they already do a pretty good job with my investments.

&amp;#x200B;

Forward to Thursday morning, I wake up to a negative balance on my checking’s at Bank A, which freaked me out. Turns out the transfer to Bank B AND the transfer to Bank C (which I thought had not gone through), were ""processing."" I immediately got on the phone with my bank and told them the situation. They said the money was in some warehouse state (I don't quite understand). The money had left my bank but that they could still put a stop order on the transfer to Bank C. They said to wait 24 hours and check again. At the same time, Bank C said they had already received the money and that I would need to transfer it back before they close the account. Friday morning, the transfer to Bank C had disappeared from my account at Bank A and I had my proper balance again (so I guess the stop payment did block the transfer). The transfer to Bank B had gone through. So everything looked good at Bank A and B.

&amp;#x200B;

However, Bank C still says it has the money. When I log into my account, it has a balance and I'm even getting interest on it. What do I do? Do I follow Bank C's directions and transfer to Bank A? Do I contact Bank A and ask if the money really didn't go through? FYI, Bank A is one of the really big banks, so it's accounting is probably better.

personalfinance,Saving up to move - how much is reasonable to put away?,"Hi all,

As the title states, I am looking to move this summer to a new city in the Mid-west. I currently have $5,000 saved up in an emergency fund (invested in a federal money market fund) that currently covers about 3 months living expenses. Since I will be moving to a more expensive area and traveling for at least 2-3 days to get there, how much would you recommend putting away to make the trip seamless and provide enough piece of mind during the process?
