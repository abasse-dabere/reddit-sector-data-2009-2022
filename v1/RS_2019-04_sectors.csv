personalfinance,Is there anything I need to know before I switch to Ally for checking and savings?,"I apologize in advance for the skeptical tone of this post but I'm used to banking institutions trying to screw you at every turn and the glowing praise I see for Ally seems too good to be true given my prior life experiences with banks.

I currently have a checking account with a local bank that pays zero interest.  My paychecks are direct deposited there.  There are no fees as long as I maintain a minimum $500 balance.  I rarely visit an ATM (maybe 4 times a year or less) and I usually only step foot into the branch when I need to deposit a check larger than $2000 (the deposit limit on my bank's phone app).  I only keep enough in my checking account to cover my typical monthly bills and the rest gets moved into my investment account.

I also have a ""high-yield"" savings account with another online bank (not Ally) but the interest rate is less than half of what Ally advertises.  I don't really use the savings account that much because it takes 6 days to move money in/out.

I'm considering opening both a savings and a checking account with Ally.  I would like to have my paycheck direct deposited into the savings account and then only transfer money to the checking account right before paying my bills.

On the Ally site, it says ""Online transfers between Ally Bank accounts are immediate.""  Is that really true?

Other than the 6-times-per-month transfer limit on the savings account, are there any other restrictions I need to know about?  I really only see myself making two or three transactions a month on the Savings account.

I think my biggest concern is about how I would go about depositing a large check, say over $5000 into the savings account.  How would that work?

Are there any kind of minimum balances or debit card usage requirements hidden in the fine print somewhere?

Do they provide any ""starter"" checks for the checking account?  If not, am I allowed to order them anywhere or do I have to order them through Ally?  I use less than 10 checks per year (probably a LOT less).

That's all the concerns I can think of at the moment.  Is there anything else good or bad that I should know about Ally before making the plunge?",finance

personalfinance,Is there a point to having more than one credit card?,"So here's some context before I get to the question:

I currently have two bank accounts: Citibank (checking, savings, one credit card) and School’s First (checking, savings, summer savers, and one credit card). 

I've had Citibank for a couple years now, been pretty pleased with them so far. A couple weeks ago, however, they sent me a notice that I'll no longer be able to have a student checking account, and will now have an account that will cost me $25/month. I’m not really down to pay that much for something I already have for free with the credit union so I was thinking of closing my Citibank account and moving to School’s First as my primary bank account. 

Is there a reason to continue keeping my current credit card at Citibank? It’s their Thank You Preferred card, if it matters. It has a limit of $7,000 and an interest rate of ~14.5%. For reference, the card I just received from School’s First has a limit of $10,000 and an interest rate of ~9.75%,. Furthermore, can you maintain a credit card at a bank without a checking or savings account? 

I’m okay with keeping the Citibank card for emergencies and just putting Netflix or something like that on there to keep it active. 

Thanks for the help.

It may fail but we now know how to do it

Let us follow the logic of things from the beginning. Or, rather, from the end: modern times. We are, as I am writing these lines, witnessing a complete riot against some class of experts, in domains that are too difficult for us to understand, such as macroeconomic reality, and in which not only the expert is not an expert, but he doesn’t know it. That previous Federal Reserve bosses, Greenspan and Bernanke, had little grasp of empirical reality is something we only discovered a bit too late: one can macro-BS longer than micro-BS, which is why we need to be careful on who to endow with centralized macro decisions.

What makes it worse is that all central banks operated under the same model, making it a perfect monoculture.

In the complex domain, expertise doesn’t concentrate: under organic reality, things work in a distributed way, as Hayek has convincingly demonstrated. But Hayek used the notion of distributed knowledge. Well, it looks like we do not even need that thing called knowledge for things to work well. Nor do we need individual rationality. All we need is structure.

It doesn’t mean all participants have a democratic sharing of decisions. One motivated participant can disproportionately move the needle (what I have studied as the asymmetry of the minority rule). But every participant has the option to be that player.

Somehow, under scale transformation, emerges a miraculous effect: rational markets do not require any individual trader to be rational. In fact they work well under zero-intelligence –a zero intelligence crowd, under the right design, works better than a Soviet-style management composed to maximally intelligent humans.

Which is why Bitcoin is an excellent idea. It fulfills the needs of the complex system, not because it is a cryptocurrency, but precisely because it has no owner, no authority that can decide on its fate. It is owned by the crowd, its users. And it has now a track record of several years, enough for it to be an animal in its own right.

For other cryptocurrencies to compete, they need to have such a Hayekian property.

Bitcoin is a currency without a government. But, one may ask, didn’t we have gold, silver and other metals, another class of currencies without a government? Not quite. When you trade gold, you trade “loco” Hong Kong and end up receiving a claim on a stock there, which you might need to move to New Jersey. Banks control the custodian game and governments control banks (or, rather, bankers and government officials are, to be polite, tight together). So Bitcoin has a huge advantage over gold in transactions: clearance does not require a specific custodian. No government can control what code you have in your head.

Finally, Bitcoin will go through hick-ups (hiccups). It may fail; but then it will be easily reinvented as we now know how it works. In its present state, it may not be convenient for transactions, not good enough to buy your decaffeinated expresso macchiato at your local virtue-signaling coffee chain. It may be too volatile to be a currency, for now. But it is the first organic currency.

But its mere existence is an insurance policy that will remind governments that the last object establishment could control, namely, the currency, is no longer their monopoly. This gives us, the crowd, an insurance policy against an Orwellian future.",cryptocurrency

I was wondering if the payment calculation is based on the latest tax return (tax year 2018)? Since we did not get married til 2019, would that mean the payment would be based soley on my wife's income since we had both filed Single in 2018.

personalfinance,Unfair medical bill. Ignored for months. Now it's hurt my credit score.,"A year ago, my doctor did a urine test.

LabCorp continued sending me bills in the mail over the next six months. Then my case was sent to a debt collector. I threw out all the letters. (Yes, this was dumb.)

personalfinance,"Purchasing a home through a business, and promissory note tax efficiency","Hey all, I've been lurking but this is my first post. Some advice would be appreciated! This is new territory for me, but from what I've researched I think this might be a win-win situation.

&amp;#x200B;

**Part I - The Challenge**

So first, the situation. I currently rent a townhome with my wife. The townhome neighborhood is located inside of a larger apartment complex, owned by the Smiths (name redacted). I am also a small business owner experiencing some real growth for the first time. My first few years hovered around \~$40-50k revenue, this year we're on target to hit $200k with $50k signed, sealed, delivered in Q1 and a greater workload in the pipeline with lots more publicity. Currently I have x5 1099's on projects and  looking at first full-time hire by the end of the year. I currently run the business from home.

Recently, the Smiths, who own the apartment complex (which does NOT include the townhomes... they are individually owned, but the Smiths own several), called me into the office. I thought it was for business, but turns out they had a personal matter in mind. My current landlord (not the Smiths) is selling his townhome to the Smiths and my lease is up in May. We have the new lease renewal in-hand... but the Smiths call me in to discuss.

They want to buy my townhome from the current owner, renovate it and put a family member in it. They are asking me (politely) to move and said they would do anything they could to make it easy for us to transition.

&amp;#x200B;

**Part II - The Financial Advice Questions**

My wife and I have been looking for a house so we can start a family, but have not been able to find anything we liked... it was a bit frustrating since we were planning to stay another year to keep stashing down-payment funds and growing the business. But after this conversation we kicked up our home search and found a house we love. If we can close on it quickly we may be able to make the end-of-May target date for the Smiths. So this is where it gets interesting...

The majority of the home would be used for business. People would work on location when mutually planned (1099's can't have required hours, but we frequently like working together). A large section of the house would be used for computer clusters, the main lounge area set up for meetings, the garage turned into a sign-making and prototyping workshop and the basement used for servers and networking. So here are my questions regarding this:

1.) Can I buy this home through my business and essentially ""rent"" the living space from the business? Would this offer me substantial enough tax benefits to justify this?

2.) We have a decent amount of cash on hand for a downpayment... but if bought through the business would require a commercial loan which brings me to #3...

3.) I have read a bit that obtaining a Promissory Note can be a tax-efficient way for businesses to procure a loan agreement between each other where capital gains can sometimes be tax-free or less-taxed. Am I understanding that correctly? And finally...

4.) I have a bit of leverage here since they're asking me to uproot my life and move so they can buy this townhome on the cheap, fix it up and put their family member in it. Would it be prudent/respectful to ask if they would consider a Promissory Note?

&amp;#x200B;

**Part III - The Potential Mutual Benefits**

This would allow several things, unless I'm mistaken (which is why I'm asking for advice)...

1.) They get us out of the townhome quickly and can proceed with their plans.

2.) We get into a house we love and would be beneficial to the growth of my operation.

3.) I get the tax benefits by purchasing through the business. (unless I am mistaken... please help!)

4.) They get the opportunity to make the interest instead of a bank. (They are well set-up to offset risk that comes with a Promissory Note situation, as they own more than 5 separate apartment complexes and over 1000 rental units, and are set up as a real estate company).

5.) We get to negotiate a lower interest rate since it's a private negotiation.

&amp;#x200B;

**Part IV - Am I Dreaming? What are the Downsides? Could this work how I'm imagining it?**

I know these ideas might just be pie-in-the-sky... but that's why I'm asking for advice. I'm a designer and programmer, not an accountant or business finance expert of any sort. But I think this has the potential to be a win-win for all parties involved. Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated!!

Bitcoin,"Bitcoins volatility is a feature,not a bug. Complex systems that have artificially suppressed volatility become fragile, they tend to exhibit minimal variability as silent risks accumulate beneath the surface then the highly constrained systems explode. Free systems become strong from variability.","Why is surprise the permanent condition
of the U.S. political and economic elite? In
2007–8, when the global financial system
imploded, the cry that no one could have
seen this coming was heard everywhere,
despite the existence of numerous analyses
showing that a crisis was unavoidable. 

The critical
issue is the artificial suppression of volatility—the ups and downs of
life—in the name of stability. It is both misguided and dangerous to push unobserved
risks further into the statistical tails of the
probability distribution of outcomes and
allow these high-impact, low-probability
“tail risks” to disappear from policymakers’
fields of observation. 

What the world is
witnessing is simply what happens when highly
constrained systems explode.
Complex systems that have artificially
suppressed volatility tend to become
extremely fragile, while at the same time
exhibiting no visible risks. In fact, they
tend to be too calm and exhibit minimal
variability as silent risks accumulate
beneath the surface.

 Although the stated
intention of political leaders and economic
policymakers is to stabilize the system by
inhibiting fluctuations, the result tends
to be the opposite. These artificially constrained systems become prone to “Black
Swans”—that is, they become extremely
vulnerable to large-scale events that lie far
from the statistical norm and were largely
unpredictable to a given set of observers.
Such environments eventually experience massive blowups, catching everyone
off-guard and undoing years of stability
or, in some cases, ending up far worse than
they were in their initial volatile state.
Indeed, the longer it takes for the blowup
to occur, the worse the resulting harm in
both economic and political systems.


Seeking to restrict variability seems to
be good policy (who does not prefer stability
to chaos?), so it is with very good intentions
that policymakers unwittingly increase the
risk of major blowups. And it is the same
misperception of the properties of natural
systems that led the economic
crisis of 2007–8. 

The policy implications
are: to make systems robust, all
risks must be visible and out in the open—
fluctuat nec mergitur (it fluctuates but does
not sink) goes the Latin saying.
Just as a robust economic system is one
that encourages early failures (the concepts
of “fail small” and “fail fast”), the U.S. government should stop supporting dictatorial regimes for the sake of pseudostability
and instead allow political noise to rise to
the surface. Making an economy robust
in the face of business swings requires
allowing risk to be visible; the same is
true in politics.

SEDUCED BY STABILITY
Both the recent financial crisis and the political crises in the Middle East
are grounded in the rise of complexity,
interdependence, and unpredictability.
Policymakers in the UK and
the USA have long promoted
policies aimed at eliminating fluctuation—
no more booms and busts in the economy,
no more “Iranian surprises” in foreign
policy. These policies have almost always
produced undesirable outcomes.

 For
example, the U.S. banking system became
very fragile following a succession of progressively larger bailouts and government
interventions, particularly after the 1983
rescue of major banks (ironically, by the
same Reagan administration that trumpeted free markets). 

In the United States,
promoting these bad policies has been a
bipartisan effort throughout. Republicans
have been good at fragilizing large corporations through bailouts, and Democrats have
been good at fragilizing the government.


At the same time, the financial system as a
whole exhibited little volatility; it kept getting weaker while providing policymakers
with the illusion of stability, illustrated
most notably when Ben Bernanke, who
was then a member of the Board of Governors of the U.S. Federal Reserve, declared
the era of “the great moderation” in 2004.


Putatively independent central
bankers fell into the same trap. During
the 1990s, U.S. Federal Reserve Chair
Alan Greenspan wanted to iron out the
economic cycle’s booms and busts, and he
sought to control economic swings with
interest-rate reductions at the slightest
sign of a downward tick in the economic
data. Furthermore, he adapted his economic policy to guarantee bank rescues,
with implicit promises of a backstop—the
now infamous “Greenspan put.” 

These
policies proved to have grave delayed side
effects. Washington stabilized the market
with bailouts and by allowing certain companies to grow “too big to fail.” Because
policymakers believed it was better to do
something than to do nothing, they felt
obligated to heal the economy rather than
wait and see if it healed on its own.


The foreign policy equivalent is to
support the incumbent no matter what.
And just as banks took wild risks thanks to
Greenspan’s implicit insurance policy, client
governments such as Hosni Mubarak’s in
Egypt for years engaged in overt plunder
thanks to similarly reliable U.S. support.


Those who seek to prevent volatility on
the grounds that any and all bumps in the
road must be avoided paradoxically increase
the probability that a tail risk will cause a
major explosion.


Consider a thought experiment, a man placed in an artificially
sterilized environment for a decade and
then invited to take a ride on a crowded
subway; he would be expected to die
quickly. Likewise, preventing small forest
fires can cause larger forest fires to become
devastating. This property is shared by
all complex systems.


In the realm of economics, price controls are designed to constrain volatility on
the grounds that stable prices are a good
thing. But although these controls might
work in some rare situations, the long-term
effect of any such system is an eventual
and extremely costly blowup whose cleanup
costs can far exceed the benefits accrued.


The risks of a dictatorship, no matter how
seemingly stable, are no different, in the
long run, from those of an artificially
controlled price.
Such attempts to institutionally engineer
the world come in two types: those that
conform to the world as it is and those
that attempt to reform the world. The
nature of humans, quite reasonably, is to intervene in an effort to alter their world and
the outcomes it produces. But government
interventions are laden with unintended—
and unforeseen—consequences, particularly
in complex systems, so humans must work
with nature by tolerating systems that
absorb human imperfections rather than
seek to change them.


Take, for example, the recent celebrated
documentary on the financial crisis, Inside
Job, which blames the crisis on the malfeasance and dishonesty of bankers and the
incompetence of regulators. Although it
is morally satisfying, the film naively overlooks the fact that humans have always been
dishonest and regulators have always
been behind the curve. The only difference
this time around was the unprecedented
magnitude of the hidden risks and a misunderstanding of the statistical properties
of the system.


**What is needed is a system that can
prevent the harm done to citizens by the
dishonesty of business elites; the limited
competence of forecasters, economists, and
statisticians; and the imperfections of
regulation, not one that aims to eliminate
these flaws.** 

Humans must try to resist the
illusion of control: just as foreign policy
should be intelligence-proof (it should
minimize its reliance on the competence
of information-gathering organizations
and the predictions of “experts” in what
are inherently unpredictable domains),
the economy should be regulator-proof,
given that some regulations simply make
the system itself more fragile. Due to the
complexity of markets, intricate regulations
simply serve to generate fees for lawyers
and profits for sophisticated derivatives
traders who can build complicated financial
products that skirt those regulations. 

DON’T BE A TURKEY
The life of a turkey before Thanksgiving
is illustrative: the turkey is fed for 1,000
days and every day seems to confirm that
the farmer cares for it—until the last day,
when confidence is maximal. The “turkey
problem” occurs when a naive analysis of
stability is derived from the absence of
past variations. Likewise, confidence in
stability was maximal at the onset of the
financial crisis in 2007.


The turkey problem for humans is the
result of mistaking one environment for
another.

 Humans simultaneously inhabit
two systems: the linear and the complex.

The linear domain is characterized by its
predictability and the low degree of
interaction among its components, which
allows the use of mathematical methods
that make forecasts reliable. 

In complex
systems, there is an absence of visible
causal links between the elements, masking
a high degree of interdependence and
extremely low predictability.

Nonlinear
elements are also present, such as those
commonly known, and generally misunderstood, as “tipping points.” Imagine
someone who keeps adding sand to a sand
pile without any visible consequence, until
suddenly the entire pile crumbles. It would
be foolish to blame the collapse on the last
grain of sand rather than the structure of the
pile, but that is what people do consistently,
and that is the policy error.

U.S. President Barack Obama may
blame an intelligence failure for the government’s not foreseeing the revolution
in Egypt (just as former U.S. President
Jimmy Carter blamed an intelligence
failure for his administration’s not foreseeing the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran),
but it is the suppressed risk in the statistical tails that matters—not the failure to
see the last grain of sand. As a result of
complicated interdependence and contagion effects, in all man-made complex
systems, a small number of possible events
dominate, namely, Black Swans.


Engineering, architecture, astronomy,
most of physics, and much of common
science are linear domains. The complex
domain is the realm of the social world,
epidemics, and economics. 

Crucially, the
linear domain delivers mild variations
without large shocks, whereas the complex
domain delivers massive jumps and gaps.
Complex systems are misunderstood,
mostly because humans’ sophistication,
obtained over the history of human knowledge in the linear domain, does not transfer
properly to the complex domain. 

Humans
can predict a solar eclipse and the trajectory
of a space vessel, but not the stock market
or Egyptian political events. All man-made
complex systems have commonalities and
even universalities. Sadly, deceptive calm
(followed by Black Swan surprises) seems
to be one of those properties.


THE ERROR OF PREDICTION


As with a crumbling sand pile, it would be
foolish to attribute the collapse of a fragile
bridge to the last truck that crossed it, and
even more foolish to try to predict in
advance which truck might bring it down.

The system is responsible, not the components. But after the financial crisis of
2007–8, many people thought that predicting the subprime meltdown would have
helped. It would not have, since it was a
symptom of the crisis, not its underlying
cause. Likewise, Obama’s blaming “bad intelligence” for his administration’s failure to
predict the crisis in Egypt is symptomatic
of both the misunderstanding of complex
systems and the bad policies involved.
Obama’s mistake illustrates the illusion
of local causal chains—that is, confusing
catalysts for causes and assuming that one
can know which catalyst will produce which
effect. The final episode of the upheaval in
Egypt was unpredictable for all observers,
especially those involved. As such, blaming the cia is as foolish as funding it to
forecast such events. Governments are
wasting billions of dollars on attempting
to predict events that are produced by
interdependent systems and are therefore
not statistically understandable at the
individual level.


As Mark Abdollahian of Sentia Group,
one of the contractors who sell predictive
analytics to the U.S. government, noted
regarding Egypt, policymakers should
“think of this like Las Vegas. In blackjack,
if you can do four percent better than the
average, you’re making real money.” But
the analogy is spurious. 

There is no “four
percent better” on Egypt. This is not just
money wasted but the construction of a
false confidence based on an erroneous
focus. It is telling that the intelligence
analysts made the same mistake as the
risk-management systems that failed to
predict the economic crisis—and offered
the exact same excuses when they failed.
Political and economic “tail events” are
unpredictable, and their probabilities are
not scientifically measurable. 

No matter
how many dollars are spent on research,
predicting revolutions is not the same as
counting cards; humans will never be able
to turn politics into the tractable randomness of blackjack.
Most explanations being offered for the
current turmoil in the Middle East follow
the “catalysts as causes” confusion. The
riots in Tunisia and Egypt were initially
attributed to rising commodity prices, not
to stifling and unpopular dictatorships.
But Bahrain and Libya are countries with
high gdps that can aªord to import grain
and other commodities. Again, the focus is
wrong even if the logic is comforting. It is
the system and its fragility, not events,
that must be studied—what physicists call
“percolation theory,” in which the properties of the terrain are studied rather than
those of a single element of the terrain.
When dealing with a system that is
inherently unpredictable, what should be
done? Differentiating between two types
of countries is useful. In the first, changes
in government do not lead to meaningful
diªerences in political outcomes (since
political tensions are out in the open).
In the second type, changes in government lead to both drastic and deeply
unpredictable changes.
Consider that Italy, with its muchmaligned “cabinet instability,” is economically and politically stable despite having
had more than 60 governments since
World War II (indeed, one may say Italy’s
stability is because of these switches of
government). 

Similarly, in spite of consistently bad press, Lebanon is a relatively
safe bet in terms of how far governments
can jump from equilibrium; in spite of
all the noise, shifting alliances, and street
protests, changes in government there
tend to be comparatively mild. For example, a shift in the ruling coalition from
Christian parties to Hezbollah is not such
a consequential jump in terms of the
country’s economic and political stability.


Switching equilibrium, with control of
the government changing from one party
to another, in such systems acts as a shock
absorber. Since a single party cannot have
total and more than temporary control, the
possibility of a large jump in the regime
type is constrained.


In contrast, consider Iran and Iraq.
Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi and Saddam Hussein both constrained volatility
by any means necessary. In Iran, when
the shah was toppled, the shift of power to
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini was a huge,
unforeseeable jump. After the fact, analysts
could construct convincing accounts about
how killing Iranian Communists, driving
the left into exile, demobilizing the democratic opposition, and driving all dissent
into the mosque had made Khomeini’s
rise inevitable. 

In Iraq, the United States
removed the lid and was actually surprised
to find that the regime did not jump from
hyperconstraint to something like France.
But this was impossible to predict ahead
of time due to the nature of the system
itself. What can be said, however, is that
the more constrained the volatility, the
bigger the regime jump is likely to be. From
the French Revolution to the triumph of
the Bolsheviks, history is replete with
such examples, and yet somehow humans
remain unable to process what they mean.



Humans fear randomness—a healthy
ancestral trait inherited from a different
environment. Whereas in the past, which
was a more linear world, this trait enhanced
fitness and increased chances of survival,
it can have the reverse effect in today’s
complex world, making volatility take the
shape of nasty Black Swans hiding behind
deceptive periods of “great moderation.”


This is not to say that any and all volatility
should be embraced. Insurance should
not be banned, for example.


But alongside the “catalysts as causes”
confusion sit two mental biases: the illusion
of control and the action bias (the illusion
that doing something is always better than
doing nothing). This leads to the desire to
impose man-made solutions. Greenspan’s
actions were harmful, but it would have
been hard to justify inaction in a democracy
where the incentive is to always promise a
better outcome than the other guy, regardless of the actual, delayed cost.


Variation is information. When there
is no variation, there is no information.
This explains the cia’s failure to predict
the Egyptian revolution and, a generation
before, the Iranian Revolution—in both
cases, the revolutionaries themselves did
not have a clear idea of their relative
strength with respect to the regime they
were hoping to topple. 

So rather than subsidize and praise as a “force for stability”
every tin-pot potentate on the planet,
the U.S. government should encourage
countries to let information flow upward
through the transparency that comes with
political agitation. It should not fear fluctuations per se, since allowing them to be
in the open, as Italy and Lebanon both
show in different ways, creates the stability
of small jumps.


As Seneca wrote in De clementia,
“Repeated punishment, while it crushes
the hatred of a few, stirs the hatred of
all . . . just as trees that have been trimmed
throw out again countless branches.” The
imposition of peace through repeated
punishment lies at the heart of many
seemingly intractable conflicts, including
the Israeli-Palestinian stalemate. 

Furthermore, dealing with seemingly reliable
high-level offcials rather than the people
themselves prevents any peace treaty signed
from being robust. The Romans were wise
enough to know that only a free man under
Roman law could be trusted to engage in a
contract; by extension, only a free people
can be trusted to abide by a treaty.

 Treaties
that are negotiated with the consent of a
broad swath of the populations on both
sides of a conflict tend to survive. 

Just as no
central bank is powerful enough to dictate
stability, no superpower can be powerful
enough to guarantee solid peace alone.


U.S. policy toward the Middle East has
historically, and especially since 9/11, been
unduly focused on the repression of any
and all political fluctuations in the name
of preventing “Islamic fundamentalism”—
a trope that Mubarak repeated until his
last moments in power and that Libyan
leader Muammar al-Qaddafi continues
to emphasize today, blaming Osama
bin Laden for what has befallen him. This
is wrong. The West and its autocratic Arab
allies have strengthened Islamic fundamentalists by forcing them underground,
and even more so by killing them.


As Jean-Jacques Rousseau put it, “A
little bit of agitation gives motivation to
the soul, and what really makes the species
prosper is not peace so much as freedom.”
With freedom comes some unpredictable
fluctuation. This is one of life’s packages:
there is no freedom without noise—and
no stability without volatility",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Is it possible to refinance private student loans for pennies less on the dollar?,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I am a MD graduate, I matched into a residency program after failing two years in a row. During the two years, I have used up all my forbearance time. Both of my private loan providers have 9-11% interest rate, but neither know that I have matched. During this period, I have managed to keep my credit away from any delinquencies or red flags. In addition to that, obtaining residency was the biggest obstacle and moving forward, it's a fairly smooth ride to success. Is there a way I can refinance these loans with a different bank and have them somehow buy my loans for pennies less on the dollar?

&amp;#x200B;

Please advise!

Thank you!

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT 1: Werewolfdad responded to my original question. Here's a follow-up question for someone who may have an answer:

During residency the salary is a fraction of a fully licensed physician. At this point, would banks allow me to refinance these loans to a lower interest rate? If so, any recommendations on which ones I should approach? It would have to be a bank that knows the timeline and process of the medical graduation system so they realize that I am at a point, which almost guarantees success.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT 2: I am grateful for the time you all have spent so far reading this and replying to it. It means a lot to me when others go out of their way to help people. This is the reason I wanted to become a physician.

I think my best option is to seek out a bank who will refinance at a lower interest rate. This will most likely be possible after completion of residency.",finance

personalfinance,The difference between revolving and installment credit and whether I need both or just one in order to eventually get a house.,"Hello, I am young, have a credit history of less than 2 years, and have never had debt.  
I have a credit card that i have set up to never get behind on paying off the full balance so that i get all the benefits of it without any interest, but i do not intend to take out a loan on anything except maybe a house about 6-12 years from now.(at which point i will have that perfect 7 year payment history everyone cares about.)  


I have been informed by a friend that my credit card is revolving credit, and since i have no installment credit, my perfect payment history on my card means diddly squat to whether or not a bank can trust me with a house loan, let alone have lower interest rates.  


Is this true? Will i need to restructure my plans/goals? And does being able to put a 33%+ down payment change that?

personalfinance,Projecting Growth: What Assumptions To Make?,"Hi, everybody. My wife and I (both age 32) are starting to buckle down and get serious about finances. We are good at saving cash, but are a little ""investment-stupid."" We also like nice things and live in an expensive area of the country (Nassau County in Long Island, NY) so we need to be aggressive with our savings while allowing ourselves to enjoy nice cars, get a nice house, and go on lots of vacations until we have kids. We will be speaking with a financial planner/adviser but I am trying to project out our net worth and investments and wanted to run my assumptions past some people to vet them. How do the following assumptions look?

**Split net income 50/50 between cash and investments** (I'd like more towards investments but my wife is risk-averse and so this may be a compromise. Should this percentage move more towards cash as we get older to mitigate risk levels?)

**Annual Salary Raise: 3%** (based on our historical averages, which are typically higher but I'm being conservative)

**Effective Tax Rate: 30%** (I know this is high, even with how much we earn, but figured it's better to be conservative)

**Spending Increase, Annual: 8%** (I found this number online, but it seems high, and it makes our net liquid assets go negative after 12 years)

**Cost-of-Living and Inflation: 3%**

**Savings Account Interest: 2.25%** (current rate, I will adjust as it changes)

**Investment Growth: 7% annual** (again, I've seen this assumption online, but as it is lower than the spending increase, it seems low).

**Mortgage Interest Rate: 5%** (assume purchase in 2022, being conservative with the rate given our credit rating and the pre-approval we got a few years when we looked for a bit)

**Child Expenses: 20K/year per child** (assume one child in 2020, another in 2022, with costs increasing annually per the inflation number, above

In general, I'm happy with what I put together for projections and I will share it with the planner/adviser, but I was curious for feedback from others who may have experience with this.

financialindependence,From negative $50k to quarter-millionaires in less than 5 years,"So I just did my quarterly net worth update and just noticed that we crossed the quarter million mark! And since people seem to like these kinds of posts, as well as being a good little reflection for myself, I thought I would share a little progress report of our journey.

Here is a year-by-year summary:

**2014**

* Got married to my wife in my senior year.
* Graduated, and got first job at start of May. Starting salary $52k in a HCOL area (Boston).
* Had about $35,000+ in student loan debt.
* Wife graduated a year prior working for a year already making ~$41k.
* She had ~$10,000 in student loan debt (low interest, to her parents)  at this point. 
* Including her car loan, we were $50k+ in debt (basically our net worth) at the time I graduated.
* I always hated the idea of debt, so we prioritized paying it down as aggressively as we could afford.
* We kept the same jobs until we would move in a couple years, earning basic 3-5% raises every year.

**2015**

* End of the year, we made a lump sum payment of $9k to pay off my student loans (while dipping into our E-fund) just so we could say we did so before the end of 2015.
* We were still making minimum payments on my wife's student loans and car loans since the interest was very negligible.
* This was around the time I started to get more interested in investing and learned about MMM, Reddit in general, then this sub, other FIRE bloggers, etc.

**2016**

* My wife started to get a little home sick so we decided to move to a LCOL area (Midwest) where her parents lived, and away from where I grew up. I was okay with it mainly because in my mind, LCOL meant easier to save.
* We decided to temporarily live at her parents house while we found our own place. We paid them the market rate in rent, which was maybe a third of our previous rent. Since they weren't doing so great financially and healthwise, the rent money and helping out around the house worked out well for them so we didn’t feel rushed to find our own place.
* We did end up taking small paycuts. My wife found a job with salary of $45k. I found one shortly after with a salary of $51k. Since then, we’ve earned 5-7% yearly raises.

**2017**

* By this time, I got my wife on the FIREwagon. I think we averaged around a 70% SR for the duration we lived with the in-laws.
* Predictably, we (mainly my wife), got sick of living with the in-laws. So we started saving up for a house down payment.
* Lost maybe about $7k in the crypto craze. Still holding though.

**2018** 

* We bought a house for ~$150k putting 15% down, no PMI, at 4.1% rate.
* Even though we were spending more for house things, we still tried to keep our savings up.
* Averaged around 60% SR for the year.
* At the end of the year, we found out my wife is pregnant.

**2019**

* My wife finds a new job, earning her a good pay bump. She now makes $60k, basically what I make now.
* Crossed the $260k net worth mark at the end of March! ~$213k in investments. Not too shabby for a couple of 28 year olds.

[Here's](https://imgur.com/tfA4oKt) a little YNAB snapshot of the last 3+ years of networth tracking. Our expenses during that period averaged to around $3,100/month. That's enough to get us yearly visits back to Boston, grass-fed beef, a Nintendo Switch, among many other luxuries. 

With the baby on the way and since we crossed a significant milestone, we may relax our savings a little. But we’ll see!",finance

investing,Is Indexed universal life insurance (IUL) a good investment choice?,"The goal is to invest cash after maximizing 401k and Roth IRA.

&amp;#x200B;

I did some research on the IUL. My understanding on IUL: a way to diversify from market risk, diversify from taxes, and a life insurance policy that has front-loaded fees.

&amp;#x200B;

The pro:

• If designed the right way the fee can be comparable to a low-cost active management fund in the long term

• Money accumulates tax deferred

• No loss in the market downtown

• Life insurance cash value not considered as parent asset while applying for financial aids for kids (unlike 529 counts)

&amp;#x200B;

The cons: 

  

• The cap can change, cost of insurance can change

• Dependent on interest rate

• Performance not guaranteed

• No dividends like SP500

&amp;#x200B;

My conclusion: With right design (maximize income and cash with minimum fee and commission) it may work better than investing SP500 in a taxable broker account. Please criticize my points if you disagree.

personalfinance,Advice On Selling Car,"I’ll try to make this one relatively quick but meaningful and potentially helping for others. 

So March of last year I bought a new car (2018 Kia Rio) with no credit to my name and ended up with a 18%  interest rate for the loan. The car itself was 13K and I’m paying $321 monthly over a 6 yr time span which puts the total cost at 23k. 

Now before I get bashed for doing this (yes, yes I know already not the smartest decision) my question is if I’m paying over 20K already for a car that’s only worth 13k new, should I sell it out now while it’s worth 11k (Kelly blue book) and pay off the difference and just get another car that’s substantially better in terms of quality since I’m already paying more for a car that isn’t worth 23k?

I can eat the loss and start over with something that will probably last me longer since the model I got for my Rio was the cheapest one (base model). It’s in great coverage condition and nothing is wrong with it, just trying to think of what may be better long term if I’m already gonna be paying a lot anyways. I’ve made every payment on time with no issues and can afford to start over since it’s still early on with me having the car. I’m in my mid 20s, healthy, no kids and work full time with no other debt besides that car loan. Any suggestions?",finance
personalfinance,FICO 8 score and Vantage score off,"So yes, I have read the sidebar and other threads about this so I checked my vantage score 2.0 through CK and I have a ~740 Equifax and Transunion score. I also have Bank of America who will give you a free FICO 8 score from Transunion so I did that and it gave me a ~665. I know that they aren’t supposed to be the same but an ~80 point difference is a lot!  I also just took out two new credit cards about a month or two ago and close my old capital one card a couple months ago because it had a yearly fee. I also have one collection that’s small from 2014 and another from 2017 that’s bigger. Do these things have a much bigger impact on the FICO score 8 than on the vantage score?  And more specifically, I’m trying to get a mortgage in the near future, what can I do to get a good interest rate and what score do they usually use?  Also, I have very little debt ~1k or less and make ~90k so my debt to income ratio is very low if that helps.",finance

personalfinance,"Paying down debt, should i trade in my car?","I was very recently thrown a huge curveball at work. I was told my pay was going to decrease by about 15K per year. My boss recently told me we wouldn't go through with the change, but it was kind of a wake up call and now i'm really wanting to pay off as much of my debt as i can. Here's my personal situation:

&amp;#x200B;

I currently make a little over 70K a year. This fluctuates, my pay consists of base pay plus commission. base pay is 60K a year.

&amp;#x200B;

My debts are as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

Rent: I pay about $600 a month (+ utilities). I'm in the process of building a house, it will be completed in early August. The payment will be about $1500 a month (+ utilities), which will be split between me and my SO.

&amp;#x200B;

Car: Monthly payment of $375 a month. I owe $19500 on the car. Interest rate is 3.99%. The war is worth a little more than 20K. I'm wanting to trade it in for something much cheaper. Not necessarily a POS but something below 10K. I'm alone in a big city and can't/don't want to deal with car trouble. If i do this, i'm hoping i will get the same interest rate, and the car payments should be max $200 per month. I would ideally keep making the same payment i'm making now, which would lead to me paying off the cheaper car much quicker.

&amp;#x200B;

Car Insurance: $65 a month

&amp;#x200B;

Other expenses (helping out family, light bill, phone, internet): $200 a month

&amp;#x200B;

Student Loans - Monthly payment $200 - Account Balance of 32,983.91 - Interest ranges from 3.4% - 6.8%

&amp;#x200B;

I have a couple accounts that i'm paying off. (Credit Cards and Installments). They're as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Installment account - Monthly payment $150 - Owe $3k - 0% Interest
2. Credit Card 1 - Monthly Payment $150 - Owe $6,700 - 0% Interest through 1/2020
3. Paypal Credit - Monthly Payment $120 - Owe $3,189.91 - (I will be giving a payment of $1860 by July in order to avoid paying interest) After that, i will have a balance of $1330, which will be interest free through 10/2020.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't feel like i'm struggling but i would like to get to a point where i only have my mortgage payment and all the basic needs like phone, internet, insurance, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd love to hear any suggestions! I'm mostly concerned about my car. I literally only use it to drive to and from work and it's a nicer car, think BMW or Mercedes, kinda feels like overkill. Also, the house that i'm buying will be a further drive and it will surely depreciate very quickly. I'm right below 50K miles so i want to move on this as quickly as i can.

personalfinance,Best Way for an American to Pay for Grad School in London,"I’m an American adult who is lucky enough to be at a point in life where I have both financial resources and available time, and I am considering enrolling in a part-time, distance graduate program.  One of the schools I am considering is based in London.  I would like thoughts on the best way for an American to pay tuition to a UK institution, if I were to be accepted.  

*(Note:  This is not a question about finding the money to pay for the program, it’s about the actual mechanics of making the payment.)*

Some relevant information:

* Tuition is about £10,000 a year, or approximately $13,000 at current exchange rates.  (I’m eligible for scholarships and other aid that will likely reduce that amount, but for the sake of this, let’s assume I pay full fee.)

* I would be paying tuition for a max of 7 years (likely less, but again, let’s assume worst case scenario).

* Tuition is due twice a year.

* Tuition can be paid via check, credit/debit card (MC or Visa), or bank transfer.   

* My income is high enough that I can pay tuition each year without loans or any other assistance.

* That said, I am likely eligible for graduate student loans (high income, high credit score, only debt is mortgage).

personalfinance,[NZ] Should I put my emergency fund in a rolling term deposit scheme?,"Me and my wife both graduated university 3 years ago and I decided to turn to this sub to figure out how we should be saving money. Everyone echoed the same line.

Prioritize your emergency fund.

So we did and over the first year, we managed to save up $20,000 (NZD).

We have since gone on to put our excess savings in other investment vehicles, mostly the NZX.

In the last 2 years, we have not once touched the $20,000 and it has made me a whopping $500 in interest with my bank sending me an email last month saying my interest rate was going to be decreasing from 2.35 to 2.05.

I understand the point of an emergency fund is to keep it liquid but we have a credit card with a $25000 limit (that always gets paid off the start of the month) and no interest for 90 days and around $10,000 sitting in various cash funds like a holiday savings account and a repairs and maintenance account for minor house issues.

What I want to do is split the $20,000 into 5 $3000 term deposits and start them at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5-year terms. Whenever a term deposit matures put it back in at 5 years.

I would keep the remaining $5000 in a liquid bank account to fall back on in case of any legitimate major expenses

With our current lifestyle, we could both lose our jobs tomorrow and survive for 4-5 months before touching anything other than the emergency fund. If we both lost our jobs I would imagine we would cut spending back somewhat and could stretch that out to 6 months.

So I guess two questions;

1. Do you think it's stupid to put most of your emergency fund in a less liquid form than cash?

2. How many months of expenses do you really need in an emergency fund? How many do you personally need to feel comfortable?

Please note this is New Zealand and we both have private health insurance on top of the public health care we have available and no dependents. 

We also both have life insurance policies if one of us were to kick the bucket.

Only debt is our mortgage which would need to be paid obviously.

If an emergency were to happen it would be a loss of income stream.",finance

investing,Investment Hypothesis: The market is fundamentally mis-pricing climate risk and reward.,"Hi All,

This is a bold statement, but I believe the market is significantly mis-pricing the risks around climate change from several angles (see below). I think it's relatively uncontroversial to suggest that capitalism in general has trouble dealing with negative externalities. My investment hypothesis is that certain industries are in effect taking on increasing, uncompensated, and unacknowledged climate risk every year (e.g. insurance, oil supermajors, coastal real estate holding companies, etc.). At the same time, other industries (e.g. clean technology, water processing / desalination, etc.) have increased upside given the nature of these risks. 
 
* Disruption to Insurance / Re-insurance organizations: Increased risk of catastrophic disasters means that either insurance companies either a) raise premiums or b) limit their coverage. Climate change causes global insurance companies significant issues because it is a correlated risk, i.e. there is an increased chance of flooding in Thailand and hurricanes in the Gulf. 
* Coastal Real Estate: I'm not suggesting that cities will be underwater in the near term, but long before that situation occurs vast stretches of high value, coastal properties will be ineligible for insurance and may suffer a massive decrease in value (how many people can / will self-insure a high risk million dollar property?).
* Government Bonds: Governments will be forced to spend heavily to either a) mitigate climate change through infrastructure projects and/or b) compensate or assume financial liabilities to avoid financial panic and protect vested interests. We are seeing early signs of this in the fight over federal flood zones in the US and reforming the federal flood insurance program. Developed governments will fund these efforts with large new bond issuances, which eventually may cause investors to demand higher yields. 
* Oil Supermajors: As climate change costs rise, governments will face political and financial pressure to recoup money from the companies ""at fault"". This may take the form of carbon taxes, direct penalties, etc. Even if governments fail to take action state / private class action law suits will proliferate as affected individuals attempt to recoup losses. An early sign of this is the lawsuits around the California wildfires and PG&amp;E (although obviously this is a utility). 
* Tax Rates: Given high debt levels and current account deficits during an economic ""expansion"", developed countries are ill-prepared to face a general recession. The debt issue will only compound as governments also face increasing financial pressure from climate change adaption and assumed liabilities. As a consequence, governments will likely raise revenue through overt or de facto tax rate hikes. Political pressure will force governments to consider taxing corporations and ultra high net worth individuals first. 

To hedge this risk I am investing 20% of my portfolio in renewable MLPs, clean technology ETFs, and private infrastructure companies. Although historically these asset classes have lagged broader market benchmarks, I believe we will start to see political pressure to invest dramatically in these areas, e.g. the Green New Deal. More importantly I think governments will attempt to finance large scale climate adaption projects via public-private partnerships due to budget constraints. 

Note: my timeline for investments is 10-20 years. I do not foresee significant climate impacts in the next several years, although there are a number of climate non-linearities that we simply don't know / cannot model (e.g. melting permafrost releasing significant amounts of methane into the atmosphere leading to a dire feedback cycle). 

Thoughts?

Edit: Great debate so far, appreciate all the great points! A couple clarifications here:

* I totally agree that picking winners in the renewables place is very difficult. I don't do that, I use ETFs. This is a sector play and tilting my investments away from certain areas. Plus, the value chain of renewables is far more complex than simply solar panel manufacturing. Look at the financing, operationalization, efficiency, etc. advances that are occurring. Many of these companies have  highly defensible intellectual property or operational expertise.
* There seems to be a common misconception that I'm saying sea level rise will simply wipe out certain areas. That isn't my point. Long before sea level rise swamps areas the added risks of storm surge, ""king tides"", hurricanes, etc. will make areas uninsurable. Property and businesses cannot function without insurance. There's a reason why insurance is one of the largest industries on the planet. 
* Yes, this is a very long term play. And I very well could be wrong (I sincerely hope I am!). But I can't exactly buy ""puts"" on climate change. My hypothesis is that this is a serious threat to my portfolio and, obviously, humanity writ large. I suppose I could start investing in some doomsday ideas like gold, bunkers in inland, high elevation areas, etc. But I choose to be a little more hopeful / constructive. 
* I don't expect to make 10x my money here. But I do see a steadily increasing investment in this space. The political pressure is increasing in the US, China already has firm targets (and this is exactly the type of top down project that appeals to the Chinese government for stimulus), and Europe / Japan are already well on their way. At some point too the rapidly growing economies of Africa, Southeast Asia, etc. will need more energy. Economics alone already dictate that most of that new energy will come from renewables.",finance
personalfinance,Pay off 13K student loan or keep saving for future big purchases?,"Hi everyone! I've been lurking quite a long time and really getting into personal finance in my down-time recently. Here is my question: I have \~12.7K in student loans (all federal, \~4.5% interest rate) and \~12.7K in savings (in a HYSA with \~2.15% APY). I'm in grad school (27k stipend/yr) so my loans are deferred for a few years, but I've been making payments towards my loan anyway to reduce total interest paid. 

&amp;#x200B;

Purely looking at the interest rates (4.5% loan vs 2.15% HYSA) it makes sense to pay off the loan in full ASAP...however, I expect a car purchase and costs associated with moving in 4-5 years (and a house down the road, but that's a while away).

&amp;#x200B;

Is it worth dumping my savings (except an emergency fund of course) into the loans and then starting over to save for the move/car, or should I keep my savings and just continue to make big monthly payments (I try to put in like $600/month) and pay it off in a couple years?

personalfinance,Is it more beneficial to purchase CD's in larger bulks less often than it would be to purchase them in smaller bulks more often?,"Sounds like a dumb question probably, but let me explain. I've been doing some calculations today to try to understand which would benefit me. Maybe my calculations are wrong (not unlikely), but from what I'm showing, it's more beneficial to buy CD's in larger bulks less often, than buying them in smaller bulks more often. The difference isn't significant, but it's enough!

For example, based on my possibly fallible calculations, if I was planning to purchase $5,000 worth of 5 year CD's every 6 months at a 3.10% APY compounded monthly, the standing of all my CD's at the 10 year mark would be roughly $123,000.

If I did the same amount, in the same type of CD, but instead purchased them on a monthly basis (which would be $833.33 a month), my calculations are showing that the standing in those CD's would be roughly $118,000 at the 10 year mark.

Note: Both calculations are accounting for the fact that when a CD matures, I'd re-enroll it and add an additional purchase amount on top of it. So in the first instance, I'd have a total of 10 CD's, and in the second instance, I would have a total of 60 CD's. Which I know is not reasonable and some banks wouldn't even allow that many, but I'm just doing this for the sake of clarity in what is the best way to purchase CD's.

Note #2: Also for clarity's sake, I'm doing this because I'm wanting to save up for a down payment on a house and want the money somewhere where it will be earning a decent interest rate without having it fluctuate with the market and where it will be easily accessible without any penalties once I decide to bite the bullet.",finance

personalfinance,Evaluating Rental Property in Portfolio Diversification?,"Would like some feedback or ideas on how to evaluate portfolio diversification when holding a rental property. \~40M, married, 2 kids for reference.

We own a home that we rent out as an investment property. We had some extra income over the past few years and decided that paying off our mortgage guaranteed us the interest rate as a return. The house is a 20 year old single family home in an established neighborhood; it represents approximately 40% of our net worth and returns about 3% of its value each year after taxes and expenses are deducted.

The balance of our net worth is held in ETF’s, in a mix of tax deferred and tax exposed accounts. We have that split about 70/30 between equities and bonds.

Our savings rate is currently 5-8% of our net worth per year and our target long term rate of return is about 5%.

Questions for the group:

1 – How should I evaluate the house as it relates to the stocks/bonds split in the portfolio? 

2 – The 3% return on the house seems a little underwhelming. I don’t consider the market where it is located to have great growth prospects. What’s a good way to evaluate whether we should keep it?

3 - Would appreciate comments on the general risk position - about 80% of our savings rate is in tax exposed accounts if that makes any difference.

personalfinance,"Chipping away at debt, is there anything I can do better? $30k down a lot more to go.","Hello [r/personalfinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance), been lurking for awhile, and wanted to to introduce myself, and ask a few questions.

**Backstory:**

I'm  about to turn 35, have a 2yr old and another baby on the way. Wife is a  teacher, I'm in IT for a non-profit (so not making industry standard  money, but love my job and has great benefits, and flexibility with  schedule which has proven nice for family time/responsibilities).  In  the past, I haven't been the most frugal/responsible with my spending,  however, in recent years I have really gotten my ""ish"" together and  built out a detailed spreadsheet to track where we are spending money,  and how to systematically pay off the fairly hefty debt that we have  created.  It even forecasts the next 5years to try help us see our goals.

We also decided  when we found out we were pregnant to fully remodel our house and back  yard to get it ready for starting a family.  This meant new furniture,  countertops, flooring, removing walls, etc. It was a big project that we  took out a HELOC for, which is a big chunk of our debt.  Shortly after our Air conditioning unit went out, so we replaced it and replaced our furnace.

In the past  year with creating the spreadsheet, and really focusing on our debts, we  have paid off a total of $30k in debt, but still have a ways to go.   Child care is really making a dent in what we are capable of putting  away towards debt, but we are trying.

**Situation &amp; Goal:**

So  the ultimate goal is to get debt free, knowing of course that things  like new roofs, appliances etc. will be expenses that will  come up.  I'm kind of looking out 5-7 years right now trying to position  us to be able to get nearly debt free (except mortgage) so we can  really have some money available to us to decide if we want to pay off  our house faster, or buy a rental property, or just throw way more into  retirement etc.

**Finances:**

We  make about $7,500/mo after taxes - My company pays 14% of my salary  unmatched into a SEP-IRA and I put an additional $400/mo into a separate  403b with currently about $115k, in retirement.

Mortgage = $1,305/mo (incl taxes etc)  Owe: $172k  3.625% interest rate. House is worth between $375-$400k

Power/Water/Gas/Garbage/Sewer/Cable/Internet = $531/mo

Car  = $600/mo (recently bought to be able to haul around two kids. Its a  2016 model year with extended warranty.  We have two other vehicles - a  truck and commuter car that are both paid off) Owe: $33k 3.44% interest  rate

Auto/Home/RV insurance = $223/mo (I have a broker that I call annually to make sure we are always getting the best rate)

Entertainment/Cell Phone/Food/Gas/Child Care = $2,600/mo

HELOC = $600/mo (is what we are paying, minimum payment is 1% of debt) Owe: $53k 5.25% interest rate

5th wheel = $300/mo  Owe: $20k 4.99% interest rate (but can deduct interest paid as second home)

Credit  card debt = $8k owed 0% interest rate, currently throwing $1300/mo -  $2k;/mo to pay it off by August when 0% promo expires.  Then we will be  credit card debt free.

HVAC = $200mo Owe: $5k  0% interest rate  

So  my game plan right now is to pay off the 0% credit card first. Then  once that's done, take the money I'm throwing at it, and put it towards  the HVAC to just pay it off in a couple of months. I know its a 0%  interest expense as well, and that goes against most logic, but in my  mind, within a couple months its just gone, freeing up a couple hundred a  month in cash flow to go towards bigger debts, or use for things that come up unexpectedly when necessary.  Once that would be  gone, I'd focus on the HELOC &amp; 5th wheel since they are the higher  interest rates.

Here is where I really  want some advice.  Right now we have no emergency fund. &lt;terrifying I  know&gt; but in my mind, I've had the logic of paying down debts is  more important than creating an emergency fund, because should an  emergency come up, that is what having good credit / HELOC / or a couple  grand in savings (not necessarily an emergency fund) is for.  I know  many will crucify me for this, but the idea of putting money away each  month to just sit for the ""what if"" vs making bigger dents towards  paying off debt that can eventually go away has always been my priority.

So  with all that said, what do you all think?  Am I on the right track?  Should I completely reorganize my plan? What should I do differently?   Thank you for the input/advice, let me know if you need more  information.",finance

I've leased cars the past 10 years of my life.  After i did a review of my last lease, i was sickened by the amount of miles i left on the table (i drove significantly less this last lease, leaving 7000 miles on the table), as well as the stupid hidden fees (disposition fee? wtf?) and insane insurance that ""XYZ"" Financial requires the lessee to have. I've decided its time to stop ""walking away with nothing"", but i'm not sure what to do, and how to do it, in regards to securing an auto loan (and making the best decision possible).

I did a Total Cost of Lease calculation and between a lease + insurance (i factored in insurance since its absurd in michigan), i would be spending roughly $11,000 over a 24 month lease, if not more.

I figure the best scenario for me would be getting a car for 25k and spreading that out over the longest period, with the lowest possible interest rate.  Is my logic flawed?

\- Do i need to have a specific model/trim picked out before rate shopping?

personalfinance,Multiple balance transfer cards?,"Another balance transfer card question. I racked up $10K in debt in almost three years on my Barclaycard Arrival Plus with 22% APR. I knew better, but still lived beyond my means while working for a university making $16/hour. Thankfully my job had tuition waiver benefits, so I got my master's degree without taking on any student loan debt. However, the additional tax liability incurred from my tuition waiver benefit severely diminished my net pay. No lifestyle change (I lived in a very fun bar/restaurant district at the time ugh) + lower income = snowballed credit card debt. So dumb. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm fed up with this amount of credit card debt and I have drastically reduced the amount I spend on unnecessary stuff and experiences. A goal of mine is to fully pay down this $10K credit card debt in a year to year-and-a-half. 

&amp;#x200B;

I thought the Chase Slate would have been a great option to do a balance transfer with $0 balance transfer fee within 60 days and 0% APR on balance transfers for 15 months. I only got approved for $1,300.

So now I'm wondering what my options are with a FICO score of 722. Should I transfer $1.3K of my Barclaycard debt onto the Chase Slate, and then apply for more balance transfer cards? I'm hesitant to do that since many applications in a short amount of time will ding my credit score.

Should I consider doing a personal loan instead of juggling multiple balance transfer cards? Barclay is sending me tons of marketing mail trying to get me to open a personal loan with them.

personalfinance,"Urgent - CPAs disagree on capital gain taxes owed on property, and must decide whether a sale is viable today or so","Capital gains tax owed on a property.

Property was bought for $10,000 in 1952 in California. Sometime in the mid-70s, the owner of the house added her son as co-owner, thinking it would help him. It turned out to be a nightmare for taxes.

My father inherited the property in 1998. Appraisal at that time. was somewhere around $200,000. The present value is approximately $400,000 today. The property was not re-appraised in the 70s.

The mortgage owed is $200,000.  Taxes [20% federal, 10-13% state] could be anywhere from $60,000 to $130,000.

We talked to a bunch of different CPAs. Some of them say that because he was the co-owner in '73, he owes taxes for all that time. Some say that he owes half of it to 1998 and half to 1952. One CPA said that he owes only the capital gains back to 1998. He said this rule is not well understood. Supposedly, because it was gifted to him in the 70s, gift tax basis is always recalculated to the inheritance time.

We would like to believe this. What really matters is what the IRS says. Is there any evidence that can show that this is the true answer? What are your opinions on taxes owed by my father in this type of situation?

IRS: Is there a department or number I should call and what should I ask?

Also: any additional reddits I should post these questions?",finance

personalfinance,Independent Contractor questions on estimated taxes and expenses,"I have read thru the Wiki and Schedule C, C-EX, SE, and Publication 535 and still have questions related to 2019 Estimated taxed and expenses.  

Background: My spouse is a W-2 employee withheld at 0 exemption level and will make similar to last year's salary.  I have been a W-2 employee for all of my life (25+ years.)  I was laid off in August and started a new position (Yeah Me!) as a contractor in March.  I am on contract in March and April and hope to become a W-2 employee in May.  I expect my 2019 tax burden to be similar to my 2018 burden.

I inquired with a few CPAs and due to tax season and my new work schedule/travel no one can see me before April 15 when my estimated taxes will be due.

My 2019 pay so far (round numbers) has been:

* Unemployment $7000 - Fed and State tax withheld
* Substitute Teaching $1300 - Medicare (1.45%) withheld, no SSI withheld (pension)
* New Job - $9200 wages, $600 Per Diam (10 days travel), $100 airport parking, $100 mileage to/from airport

My questions really relate to qualified expenses.  I traveled 3 out of 4 weeks in March and I am not sure how much I will travel in the future.  Are there any concerns with claiming (deducting) any of the following against my Contractor Pay, Per Diam, and Expense Reimbursement?

* Airport Parking at $135 (I chose a more expensive option)
* Roundtrip Mileage at $0.58/mile for Airport travel
* Meals (restaurants) on days I travelled
* Incidentals - ie: Groceries (soda, TP, snacks) on days I traveled
* office supplies for home office (paper/pens, printer, misc computer peripherals).
* Phone services (Cell phone, Landline)
* ISP for home office 
* Gas for car share while traveling
* NOT planning on claiming home office deductions.  Should I use the safe harbor method here?

Note: work paid for lodging and provided a car while on site while traveling and I was not reimbursed.

Bonus questions:

* What am I not thinking of?
* Would it be smarter for me to remain as a 1099 contractor or become a W-2 employee?

Bitcoin,"Short-term bullish, long-term bullish","In the short term, with Central Banks continuing the bubble party across the globe, there are immediate reasons to buy, hold, and use bitcoin to participate in a parallel economic system that is still somewhat tethered (although increasingly less so) to the US Dollar banking cartel.  Given the Fed's about face in policy over the last 6 months, it is clear that the US dollar will continue to degrade in value as the Fed promises to continue to support morally hazardous behavior.  For these reasons, holding commodity type assets such as bitcoin, gold, and other non-perishable goods could prove fortuitous.

In the long-term, as Bitcoin and the Internet continue to evolve, we will see the Bitcoin economy be untethered from the established monetary order and will become fully independent as its own economic domain.  Creative computer scientists/programmers/businessmen will re-invent commerce and will allow for a level of collaboration among the human species that has never been seen before.

personalfinance,First Time Buying A Car (Tips on the Process) (Bunch of Questions),"Hello PF,

I've been a lurker and learning for the past months. I am 22 years old and wanting to get myself a new car (used). I am wanting a Jeep Wrangler (price range of 15k-20k). I am as well thinking of getting it financed, most likely through the dealership since in Canada (Québec) I do not think we have credit unions. I do have 8k saved up but I would much rather leave it saved up as my emergency fund.

But it's when it comes to the finance I do not totally understand. I would like to be explained as if I am five. From my basic knowledge, I know finance comes from bi-weekly or monthly payments but we'll go by monthly with the interest rate depending on what is offered (my credit is in the low 700s). My question is instead can I get a car loan from the bank and finance the loan through them? Of course keeping into account the interest rate of both. I know reading through PF (thanks a lot seriously), the dealership is going to try to haggle its way into my mind to finance through them because they make money off it. But with that in mind, I can definitely play along and try to lower their interest rate compared to the banks, right? Or am I completely clueless?

Also, on the process of buying and dealing. I am definitely going in with a ""out the door price"", I am in no hurry to buy the Jeep so if it ain't right then so be it. But let's say they do accept my offer, what kind of tricks could they play on me? The only thing I should check is the final cost of the vehicule right? They might spread my 20k in order to attract me with the low monthly cost to add more shit, right?

Finally, I would like your opinions on the extras like warranties and such? Are they really worth it or depends? I've read about GAP insurance here but I believe in Québec it is not available because we are protected under the QCPA. So, as a newbie, what are the things I need to watch out for? Or, any tricks you guys even used to get the upper hand or get to add extra in the contract for free or cheap?

I have no problems walking out if I don't like the deal but as a newbie I need to actually know the difference between a good and bad deal. In my opinion, as a first time buyer going against people that have been in the business for years and years, I'll need to know all the tricks.

\*Any Jeep Wrangler owners here that got a good deal with add-ons? I has a friend that negociated to had 35"" tires with the Jeep.

\*Keep in my the budget (15-20k) -- I am from Canada, Québec and a newbie !! Please afrain from telling me not to buy a Jeep Wrangler or such...

Thank you, PF",finance

personalfinance,Advice on Two Job Offers,"Hey PF, 

Graduating college at the end of May, and effectively have two job offers. Both are in the same field of technology consulting. My first offer I received was back in January and I actually accepted it. Offers are: 


Accenture Federal Services, 68k salary plus overtime, 6% 401k match, 3 weeks PTO. No definitive Start date just yet, I should receive notice 8-10 weeks out. Already accepted.

CVP, 70k salary no overtime, $1.5k signing bonus, 6% 401k match, 3 weeks PTO, start date June 3rd.

Both Jobs are in the DC Metro area. Both seem lucrative. Accenture offers overtime which I would assume at a company like that is almost guaranteed, so effectively a higher than 68k salary. Drawbacks are the obvious: its Accenture. Generally considered a toxic environment, massive at 800k+ employees, difficult some times to move up. CVP however is more boutique, roughly 400 employees, has a MUCH better work environment from what I've heard. 

Given this information, how would you proceed? With both company's offers, is there room for negotiation with salary/benefits from either? I believe CVP is offering a higher than normal salary for my position as I have a strong background in the qualities they need right now, and they know about my Accenture offer. I'm inclined to move forward with CVP. Any advice?",finance
stocks,Ladybaybee picks for 2019-04-02,"[Link to imgur with picks for the day, details for some picks and current state of ledger (total 8 images)](https://imgur.com/a/ym9Agg7)

**Feedback Request**

Given my ""greenness"" in the area of economics, I am very much interested in reading your feedback, whether positive or negative with regards to specific stocks that you see on my picks. Some of you have done this in the past couple of weeks and it has helped me tune the machine learning engines that power my program. 

**HOW I USE THIS:** 

1) All the stocks identified in the table are qualified as “BUY” opportunities.

2) I focus in the column “Success Rate(3m)” which shows the precision of the agents in the last 3 calendar months. I personally feel most comfortable with Rates 0.8 or higher. 

3) Then, I see the number in “Tx(3m)” which represents the number of transactions that the agents predicted for this stock in the last 3 months. I prefer stocks that have had at least two transactions during this period. 

4) Finally, I look at Growth(3m), if the agents have had a considerable growth (&gt;5% in 3 months) then I follow that trade. 

5) If a row in the table is colored green then it means that stock has been on the rise today so I purchase it immediately in order to ride the wave up. On the other hand, if the row is colored red, then I wait out until very close to market close to purchase the stock and let the price bottom out before climbing up again tomorrow.


6) After I purchase the stocks, I ALWAYS set a stop loss order at -2.5% from my buying price valid for the day. I think this is good hygiene, no matter how confident I am of my system, I still want to make sure that my losses are capped. I update this stop loss order every day. 


**BACKGROUND**

I am not a financier or economist. I am electrical engineer with equal passion in artificial intelligence and financial markets. For the past 2 years I have been working on a system that would make short term predictions of stocks. The system is rather complex, I use multiple layers which include: Convolutional Neural Networks, LSTMs and Genetic Algorithms. All bulked together produce an output like in this image. The way to interpret the image is a follows: Symbol and Date columns are self explanatory, Quorum refers to autonomous agents that decide whether to BUY/NOT BUY or SELL/HOLD a stock. Each symbol has 9 agents, and the Quorum column, counts the number of agents that recommend Buy, Selling or Holding the stock. The “Not Owned” column means: if you don’t own this stock then you should … The “Owned” column means: if you own this stock you should HOLD or SELL. The column “Growth(1 Year)” refers to what what has been the growth of this system of Agents in the past calendar year. The column “Tx(1Yr)” shows the number of full transactions that these agents recommended in the last calendar year. “Factor” is just the division of Growth divided by Transactions to get the average growth per transaction. Finally “Success Rate” shows how successful these agents have been in their recommendations in the past calendar year, success 1 means 100% successful, 0.5 means 50% successful, and so on.

Many people have been curious about the actual process that the system follows, so here it is: for every symbol (600 stocks are analyzed daily), we get the full stock data (open,close,high,low,volume) for the past 4 months. Each stock is associated with another set of “lookalike” stocks as well as major ETF’s. This initial dataset is run through a convolutional layer that extracts an undisclosed number of features. These features are then passed onto a recurrent neural network (LSTM) where sequences and patterns are extracted. The LSTM then spits out probabilities for the likelihood that this stock will have a positive, negative and neutral tendency in the next N days. These probabilities are then fed to a genetic evolution system (GES). This system essentially checks the predictions for the past N days and compares them with reality, following that the systems knows which predictions are performing the best. Once the system knows which stocks are being simulated the best, then the system automatically finds which of these best performing stocks have the biggest potential for the next few days. The system does not output explanations, unfortunately us humans are not capable of understanding (or visualizing) a problem of this dimensionality, for example the LSTM part alone works with over 10 million dimensions, not features but dimensions.

personalfinance,Refinancing House for Repairs and Debt Consolidation,"My wife and I are considering refinancing our home to:

1)	fund necessary house repairs 
        -new roof, gutters, soffits, and fascia ~10K

2)	pay off some loans with a higher interest rate (consolidating our debt)


The house repairs are absolutely necessary. We expected to replace the roof within 5-7 years after buying the house at the end of 2015, but water is starting to leak into the house in several spots. We didn’t expect to have a baby before then, so that threw a wrench in our plan to conquer debt and save money for this. Expenses have increased due to the baby, but income has also increased substantially since buying the house, so we are staying above water (figuratively, but not literally). 


My student loans are consolidated. My wife’s are not. I’ve been paying on my student loans since 2013, my wife started paying on hers somewhere around 2015. We have a car loan approaching the end of its payment schedule as well. I’m hesitant to kill our equity in our home for this, but believe it could make sense if the interest rate on our mortgage remains around 4%. Also, our loan is an FHA backed loan and because we did not have the traditional 20% down payment, we pay $83 per month in PMI.


We bought our home for 130K. Similar homes in the area are appraising and selling today in the 170-180K range.

Our monthly take home is $5800. Our monthly expenses (Everything) are $4500.
We put $600 into a joint savings, $200 split into individual savings, and have $500 in pocket money per month. 


Current savings levels are 

9.3K – Joint Savings (Emergency Fund)

1K – My Savings

OK – Wife’s Savings (She is an amazing woman but has terrible money management)


We are not opposed to using our savings for the repair project, but we do not want to drain it completely. We want to start repairs in May, so we will have close to 10K by then. We are comfortable using 7K from our joint savings towards home repairs, and are hoping to use any cash from the re-fi to complete home repairs. After that, I would like to pay off the unsubsidized student loans with the rate of 6.8% and the car loan at 5.1% (tall order, I know). 


Is this a bonehead move or does it make sense?

gaming,"Ubisoft Support Rant - Save money now, lose later?","I just had an experience with Ubisoft recently. I have Far Cry 4 on the PC, and I decided to pick up the season pass. Unfortunately I made the egregious mistake of buying the season pass for Uplay, but my Far Cry 4 was owned on Steam.

Even though it's required to have Far Cry 4 activated on both Steam and Uplay, and both launchers are required to be running to play the game, the season pass will not work unless it's specifically for the Steam version of the game.

I contact support, and over the course of 2 weeks, I find out I'm screwed. There's no solution to this problem. I produce proof of ownership of both products, and you figure they'd solve the problem with the CD key for whatever would be cheapest for them overall.

With a digital product, I dunno how much they'd actually lose, but with the good will you can bet they'd earn more in the long run. Instead they'd rather this ended with me miffed, and less likely to purchase Ubisoft in the future.",technology

personalfinance,"Mortgage question: bad idea to agree to adjustable rate today, with intention to re-finance a year from now after I have two years of self-employed income?","I am scheduled to close on a house at the end of this month and trying to hammer out the financing. My wife is a pediatrician (working part time, so salary is good but not great) and I am a lawyer with a pretty good salary. I have been approved for a jumbo 10/1 ARM -- i.e., fixed at 4.25% for the first ten years, then it goes adjustable. It's a portfolio loan (i.e., my lender doesn't sell it off to an investor). I hate the adjustable rate, given that interest rates are so low right now, but it's the only portfolio loan my lender has available. The reason it needs to be a portfolio loan: I made partner at my law firm on 1/1/18 so I am now self-employed. For investor loans, the investors (Chase, Wells, etc) apparently require 2 years of self-employed salary, which I don't have, so it has to be portfolio.  

Questions:

* 1). Am I correct to be wary of a loan that will go adjustable in 10 years?

* 2). Would it be a bad idea to agree to the adjustable rate now, and then plan to re-finance once I have the two years worth of self-employed salary (i.e., less than a year from now)?",finance

personalfinance,Need investment/tax planning advice,"I'm starting a new job and I want to take this as an opportunity to carefully structure out my finances. I have been reading a lot of the wikis PF and feel that I have a pretty good idea of what I need to do, but I just want some confirmation/ outside perspective. Really hoping some of you would dive into this puzzle with me....TIA for any info or help!

&amp;#x200B;

I'm about to accept a job that offered 65k (hourly equivalent) + potential for 15% eoy bonus....full benefits, etc. I plan to try to maintain a pretty similar lifestyle after starting (I have been making \~25k for the past two years). 

&amp;#x200B;

So heres my plan :

\- Max 401k to reduce tax liability to as close to 39,475 as possible (Delineation for 2nd and 3rd fed tax bracket is $39,475 for 2019). Theoretically this should get me to around 46,000.

\- Open traditional IRA and max my contribution to that to get my liability down to 40,000.

\- Then based on some online tax calculators, I would take home around 31,000 after tax at that point.

\- Then, if the bonus comes through I would contribute to my individual brokerage, start building an emergency fund, buy some steaks, trade some crypto...who knows...shit might get wild.

&amp;#x200B;

Few things to note:

\- I am very lucky and my parents are very financially stable, and while this feels snotty to say, I frankly don't feel that I need to prioritize an emergency fund. Convince me otherwise?

\- When reading the flowchart, it suggests maxing a 401k up to the point in which you get your match and then switching towards a trad or roth IRA. I read in another thread this is because most 401ks don't provide good low cost fund options....but it seems to me that reducing my tax liability would be more important, correct? I understand that compounding 1.2% expense ratio is a killer but avoiding 10% tax on 20k also seems valuable. Ultimately I will just have to wait and see what my 401k plan is like.....

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, does this general plan seem smart/effective? The main thing I am still trying to think through is after I max a 401k, whether or not I should put that next 6k into a traditional IRA or a ROTH IRA. As I mentioned above, reducing my tax liability from that third bracket seems smart. On the other hand, I have no idea what my income/financial situation will be when I retire and so I'm not actually confident that my tax rates will be lower at that time – which would make me inclined to contribute to a ROTH so as to not put too many eggs in one basket (the basket of assuming I will be in a lower bracket when I retire). Am I thinking about this in the right ways?

&amp;#x200B;

Some background info: Married, living in NY. We filed joint and used H&amp;R Block. We're both pretty inexperienced with taxes (both early-mid 20's never filed by ourselves). Last year, we had an accountant who did it for us but he moved away so we decided to use H&amp;R Block this year. We read a lot of mixed reviews but decided to go anyway to get it over with back in early Feb. They told us we had to pay a little for both state and federal (most of it being federal).

This is also the first time both of us have ever had to pay. We've paid our state taxes already but when we log on to pay the largest amount for federal, it still shows there's nothing to pay! It's been a while since we filed so not sure if this is normal or if this means something is wrong? Another thing I found odd is I work in NJ, H&amp;R block told me I had to pay X amount for NJ state, which I immediately did back in Feb. We received a check in the mail for the same amount from the gov. I haven't cashed it yet as I'm worried it could be a mistake but I can't help but feel like something was done incorrectly.

personalfinance,Considering dipping into my ROTH to purchase a house. Can you help me weigh the decision?,"Here's my situation - I'm a teacher, 36 years old, making about 65k per year.  I work in an international school, which means I am neither paying into social security nor any teachers retirement fund.  I have been building up my Roth IRA for the last 3 years and have done quite well.  My stock portfolio was up 15% last year and so far is up 35% this year, totaling out around 50k.  I've done a lot of research to identify 10 companies that I believe have very bright futures, and so far, it seems like the market agrees.  The stocks I am invested in are volatile, but they are trending upwards rapidly.

I am getting married in June.  My partner and I are purchasing a home together that we will use as an investment property (2br apartment) in our city.  The cost of the home is approx. 133k USD.  We are already planning to make a down payment of $65k US.  We have already paid most of this and will pay the rest when the construction is done in November and we sign the mortgage.

I was planning on adding more to the down payment, but some expenses have crept up.  My partner is starting her own business and it is taking a bit longer for her to get it going than she anticipated.  So for the moment I'm supporting both of us and will be paying for the whole wedding.  I haven't been able to save as I anticipated.  I imagine we will recoup some of the cost of the wedding through gifts, but its hard to know how much, and I don't count on anything.

(My partner runs nationwide programs in social and economic development for women.  Her new business is selling her methodology to corporations' social responsibility initiatives.  I'm sure she will get some customers, but it is taking time to get her marketing together, polish her offerings, and generate sales.  There is a nonzero chance it will fail, but I'm pretty confident she will be successful.  However there is a question of how long it will take.)

Mortgage rates here are much higher than the US.  We're talking 11-14% and 20 year max term.  If I do not contribute more to the downpayment, our monthly payment will be very close to the amount we would charge for rent.  I can withdraw about 32k from my Roth IRA penalty free to contribute to the down payment.  This would considerably cut back on the monthly interest payment we would have to make and also create a much better cash flow situation for us.  But I am remiss about tapping into retirement funds for anything at all.  I have been browsing online and it seems as if the consensus among financial planners is to not dip into retirement savings to buy a home.  But I'm wondering if the calculus changes considering that we are aiming for this to be an investment property and that the interest rate for the mortgage is quite high.

I am concerned about my retirement savings because it is lower than the 1.5 x one's salary that is recommended for a 35 year old, and because I am not paying into social security.  The social security system here is more like a savings account, into which I have paid about 20k.  I also have a skip-generation trust of about 70k that is coming from my grandmother, may she rest in peace.  My parents are also affluent and will probably leave me something, but I don't like to think about that.  So I'm not totally in the woods, but still concerned  - just to give a bigger sense of my overall picture.

How do you figure this situation?  What should I consider?  I'd rather crowdsource my situation to reddit than talk to a financial advisor because I figure I can get a bigger diversity of thought and opinion here than anywhere else.",finance

Looks like TurboTax messed up it's calculations and made you under pay. So now we need you to pay after you've had the return for nearly a month now. Sorry dude.

I've talked with a few friends, family and co-workers and we've all come to the same conclusion. It's pretty unfair. They amount their asking for is a little less then $700. A pretty good amount that could make your break you financially for a month.

personalfinance,Tax Return Question,"Hello all,

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for your time reading this and helping me out. I am trying not to panic but it is tough with tax day approaching and I am considering filing an extension so I can save up for my liability payment. I just am so distraught at my spouse's and my 2018 (FLA residence, no state tax obviously).

&amp;#x200B;

I started a new job in October. I am a w2 employee and for simplistic purposes will round all these numbers...

&amp;#x200B;

My w2 says $19k with $2k federally withheld for OCT through end of year. My old job had me as a 1099 employee. I do not know why. I had $77k in wages and only $9k withheld federally. I say I do not know why because I had HR access and a few benefits. The company was a tad ""shady"" so that is prob why they made me 1099.

&amp;#x200B;

My spouse had $60k wages as a w2 and $7k federally withheld. We are not itemizing due to the new MFJ deduction being as large as it is. It is that simple, no other craziness - no kids, no big purchases, etc. The only other thing is about $100 in interest income from a bank account, no investments to account for. Also, I pay LARGE student loan payments each month. I hit the $2500 max in interest.

&amp;#x200B;

So basically, by my extremely simple and naive math we have $156k in wages, only $18k in federal withholdings. So the MFJ and student interest loans get us down to about $130k in wages. Turbo tax just sent me into a panic with about a $13k payment due. 

&amp;#x200B;

What are my options other than extension to try and save by mid October? Can I go to a tax attorney regarding the 1099 issue since I had no idea I would be a 1099 employee? My spouse and I made our w4 a ""1"" deduction back in October.

personalfinance,FICO score plunged 870 to 746 after $150 in missed car lease payments - Equifax is now 696 - any advice?,"Hi guys, this is my first post, and I'm looking for some help rebuilding my credit score after a bit of a SNAFU on my part. 

I am preparing to buy a house and have been consistently monitoring my FICO score, which has been in the 'exceptional' range. In October 2018, I lost and canceled my debit card, which is how I was paying my $75 per month car lease. I had also moved house since getting the lease. 

Long story short, after making 2 years and 10 months of on-time payments, I missed the last two payments in November and December because I didn't update my payment details and they weren't able to contact me by mail. I have no idea why they didn't call me. The lease ended in January, the lender started calling me to arrange returning the car and then they told me I had $150 outstanding.  I paid it over the phone. Then I checked my FICO score and it had plummeted 134 points because of past due payments. I signed up for Equifax Complete and found out my score was 696 with Equifax, higher with the two other agencies. I have basically gone from 'exceptional' to 'good' over $150. I am so mad with myself. 

My current credit report is still showing one installment account with a balance of $150. What really worries me is that only Equifax is showing me as having a negative account -- Transunion and Experian show zero negative accounts. I guess they don't have the information yet, so I presume my score will go down with them too when the information reaches them about my delinquency. Is it normal to take four months for a delinquency to register with them?

As far as other credit, I only have one active credit card with a limit of $17,000, which I carry no balance on and pay off every few days.  

I have read about writing a ""goodwill letter"" to the lender asking for the late payment to be removed. Has anyone had any experience with that? 

If anyone has any advice on how to rebuild my score, I would be really grateful. I know my score is not terrible, and there are people much worse off than me, I get that, but I am worried it will get worse and I've been working hard for a long time to get to a position where I can get a good mortgage interest rate. I feel that slipping away.

I found out that he is paying a 5.5% interest rate on his home (i asked fixed or variable, and he said he didn't know). I believe it's a 30 year. Home cost about 200,000.

I felt that this was high and that he didn't put any thought into it.

Maybe i'm wrong, but I was looking for advice about addressing this if it is indeed high. I somewhat figured that's his business and I shouldn't say anything, but I wouldn't want to see my friends making bad financial moves.

I'm sure I've left out key details, sorry in advance. Let me know if there is anything else you need to know and I will try to make edits. Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,"Hey guys, my mom has accrued $27K in credit card debt with upwards of 27% interest. She finally wants to take initiative in paying these off, but not sure how best to go about it! Told her I would ask here and get back to her. Advice greatly needed!","Hey Everyone, 

So my mom lived her life thinking it was okay to just be overusing credit cards and just paying off the minimum to ""maintain a balance"" on her credit cards to have an increase in credit score (as many falsely believe). 

Now she accrued about $27k in credit card debt with high interest rates. She now realizes her mistake, unfortunately, but is adamant about fixing this and changing her habits and aggressively paying them off.

She is in her late 50s. Makes about ~$70k/year. This is the maximum monthly payment she can make for now given other expenses (mortgage, car insurance, car payment, house bills, etc.).

What advice do you guys have for her to make sure she is headed in the right direction paying these cards off? I told her to focus on the higher interest ones first and go from there. But what options does she have here? Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Thanks guys!",finance
economy,Pre-recession trade war as monetary policy,"Hi guys, just something that crossed my mind today and I wanted to cross it by someone else. When the last recession hit the US interest rates were dropped and dollars were printed but when this didn't do it, quantitative easing was introduced. This helped ease the pain and with another recession looming the same may be required, this time however there are on going trade wars to also consider. When the next downturn hits could the US reversal of these trade wars not do a better job of stimulating the economy then say QE? Is the potential of reversing these wars not another tool in the US arsenal against a difficult downturn?

With the fed controlling interest rates, would the introduction of a trade war prior to a recession and the withdrawal from said war not have a similar effect on the economy as the rising and lowering of interest rates?",finance
personalfinance,use an old 401k to pay std loan,"Hey! 

I'm debating about withdrawing money from the last job where i have $5300 in a 401k. Im 28 making 68k a year. My last company did not contribute to the 401k. with 20% fed take out im assuming ill get around $4200. I'm not accounting for New York taxes at the moment. Ill pay during the 2020 tax time which im ok with.  previously withdrew $6k to over my medical bills, a vacation and some student loans and owed $250 to NYS. I was bumped up a tax bracket for doing this. 

My student loans are at $18100 with 4.75% interest rate weighted average. I have on loan from that $18100 that is at $4200 with 6.8%. I currently pay about $400-$700 a month in payments depending on expenses during the month.  My student loans currently make $2.40/day in interest. If i kill that loan it'll go down to 1.60/day but now id be able to pay more for the other 5 loans. im on track to pay of my loans within 50 months @ 400/mo. but if i pay the loan, i can pay my loans in 36 months. 

i want to reduce as much of my debt as possible before this recession hits. This student loan is the only debt i have at the moment but id like to buy a new car in the future.",finance

My plan is to get to 10K savings and use what I normally put in my savings each month toward the final loan. I make 4.7K per month before taxes now but anticipate more income because I am currently paid below market value in the public sector.

personalfinance,Better understanding my company's retirement program,"I work for a large chain convenience store in upstate new york that has a employee stock ownership program. The program contributes a large percentage of my salary into the retirement plan (this year is 19%) with no contribution required from me and even has an interest rate of 13.5% on my my total account balance this year. Now the interest, to the best of my understanding, is determined based off of the valuation of my company come year end. Does this mean all of my retirement is based on if my company stays afloat? Are all of my eggs in one basket and what are the potential detriments to this retirement program. I know people who make insane amounts of money in this program, enough to buy boats and cars or even pay for huge weddings outright from the dividends. Obviously this is very appealing to me so I would like to better understand it.",finance
personalfinance,"Back to school in my 30's, while getting a divorce...trying to weigh my options to make it viable.","I decided two years ago, at the age of 30, that I wanted to go back to school to pursue engineering, coming from a previous career of manual labor.  I did the calculation that it would pay for itself eventually to get a degree, even if I did accrue debt.  I decided to go to community college for the first two year, to earn an associate's degree and have a way point halfway that makes me feel like I'm getting somewhere, and also to save money.  I have also been married during this time, and this was a huge help.  My spouse was very supportive, both emotionally and financially.

Well, now it's 2 years on, and I have succeeded in obtaining my associate's degree.  After this semester, I will have my first degree, which feels really good.  I've also been accepted to a prestigious four year school to finish it out.  However, things have gotten a bit complicated recently, in that my spouse and I have come to agree that we are getting a divorce.  It's not exactly hostile, and it's a bit complicated, but it is what it is.  We will be officially separated in a month, and we will move to different places in a couple months.  The problem is, I have been working part time while I'm in school, with my spouse supporting us mostly.  I've never lived on my own in my entire life, let alone paying for an apartment while trying to go to school full time.  Just when things were going great, they suddenly took a nose dive.

So I'm currently weighing my options to make it viable.  I've come this far, and I don't want to lose momentum.  It's not going to get any easier from here on out, and I need to be on top of my game to be successful.  Here are the two major options I'm considering:

1.) Take out loans to fully cover my expenses.  I should qualify for federal student loans, but I'm not sure how much yet.  I never really needed to use them for housing previously, but maybe I could ask for more to cover it.  I should be able to find a place to rent for $500-650, usually a room in a house with other young people.  However, I have a cat, and finding a place to rent that allows cats can be difficult.
Or 2.) Move back in with my parents, who live about an hour away from the school.  I've done the math on the commute, and it would cost about $250 for gas alone, wear and tear could add up to maybe $500 potentially, assuming the commute doesn't just kill my car entirely.  This could be the most economical option, but honestly not much more than just getting a room in the area, and there are a lot of risks, including the possibility of straining my relationship with my parents, plus the possibility for my car to just give out on me.  Another risk is the possibility that since I live so far, I will feel distant from the school, and not keep up with my work, or get annoyed at the commute and give up.  However, I've come so far, and feel very driven, that I feel I wouldn't do that, and will do what it takes to get it done.

Overall, I'm just trying to decide what I can do to keep my costs down.  Moving in with my parents would be the safest bet, but it's also humiliating moving back in with my parents in my early 30's, and an hour commute each way is not something I would be looking forward to.  However, it is only temporary, and will be over with in a couple years, so maybe it will be worth it.  On the other hand, it may not actually be cheaper due to gas and wear and tear expenses.

So any input or advice anyone could give on this situation would be greatly appreciated, and let me know if you want any further information about my situation.",finance

personalfinance,Issue with discrepancies among amount owed for different tax filing services,"Quick issue here: tried filing taxes with FreeTaxUSA, TaxSlayer, and TurboTax.

TurboTax: 352$ owed fed

TaxSlayer: 654$ owed fed

FreeTaxUSA: 753$ owed fed

I'm tempted to go with TurboTax because it's significantly cheaper however I don't understand how the amounts could be so different?!

personalfinance,Please help me understand how to fill out 2018 form 8962 for my mom and sister.,"I tried to search for my situation that my mom is in but it seems a bit unique and I couldn't find anything. Please help!

&amp;#x200B;

**Here are the details:**

So my mom moved to Utah from Nevada around 1/8/2018 and the 1095A indicates NV as the marketplace identifier. 

She has herself, my younger brother, and my younger sister as the covered individuals. 

They were covered from 1/1/18 to 5/31/18.

&amp;#x200B;

My mom claimed my brother, but didn't claim my sister and my sister filed her own taxes. They both got a letter needing them to send 8962 and 1095A. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mom is not eligible to take the PTC because she made more money due to a lot of overtime pay. 

&amp;#x200B;

**From my research:**

As I understand it so far my sister and my mom need to collaborate to figure out the percentage allocation. 

Which means that they both need to fill out part 4 and part 2 and their forms need to reflect each others' numbers correctly. Payments split correctly.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So...

What is the best option here? My mom was getting about 4k back from federal and my sister (full time student) was getting 1800 back. 

&amp;#x200B;

Are they both going to be losing their refunds or will it get cut down significantly? 

What would be the best option here for them to get the most of it back? Should my mom allocate 100% or it or split it or have my sister allocate 100%?

Anyone here go through something similar?

&amp;#x200B;

Any other helpful suggestions will be very much appreciated. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you in advance.

personalfinance,Roth 401k or traditional?,"I'm debating whether I should contribute pre-tax or post-tax funds to my 401k — right now I have both a Roth and a traditional 401k at my current job. I'm single, in the 22% federal tax bracket and live in a high cost of living city. I'm currently contributing 10% of my salary to a Roth 401k, which comes out to less than $5,000 each year, whereas if I contribute pre-tax dollars I could put in closer to $9,000 annually and get essentially the same paycheck. Saving more than that isn't possible right now given my existing debt/expenses.

I like the idea of contributing post-tax funds because I like getting taxes out of the way and hope to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. For that reason I also max out my Roth IRA annually. But anything can happen and I might end up moving eventually to a state with lower taxes or being in a lower tax bracket in retirement. My work matches just under $4,000 in pre-tax dollars so my 401k is somewhat diversified. But I wanted to get some advice on whether I should switch back to pre-tax contributions and if there are any other factors I should consider. Thank you!",finance

personalfinance,Am I missing something in my interest calculations? Netspend Savings,"Hello. I have one of those 5% APY savings accounts with NetSpend. The actual interest rate is 4.91%. The savings account compounds interest quarterly and is also credited back to the account quarterly. At the end of the last quarter, I managed to have $490.29 saved up. At the beginning of last quarter I had $190.29 saved. I've been putting 50 dollars into my NetSpend Savings account each paycheck (twice a month). The last quarter ended on the March 31st, and I was credited $3.85 the following day. 

Now I'm sort of new to this compound interest thing, so forgive me if my math is off, but according to my calculations, shouldn't the correct amount of interest that was to be credited to the account be $6.02? The formula I used is as follows:

A=Balance after compounded interest
P=Principal
R=The interest rate expressed as a decimal
N=Number of times per year that the interest is compounded
T=Number of years compounded

A=P(1+R/N)^NT

496.31=490.29(1+.0491/4)^4(0.25)

To find the amount that was to be credited to the account I simply found the difference between the new balance and the principal:

496.31-490.29=6.02

I asked for clarification on their end, but they basically just copy pasted the terms and conditions for the account including that they can change the interest rate whenever they want. Correct me if I'm wrong, but if they are to change the interest rate, then they are required to notify their account holders?

Thanks for any help in advance

UPDATE: Thanks guys! I see now that the principal is an average of the daily balance! Makes sense.",finance

Are they glossing over the amount of corporate debt? When those interest rates rise only one thing happens to companies with debt; bye profit.

Conversely; AT&amp;T huge debt but almost 7% dividend. Interest rates rise, dividend falls, stock sky rockets. Or will it?",finance
personalfinance,I have roughly 23k in student loans and currently have 15.7k in various stocks. Should I cash out of my stocks and pay off student loans?,A little deeper is that there are technically 4 student loans and two of those that comprise of about 12k of it have the higher interest rate at 6.2 percent.  I have been toying with this idea for awhile but have always held off because I have slowly built my little portfolio and hate to see it go away but I think it is the smart choice. Just looking for opinions. Also this is not my 401k just a tdameritrade account that I have had since college.,finance
personalfinance,TreasuryDirect.gov isn’t talked about enough,"I see a lot of discussions on where the best bank to park your cash is, who has the best interest rates etc. I rarely see anyone mention treasury direct as an option. It’s the website to buy treasury securities from the US government directly. The website is easy to use and navigate, setting up an account takes 5 minutes, and links directly to your pre existing bank account. 4 week tbills are currently yielding over 2.4%, which is more than you can get pretty much anywhere else. For cash management purposes I would highly recommend checking it out, especially if you’re saving for something like a house and can’t take any risk. They offer automatic reinvestments for up to two years at a time than you can Vance whenever you want, and the website does a great job of explaining everything for you. If you’re concerned about having your money locked up for 4 weeks at a time, you can split the money into 1/4s and buy the auction each week, set them to auto reinvest and if you end up needing the money stop the auto reinvestments and the cash will be deposited back into your bank account at the end of the term.

There are no fees, and no minimums, All your money stays in your current bank and is withdrawn when you purchase a security. Proceeds from maturity are automatically sent back to your bank unless you reinvest. Plus it’s the US government so you don’t have to worry about who you’re doing business with, or have to keep searching and switching banks to find the best rates.",finance
gaming,The meat bicycle in the room... (or Borderlands 3 timed exclusivity.),"Take Two has confirmed that the September release for the PC version of Borderlands 3 will be an Epic Games Store exclusive, with the game coming to Steam over a year from now.

Gonna implore everyone here to hold off on buying it at all until that exclusivity deal is over or it gets canceled. We all have a say, and that say is whether we as consumers decide to play along with Take Two's incredibly disappointing decision, or whether we let them know that they've shot themselves in the foot. 

Vote with your dollars. Enjoy the game on consoles, but don't buy it on PC until the Steam launch in April 2020 if you're disappointed in the Epic exclusivity deal.

Edit: My gripe with Epic isn't Chinese spying (okay, maybe I am a little miffed at nonconsensual data harvesting), it's this - Epic may take a smaller cut than Valve, and it's perfectly fine to tempt me with an EGS release. However, I was burned pretty hard on the Metro Exodus debacle, where after months of advertising and taking preorders on Steam, Deep Silver announced that they would be launching exclusively on the EGS about six days before the game actually launched. 

In summary - giving developers and publishers more for their work, good.
Reducing Steam's near-monopolic clutch on the PC gaming market, good
Eliminating my choice of platform as consumer, not so good.

If you want me to buy the game on the EGS, give me a choice, don't force me to buy it from the EGS.",technology
personalfinance,Tips for investing and savings,"Hey all,

I'm 25 years old, live at home with my parents and I don't have much money saved. I currently have about 500 dollars in a Marcus Goldman Sachs savings account that has a 2.25% interest rate. My monthly expense is $40 for my cell phone bill. As for income, I'm unemployed and receiving money on a weekly basis through a NYS 599 student program as I'm working on my associates degree. I'm going full time taking 15 credits. School is a backup plan to a very likely apprenticeship opportunity in the near future(possibly September 2019 or February 2020). I've paid off previous student loans and with federal and state aid I'm currently going to school for almost nothing. I'm fiscally responsible and I have a great credit score. I will be receiving $1,400 in tax returns and I'm looking to either put a lot of it into my savings account or invest it. I was thinking of maybe doing the minimum $500 with Wealthfront and starting there.

I have little to zero knowledge about investing and would appreciate it if anyone has some tips or advice. I have an open mind to any ideas, thank you for your help!",finance
personalfinance,Took the standard deduction but then realized my parents can claim me as a dependent,"I already filed my 2018 tax return, got my federal and state refunds, and deposited them. My parents are just now filing their taxes and want to claim me as a dependent (they can/should, I lived with them last year). 

I found an irs article about how the standard deduction for a dependent is like $1000 not the $12k I took. That would drastically change my refund amount as I said I wasn’t a dependent when I filed (stupid, I just wasn’t thinking at the time). 

How do I fix this? I’m not sure when my parents are actually sending in their return but soon. If they claim me as a dependent is that a problem and how bad?",finance
personalfinance,New job offers a Student Loan Repayment Program -- Should I consolidate?,"I graduated from school about 3 months ago and got my first salary job about 1 month ago. One of the benefits of the job is a student loan repayment plan, where the company will make contributions towards employees' student loans after 6 months of employment. The repayment plan will pay out over the course of 6 years, while making contributions of $300 quarterly during years 1-3 and then $600 during years 4-6. However, there are restrictions on the types of loans that they will pay down. The only loan type I can qualify for is a Federal Consolidated Loan. This has led me to the question: to consolidate or not? 

My current loans: https://imgur.com/a/De03P2A
- 0 - Direct Subsidized
- L - Direct Unsubsidized 

My current plan is to only consolidate a portion of my 12 loans. For instance, two of my loans are under $300, so I am planning on not consolidating those and just making direct payments. Besides that, I am unsure what is the best way to consolidate. Should I only consolidate the loans with lower rates? My grace period for my current loans ends in about 3 months and my eligibility for the repayment plan begins in about 5 months. Should I wait until my grace period ends before I consolidate? Or is the consolidation process extensive and I should begin now? 

If you were in my shoes would you use this benefit? Since I have just started at this company, it is hard to tell if I will still be there in 6 years. My ideal time to stay with the company is about 2-3 years. I am worried that if I consolidate too many of my loans and I end up leaving the company, I will be putting myself in at a disadvantage by giving up the benefits of unconsolidated student loans.

I have really know idea what I am doing when it comes to student loans, so any advice is beyond welcomed.",finance
personalfinance,FHA Streamline Interest Rate Reduction Program,"So I got a call from my mortgage servicing company today and the representative was telling me that now that I have made 6 months of payments on time on my new FHA mortgage, I am eligible for the program in the title of this post. He told me a list of things that honestly just sounded too good to be true... He said I can refinance my mortgage while keeping the same term (not extending it at all), I won't have to pay any out of pocket costs like closing costs, and my rate will go down and save me a lot of money each month.... Is this a legitimate program? Is it a bad idea for some reason I'm not seeing? So far it doesn't sound like there are any drawbacks but if that's the case, I don't understand why the mortgage company is approaching me about it since it means they'd make less money on my loan???

Thanks",finance
personalfinance,My wages are being garnished by Federal Student Loans--please help! *desperate*,"\*\*Any help or steps to take is greatly appreciated\*\*

I'm a 25 year old female from NC who has about (+/-) 40K worth of student loan debt. I have only ever made one student loan payment (about $100 a few years ago). Currently, my wages are being garnished at 15% of my paycheck. I have medical bills, outstanding credit-card debt, and unpaid household bills. On paper and out loud, this sounds bad. I haven't made a good effort to get my student loans under control. I've been battling with depression and my finances have been all over the place. No, I'm not good with my money and I know I \*have to\* be. There is more to this story but I'm trying to lay down all of the facts to receive help.

I went on [studentloans.gov](https://studentloans.gov/) and filled out the application to Consolidate my loans. I know I haven't done this in the past and my wages are already being garnished. The application has been sent. Is this something I can still do? Is consolidation actually an option?

The restaurant listed the scholarship on my W-2 as part of my wages, so it looks like I made 12K working there for a summer. But, I was not directly given the money - they send the check to my school. Since it's processed there, it shows up on my 1098-T form as a scholarship / grant in box 5.

Other than that, I made \~2k (12k-10k) at the restaurant back home, and then about \~4k at my part time job on campus. I don't understand how I owe almost 700 dollars in taxes. The majority of it is to the state where I work my restaurant job with the scholarship, which is why I'm suspecting there are issues with my W-2 and 1098-T both listing the scholarship.

Bitcoin,Why I Bitcoin,"I've always been skeptical of authority. 

I've always felt that authority is exercised by those least qualified to wield it. 

During the Occupy WallStreet protests we watched on as ""authority"" used violence and despotic tactics to undermine the efforts to bring the evils of the Central Banking system to light. Police and intelligence services infiltrated non-violent protest groups ; posed as protesters ; and then would instigate violence by looting, throwing rocks, etc. Authority was caught red-handed performing false-flag attacks against the Occupy Wallstreet protesters.

The narrative quickly shifted from exposing the Banking system to fighting police corruption/brutality.

Then Edward Snowden revealed and confirmed the biggest proven conspiracy to date. That the US Government was overtaken by the ""Intelligence Services"" ; that the US as a democratic, constitutional republic, no longer exists.

The leaked documents revealed that a massive Shadow government exists and has been executing a plan to monitor and have control over every aspect of every human beings life on planet Earth.

After the failure of Occupy Wallstreet many of us were livid. We didn't want to participate in this rigged game. But there was seemingly no way out. How can you fight a system that has a monopoly on the means of exchange? That has a monopoly on the concept of ""value""?

That is where Bitcoin comes in. You can't fight the monolithic system. The Central banks have the world in a mass hallucination ; they are exercising mind-control on the greatest scale humanity has ever seen. The Central banks control the behavior of humans on the planet by having a monopoly on the ideas of ""wealth"" and ""value"".

https://youtu.be/4AC6RSau7r8

You can't fight the system. Its like the Matrix; where anybody who hasn't ""woken up"" can be an ""Agent Smith"" ; fighting the system would be fighting every person who consciously or unconsciously supports the system.

The way to win; is to create a better system.

People will happily buy products at the supermarket made or harvested by slaves. They will never be convinced to do something that is ""right"" if it negatively impacts them in any way.

So we create a system that latches on to peoples sense of greed. Bitcoin will win out not because people want to overthrow the central banks en-mass; Bitcoin will win because individuals want the profit.

Bitcoin is the biggest threat of central banks and governments that has ever existed.

The source of power is peoples beliefs surrounding wealth and authority. The people have been brainwashed into believing that wealth and authority are one and the same.

People believe that for money to have value it must be issued by a government. This belief is what gives government power to issue fiat currency. Money that has value because the government says it has value.

Fiat currency is a dastardly, criminal trick perpetrated by the highest levels of ""authority""; the FED, Central Bankers, and Treasury. They are truly Rats. Bitcoin is here to end their party. As Warren Buffet puts it ""Bitcoin is like Rat Poison"". ; Bitcoin will certainly act like rat poison to the central bankers.

https://youtu.be/6n_xCI-peq0

Bitcoin proves that the value of money comes from People; not government decree.

Bitcoin proves that Central Banks are unnecessary

Bitcoin proves that intermediaries are not necessary for value transactions

Bitcoin proves that money can be global, border-less, and permission-less

Bitcoin proves that the Pen is Mightier than the sword. A significant portion of our military power is wielded to enforce economic priorities that improve the value of the USD. The US uses force and violence to create value for the USD. The USD requires a complex legal framework to prop up its value. Large sums of money are spent combating counterfeiting ; and billions in counterfeiting is gotten away with. With a few lines of code Bitcoin is entirely self-regulating. No need to use force or violence to give it value. No need to worry about counterfeiting. The system regulates and balances itself without any central authority.

Bitcoin is Law

Bitcoin is the definition of Wealth, Value, and Money

Bitcoin is Freedom

The world is malleable. We are all part of the New World Order ; its our responsibility to guide that Order in the right direction.

personalfinance,Paying for tuition without financial aid - personal line of credit or personal loan?,"I am in my last semester of my MBA and I have about $4k that I need to pay.  Without getting into a ton of back story, I should have finished last semester, which my financial aid covered, but had multiple circumstances rear their ugly heads that prevented me from finishing on time.  Because of that, I've exhausted my financial aid and need to pay tuition for this semester.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a couple of options.  Right now I have about $3k in my emergency fund, but I don't really consider this an ""emergency"" and don't want to touch that.  I already had to use some of it in the last several months to handle the actual emergencies that came up and I want to replenish it.

1. I have a credit card with a 9.4% interest rate I could use, but I don't like the idea of using a credit card in general for this.
2. I have a line of credit with my bank with a 8.9% interest rate and a limit of $1k.  I could request an increase so that I could cover tuition with it.  This would be my lowest interest rate, but my credit utilization would increase.
3. I could apply for a personal loan with my bank.  My credit is solid and I expect to be on the low end of their interest rate range, which is 9.14% - 18%.  Since this isn't a revolving line of credit I feel like this might be better for my credit, even though it would lower my average age of credit and I would have a new ""maxed out"" loan.
4. I can do 4 payments with my school and pay cash, the first payment due immediately.  There's a $55 fee for the payment plan and it would be a stretch to pay $1k each month for the next 4 months.  I'm trying to rebuild my emergency fund and this would basically put that on hold.  With the way things have been going in my personal life, I see the value in having that emergency money available.  Additionally, since I have student loans in deferment while in school, I have interest accruing on a couple of them that will capitalize after graduation if I don't pay it, which I have every intention of doing, so I need to make sure I have money going towards that.

&amp;#x200B;

I prefer going through my bank versus having a private student loan company, as I think I will have better interest rates and terms.  I think I'm leaning towards option 2 of increasing my line of credit, since I never use it, the interest rate is the lowest, and it won't require opening a new account which impacts my age of credit (although that impact would probably be minimal).

&amp;#x200B;

I am also looking at appealing my financial aid status, but it's unlikely I will qualify (the way my school does it is you pretty much have to have had a death in the family or a medical emergency for which you were hospitalized, neither of which apply).  Even if I do appeal, I have to pay my tuition in the meantime and if the appeal were approved then I would be able to pay off any loan that I took out right now, but I don't want to count on that.

&amp;nbsp;

Hi all,

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

If this is posted in the wrong sub, let me know.  Sorry.
&amp;nbsp;


&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;


Ok, here's the story. I work for an organization that works on federal grants.  The one I currently work on was supposed to be renewed earlier this year, but it was postponed.  Now we aren't going to find out until later this month (maybe).  If there hadn't been some snag (above my pay grade as to what exactly it was), i probably wouldn't have even given this a thought.  I'm not worried about being laid off.  My employer has said that if we don't get the grant, they would absorb us into other grant work, but thing is, is I'm bored.  I'm tired of working on this topic, and I'm pretty sure I have both ""F.U"" and ""Shit, I'm bored and I want out"" money.  I've been applying to new jobs, and had a great interview the other day, but I won't find out if I got it for 2 weeks though (still interviewing others).  And I'm thinking I just want to quit.  And if I get this new job, then great.  And if I don't, well then I'll continue to apply, but otherwise dammit, it's going to be the spring of Herbwannabe!  I just want some objective input on whether or not I can do this safely, given my numbers, and if anyone thinks I may have forgotten to consider something.
&amp;nbsp;


&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

Honestly, the only thing giving me pause (besides wanting outside opinions), is that a friend of mine was in a completely different organization under the same larger umbrella employer, and she's been looking for work for almost a year.  Now, we do not have the same skills, we do not do the same thing, we would not be competing for the same jobs, but since it's the same employer, and it's been almost a year for them, it makes me wonder if that could happen to me?  Oh, and my parents keep telling me never to quit without having a new job first, which defeats the damn purpose of taking time off.
&amp;nbsp;


&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

My situation:

Single - only pet dependents.

Home - paid for, and I've already paid my homeowners insurance for the year.

Upcoming taxes (August) - $1600, (December) - $50

Car - don't have one.  No maintenance, no gas, no insurance, etc.

CC debt - none.

Monthly charitable givings - $350

Monthly bills - $300

Monthly grocery - $200
&amp;nbsp;


&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

untouchable retirement (401/403) - $284,677

available retirement (457, post tax mutual funds, etc) – $100,908

savings account - $40,000
&amp;nbsp;


&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

Spending History

I've been tracking my spending for 3+ years now and to live in the house (bills, groceries, insurance, taxes, etc) it has cost me:

2015 - $16,000

2016 - $16,000

2017 – $12,000 (I buckled down last year!)


&amp;nbsp;


If I do take time off, I'll be responsible for my own health insurance, which thanks to Cobra, I can get for the next 18 months at the same price as the total is now:

Health insurance - $600/month


&amp;nbsp;

Estimated 2018 (from now on with health insurance): $20,000 - $25,000 (slightly padded to cover emergencies).

&amp;nbsp;


While I'm only ""planning"" on a couple of months, if the SHTF, I feel like I have enough in savings to cover almost 2 years worth.


&amp;nbsp;


So, what are your thoughts on whether or not I can take some time off safely?  And is there anything that you can see that I'm not taking into account that I should be sure to consider?

personalfinance,Most efficient way to deposit cash from house sale?,"My parents purchased a new home about 10 months ago and have just completed the sale of our old house. In order to finance the new house, my parents had to take out a mortgage while the old house was completely paid off. Also given their relative income to the cost of the new house, we currently have PMI as part of our mortgage payments.

**New House:**

1. How can I ensure the maximum benefit of contributing the $180K to the principal left on the new mortgage? If I make a one-time payment the goal would be to apply purely to principal, correct?
2. Should I consider having my parents refinance after we apply the payment? Currently they are able to afford $1500 of the $2075/monthly payments and I cover the difference. Would refinancing with a lower interest rate bring the  monthly payment to something they can support without me? Should we look into a 15-year rate?
3. If we continue to make the same payments ($2075) after applying the 180K balance how long would it take to pay off  the mortgage? What's the equation I can use to play with the values?",finance

science,Science discussion series: We are an interdisciplinary group of water science professionals and we’re here to discuss safe drinking water. Ask us anything!,"[Hi Reddit](https://i.imgur.com/sqOjWz6.png)! Today's discussion is coming to us from the [**National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM)**](http://www.nationalacademies.org/) and is a collaboration between r/science, [**LabX**](https://labx.org/), and [**the Water, Science and Technology Board**](http://dels.nas.edu/wstb)! 

## We are panel of diverse water science professionals ready to answer your questions about all things related to drinking water. 

Water is a ubiquitous phenomenon! But its visual abundance—from its constant flow out of taps and fountains to the immensity of our oceans—can mask the fact that 1 in 7 people worldwide lack access to safe drinking water (that’s over 1 billion people!). Furthermore, in places like New Orleans or The Netherlands, water can seem like an impending threat without the proper means to safely contain it, or productively incorporate it into our daily lives. The broader water/society interface raises questions about drinking water’s vulnerability to climate change and society’s vulnerability to ageing infrastructure for adequate and safe sourcing, treatment, and distribution. Poor drinking water quality can result from pollution from sources such as industrial waste, agricultural runoff, corrosion of lead from distribution pipes, or treatment facility contamination by man-made materials such as polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Emerging innovations in grey/green infrastructure, stewardship programs to reduce man-made contaminants, desalination technology, and international efforts to increase access to safe water on a global scale might help preserve and increase Earth’s water supply and society’s value of it. All of these issues, and more, are on our collective radar and we look forward to discussing them with you. Ask us anything! 

Our discussion panel guests today are:

1. **Will Logan** (u/Will_Logan_ICIWaRM) is currently the Director at the International Center for Integrated Water Resources Management (ICIWaRM), which is part of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Previously, Will was the Science Attaché for the US Mission to UNESCO and he served for almost a decade on the Water, Science, and Technology Board at the National Academies of Sciences. Will holds a Ph.D. in Earth Sciences/Hydro-geology from Waterloo University and was an Assistant Professor of Hydro-geology at George Washington University. 

2. **Ellen de Guzman** (u/Ellen_de_Guzman) is currently the Senior Water Officer in the Middle East and North Africa Bureau at USAID. Ellen has managed projects spanning rural reconstruction, humanitarian and disaster response, alternative livelihoods, food security, agriculture, water and sanitation. Prior to USAID, Ellen worked for the National Academies of Sciences, where she provided policy research support to develop federal policies on managing subsurface water contamination, the Clean Water Act, sustainable water and environmental management in the California Bay-Delta, and invasive species in ballast water. 

3. **Jin Shin** (u/Jin_Shin_WSSC) is currently the Water Quality Division Manager at WSSC (Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission), where he has worked for nearly 15 years. The WSSC is one of the largest water and wastewater utilities in the nation, with a service area that spans nearly 1,000 square miles in Prince George’s and Montgomery counties in Maryland. Jin holds a Ph.D. in Environmental Engineering from John Hopkins University, where he was also a lecturer and visiting professor for 6 years. 

4. **Teddi Ann Galligan** (u/Teddi_Ann_Galligan) is a community science educator. She draws from firsthand experience living in conditions where safe drinking water was a daily issue, as well as substantial laboratory experience, which includes wastewater analysis for a sustainable sanitation digestion technology, water quality analysis, and clinical laboratory work in low-resource settings. Currently Director of Covalence Science Education, Ms. Galligan has designed and delivered hands-on programs in a wide variety of environments, ranging from classrooms in the United States to open-air community science workshops in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Teddi Ann was an educator and consultant at the Marian Koshland Science Museum of the National Academy of Sciences for more than a decade, helping visitors use science to address real world community resilience issues associated with climate change.

The check showed up today and my step daughter is worried about taxes on the life insurance.  There is no estate, pretty much everything my wife and I owned was household items and a single vehicle in both of our names that is my only vehicle.  

From what I can tell there should be no federal taxes on the life insurance policy.  Face value was 20K.  And I don't think there is where her daughter lives either, Arizona.  I have searched online and can't really find a whole lot of information on this and want to make sure or at least have a better idea if she needs to worry about it or not. 

Any help will be appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,Mid-career government employee (US) seeking investment advice,"Hello, r/personalfinance. Looking to get some advice on mid-career investing and making sure I'm well-positioned for retirement. Throwaway account, for obvious reasons.

Age: Early 40's

Current major assets:

~$150,000 in savings

~$180,000 in Thrift Savings Plan

~$30,000 in separate managed Roth IRA

~$28,000 in managed fund account

- Single, currently renting, not seriously planning on home ownership at this point.


Expected retirement income:

- Federal retirement (FERS)

- Military retirement

- TSP

- Social Security (if it's still there)


I'd particularly like to put my savings to work - nice fat balance in there, but it's not doing all that much for me at the moment. TSP funds are invested in one of the Lifecycle funds that will hit its ""time horizon"" right around the time I expect to retire, and I'm maxing out my yearly contributions. 

Any advice would be appreciated - thanks!

personalfinance,Lightstream RateBeat Loan Program Scam,"If you are not familiar Lightstream is a company who provides loan products with an advertised RateBeat program in which they will beat a competitors interest rate by .1 if a few conditions are met.

&gt;**The interest rate (APR) must be for the same loan amount, loan term, loan purpose and payment method (auto debit or invoice) that are being offered by LightStream. The offer applies to fixed-rate loans only. Variable-rate loans do not qualify.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**You need to be approved for the other lender’s interest rate (APR).**  
&gt;  
&gt;**If requested by us, you will need to supply LightStream with evidence, to its satisfaction, that the other lender’s interest rate (APR) meets the Rate Beat program terms and conditions described here. This could include an approval letter, loan document containing the APR, or other documentation that LightStream finds sufficient.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**This offer expires if the terms and conditions are not satisfied prior to 2 p.m. Eastern time on the business day prior to loan funding.**

&amp;#x200B;

I was shopping around for a credit refinance loan and had received a few quotes from a couple of different loan providers without the need of a hard credit pull with one of the providers offering a rate of 6.57% I hadn't actually applied to Lightstream at this point because they required a hard pull to receive a quote.

I carefully read through their conditions advertised on their website and determined that my current offer matched all of those conditions. Every condition was met, my loan was the same amount $8000, loan term 36 months, loan purpose of credit refinance, and payment method (auto debit or invoice). I went ahead and finished my Lightstream loan application and was approved for a rate of 8.5%. Well I submitted the documentation of my competing offer and was immediately told that I do not qualify because the provider charged an origination fee (1%). I responded politely to inform them that this was not a condition of their terms posted on the site , asked if they could send me their actual terms, and if they would honor their advertised offer.

&amp;#x200B;

This was the response I received

&gt;Thank you for your feedback.  LightStream does not offer any fees or late payment penalties, which makes this Truth in Lending Statement ineligible for our Rate Beat program.  
&gt;  
&gt;Thank you,BobbyLightStream

I now have a hard pull against my credit report and support has started ignoring my emails. I just wanted to let everyone know who may be considering a loan through them with the hopes of utilizing this program that if they do not like the rate they have to beat they are likely to just make up more conditions so that you do not qualify.

I don't mind that these conditions exist but they should have definitely included them in the list of conditions. This is list is very clear on what needs to match in order to qualify.

personalfinance,How is my mothers credit card interest payment calculated? We don't get it,"So she owes 5 grand on her credit card with an interest rate of 12%, and we're trying to cut expenses. So we want to ask our neighbor and good friend for a loan (she already offered a while ago) to pay off the credit card and then owe the 5 grand to our neighbor with a much lower interest rate, but still higher than what she's earning from having it sit in a savings account.

personalfinance,Buying a house with a 5% down payment?,"So the other day, my parents and I were talking about housing, renting and the like. I mentioned what we were paying in rent, and they were like ""why don't you buy a home instead? You could be using that money to invest in yourself instead of the landlord."" The same thought is common amongst my work colleagues as well.

 However, we live in a HCOL area (the Bay Area!!) and have recently just started our careers/lives.  Not to mention, we just had a wedding, and just bought a new car (and sold both of our other cars), so our savings have been depleted a bit. Since I spoke to my parents about housing, my thoughts slowly transitioned from ""we will never buy a home as long as we live in the Bay"" to heavily considering buying a condo. 

Now I keep hearing things like ""oh buy now, or else if you wait til these companies go public/ IPO it'll be hard and expensive to get a decent home"" and ""the values of homes in the Bay will increase faster than you can save money"" and ""interest rates are really low right now"" and ""it's a buyer's market right now, soon it will be a seller's market"" from various people, from coworkers to the agent we are working with. The agent we are working with says to just get into a home, just to get into a home, then we can always sell or refinance later. 

Due to our recent expenses, we don't have as much as we should saved for a down payment. I've been working on saving money and budgeting (i.e. spreadsheets), but that's an ongoing thing. For what we are looking for, average condos are about 800,000 to $1million (we are locationally bound to be 1/2 way between our work, and my husband has to take public transportation into the city). Our agent has found a lender that can do 5% down on $1mil. Is this a good idea? Don't want to rush into this too quickly and end up in a bad situation, but our lease is up in June, and would like a bit of comfort that we are making the right decision. 

Here are some details:
Husband - $135k/year
Me - 164k/year
Rent - 3300/month + 150 for utilities
Car - 800/month
Student Loans -400/month, have been putting a lot more towards this lately
Savings - ~70k up for use

Any advice would be great! This is our first time through the process, and this happened pretty quick.

I bought my 2006 Subaru WRX for 10k back in August of 2018. I received a loan from my bank to purchase this vehicle and have loved the car ever since I bought it. The problem lies with my interest rate, it is absolutely fucked. I have about a 30% interest rate on this car, and have no idea how to get it lowered.

Back in November I wrote a check to Harris &amp; Harris for $862.03.  From my statements I see the check is cashed.  I called my bank today and they confirmed the check was cashed.  The CSR and I both looked at a scanned image of the check cannot make out the bank.  A lot of the stamp did not get picked up in the scan.  But there are four lines which we can read clearly:

Our plan is pretty simple. Immediately, we are paying off our credit cards to lighten our credit reports. Once those are clean, then its all hand on deck for the vehicle loan. Yes the interest rate is horrible, I don't need a reminder. We got burnt on the buying processes and its a lesson learned. We needed a vehicle as both of our had pretty much ended their own lives....ugh. Once that loan is done, then we will be tackling my split apart loans to chew through them quickly. Mine are setup for priority through my lenders for the higher interest ones. Once mine are tackled I can commit my entire financial ability towards my wifes condensed loan and we can remove it quickly. By my rough math, not counting tax returns, or pay increases we can have these paid off in around 6 years or so.

Does this plan make sense? Does the time frame sound somewhat close? Anything we should consider?",finance

personalfinance,Need Help Deciding How to Pay Off Student Loans,"I recently graduated college in December with ~54.5k in student loans. I just accepted a job making 65k/yr. My company matches 50% of what I contribute, up to 7%. Meaning if I contribute 14%, they will contribute 7%. I plan on contributing 14% to max the contribution from my company. I need help deciding how I should pay off my student loans. I will lay out my expenses and what not below. 

Monthly Income (after taxes and payroll deductions): $3,923.96

Monthly Expenses: $1,858.33 (shown below)

Rent: $725, Utilities: $75, Food: $200, Gas: $100,
401k: $758.33

Leftover: $2,075.63

I will eventually be getting off my parents car insurance and getting my own, I just don’t know when and will not include that as of now. My health insurance is included in payroll dedications. Internet and TV is included in utilities (very cheap). 

Student Loans: ~26.5k Private Loans and ~28k Federal Loans

These are my Private Loans with Rates
$13,062.85 - 8.625%, $7,249.35 - 8.625,%,$6,049.36 - 11.625%

I plan on refinancing these very soon. The best rates I could find are with Earnest at 5 year plan-5.4%, 7 year plan-5.59%, and 10 year plan-5.66%. 

I have 12 Federal Loans totaling ~28k with rates between 4-5%. 

I have two options that I need help with deciding which is better for my situation: be as aggressive as possible and pay ~$1,100/month for 5 years or do a 10 year plan and pay ~$600/month but pay a chunk of my savings every now and then to cut down the principal.

personalfinance,Do different tax prep services calculate taxes differently?,"I currently have three different jobs, two of which give me a W-2 at the end of the year and the other one giving me a Form 1099. My 1099 income accounts for more than half of my total income, plus I didn't pay any estimated quarterly taxes on it, so I expected that I had to pay some amount rather than receive a refund. However, I put all of my tax information through two different websites and the two amount I have to pay are vastly different.

Now I have read a few threads here on /r/personalfinance about these two companies and I don't really want this to be a discussion about which tax service is better or if one of these companies is ""literally Satan"", I'm just curious if these different services calculate refunds and dues differently. I'm also not too concerned about how much I will have to pay in order to file, seeing as either option is cheaper than hiring an accountant.

That being said, I put all of my tax information through both TurboTax and FreeTaxUSA, answering all the questions to the best of my knowledge and as consistent as possible. After everything was all said and done, the total amount that FreeTaxUSA told me I had to pay for both federal and state was EXACTLY $1,000 LESS than the total amount that TurboTax said I had to pay. 

Now before this year, I was exclusively using TurboTax, so was my prior year's info being used to help calculate this year's taxes? And since this is my first time using FreeTaxUSA, do I need to apply last year's taxes in order to get a more accurate number? 

I guess I'm just worried about submitting incorrect info to the IRS, though on the other hand, I'm not sure if a $1,000 difference would make a blip on their radar. Should I just go ahead and file the FreeTaxUSA return?

Bonus question: Luckily, both sites concluded that I did not have to pay any underpayment penalties for my 1099 income. However, should I start paying quarterly taxes on that income to be safe, or will the taxes withheld from my two W-2 jobs be enough?",finance
worldpolitics,"The Arctic is a territory of peace, stability and cooperation","To facilitate cooperation, coordination, and collaboration between the Arctic states, indigenous communities, and the rest of the inhabitants of the Arctic, in 1996 the Arctic Council was established. It should be recalled that it consists of 8 participating states (Russia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and the United States) and 12 observer states (Germany, the Netherlands, China, etc.). It should be noteed that the Arctic Council is actively working within the framework of six working groups aimed at eliminating pollution in the Arctic, preserving and protecting its flora, fauna and marine environment, and comprehensively developing and improving the living conditions of Arctic communities.

However, the Arctic is now an object of interest for a number of states, which may be the reason for conflict between countries. Due to global warming, ice in the Arctic Ocean is gradually receding and opening up not only access to oil and gas, but also Arctic transport routes, which, according to experts, can become free for shipping all year round, and these are just two of the most important areas: the Northern sea route and the Northwest Passage, which in turn significantly reduce the time for the supply of goods and energy from Asia to Europe and North America.

Russia declares the lack of capacity for conflict and commitment to the development of the Arctic as a territory of peace, stability and cooperation. And in accordance with the Antarctic Treaty of 1959, the Antarctic can be used only for peaceful purposes, all types of military activities are prohibited, all territorial claims of the states in Antarctica are «frozen», only scientific research is allowed in the region.

However, some countries do not pay attention to this and act only in their own interests, trying to «pull the blanket over themselves» and expand their zone of control in the region. Thus, on February 18, 2019, the head of the British Ministry of Defense G. Williamson announced London’s plans to increase its military presence in the Arctic to counter Russia. As Williamson explained, the United Kingdom has adopted a new ten-year program, under which the British marines will be trained together with their Norwegian colleagues. Also, he announced the appearance in the Arctic by 2020 of new anti-submarine aircraft Boeing P-8 Poseidon, which will monitor and deter the Russian Arctic submarine fleet.

But, as is known, Russia's military presence in the Arctic is aimed exclusively at «cleaning» of the Arctic zone of the Russian Federation and ensuring its national security. Furthermore, Russia, in turn, cannot but be disturbed by the situation when a non-Arctic country adopted a military strategy, because this step leads to an escalation of the military-political situation and heightens tensions in a region where low military-political tensions were traditionally maintained.

According to Russian diplomat I. Konovalov, NATO, including the United States, Denmark, the United Kingdom and Norway, is preparing for a big fight for the Arctic, the degree of confrontation is rising, and in the countries of the North Atlantic Alliance they are gradually getting ready to openly make claims to Russia.

However, on March 1, 2018, in a message to the Federal Assembly, President of the Russian Federation V. Putin clearly emphasizes that «Russia is not threatening anyone and is not going to attack anyone ». He noted that Russia's growing military power is a guarantee of peace on the planet. After all, countries belonging to the Arctic Council bear equally great responsibility for the Arctic region, they are equal in matters of its development, a strategy of superiority of any state over others is unacceptable, and even the council itself was created for international interaction between states.",energy

personalfinance,Selling Home to Another Party to Avoid Future Capital Gains Tax,"Hi everyone! I have a complicated question about a home selling/buying situation and capital gains taxes. Let's see if I can explain this...

I bought a house in 2010 for around $155k. I currently owe $65k or so on it. Since I live in an area that experienced a bit of a boom over the past nine years, the value of the home is now around $400k. Yay! It's been my primary residence since then, so I could very easily sell and utilize my 2-year owner occupant status to avoid taxes on the capital gains. Cool!

I've decided that I want to buy a different house in a better neighborhood. I found a great deal on a home, but it was a unique sale that requires cash-only at closing. I'm under contract now, for around $400k; ironically about the same value as my current home. That sale will close at the end of May, so I have some time to figure out how to get that cash...

On top of this, I am recently engaged! We will get married in the fall. I have $100k in cash in the bank, and my fiance has around $40k in her account.

So here's our conundrum... We need to get $400k in cash by the end of May. A hard money lender could be an option, but it's a world we're not super familiar with and would rather avoid if possible. We could sell my current residence and be fine, assuming that sale would take place before our closing date on the new house. But we'd rather hold on to the current property and use it as a rental...

So we have an idea: what if i sold my current property to my fiance? I'm not sure how much she could be approved for when it comes to the loan, but if we could get $400k in cash between that sale and our current liquid assets we could use that to buy the new house AND keep the current house as a rental!

My main question is what tax consequences would this have when it comes time to file as a married couple next year, since our wedding is in the fall? Could I still avoid the capital gains taxes if I sold the house to my future spouse (who would be my full spouse when it comes time to file taxes)? Would it just be a matter of not filing jointly that first year?

In addition, if my fiance did purchase my current house, would she need to call it an investment property instead of a primary residence (even though she currently just rents and doesn't own a house of her own yet)? Would that require a higher interest rate? What if she claimed it was her current residence but never ended up living in it?

If this is a bad idea for some reason, is there a better way of doing this? Creating an LLC and selling to that entity, perhaps? Could I sell my current house *to myself and my fiance, combined,* and still claim the capital gains tax exemption? Is that a crazy question or what?

The amount of equity in my home is significant, and if I start renting it out without resetting my basis first, I'm going to lose the ability to avoid a large tax bill after a few years. Let me know your advice, reddit! (And I know I probably need to speak to a tax expert about this, but I thought I'd throw it out there because I like reading this sub and getting ideas, even if I have to double check to see whether it's good advice or not!)

personalfinance,"What happens if I paid most of my taxes for 2017, but didn't file a return for that year yet?","I'm self employed (a remote worker consultant), as a single member LLC. I'm in the process of figuring out my return for the 2018 year. However, last year I did not file my return for 2017.

Long story short, I procrastinated on my 2017 taxes, and it took me a long time to compile all of my expense and income records for the year (days digging trough piles of receipts). By the time the deadline hit I still wasn't done.

I had already paid a portion as estimated taxes for Q1 2017. However, I didn't make any other estimated payments.  I crunched the numbers myself in a spreadsheet I made, and came up with a pretty close estimate of the remainder I would owe for the year...including the underpayment of est taxes penalty.

I paid the remaining balance estimate as a direct pay on the IRS site, as a request for Extension. I figured I'd get everything over to my CPA ASAP to get the return filed...and I had until October now.

Well, some things happened in my life, and I kept putting off organizing all of the docs the CPA would need. My friend had talked me into trying my hat at some Cryptocurrency day trading....and I got caught off guard realizing I had to analyze every single trade I did, on platforms that didn't have any built in tax reporting features. It was super tedious, and I never felt like I had time to do it.

 Now its April 4th 2019, and I'm 5+ months past last year's Oct extension deadline.

I'm confused what happens now. Theres a lot of guidance about what happens if you don't pay or file your taxes. Theres not a lot of information about what happens if you pay your taxes but don't file a return when you owe money.

I think I paid a majority of it, but theres a chance I still owe a few hundred dollars more federally once the CPA is done. I also didn't pay anything towards state taxes yet.

I've actually put off filing this year now because I'm so embarrassed I let this happen. My CPA is a family friend of my dad's, and I fear that he would tell him how bad I screwed up (which would lead to my father stressing out and a lecture).

But I just want to get everything paid for and over with for 2017 and 2018, so I'm going to find a different CPA. Just wondering what to expect.",finance

personalfinance,First-Time Home Buyer -- Tapping long-term savings to avoid PMI?,"Hi PF, my spouse and I have been saving and looking for our first home for the past several months and we're about to put in an offer. I'm penciling things out and had the following quandary.

&amp;#x200B;

We've saved enough for a roughly 12% down payment on the home in cash (plus or minus accounting for closing costs). The property is well within our means and we have a comfortable emergency budget that would cover our expenses for about 6 months if we both lost our jobs, more if we stretched it. I don't want to touch it for this purchase. 

&amp;#x200B;

We don't really want to put making a purchase off another year (to save up more for a down payment) for a whole variety of reasons, mostly personal. But we also know that interest rates are good right now. Our student debt's nearly gone (under $10k), we're financially and career stable and have good incomes for this area. The home we're looking at is well, well within our budget based on all the calculators we've used and we had no issue being prequalified. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm wondering if it would be fiscally prudent to dip into what I consider long-term savings to close that 8% and avoid paying PMI. I would do this by selling some index funds (not tax advantaged, in a straight brokerage account -- 401k and IRA would be untouched). I've always considered these funds as set aside for retirement, but seeing as this would be a relatively small percentage of those overall funds, and not involve tax advantaged money / incur penalties other than capital gains taxes, I'm feeling it makes sense in the long run. Not to mention the market's on good footing right now, so my investments have grown nicely.

&amp;#x200B;

My rough math says this would take about $20k out of my savings, which is about 7.5% of the overall value of my long-term savings portfolio. It would probably take us a couple years to simply pay down the loan to the level we could remove PMI. So we'd be saving at least $3,000 by avoiding it, perhaps more, and it would free that money up to pump back into savings.

&amp;#x200B;

My gut says this is a good move and a reasonable ROI for that $20k by way of avoided cost. This account for the cost of any tax event created by the liquidation. What say PF? Is this thinking sound or am I missing something?",finance

personalfinance,"What should I use my income for first (retirement,savings,debt)?","Hello everyone! I am using a throwaway because I really am not a fan of talking about money and my other account is a little too not anonymous for me for this topic. Anyways. 

&amp;#x200B;

My husband and I have lived comfortably off his income for a while now, maybe not as much left over for saving as we would like, but for the situation it was good. I just got 2 jobs (one a month ago and the other just recently). However, neither of us really want to use my income on us. Like I said before, we are quite comfy where we are, if anything we will spend like another $100 a month on subscription services we want but don't have currently. We want to use it for bettering our financial situation.

&amp;#x200B;

Our situation is like this:

&amp;#x200B;

\- Debt 

&amp;#x200B;

$25,000 car loan. 2.75% interest rate. Minimum payment is $450 a month, we are currently paying $250 biweekly.

&amp;#x200B;

$25,000 student loans. Variable interest rates per loan, average is 5%. These are in my name, however my parents are paying them off. I have considered helping to pay them off though, as I know my mom is putting off retirement to pay for mine and my brothers educations. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Savings 

&amp;#x200B;

Current balance is $27,000. This is for an emergency fund and to cover my husbands medical issue if it decides to flare again. He needs treatment quickly, which means they need money quickly so we decided to leave a nice buffer in savings in case that happened. Our OOP max for insurance is $17,000 which we could hit quite easily. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Retirement

&amp;#x200B;

I know this is a big no no but right now I'm not sure how much we have in retirement, he can look that number up later though if you really need it. I only know that he puts in 10% into his 401k. This is a nice start, but if we have extra money it just makes sense to put it into retirement to me, I don't want to work forever.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Some other extraneous factors to our financial situation that are probably important to mention

&amp;#x200B;

My husbands job is being phased out within the year. He has already started putting feelers out and will be given 60 day notice to when it actually happens. We have considered him getting a new job before then, but he will get a nice severance package if he doesn't so we are weighing those options right now. Hopefully he won't be without a job at all, but its always a possibility and something we need to be ready for. In this case, my income covers our monthly expenses with virtually nothing left over. 

&amp;#x200B;

We plan on having children in the near future. We want my husbands job to be a bit more stable but plan to start trying around the end of 2020. Just want to plan for the delivery costs and taking some unpaid time off. But I'm thinking that should be an after we pay off debt thing since it is 18 or so months away and we have the debt gaining interest now. 

&amp;#x200B;

I will need a new car soon, probably 3-6 months. I don't mean new new, obviously getting a used car, but new to me. My car is on its last leg. So I was thinking of putting a little more into savings for that.

&amp;#x200B;

So what would you do? Pay off debt first? Do half into debt half into retirement? Put some into savings? Any other suggestions? Should my husband raise his 401k %? Also obviously there are limits for putting into retirement (unfortunately I don't have employer sponsored plans) so after those are hit should we invest it? Whatever you think would be helpful! I'm just looking for suggestions because I honestly don't know what the best course of action would be, we have never really thought about our finances all that much but with all the extra money we have now I figured we should start.

personalfinance,Trying to remove PMI from my mortgage payment - would love more information if you have any,"So I've been lurking for awhile now and have started to actively pursue removing PMI (~~$250~~ $167) on my monthly payments  thanks to some recommendations for this sub (thanks everyone!). According to my lender, it will be removed at the 80% amortization value, but according to my calculations that isn't for another 5-6 years. They wrote back and told me that I need to meet a LTV of 75% or less - and I need to have an appraisal done to confirm this. Once this is complete - I can continue the PMI cancellation process (I should get more information from them as to what still needs to happen).

First question - they made it seem like i have to pay THEM to complete the appraisal. Can I use another company to do this, or do I need to pay them the roughly $425 as they are asking? Is it pretty standard to have your lender do the appraisal?

Second question - from some ""really high tech online research"" I pulled appraisals from the major online reality sites and estimated appraisals for my house are averaging out to  about $13.3K MORE than what we need to meet the 75%. Is this a meh, good, or great sign? How reliable might this be compared to the actual appraisal? We live in a pretty established, well kept neighborhood. Houses that are currently selling are going for more than market value, and I feel this is pretty accurate, and our house is in good shape. If this is accurate,  I'd like to take advantage of this now, in case prices begin to drop for whatever reason.

Third question - I understand this may require more data to determine, but would it be better/more advantageous for us to just refinance in hopes of getting rid of the PMI and possibly lower our payments?

EDIT - was looking at escrow MI not the PMI - correct PMI is $167

EDIT 2 - UPDATE - So I reached out again to what I thought was my Loan Company - LoanCare. Apparently that's not the case. LoanCare is a company that does the paperwork. numbers, etc, for my actual company QRL. I met with my bank, who uses QRL for their mortgages (which is who mine was sold to), and my rep says she has had good experience in working directly with QRL (not with LoanCare) to remove things like PMI. She is currently working with her partner at QRL to possibly go forward with an Automated Appraisal at my behalf, as real estate in our area is booming, and they have had a lot of requests like this.   
I really appreciate everyone's input and suggestions, and I'm just currently waiting to hear back from them. At best - they can do the automated appraisal and we'll see where we stand. At worst - they'll make me pay for the $425 appraisal, and we'll see where we stand. Hoping for an appraisal of at least $290K. Once we have the appraisal we'll know where we stand with PMI (my main goal) and also with a possible refinance (not likely because of interest rates).",finance

I've made some bad decisions with credit cards over the last few years that has caused me to be in some serious debt. I took a loan out a few years ago to clear up one of the cards but I ended up racking it back up. I'm not even sure how I got to this point (well I do really) and on my way to work today thinking about what I was going to post here I thought about how I let this even happen and how did I not get it under control sooner. Now I have two cards right that are about maxed out and I have been making the minimum payments for quite a while but they both have high interest rates. I just don't know what to do anymore.

Car: $22900 @ 5.8% (I just refinanced my car to lower my payment about $80 the previous rate was 12%)

&amp;#x200B;

I make just under $70k a year and after taxes, insurance, etc. My monthly take home is $3520 (sometimes I can work OT and get a bit more) and my budget is as follows

Mortgage: $1885

Car: $441

Card 1: $265 (Minimum)

Card 2: $220 (Minimum)

Card 3: $29 (Minimum)

Personal Loan: $235

Utilities: $180 (This will go down come spring/summer)

Water: $40

\------------------------------------------------

I've never missed a payment or have been late on anything and my credit score is decent surprisingly (725). I spoke with my bank to try and get another loan to clear up the debt that I currently have with the two maxed out cards. They approved me for a loan @ 10.25% for 5 years (which would be a monthly payment of about $322) with the stipulation that they would write the checks to the card companies and close the accounts. I am all for this with Card 2 but Card 1 is my longest open account (about 7 years) and highest credit limit. I'm worried that this will cause my score to take a big hit. However, I understand that doing this will take away any ability to rack those debts back up. This has been a huge learning experience and I can say that I have definitely learned my lesson and won't let this happen again. My head has been all over the place because of this and my stress levels have never been higher and it's really beginning to effect my over all quality of life. I have a lot of things coming up that I need to pay for and I feel like I'm finally at a breaking point where I will have to start deciding what gets paid and what doesn't each month. As a side note though I do have something to look forward to. I've been with my ""company"" for a  number of years and I have starting looking at what others in a similar environment make (between $79k-$85k). I spoke with my boss and explained this and they have said that I will receive a raise. But I'm not sure what it will be yet or when I will get it.

I was looking into taking out a home equity line of credit to pay for this expense. The interest rate will be ~4-5%. I have the money to cover this repair in my emergency savings which is currently earning 2% interest.

I'm coming here because I'm not sure where else to go, and people give really great advice here. I'm just not really sure how I should approach this. I hope this isn't a lot to read.  I'm 28.

I graduated a couple of years ago with a degree in Mathematics. I really really do wish schools would of taught more about finance, loans, credit cards, etc in school. I'm completely oblivious, eager to learn, and want to reduce my debt. It's like I see all these numbers, percentages, etc, and I know it shouldn't confuse me, but it just intimidates me to where I shut down. I do contract work for a super large internet provider as a designer. So, like most people, I use my degree, but not really. Hell, It took me a little over a year to nail this gig after graduation. I only got it because of a family friend who stuck their neck out for me. Thankfully this company didn't demand 3 years of experience prior to graduation. I'm not on hourly anymore, and I'm on unit based. There isn't as much work as there used to be, and I'm wondering if I should move jobs.

I'm a little under 50K in student loan debt. A little under half are fed loans, and the other half private. I was 2K in debt in community college, then I went to university, and my debt skyyyyyrocketed. I have about 6K in another loan and CC debt. I make a little over 50K a year and pay about 450 a month in rent. I have less than 5 dollars in my savings. Every time I get paid...I see the majority of my money go for the loan payments, on top of car insurance, etc. Even then, most of the time, I make the minimum payment. I'm trying to get rid of my CC debt first, because that has the highest interest rate, so, I usually pay more than the minimum for that. It's just so disheartening to make a 600 dollar payment, and interest comes and takes the majority. I'm not trying to complain, but I just know a lot of people here have similar stories.

I'd like to get a second job, but my girlfriend and I don't seem to think that's a good idea. We don't get to spend that much time together due to our schedules, and me getting a second job will probably eliminate that all together. We've been together for two years, and live together, and I don't want to throw what we have away. We go out to eat sometimes, but we normally cook at home to save money.

&amp;#x200B;

I need to make a better budget than just saying hey put x here and x there. I just feel like I'm stuck, and I don't have any financial freedom.

I'm just trying to figure out what would be the best way to pay off this debt. Should I consolidate? I've called the student loan people, and they can't lower my monthly payments any more than they have already, which is crazy. Should I consider a different profession? I don't really have anything to sell. I drive a beater. Is investing/playing stock market a good idea? I have a 401k account as well, but parents tell me to forget that even exists and leave it alone.

personalfinance,Question regarding paycheck/taxes,"Hey ya’ll,

I’m hoping someone here can give me some advice. I just received my first bi-weekly check and the break down is as follows: 

Gross pay: $2,216.80
Net pay: $1,537.34

Fed income tax: $396.70
Social security tax: $137.50
Medicare: $32.15
AZ State income tax: $113.11

Number of allowances: 2 (single with one job)

I’m confused as to why when I received my weekly paycheck two weeks ago (my start week did not fall on the bi weekly schedule so I was paid for the first week only), my federal income tax was just $65.51 (gross pay $1,110.48). So why the jump from $65.51 for weekly to $396.70 for bi weekly? Just seems like a whole lot more to me. 

Any advice is appreciated, thank you.",finance
personalfinance,Received a large tuition reimbursement.

I'm wondering what the best thing to do with this money would be. I'm already back to being employed full time (about $17.50 per hour). Would it be unwise to use some of the money to setup an emergency fund or buy a cheap used car to get around more easily (I have neither)?

personalfinance,Opening a Roth before starting MD-PhD grad school?,"This summer, I (25) am starting an 8-year MD-PhD program (on scholarship: tuition is covered, and I get \~32k stipend every year for living). I am currently working a high-paying (for me lololol) short-term consulting job (lower 6 figures) and wondering what best to do with the money before I start.

&amp;#x200B;

Debt:

I have about \~10k in student loan payments (2.5k don't accrue interest when I start grad school, the other 7.5k in chunks of about 2.5k have interest rates of 3.3, 3.8, and 4.3%).

&amp;#x200B;

Retirement accounts:

I have about 3k in a 403b from my last job. I do not have a 401k/403b from my current job (there's no matching anyway and a few other reasons why it didn't make sense for me to enroll).

While in grad school, I don't have earned income, so I can't contribute to retirement accounts (or so is my understanding).

&amp;#x200B;

My plan:

1) Make sure I have enough for a 5k e-fund, and to pay for beginning of school expenses (new laptop, moving, housing deposits, etc.).

2) Open up a Roth. Max it out for my earned income from my job last year before the window expires (my understanding I have 16 months from the time I left that job to do so?). Roll over my 403(b).

3) Pay off the 4.3% loan.

4) Over the next year, contribute to the Roth (6k) for my earned income for this year.

5) Pay off rest of loans as quickly as possible (while maintaining QOL to focus on my studies).

6) Save up liquid cash for medical residency applications, buying a new car, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Questions:

A) How does this general plan sound?

B) I was thinking of using a robo-managed account for the Roth, through Betterment or something similar. I want to be as hands off as possible. Good idea?

C) How high-risk should I go? 

D) There is a small chance I could find a decent mortgage while in grad school. I don't particularly want the stress of owning a house, but would it be better to save money for a potential down-payment instead of putting it in a retirement account?

I stream to twitch, I use Pretzel for background music, I use OBS for broadcasting and overlays and I use an external 4 channel 3 bus mixer for my Mic preamp and phantom power to the condenser mic. I want to be able to twiddle a seperate knob on my mixer for each audio source. One for system sounds, one for pretzel music, one for mic, and one for the feedback from OBS to monitor audio as it is being broadcasted. 

As of right now I have a very messy convoluted way of doing things. I use Voicemeter Potato and an old decrepit Tapco USB DAC along side my computers build in audio card with the external mixer to get a desired effect. except I have to control volume levels for different software sources using a midi controller and OBS's built in audio mixer. Its nasty. I only get 16bit audio and the latency sucks... Not to mention it sometimes falls apart and software crashes because I have to have 7 different programs running to support all this.

Solution: Can't we virtually route stereo audio out through the unused surround sound channels? A program that creates a virtual end point that can be selected as an audio device in any software and routes the audio out through one of the 4 audio jacks? The sound card would see it as 7.1 audio being fed in, but the software would see 4 separate ""virtual"" audio cards. I feel like Voicemeter could do this but it falls short with no way to mix in 7.1 audio channels.",technology
personalfinance,"no debt, baby on the way, toddler in-tow, decent income-- little savings. buy a house and take advantage of the market, or build savings and wait?","Hi everyone! ISO wisdom.

Spouse and I have virtually zero debt. We also have a toddler and a baby on the way. I opened my first credit card less than a year ago and have an excellent credit score so far. Spouse has great credit score from paying off student debt. We loosely follow Dave Ramsey's principles of paying for our lives in cash and only use my credit card for things we'd buy with the cash we earn.

We currently both work but we will go down to one income when baby number 2 arrives, and for the long term. This won't cause us financial pain, though it will cause us to save less. Our savings isn't much at the moment but is fairly decent-- it's not up to the 3-month mark-- but will be about there by the time baby number two gets here.

We've been renting for the past 5 years and have moved 4 times during that time frame. Needless to say, we're ready to settle, especially with another kiddo on the way. Our current lease is up soon and we're trying to decide on what to do.... they're going to jack up our rent (surprise, surprise) regardless of the length of the lease, should we choose to go that route. However, we feel like in the long term it makes more sense to buy a house while the interest rates are relatively low and make payments that are equal-to or less-than the rent we pay... but is that the best thing to do right now? With the first time homebuyer programs around, we would be able to receive down payment assistance and tax credits and that sort of thing, but the process would no doubt wipe our savings.

My question is, part of me feels like it would be wiser to put what we have in savings in a high interest savings account for another year or so and suck up the cost of rent until we're a little bit more stable. However, we wonder if in the long run we'd pay less money for a home if we take advantage of the current low-ish interest rates.

tl;dr: no debt, decent income, baby on the way-- should we buy a home or wait and earn interest on the savings we're building?",finance
personalfinance,State Standard Deduction Confusion,"I have been looking at my withholdings on my state (DC) and federal taxes and I wanted to run a question past you guys before I adjusted anything.  

Some background: I work in DC currently, but I will only have this DC job for 6 months before I move outside DC for a different job.  According to the DC website, ""the District standard deduction conforms to the federal standard deduction"" i.e. $12,000 for a single person with no dependents like myself.   

So I was looking at the taxes I have been paying and I noticed that I have been paying as if I would make my full year salary of \~$60k as opposed to the \~$30k I will make in the 6 months I will actually be working in DC.   So I am going to adjust that so I do not pay DC double what I have to in taxes.   

My question is, how does that $12,000 DC standard deduction work?  As far as I can tell it has not been factored into what my employer has been subtracting for DC taxes so far...

CryptoCurrency,A Message To Cardano: Sell People Progress!,"What inspired me to write this post is seeing how Cardano reddit channel is desperately trying to convince its crowd that it's a beautiful/promising project over, and over again. The last post I saw of them included lots and lots of extremely technical trading charts/algorithms.

I do not doubt whatsoever that Cardano will be something one day. I am however not pleased with their strategy to continuously post about news that do not sell just to put their hodlers crowd in the fridge and avoid being over sold.

I will cut to the chase here. Their last post mentioned a lot of what complex chart signals mean for Cardano. Trading the charts as of math and algorithms works to some extent but I believe it's mainly a representation of people's emotions and beliefs. So the true source, power and motivation behind mass buying or selling are the beliefs and emotions of people. It's not the frequency of reddit posts or the math behind the charts that will dictate where Cardano's project will end or what price ADA will reach.

People are fed up of eating news, they want to eat progress. That's why EOS ecosystem is booming while ADA is not. Cardano is not the only coin that follows this frequent ""news"" strategy many do. But those projects who really attract buyers are those who feed actual progress to the people. If Charles does good deeds in Africa, that's great but it's not a selling point of progress for the entire project. It's just selling a utopic impression of the project founder/leader.

When I look at my EOS wallet every now and then, I find new tokens/projects all being built on EOS. I go to [dappradar.com](https://dappradar.com) I see a flood of EOS projects. When I look at YouTube most of those who talk about EOS talk about progress being made on the blockchain from the technological side. As for Cardano, it was the same message last year that it is today.. that it's a 3rd generation blockchain that will reign over all chains. Progress? Oh, it will be peer reviewed. That's very methodical and scientific but it seems that Charles needs to practice some dictatorship to get things done his way. Isn't that why he left Ethereum in the first place to do things his way? Then just do it, because waiting forever isn't working.

I thank God now that sold all my ADA at 0.2 when I was still at a loss buying it @ 0.4 USD. But I am more than willing to buy again if I only see a sign of progress. Cardano is a very clear example of the original message I intend to deliver here to any project that is willing to succeed. Do not sell people empty news or math charts that simply represent what people believe. Sell people progress, because only that counts and increases the value of your project and eventually the coin/token that represents it.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Approaching last year of college and worried about debt,"First time posting here.
Im currently earning my bachelor's degree in nursing and have 52k in debt right now. 
Situation:
I took an extra year of school and it is an expensive school, and the cheapest place I found to live is $700/month with a roommate. Ive applied for so many scholarships and have not gotten any, I applied for more nursing specific ones this semester and I'm hoping. Given that my parents make over 200k and I am not in a minority group or disadvantaged it is hard to find any real financial help. It is the only bachelor's in nursing program in the area (the other one in this state is even more pricy) 
I do have a little bit of money from federal aid, but like I said, they wouldn't give me much, and most loans come from my private bank.
By the end of the nursing degree I will have roughly 80k.
Nursing jobs here typically  start at $32/hour for graveyard shift and ive heard there is lots of opportunities for OT, plus all the hospitals here (5 of them) have new graduate programs.
One hospital I am looking at advertises that it will pay 2400 a year towards student loans for full time employees (200 a month). 

With a 20 year repayment plan I am looking at 800-900 a month in loan payments (plan to refinance and pay off sooner when salary increases, which it does for most nurses here) . Rent here will be split with someone else so it should stay around 700.
I have no other expenses, car is paid for and insurance paid for by my parents, phone paid for by parents, internet included with apt, and health insurance at most hospitals is around $40-$50/paycheck.
I plan to start low with my 401k at 2-5% and increase it as my salary increases.
I am planning on around 150 a month for my half of utilities (right now it is only 50, I added a buffer in case I move)
If I work a 36 hour week, take home roughly 1650 every 2 weeks after taxes and deductions, and every two weeks pay roughly 900 of that (700 rent plus 150 utilities second half of month) , leaving me 750 every 2 weeks, and 150 into savings every 2 weeks - does 600 every 2 weeks of spending money seem feasible? 
Or should I plan on likely picking up a second job, as nurses typically work 3x a week? 

Im really stressed about this, but I know this is the only way for me to get my BSN, and I want to do grad school someday, so BSN is important.. 

Thank you 😊

Edit: interest rate on loans is average 8.75 percent, loan calculator says private loan payment will be 700 per month but I added in the 170 loan payment for federal loans (which are 5 percent interest at 10 year repayment) and rounded to 800-900.",finance

personalfinance,Student Loans vs. Roth IRA - Who Should Win?,"My wife (23) and I (25) just got married and started two new jobs in the city, with a combined income of about 150k per year. We are also sitting on about 70k in student loans.

We have recently opened up Roth IRAs - I maxed out my contributions in 2016 and 2017, but she just started hers last month.

The average interest rate on her 70k in loans is about 4.7%.

I think that covers the basics. The question is - ***where should our first paychecks go towards?***

Intuitively, it seems like maxing out our Roth IRA (for 2018, since we still have a week do so) would have a huge payout over the rest of our lives because we plan on maxing it out EVERY year (so ""missing out"" on paying for 2018 would have a compounding effect).

1.  What questions should I ask during this phone call?

It performs well enough right now that I do not anticipate needing to use any of the principal and most likely won't need to use much of the interest once I graduate and start working full time again this summer

3. How likely do you think it is that if I tried to go it alone, or with the help of a financial advisor, I would end up getting boned with taxes?  Or put another way, how much do you think the amount of tax currently being paid is optimized?

If I'm only planning on staying in the US for 3-4 more years, which option should I take? There's a chance I'll stay longer but worst case, I'll only be in the US for the near-term. I just don't want to break any rules or be hit with a large tax when I move back. How do IRA's work if I want the money early?

personalfinance,Question about Tbills (US),"I have been looking at treasury bills to get a foot in the door with low risk investing. I have been looking around and haven't been able to find a straight forward answer to how some aspects of Tbills work. Looking at trasurydirect.com I see treasury bills have a high rate and an investment rate listed, what are the difference between these two numbers and are they equatable to an interest rate? So if a 4-week Tbill has a 2.4% investment rate, does that mean if you purchase a $10,000 security it will be worth $10,240 at the end of the four weeks?",finance
personalfinance,Contribute more towards a Roth ira and pay minimum on student loans or pay down student loans,"Hello all,

My girlfriend is trying to pay down her student loans. Currently, she has student loans of approximately $47K at an average interest rate of 6.5%. She pays them down aggressively right now at $300 over her minimum payment. Would it be better for pay minimums on her line and put it into a Roth IRA or just continue paying down her debt aggressively? I personally hate debt and have been advising her to pay her debt down as fast as she can. Also, at current levels the markets appear overvalued (Shiller p/e at it’s 3rd highest point in history) and I believe she is safer just continuing to pay it down. Our close friends think otherwise, that starting a Roth IRA and paying the debt down later is a better for money growth. I’m not sure what to do after speaking with them. It would be great to get some recommendations as to what to do with her money to set her up as best as possible for the future.",finance
stocks,Combined daily &amp; themed posts for r/Stocks and new time! + today's Daily Discussion &amp; Fundamentals Friday,"I updated our 3 themed posts so that they're combined with the daily discussion.  This way we're not cutting off the daily conversation with the themed conversations and gives more time to the theme.

Another thing I did was set the post to launch at 3am eastern (4am during daylight savings), this gives our stock traders &amp; investors in the rest of the world (Australia, Europe, and anyone who speaks English) time to post comments related to stocks and participate in the themes while also making sure it doesn't start too early for our users on the west coast (12am &amp; 1am pacific time respectively).

I know this will single out Alaska, for example Monday's daily discussion post will start Sunday at 11pm &amp; 12am Alaska time and Hawaii 9pm &amp; 10pm Hawaii time, so the best I can say is sorry, but I'm sure you guys are used to it already.

Sorry to everyone in Australia, Europe and anyone who speaks English who participated in the these daily &amp; themed posts and never got any responses, now the new time will solve that issue.

Thanks to everyone who have participated in the past and who make r/Stocks a serious, helpful, and informative place to discuss stocks.

I know I posted this late for Australia, but for everyone else who is awake, here's today's daily discussion &amp; fundamentals Friday:

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

See the following word cloud and click through for the wiki:

personalfinance,Financing a car: joint or individual?,"I am currently a full-time graduate student and my car is on its last legs. When I graduate in a year and start working I will be buying a new (used) car and putting about 30% down. My credit score has been ""very good"" for years, but my climbing student loan balances are causing it to drop, so I don't expect to be able to get a decent interest rate on the loan. My husband has been financing his car for the past 2 years and has little student debt, so his credit score is in better shape. When financing our new (used) car next year, should we take out a joint loan, or should he (or I) just do it individually?

investing,4/5/2019 Two Harbors Investment (REIT) 10-K Recap,"Two Harbors Investment, a real estate investment trust, filed its latest 10-KA filings for 2018 on 4/4/2019. Below is a quick recap on things we felt essential to review.

&amp;#x200B;

**MD&amp;A Recap**  


* TWO Harbor's management team highlighted their expectations in more graduate home price increases, albeit at a slower rate, better than expected market conditions, and Fed ceases raising rates.
* Key highlights include completion of the acquisition of CYS, which help increased its market cap and improved its liquidity.
* Shift in strategic allocation, moving capital from Agency RMBS into MRS and non-Agency securities. Agency Residential mortgage-backed security is considered less risky. This move tells us that TWO is seeing better investment opportunities and perhaps inefficiency in mortgage-related securities offered via non-agency. 
* Note the increases in float income was directly related to increases in the size of MSR and higher earning rates.
* Due to the acquisition of CYS, the management agreement was amended to (i) reduce management fee (ii) $17.5 million to CYS for a one-time downward adjustment of Pine River's management fees

**Risk Factors Recap**  


* CYS may not qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes and could cause adverse tax consequences.
* Dodd-Frank Act has rolled back critical provisions in 2018, easing mortgage regulations on the small and medium size. 
* Added verbiage on FED and its further reduction in reinvestment or outright sales of its securities portfolio and its actions' effects such as causing agency RMBS price to decline further and increase market volatility.
* Added verbiage on the nature of MRS and its illiquid nature in economic downturn and dependence on the external valuation of the MSR collateral.",finance

personalfinance,"Promised raise, offer letter, incentives package detail, etc. Received nothing. What do I do?","Hey guys, hope you're doing well this morning. I am having a hard time dealing with my boss/company in an orderly manner without getting fed up and just quitting, so I wanted to see what you all would do in my situation. 

I have been working for my current company for around a 1 1/4 years, and everything was going pretty well until our new CFO joined (my boss). I've dealt with some bullshit I don't want to go into, but there has been confusion/lies about my payroll in the company. To preface everything, my boss is also the head of HR as well. 

In November, I mentioned to my boss that my incentive package was never clearly ironed out, and I was not given a quarterly bonus in Q3. He said he would iron out an offer letter for me detailing this. I still have never received the new offer letter, even after reminding and bringing it up at least 4 times within the last few months. 

On 3/11, I had my performance review (2 months late btw - sorry, I'm a bit mad) and was told that I would be getting a raise. I thought alright great. 2 weeks go by (paid biweekly), and my boss mentions that he initiated the raise and my quarterly bonus. Awesome! I get a big check, and all is right in the world. I wake up this morning and check my pay stub, and I actually am now receiving LOWER than before. I did just do a new W4 with new deductions (I forgot to do state tax like an idiot), so the explanation is that the raise was never actually put into the system. 

Now, I'm very sick and tired of the BS he has put me through these last few months. However, I still need a job to pay the bills and am very aggressively interviewing (I have one later today actually). How do I bring this up to him in a manner that things will actually get done? My boss is one of the most forgetful people I have ever met in my life, but the fact that he said 2x that the raise is in and I would be receiving it is coming off as purposeful. 

TL;DR Boss has made a lot of empty promises in terms of my pay and incentive structure. I've had enough of it, and want to know what to do.",finance
personalfinance,Credit card Interest,"I’m heated at the moment.

To backstory, I paid very much attention to my debts this year and really started cracking down on them.

For the Citi CC, I was under the impression that interest is charged based on the principal balance at the time of my closing billing period (23 calendar days after the new cycle begins).

We will give some scenarios here to shed light:

Card: Citi
Interest: 17.49%

New Billing cycle is every Month on the 5th.

I had 6100 in balance March 5th. I made a payment of 600 March 8th. New Balance of 5500. We had some extra funds around and decided to make another payment of 4500, bringing the balance to 1000 even. Closing statement came in last night saying I was charged $47 in interest based on a 3411 balance. I was skeptic so I called Citi CS. They gave me a break down of how they calculate interest. I had conflicting information from previous reps in the past. I had the call escalated to an account Manager to further explain in numbers (the reps weren’t doing a good job explaining in detail where the 3411 balance-interest came from other than repeating the previous 30 days of daily interest).

This whole time I was under the impression that the balance come the closing of the billing period, that is where they calculated the interest on the principal AT THE TIME of the closing period. In this example: the 1000 balance I had.

I’m trying to understand this better. I’m having trouble visualizing the recent interest charge and the balance they used for this past cycle.

This is their statement on how interest is calculated:

About Interest Charges
How We Calculate Interest. We calculate it separately for each balance shown in the Interest Charge Calculation table. We use the daily balance method (including new transactions). We figure the interest charge by multiplying
the daily balance by its daily periodic rate each day in the billing period. To get a daily balance, we take the balance at the end of the previous day, add the interest on the previous day’s balance and new charges, subtract new credits or payments, and make adjustments. The Balance Subject to Interest Rate is the average of the daily balances.
Minimum Interest Charge. If a minimum interest charge applies to your account, it will be at least $0.50.
How to Avoid Paying Interest on Purchases. Your due date is at least 23
days after the close of each billing period. We will not charge you any interest on purchases if you pay your New Balance by the due date each month. This is called a grace period on purchases. If you do not pay the New Balance in full by the due date, you will not get a grace period on purchases until you pay the New Balance in full for two billing periods in a row. We will begin charging interest on cash advances and balance transfers on the transaction date.",finance

personalfinance,Buy or rent &amp; save over the next 4-5 years? Also a sanity check on home costs,"Hi PF,

My fiance just got accepted to a top-ranked professional school and we are looking at either buying a house in town or continuing to rent for the next 4-5 years. I work in IT and make 95k/yr (expected ~7.5k bonus which I do not factor into my calculations), she will be working part time during school and contributing ~600/mo toward rent/utilities etc.


Renting: 

* We currently rent a nice 2b/2ba 1100 sqft apartment for 1500/mo, utilities are fairly cheap

* There are some issues with new management so we may stay or move to another community or a private landlord/house if we decide to keep renting

* Rental budget would be between 1500-1900 depending on size/location/etc. 


Buying:

* I have access to a VA loan (debating USAA vs Navy Fed vs Vet United) and will be fully funding the home (I do not want to dig into my emergency fund for a downpayment)

* Area is low-moderate CoL but home prices are pretty high (median around 450k), taxes for homes in our range are under 2k/yr

* We are looking between 300-350k, but some of the nicer homes up to 365/370 have no HoA dues (many houses in our range are part of 'pop-up communities') which balances monthly payments


Looking at the upper end of our budget (say 365k), VA loan calcs put PITI + VA funding at ~2100/mo, which seems reasonable and would allow me to save monthly for maintenance and other house costs as well as building my personal savings. I am currently contributing 6% to my company 401k to get the full 4.5% match. I have fully-paid CC's every month and owe under 5k on my 2016 car.

Also worth noting is we hope to move back to a HCOL region after school is finished, so my big concern is having enough savings for downpayments in an even more competitive area (plus extra student loans for my partner). Are we reaching for homes from a price standpoint? Would renting and saving be a more advisable option?",finance

personalfinance,"Wait two year to buy, Rent, or USDA loan?","Hi everyone.  


This is a throwaway account because I don't really want financial information tied to my main account.  


I'm in my mid-twenties I recently graduated into an high-demand field with tons of jobs in the area and I now make about $53,000 a year. My current expenses are minimal and I am able to set aside about $1200 every biweekly paycheck. As of now I only have a couple thousand saved up because there were a few things that I needed to buy when I started my new job.  


I live at home, which is alright. I have to share a room with my brother for half the year, when he's back from college. It's a pain with other people being around because I work nights and have to sleep during the day. I also only have one room that everything I own has to go in. It's about a twenty-five minute drive to work, which isn't too bad but it easily balloons to 45 minutes during winter months. Overall it's an okay situation. It could be better, but it's hardly bad or anything.  


The only debt I currently have is $9000 from the federal subsidized loan program. I have health insurance covered through my job as well as quite a few other benefits. 

&amp;#x200B;

My significant other and I would like to get married sometime over the next two years. We've been together for over half a decade now. We're both ready for it, but the biggest roadblock is the living situation. 

&amp;#x200B;

Right now I'm trying to figure out my living situation. At this point in time it's definitely unrealistic to think about purchasing using a traditional mortgage this year. Right now staffing is low and I could work extra, but I'd be looking at working 60 hour weeks just to get close to being able to afford a small home and there's no guarantee that I would be able to work that much every single week. It would also leave little time for other things and I wouldn't have much left over for an emergency fund.  


Alternatively I could rent. I'm not too keen on the idea of an apartment, as I don't think that would be much better for sleeping and space would still be cramped. I'd also be spending $800-1000/month. Most apartments are more in town and I'm not much of a city person. For a house I would be looking at $1000-$1500/month. With an apartment I could still save up, albeit a lot less. With a house saving would slow down quite a bit. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another option would be to save up over the next 18 months and make a purchase then. It wouldn't be too bad. That would push the idea of getting married quite a ways out, and it means staying stagnant in my current position for at least 18 months, which is a bit of a downer. It's probably my least favorite option but it would be the safest.   


Lastly I am eligible for a USDA Single Family Housing Guaranteed Loan. With that I would be able to purchase later this year. I'd have enough money to cover closing costs and put about 3-5% down, while still having some leftover for an emergency fund. I prefer rural living and my job is stable. This area is fantastic for the field that I'm in and I have no desire to move and can't see any situations in which I would be forced to move out of the area. $100,000 with 5% down would be $650/month. I'd probably be targeting the $130,000-170,000 range for $850-$1100/month. It's probably the most attractive to me, but also seems the most risky.  


Regardless of when I buy, my significant other graduate's with her master's in 2 years and, once she gets licensed, our income will be around $120,000 a year, if not more. Her current income is eaten up entirely by school expenses. Her debt is currently zero, though that might change with the cost of master's classes. Once she graduates, the plan is to continue living at the means we were prior to her graduation until we've taken care of all debt. If we're renting at that point we will pay off whatever small debt we have and then save up for a house.  


Anyways, I thought maybe I'd be able to find some insight and opinion here. Any input is appreciated.",finance

*Thanks, everyone. I guess I was just surprised at how much of a difference a raise can make in income taxes. I honestly thought that the money coming out of each paycheck would/could bring a person close to even with the government at the end of the year.*

Hi,

After doing our taxes this year we were fairly near to break-even between the federal and state income tax returns. We owe the state but the country owes us. However, my wife has received a very substantial raise which will make for a very different situation next year.

On our 2018 return, our total income was very near $100,000. Next year it will likely be over $140,000 with very few forecasted changes to our deductions. Our CPA threw some numbers into a projection and it looks like we could owe over $11,000 next April.

What can we do in the meantime to help avoid such a large payment? Having to withhold another $1000 each month seems absurd. My wife already claims 0 dependents despite our three kids. 

To make things a bit more difficult, we have no savings and a not-inconsequential amount of credit card debt. This raise has allowed us to start fixing that situation, but having to throw $11k to the government next spring will almost completely halt our progress.

Thanks",finance

personalfinance,Cashout refi mortgage to pay student loans,"Hi Redditors, 

Im at a crossroads as I just graduated with a MBA and it resulted in ~40k in student loans at a 6.99% interest rate (not good!).   Fortunately I have some tools at my disposal that I'm planning to use to pay it down.   I have set aside about 15k that won't impact my 6 months of safety net emergency fund i have set aside.  But that leaves me with 25k I'd need to pay down.

What I'm needing input on is do I utilize my houses equity as a tool to pay down the rest? I'm currently at a 5% interest rate on my mortgage with ~120k in equity, and with rates dropping I had planned to refinance to reduce my interest costs.  This alone would cover my monthly payment for the student loans (though thats not my goal).   However at the same time I could still lower my rate and cash out 25k to close out my student loans.   I do not plan to move anytime soon, and the costs to refinance pay off in less than 2 years, and my resulting rate would be 4.25-4.5% with the cash out.

Does this seem like a smart move - or should I avoid the cash out and just pay off the student loans over the next 5 years?",finance
investing,"Pot, trump, china, and lipstick","I am rather new to investing and just trying to wrap my head around the greater global economy and how it might play out in the coming years as I plan my investment strategy. This might be all completely off but I’d love your kind and constructive thoughts.

I believe Trump made such a mess of his administration that there is likely very little chance that he will be reelected unless he pulls a rabbit out of the hat with China and strikes a deal that fixes everything, and puts the economy back on track. I don’t believe he would be reelected otherwise. Is that the general consensus for others?

Let’s assume in scenario one, Trump does manage to fix the economy by striking a brilliant trade agreement with China and the markets rally. So he gets re-elected and we forgive his bad grammar and anti social behaviour for a favorable economy. Weed fails to get federal legalization and it remains fragmented by state laws as it currently is. In this case, all is well and I believe we would continue to see the markets rise. Of course this is an oversimplification, ignoring the other influencing factors of debts and interest rates which I’m slowly untangling. 

In scenario two, Trump fails to get reelected and we get a Democrat who push through cannabis legalization federally and a new industry with a big potential revenue is created across the US = More jobs and more profits = good for America. Markets are even happier and it’s home grown so not reliant on export. However, let’s say this Democrat failed to fix the broken US China relations, and if the recent [inverted yield curve](https://youtu.be/bItazfbSptI)  is any worthy harbinger, we fall into a recession and the stocks tank in 2021. In this case the usual suspects would do well: alcohol and [lipstick](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lipstick-effect.asp) . But cannabis (weed, pot, marijuana...whatever you want to call it) would also get a boost (assuming the population see it in the same light as alcohol for the obvious “I just lost my job and wish to escape my reality for a moment” effect), and so it might be safe to assume pot would sky rocket in this case. 

So that’s how I see the possible future of the US economy. I know it’s extremely simplified and I’m learning so please take it easy on me.

One of my loan servicers emailed me an offer to refinance and I was surprised to learn they are offering to refinance all of my loans, not just the ones they service.  The interest rate on the refinance is better than what I'm paying on the higher rated loans which are the largest balances, but higher than what I'm paying on the smallest loans, but those balances are so small I could easily just pay them off anyway and the only reason I hadn't done so was because they aren't ""due"" on the avalanche method.  

I believe that if I refinance I lose the option of income-based repayment and eventual forgiveness of the outstanding balance, but really I don't think that option is a good deal anyway - I would have to make income-driven payments another 20 years and the taxation on the forgiveness combined with interest for that period would ultimately be more than just paying them off in ten years.  If I do the refi on a ten-year term, my total interest comes down significantly and my monthly payment is more manageable than it is now while still substantial.

I wanted to make a post summarizing how to maximize tax advantaged retirement savings under some common assumptions. Also want this to be a chance for the community to check my understanding and knowledge of this area of personal finance.

Note: Limits are for 2019

Single, employed: IRS limits for 401k contributions is $19000. Contribute the percentage of your salary that will get you as close as possible to $19000 without exceeding it. Then if you're AGI (adjusted gross income) is under $74000, you can make an additional $6000 ($7000 if age 50 or above) contribution to an IRA. This contribution will be fully tax deductible if AGI is under 64000 and partially tax deductible between AGI of $64000 and $74000. 

So for example, if John has a salary of $80000 and no additional income, he can make a $19000 pretax contribution, bringing his AGI to $61000. Now he is eligible for another $6000 contribution to his IRA, reducing his AGI further to $56000. So in this year he has saved $25000 and paid 0.22 * 25000 = $5500 less in federal taxes than if he had not made any retirement contributions.

I've been reading a lot of posts on this sub but this is my first time posting (nervous AF) because I am overwhelmed by trying to figure out what should be my next actions to take in my situation, and I need advice from you all.

Sorry by advance for the long novel below and formatting I'm on cellphone. TL;DR at the end.

Here's the situation I am currently in : 35yo, I've been working in the visual effects industry for the past 10 years. I am now in Canada (but I'm looking for general advice more than country specific ones ). Started working at 35k and stayed between 35k to 50k for 6 or 7 years then I moved up pretty quickly to 80k than 90k and I am now at 100k since about 2 years.

I never had any financial education growing up, my parents told me a couple a time I should think of my retirement early but I never got any more details on this about the how, where, how much, etc... So I thought for many years I was doing it right by putting some cash (about 400$ on a saving account for emergencies and a couple of hundreds in a common fund for retirement with my job). I moved from Europe to N.America and also had no clue how the financial system worked here. Since the mindset in these two continents is different regarding money, I had a lot of trouble adjusting.

Around 2014 I finally got my debts and credit card paid off ($6000). I changed job in early 2015, saved about 17k to go travel around the world the next year (life long dream). So I did. But at the end of the journey I had to go back in Europe unexpectedly and I ended up having to use 6k on my line of credit. I figure I would pay it off as soon as I would go back to work.

Went back to work in Canada (same job) started to slowly pay off my debt, but 6 months later before I finish paying it off, I burnt out badly. Turns out my employer did not offer invalidity insurance to it's employees like I thought and I ended up using all the savings I had to cover my life expenses (rent and food) for the 8 months I could not work and when the saving was gone I started getting more in debt until I could go back to work, which I did on a partial time and only got back full time at the end of last year.

I have now a credit line and a credit card debts  to pay off. At the same time in 2016 I've met my girlfriend, and we moved together early 2018. Our rent is expensive in the city but we needed to be close to work for medical reasons etc...

Problem is, she's 41yo, started a new career 2 years ago in the same field as me and had a lower income than me (around 40k) and lost her job last May and is still looking for a new one, so for the past 10 months I have been paying almost all our expenses and still will until she finds something.

In an attempt to help, I transfered my credit card on a new one with lower interest rate (20% to 10.9%) and it helps a bit but now I am looking what I can do, because it seems the financial burden is getting heavy and that I cannot save anymore. My credit score have been drastically decreasing when I started to Max out my credit card. I hate living paycheck to paycheck, I hate not having insurance at work, so I started to look for a private one, I hate not having control over my potential financial independence one day because I don't know what to do next.

Here's the key info if my finances :

Income :
- $100k salary, 0 from Girlfriend.

Debts: (26.5k total)
- Line of credit was 14.5k but is now at 10.5k at 7.9% interest rate. Minimum payment is $330/month going down $5 every months.

- Credit card (Visa) at 16k at 10.9% interest rate. Minimum payment is around $350/month.

Expenses that I cover:
- rent : $2000 (100% of the rent)
- home insurance : $66
- car assurance : $50 (the car is paid off already and was 2.5k total)
- electricity and charges : $85/month
- internet : $75/month 
- cellphone : $69/month
- Netflix and Photoshop subscription : $30/month
- Locker (needed) : was $180 is now $120/month (starting sharing the space with a friend to lower the cost)
- groceries and takeout lunch : $400/month
- restaurants and entertainment : $150/month
- trainer : $65/week ($260/month)
- therapist : $90/session 2 times a month ($180/month)

Savings:
Retirement : $140/month in a common fund. (Which I know is not enough)

Emergency fund : $500 (so really nothing)

Notes :
- The trainer and the therapist are part of my slow return to work program and help me not getting back in burn out.

- I also pay for almost all of the unexpected expenses like the car repair (already put 1k in it this past year)

- My GF has also her students debts to pay off with the little money she gets from unemployment program, which stops at the end of the month :/

This equals roughly around $4300 of expenses when my net income is $4500/month.

It drives me nuts to have worked my ass off to earn that much money but managing it so wrongly because I obviously don't know what I am doing. 6 months ago, in an attempt to reduce our charges, we cut off my GF Netflix account, I cancelled my Google music account, Amazon prime membership, all the donation I was doing to organisation I care about, changed my internet and cellphone plan to a less expensive ones.

I feel stuck. I can no longer afford travel and my entire family leaves across the ocean so my situation needs to change. I barley pays off my debts, line of credit is ok my my Visa does not lower quick.

What next ? I am losing hope.
Any advice is welcome. Thanks a lot.

I'd say 50% of what I sold were acquired prior to 2018, so I guess it's not advisable to deduct those without records.  

I have records of both shipping &amp; material costs for 2018 which is about 10%. Can I also deduct both eBay final value fees and paypal fees (10% ebay and 3% paypal)? How about the computer I built last year which I used to run my sales? The PC alone cost 2k which I'm still using. Also, I still have a ton of things left to sell in terms of games and figures, am I able to report this as inventory? Not sure what else I can add.

Those are the ones I have records of in case of an audit. With my W2 and without deductions to the 1099k, my estimated fees would be around 7k total Fed/State. This will be my first time filing a 1099k. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks",finance

personalfinance,Learning the hard way. Considering a vehicle surrender.,"Hi everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

Any feedback or suggestion is appreciated. I am in the pits right now and I fear the worst to come. Long story short I did a foolish mistake of agreeing to a insane offer for a auto loan. The company is Exeter Finance and my interest rate is 25% with a $625 monthly payment. Living in New York Insurance is $289 on top of it. For the first year and few months I managed to keep up with loan but I came up late with payments 3 times but only a few days (2 or 4 days past due date). Recently was laid off from work cause the company closed down. After being on a intense job search I have pending job offer but the pay is less then previous job I will make $150 less weekly then from my last job.

&amp;#x200B;

I am about 34 days late on my car in which has a late fee on top of interest for that late fee according to Exeter rep. So my current bill is $1400 since they already have this months payment due added. I am considering surrender of this vehicle. It is a 2017 Nissan Altima S model. Car is only valued at $16750 according to fair retail value but my loan is still around $23,000. Nobody wants to refinance. NOBODY. I have spoken to several banks and everyone is asking that I get the principle or pay off down then they can accept application. My credit is in the lower 600's I already know that is not favorable to me at all. I know most of payments to towards interest during agreement early stage but it seems like I will end up paying over $30k for this car when first sale price was $18k. There was times I manage to add extra $50 towards the note on top of my regular payment and they applied it towards next months note NOT principle itself. It seems like this company was on purposely trying to keep me within their grasp of this high interest loan.....again foolish of me and a win for them.

&amp;#x200B;

Would it be better to give them back the car? I also have other legal obligations that came abroad due to a break up. My ex decided to file child support which makes no sense cause I have always taken care of her and my children ($212 weekly) Living in New York...plus high rent...I am lost. Now that on top of this car note has me gasping for air cause I can barely afford food and clothing now. 

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: **Reality is as many said I did this to myself, so if anyone has been through similar situation I am seeking advice on how to fix this.** I am thinking about voluntary surrender of the vehicle. I know it's depressing I never thought things would be this way. Any help works. Thanks and have a blessed day!

personalfinance,"I need to take out a loan for my last semester of University, and I need to do it soon.","I don't really know who to ask or where to really go for loan questions, so I thought I would post here. I am 21M and need \~$13.5k to pay for my last semester (which I'm currently in) of college. 

&amp;#x200B;

The due date for this was mid-March, but I pushed it off because my parent assured me that the school would grant an extended payment schedule or waive the final installment since we've already paid $140k to this university, and I am going to be graduating with a full-time job. However, I have always been skeptical of this but haven't expressed it to my parent due to the fact that they've paid for 70% of my tuition and school expenditures up until this academic year. My family is wholistically unemployed in recent months, and are now unable to assist in any educational assistance moving forward. I have been affording my entire living expenditures since February of 2018, and only have enough to get to the end of June, which is when I will start my new job. I just recently tried getting a loan through a reputable company (through which I have a credit card with a mid 700 credit score history) and was denied based on my cosigner.

&amp;#x200B;

The caveat with the situation (for obvious reasons) is that my employer requires transcripts/degree conferred to them prior to starting work. The university requires full tuition payments by mid-May to release transcripts and allow me to walk at graduation. I feel pinned here and don't have a lot of guidance in the way of where to look for loans without a reputable cosigner. Any suggestions at all would be welcome. Current net worth is \~$5k down from \~$18k from last February.

personalfinance,Convince me that I shouldn’t do my own taxes,"I’ve done our own taxes each of the past 4 years with little to no issues. The year prior to that, I paid an accountant to do them since we had a lot go on all in that one year (I graduated college and paid off student loans, bought a house, got married, both started full-time jobs). The few years after that it was pretty much just status quo and I was pretty easily able to fill out and submit state and federal just using the online forms, and it didn’t hurt that I had the filing the professional previously did to reference back to if need be. 

Well 2018 was again an interesting year for us. We had a baby in Feb. My wife went back to work for a short time then quit for good in July. I took a new job in Oct which required a move, but in-state. We bought a house right away so we owned 2 from mid-Oct until the end of the year (old home was vacant until selling in 2019). 

Is there any reason I shouldn’t still be able to do our own taxes, or if I do, anything I need to be especially aware of? While I never used software in the past, Newegg has H&amp;R Block Deluxe for $15, so I was thinking that might help some too right?

I’m not too concerned with the job thing, as I assume I’ll just be submitting 2 W-2’s for myself. I’m not sure if health insurance will have a major impact. We were on my wife’s until she quit (so when baby was born), then through my old job, then through my new job; so always through employer and deducted from payroll. We did pay a lot of medical expenses via pre-tax HSA contributions so curious if anything to worry about there reporting or deduction wise. If I remember right from last year, that’s called out in one of the W-2 boxes, so not sure what else may need to be done on that front.",finance
gaming,CSGO AND HARDWARE BANS FOR GAMES,"Hardware bans would probably be the best action to take against hackers. I have recently tried out the free version of CS:GO (I own the game but didn't want to derank in an unknown part of the game when playing with a free-to-play friend)  and it is so full of hacks at least 2/3 games is a hacking game. Some hackers are nice, some are the worst people you will ever meet but one common thing is they still all hack. They all have the excuse that they can just get another account. You may say 'Well they make money from the free accounts"" well, not enough for it to matter because the most they would get out of it would be skins and i rarely saw a free player with a skin. New players would see all these hackers and just leave. There is no win for keeping hackers around so the best option would be a hardware ban because then at least they would have to waste a lot of money or even take more effort than playing 3 arms race games after going to an account generator site just to hack. This game is going down the toilet when it comes to this, the game has a strong competitive scene but when probably 40% of the players are hackers (made up the number but if it was based off my 2/3 it would be around 62%) the game seems to be going down a steady downslope. It may be one of the top ten games but the free-to-play spike in the games play stats is now about to be passed. and it will keep going down.

&amp;#x200B;

If a hardware ban starts happening on one of the most popular games in the world, think about how many hackers will start getting removed.

&amp;#x200B;

There is also the option of just making a better system to detect cheating. ESEA has a pretty sound system when it comes to cheating and most pros prefer it, you are trying to impress the pros and keep them right? This is the way. Even easier would be outright buying them and implementing their system into your game much how like Notch (creator of Minecraft) implemented better lighting when a member of the community made one better than his.

Valve, if you are reading me or the hate/love below this post just remember:  you have the resources to fix the problems and everyone in the community wants the game to succeed.

personalfinance,Help understanding the bond market and its relationship with business cycles,"Hi everyone, I have a decent understanding of economics and business, but am a young investor and inexperienced. I've been getting my feet wet with equities and am starting to try to learn about bonds/treasury bills. I understand the basics of what these things are, but I want to understand better the relationship between stocks, bonds, business cycles, and interest rates. For example, when is the 'right' time to switch from a more equity based portfolio to a more bond based portfolio? It seems like equities get referred to as offense colloquially and bonds are more of a defensive position as far as I understand.

So my questions are: When during a business cycle do bonds become better investments than the stock market and when do they become worse? Is the ideal time to buy right before a contraction? And what is the relationship with interest rates? If you expect the fed to raise interest rates in a few months, should you be buying or selling bonds? Why? What role does inflation play here?

personalfinance,Underpaid by about $20k pre-promotion. New role is now underpaying me by $35K. What do I do?,"**Pre-warning: sorry I think this will be a long post, its still pretty fresh the disappointment.**

&amp;#x200B;

I just got the news today on a Promotion I've been waiting 4 months on being given im being stiffed HARD on my raise. I had really hoped to jump a huge salary gap, and today I just found out the promotion only comes with a $5k raise, after already working a year with a silent promotion with no raise.

&amp;#x200B;

Backstory:

I started this new job in 2017. I have an AS in Computer Science and  BA in Information Technology. I lost a taste for hard core programming before even graduating, but within my first year of college I had started working in my college part time as a councilor/mentor to a newly funded initiative in my school to help out under-performing freshmen adjust to college. Within that job I discovered a larger appreciation of Project Management during my degree coupled with a real passion for Adult Learning and training, as well as Metacognition and motivating others. I used to joke it was my job to beat the high school out of freshmen who were given a bad taste for education and show them how college is different while making it easier for them to transition by basically being their hired friend to tell them ANYTHING they needed to do. (This will matter in a bit).

Sadly along the way pretty much from graduating highschool till 2016 I was in some way or another taking care of my mother through drug and alcohol addiction and then what the final kick off was from about 2013-2016 staying to help her battle breast cancer. So the reason I detailed my college work was because being one of the original members and basically founders of that college initiative and college assistants can only work part time, I stayed at that job for a total of 10 years from my 2nd semester of freshmen year till nearly 5 years post graduation (while also taking on various helpdesk and IT jobs within the school in the tech center as well, so 2 part time jobs) but the flexible schedule really helped me keep things alive at home (I also had a brother in Grad school who I really wanted to make sure our house didnt implode while he was away and randomly coming back, so I held down the homefront by keeping mom sane/alive). But having been there so long I became the senior mentor of the program and was basically responsible for training all new mentors, developing all  new initiatives of the program and facilitating all the training workshops we handled, running our summer programs enrollment and set up, basically I was the right hand person of my department director in keeping that program alive and making it into one of the cornerstones of my college. They really did not want to let me go but going from College Assistant to Full time faculty was an impossibility.

Unfortunately in October of 2016 mom lost the battle to cancer and life kinda had to rush on forward. After almost 2 months of going through the death process of making arrangements, and grieving, by end Nov/December I knew I had to hit the pavement hard with the job search. I threw everything I could into my resume about my technology background which other than the programming I tried to stay abreast about as much as I could, and pushing my higher ed background however I could.

&amp;#x200B;

I landed a job after about 30 submissions over the 2 months in March of 2018 (I had to wait for the role to open but I had the job promised for the 3 months before it opened) in a financial training firm who really appreciated my background in education but my training in technology so I seemed the perfect fit for being the assistant to my supervisor in administrating and managing our online eLearning platform and programs. Without giving away the name we disperse training to Fortune 500/1000 banks and financial firms for post-grads.

I took the job ASAP even though their initial offer was pretty low, I figured beggars can't be choosers and if they were willing to give me a shot because I felt like I was a mixed bag, id take it and see where it goes. They initially offered me 50K. It wasnt really that low, 53 would have made ""adulting"" pretty doable. (I live in NYC so the solo living threshold is pretty high). I also have a liability, my mother ""owned"" a co-op under my grandfathers name, paid in full so maintenance is about $750 a month. Thats not bad, but I have to now hold the co-op. I can't leave it.

But thats when things started to get kinda bad. They hit me with a reason that because the role never existed in the company before, it was going to be paid less to validate its purpose and need. That at the time seemed logical enough to me so they knocked me down to 40k, and I was to get the 50k at the end of the year if I performed well and the role did since I started in Q1 all I needed to do was make it to the end of the year. Now post taxes i take home a pretty rough amount, Its about 23k (I was still receiving money from my last job because city pay is lagged and cash outs of vacation/sicktime unused, it made following my net income hard and im bad at math honestly). But I liked my supervisor, i liked most of the staff.

And then the signs started rolling in. Within the first 5 months, my department manager was let go and we were moved into our corporate office from where we were, and literally every month from the month I started someone quit, and someone new came, and some of the new people left. Rollover was HIGH. Also about 2-3 months in I developed a series of medical issues where I'm in pain 24/7 with pains in tender bits I wont mention as well as back pain and spasms that tend to go out. I get to work from home sometimes but I also have massive trouble getting out of bed in the morning due to my back being really stiff. So far they've been pretty cool in dealing with me like this, so I will NOT deny them that understanding. But this also adds to an growing MEDICAL DEBT I am accruing because 9 doctors and 2 years later I still have an un-diagnosed reason. 

Come my first evaluation, I get pretty stellar marks, but my supervisor hits me with this gem. My previous department manager had never agreed to the 50k upon my end of year evaluation. It was an under the table agreement never put down in writing to add to my contract (yes...i know. Mistake #1). And with the manager having been fired, no one was there to hold up my 50k promotional increase. So by March of 2018 i go from 40 to 43,750 with a 2,250 ""bonus"" to make it look like 45. (But the bonus got eaten up pretty hard  by taxes.)

End of march, my supervisor who was probably the best employee theyd ever have and an AWESOME boss/supervisor, finds a WAY better position elsewhere, and I am soft promoted to inherit about half his responsibilities while others were phased out. No official promotion, no salary increase, but a ton of responsibility and ownership increase and many things to learn because he didnt have time to train me in all the stuff he did behind the scenes. Again I was hired to assist him because his role alone handling everything we did was too much. But here I am, handling it all myself. No ""assistant"" to be hired to me to help share the load, because they werent sure if they were gonna hire a new person in his role, or promote me to it.Turns out neither happens, they fill the role with a ""new"" position. Fine. Im vocal about the fact that this is a lot. I put in a lot of weekends and late hours and manage to keep up hoping at the end of 2018 things will shine and I'll have proven myself real well.

Things are crazy. Things keep breaking we have no control over, but I manage to organize the teams together and get them fixed with minimal to no impact on any of our clients. We finish a bunch of new initiatives that really improve everything we do. I also get along with everyone pretty well, even the people I cant stand, but this is work, so part of what I do is make sure I get along because if the team gets along, things get done, I dont have to like them, but they dont have to know I dont. I keep my personal shit to myself.

If asked ill say what my title is, but its hard to describe because I work for a UK company technically so what they title me is according to their standards, not the US, so it doesnt translate AS well over here without some digging and name swapping for titles with relevant/same skill sets. But I went into the end of 2018 pretty much knowing I've been ""elevated"" in importance and responsibility, and I decided to formally ask for a salary renegotiation. I typed up a 5 page document on how things have progressed, my workload and accomplishments in the last year/2 years. The comparison of my responsibilities pre and post ""soft"" promotion, and what salaries look like across my title within the same space on a low-average-high comparison from 5 different well document sources and the list of skills I have in common with that title and a slightly higher title and how that translates into those pay scales.

It gets looked over and I'm told my role was up for a change anyway, theyd been considering restructuring my role and responsibilities and giving me an official promotion to an even higher more global facing position. After research it pretty much kept the same average-high but the low average was a little higher, not much. The new title would roughly break across the board (L) 70k (A) 90-120k (H) 130K-150k+.

I submitted this document with a meeting stating that I would like my elevation in responsibility to be re-evaluated, my dedication to working nights, weekends and holidays to fulfill client deadlines, and my overall performance as having always delivered on or ahead of schedule to the clients satisfaction or exceeding.

Wait through 4 months of ""Yes you're getting promoted. No I cant mention ANY salary info until performance evaluations are done (which were 2 months late), and our department is not really profitable enough."" Now to that last statement, Ive learned quite a few things about my company from people that left that didnt leave bitter and had been there so long they knew a lot of people inside and outside the sector. My department was bought and held with the intention of being flipped and sold, but no one wanted to buy it. We are seen as an offset, not really part of the company (my department exclusively has different and worse benefits than the rest of the company only) and overall were not seen as being held onto anymore for profit, but for the contacts we create and maintain to sell even BIGGER things. I equated it to the food at a bar. We dont really make the money, but we facilitate the staying around for the spending of bigger ticket items/products/services.

Today I get my official promotion email before my boss had a meeting with me about it (a screw up on HR's part so now Im aware of something before I was supposed to be) but the compensation is now at 48,750. So yes if you went with the LOWEST ball figure of the 70k low average, im 21, but I was PRAYING maybe theyd go a little higher. Sad thing is I knew it was never going to happen. EVERYONE it seems (or so im hearing) at my company is paid vastly under market value, but damn I was hoping to at least hit 53-60. That was my realistic expectation after a soft promotion with no increase, a nullification of my initial ""under the table"" offer, and that I've managed to perform with little to no additional training other than apologizing to all the contacts I now had to work with and ask them to walk me through things so I could learn what was expected then research how to deliver that.

&amp;#x200B;

This is so long and I apologize that I am not a common poster on forums anymore, let alone have I ever really posted much on reddit, and am also incredibly distraught at what to do next. The new title despite containing much of what I do already and was never promoted to do, also comes with a hefty amount of official ""documentation"" practices and skills I have never been able to work on yet, so it will take MONTHS and MONTHS of practice and training before I can really feel I embody that title. But I need to make more money ASAP. The co-op my grandfather holds that I now reside in is supposed to transfer to me. Id rather that be done willingly rather than upon his death, but he also is not a very understanding man who is in his 90's already so...time is short and he is always upset I am not paying the full rent yet. I WANT TO. I also need to to pass the co-op board and truly get my mothers co-op, the one thing she ever managed to somewhat have that she could leave to us, so that wed have some sorta security or inheritance, but its not much but its something that I feel on the verge of losing. I hate being 34, having sacrificed a lot of time yet I do not feel like an adult at all. I pay every other bill except rent, so I am not self sufficient and that bothers me to no end. I definitely struggle with what is called ""Impostor syndrome"" which for anyone in the tech space, this is the idea that so many people until they are older or in a really elevated position after a while, feel like they dont deserve the role they have because the tech space is so big you are ALWAYS over shadowed by someone because they've been there longer so you feel incompetent by comparison. Despite having met every demand put on me, I still feel like I didnt truly earn my way into this job in the back of my mind. It might not make sense but I guess its because I dont internalize the lingo and content we give out (and it seems everyone in the financial space LOVES learning this stuff, i really dont care about stocks, bonds and hedge funds and mergers, maybe if i ever have stock market money i might but I go with the idea its like vegas, you dont play with money you need or will miss, so, NOT HAPPENING). I feel like yeah a lot of it is my fault for spending so much time staying part time to help someone a lot of people said I was better off ignoring and moving on with my life from, but pre-drugs/alcohol she was always there for me and saved me from a lot of trouble with an abusive father/husband that tried to kill her and kidnap us. I will always respect her for being a strong enough woman back in the 90's to embrace her divorce and speak out against the violence she was facing. And I saw a lot of that as why she turned to drugs/alcohol eventually. I couldnt just abandon her to die alone and just move out into the working world and know that after my departure would probably be a 2 month clock before she burned herself out. But I thought I'd worked hard enough the last 2 years, proved I could do every single task handed to me, embark on new initiatives to bring value, and at least wind up self sufficient enough to get by and work myself on up from there.

&amp;#x200B;

But after today i would LOVE to quit. The department has turned over so much that most of the people left now are nowhere near as nice as the ones I started with left. (like 80% of the people that left I still talk to, including my old supervisor). And now i really see the kind of place I work at. It has no future. But this is also very new territory for me on do I apply for jobs with my old title, ignoring the promotion Ive earned and try to find someone who will pay at least a livable wage? Do I push on with the new title despite having really half the qualifications now, and hope a company understands that I was seen as capable enough, but I left for all the reasons above? I have the meeting on Monday about the promotion and salary and I've been told up to this point that the number I see will NOT be up for discussion. So I feel expressing any disappointment or pushing for more will lead to my inevitable termination. I think theyd have a hard time replacing me, but they will.

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone has made it this far at all, a) thank you for reading this at all. You are a saint and I appreciate even a shred of the time you spent looking at this. b) Any advice? I have never felt so slighted and angry as I am right now and very afraid of the future of how I'll manage to jump that gap. How do I look for a job and make the time for interviews when I have a job? I have VERY little PTO and sick time and vacations have a 2 week advanced notice requirement IF the scheduling allows. What is a good way to explain why my resume would show a promotion that recent yet Im jumping ship? How do you promote yourself despite having obviously missing standards and still manage to land a position? And how and what the hell do I do on Monday to keep a straight face and not express a self-sabotaging level of disagreement with my current predicament?

Thanks to all and I sincerely hope no one is currently in as screwed a predicament as I feel I am, but if you have been what did  you do? And if you are....I wish you the best cause damn this feeling SUCKS.",finance

personalfinance,Likelihood of IRS/State Revenue Coming After ~$3K in Unpaid Taxes?,"Title is just like it sounds. It's my first job and time filing taxes-- ever. Job was \~$30K this year and it says I owe about \~$3K between the federal and state governments (Oregon). What's the likelihood of either coming after me? I've done a bit of reading and it sounds like even if they do come after you, it'd likely be negligible based on how little I owe. 

For example, the amounts owed are reduced or even if they're increased it's not by much (if they come after you at all). Due to a long list of financial issues that've occurred over the last year, I can't afford to pay any of the taxes and any payment plan would have to be for something like $25 per month.",finance
personalfinance,Mortgage vs. Rent,"Hey gang, so my fiance and I are in a pretty decent situation but we're at a crossroads and looking for some advice. For some context: together we make around $130k/yr. We have 2 cars on which we owe around $30k combined. I have around $18k in student loans and no credit card debt for either of us. Our plan for this year was to try to pay off one of our vehicles ($14.5k) this year, then go after the other vehicle and student loan debts over the next 2 years. Those are prioritized by interest rate.

Now to our crossroads, we currently rent our home for $1,050/month. We are always watching the housing market around our area and we are finding some fantastic houses that we could afford but going into more debt for a house flies in the face of our plan to reduce debt. This is a moral dilemma for us but the only thing we keep thing is even if we are taking on more debt, it *surely* has to be a better option due to the gain in equity than continually paying our landlord $12.6/yr that we'll never see again. The issue is the down payment and closing costs will likely push the rest of our plans out at least a year and with our wedding planned next year possibly even longer.

Would it be wise to make the jump to home ownership or should we stay the course and get our cars/student loans cleaned up first?",finance
personalfinance,New Grad looking for Financial Advice,"Hey everyone, after reading the wiki over the past couple of days I still have a few questions. My fiancé and I are moving to a new state for my new job and she is being allowed to work from home and keep her job. Together we have a combined total of 160k in student loans(different loans at varying interest rates 4% - 9%) and make a combined $110,000 gross/year. I plan on following the flow chart in the wiki and have a budget planned out. 

	The game plan is to get monthly payments as low as possible on student loans and avalanche money at the highest rates but is there a percentage of income that is recommended or is it personal preference? Also is refinancing student loans a smart option or even possible? 

	We plan on saving for a frugal wedding as well as a down payment for a house (currently renting). At what point do I start investing in a Roth, HSA, and 401(k) (no matching from my company)? Should i start maxing retirement funds now? Or use the money to reach our goals of a wedding/house first then begin investing?

personalfinance,Taxable refund from amended return?,"My CPA accidentally filed incorrect returns for 2017 last year. We caught it the day after the April 2018 deadline when automatic withdrawals from my account by both the fed and state were higher than they should have been, so then filed amended returns. I wound up receiving refunds in 2018 from both the fed and the state for the differences. My question is, ""Is the money refunded by the state in 2017 now considered a taxable refund on my 2018 federal return?"" The way I see it, that money should've never been sent to the state in the first place, so it shouldn't be taxed- after all, both the originally filed 2017 state tax return and the amended state return show no refund. My CPA insists that any money refunded by the state is considered income. I don't understand how that's possible when the state return showed no refund was due. To me it is as if I accidentally sent the state extra money without filing any returns, and the state then sends that money back to me. I wouldn't get taxed on that money in that scenario, so why would I in this one?",finance

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 8th, 2019.

# **Key data could end or defend recession fears as stocks notch best quarter in a decade  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/05/first-quarter-earnings-are-expected-to-be-lousy-but-stock-market-may-not-care.html)**
*****
&gt; The worst earnings season in nearly three years is about to begin, but stock strategists say the market should be able to look right past declining profits and continue to reach for all-time highs, as long as trade talks between the U.S. and China continue to show progress.
*****
&gt; Stocks were higher in the past week, on the prospect that the trade talks would ultimately lead to a deal that could end punitive tariffs and boost earnings growth. The S&amp;P 500 was up 2% for the week, at 2,892 and is just about 1.6% from its all-time high of 2,940, reached in September.
*****
&gt; Among the first major companies to report are J.P. Morgan Chaseand Wells Fargo, both on Friday. In addition to earnings, investors will be watching Wednesday for minutes from the last Fed meeting; CPI inflation data also on Wednesday; and any headlines on trade or the U.K.'s ""Brexit"" from the European Union.
*****
&gt; As for earnings, Refinitiv expects a 2.2% decline in first-quarter profits for the S&amp;P 500 companies, but those lower results are expected to be the trough. Earnings growth is projected to rebound to 2.8% in the second quarter and by as much as 9% in the fourth quarter. The first-quarter decline would be the first negative earnings period since the second quarter of 2016.
*****
&gt; ""The second, third and fourth quarter will show a rebound.That's supportive of higher equity prices,"" said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. ""I was thinking I'd like to see a record for the whole year, and it looks like we might do better than that.""
*****
&gt; 'Picture much brighter'
Keon said there are risks, including whether there really is a trade deal with China over the next couple of weeks and whether China's economy is really bottoming. ""Is the success of China's stimulus gong to to continue and spread to other countries? To me, the picture is much brighter than it was a couple months ago,"" he said.
*****
&gt; Strategists said any number of factors could be the catalyst to push stocks to records, including earnings season, if companies beat lowered guidance and their outlooks are good. Stocks could also ride higher on a better outlook for the U.S. economy, after a batch of better data including Friday's March jobs report.
*****
&gt; ""I think maybe we end up getting to a new high sometime early in the second quarter, and then maybe we do some sideways moving in that 'sell in May' period,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. ""I think we confirm that 10th anniversary of this bull market by hitting a new all-time high. Then we digest some of those gains and move sideways for a bit and let some of those earnings catch up, and then maybe there's a year-end advance.""
*****
&gt; Also in the week ahead, investors are watching for the minutes from the Fed's last meeting, scheduled to be released Wednesday afternoon. At that meeting, the Fed released revised forecasts, with no rate hikes now expected in 2019 and a slower growth outlook. The minutes should also show what Fed officials were considering when they decided to end the program to roll down their balance sheet, and bond traders are looking for clues on which type of Treasurys the Fed will hold in its balance sheet.
*****
&gt; On the data front, there are CPI consumer inflation data Wednesday and producer price inflation on Thursday. Both of these indexes should be closely watched since wage gains were muted in Friday's March jobs report, and strategists said they see no sign of inflation on the horizon. The Fed also sees below-trend inflation, so any unexpected change would be important.
*****
&gt; The U.K.'s effort to leave the European Union will continue to make headlines in the week ahead. The Council of the European Union meets Wednesday, and will consider the U.K.'s request to extend the Brexit deadline, originally this coming Friday.
*****
&gt; ""It could go in any number of directions. The thing we've been telling people is if it's a messy, hard Brexit, the big difference between now and three years ago is you'd get a big chunk of that safe haven flow into U.S. dollars,"" said Michael Schumacher, director, rate strategy at Wells Fargo. Schumacher said investors would be more inclined to move into the short end of the Treasury curve, rather than into German bunds, which have negative yields.

# Big First Quarter Gains Undoubtedly Bullish

&gt; Well the big gains of Q1 are in the books and after the nastiness in Q4 it’s reassuring to see the “Sweet Spot” of the 4-Year Presidential Election Cycle returning to form and delivering solid gains. The Sweet Spot of the 4-Year Cycle runs from Q4 of the Midterm Election Year through Q2 of the Pre-Election Year for with an average gain of 21.1% for the S&amp;P 500 over the 3-quarter span. The S&amp;P 500 gained 13.1% in 2019 Q1, but it lost 14.0% in 2018 Q4 and is still down -2.7% for the Sweet Spot so far.

&gt; But, nevertheless, this type of gain for the S&amp;P 500 in Q1 is undoubtedly bullish. The S&amp;P 500’s gain for 2019 Q1 is the 26th best quarterly gain for the index since 1930, 7thbest Q1 since 1949, largest Q1 gain since 1998 and the top quarterly gain since September 2009.

&gt; As illustrated in the accompanying table the 44 prior times that the S&amp;P 500 was positive in Q1 since 1949 resulted in 40 full-year gains and 4 losses for an average gain of 16.2% and gains for the remaining 9 months of the year 38 times out of 44 year with an average gain of 8.6%. The 18 years with Q1 gains between 5.5% and 13.9% are all followed by full-year gains with the only blemish in geopolitically charged 1956.

&gt; The big black mark came from Black Monday 1987. 1956 was mired by the Hungarian Revolution and the Soviet invasion as well as the Suez Crisis, the Second Arab-Israeli War. 2011 was hindered by the international sovereign debt crisis, the U.S. debt-ceiling crisis and the resulting downgrade of U.S. credit rating. The dotcom bubble popped in the year 2000. Tepid growth and earnings declines created a mini bear in 2015 that bottomed in February 2016. And finally, the 1980-1982 double-dip recessions put U.S. stocks in abear market throughout 1981 that ended in August 1982.

# The Bespoke Report -- Second Quarter Chart Checkup

&gt; Following big market moves like we have seen in the last six months, a number of market characteristics tend to change as some new leadership groups emerge and others fall by the wayside. In order to help get a better idea of what sectors and groups have been driving the market, in this week’s Bespoke Report, we are providing a ‘chart checkup’ of all the S&amp;P 500 Industries as well as providing updates to some key market and economic charts that we feel are important to highlight.

&gt; It was a banner week for US equities and a great encore to a strong first quarter. With the exception of the Dow (DIA), every major index ETF was up over 2%. Value outperformed growth across all three market caps, but the margin between the two was pretty narrow. Defensive sectors like Consumer Staples (XLP) and Utilities (XLU) actually saw modest declines this week, while Materials (XLB), Financials (XLF), Communication Services (XLC), and Consumer Discretionary (XLY) all rallied over 3%. In international markets, China (ASHR) surged over 7%, while Mexico (EWW) bounced over 5%. Australia (EWA) was the only country up less than 1%. Fixed income ETFs saw modest declines across the board.

# Jobs Growth Slows, But Only A Little Bit

&gt; Today's job numbers beat expectations, with 196,000 jobs added and a small positive revision to the prior two months. On a rolling 3 month average, job creation fell to the lowest level in over a year, but only marginally. While jobs growth is still solid, it has cooled a bit. That isn't anything to worry about, but it is something to keep an eye on.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/040519-ESR-1.png))**

&gt; Wage growth picked up dramatically last year, with 2016-2018's sideways movement in the year-over-year change of average wages paid surging. Over the last few months that growth has once again been moving sideways, albeit at a much higher rate of growth than we've seen for almost all of the current economic expansion.

personalfinance,[US Fed] Will a traditional IRA contribution for 2018 affect the income counted for Social Security that year?,"I had two employers in 2018; neither had retirement plans; both had IRAs but I did not contribute. We file married jointly, my wife is covered by a retirement plan at her job. Our joint income is below the AGI limit for deducting IRA contributions for our situation, so it appears to me that I can contribute the max allowed to the IRA and take a deduction.

But there may be a wrinkle.

When Social Security is calculating your benefit amount, they use your highest income over some period of your working life, and my 2018 income may be one of my highest-earning years (after the weighting calculations they put it all through). Does contributing to the IRA affect (lower) the income used for Social Security benefit calculations for that year?

I've been looking on the IRS website; if anyone can point me to a reference on there, or the SSA, with the answer, that'd be perfect.

EDIT -- thanks to all respondents, concensus at this point is that it does not affect SS basis. I read through the chapter on IRAs from the IRS and couldn't find anything. There was a a section on people who were already receiving SS benefits, making me think that, if there were an effect on the SS basis wages, it would have been mentioned somewhere.",finance

I am a federal employee.  I contribute 10% (15% with the match) from my paychecks (paid biweekly) toward my roth TSP (the federal government's version of the 401K).  I am 32 years old, and have been doing this job for 1.5 years.  Should I decrease my retirement contribution?  I am doing it roth, because I believe I will be in a higher tax bracket when I retire (so I can save on taxes).  Should I change my contributions to traditional, so I can get more take home pay?  Also, per H&amp;R Block's advice, I set my federal exemptions to 0, and my state allowances to 0 as well (I live in California).  Is this right?  I am single, and don't have any children.  H&amp;R Block said that this way, I'll get a bigger refund at the end of the year, but I'd really rather just break even, and get more take home pay throughout the year.  Should I change my tax information?  I honestly don't know much about these sorts of things.  Should I see a financial adviser?  I live with my parents, and spend about $1,000 a month.  

I'm getting a 2.1% salary increase starting the next paycheck, but I am giving you guys my current paycheck information to make things easier (I got paid today).

Thank you!

Edit: Thank you all for your great advice!  I changed my federal exemptions to 01, and my state allowances to 01.  I made my TSP contribution traditional, and am going to contribute 5% (so 10% with the match).  I'm excited to see how much I'll get in my next paycheck!",finance
personalfinance,Huge difference in refund amounts ($1161 vs $2138) from 2 different sites; what gives?,"I’ve filled out all of the information that I have for my and my husband’s tax return for 2018 on TurboTax (which I used last year) and Credit Karma. TurboTax says +$1161 for federal and +$10 for state. Meanwhile, Credit Karma, with the same forms says +$2138 for federal and -$24 for state. 

Is there some fundamental difference between their calculations that would cause such a huge jump? I’ve looked over the numbers three times and I can’t seem to find any input errors (though I could have missed it, I’m sure). Has anyone else experienced this?

personalfinance,Paying Down Debt and Increasing Savings,"Hi personal finance community, I want to start by saying thank you to everyone who contributes here and provides valuable information and direction for each other. I started lurking here and educating myself after the harsh realization that I'd saved close to $0 this year due to some frivolous spending habits and frequently dining out due to laziness. Long story short, I'm on a better track and in a better state of mind thanks to you fine folks here. I'm looking for some guidance on determining the best route forward on the following  topics:

**Context**:

* Income/Month: $3500 net
* 401k contribution: 10%
* Savings/Month: approx 20%
* Emergency fund: 6 months of expenses
* Other: 12k stashed for a business startup, 5k stashed for a house downpayment (contributing to this with savings now that I've completed a 6mo emergency fund)
* Building an investment account w/ quarterly contributions of 1k

**Student Loans**

* Loan A: $7,918  at an interest rate of 1.75% which I am currently paying off at 123.36/month
* Loan B: $4,818 at an interest rate of 6.50% which I am currently paying off at 190.58/month

**Question:** I have the funds to pay off Loan B in full. If I do so, would it make the most sense to increase the Loan A payment by the amount of Loan B or should I dip into some of the other savings to pay off Loan A in full?

&amp;#x200B;

**Savings**

* Currently saving at about 20%, what are some of the little things you would suggest to help cut costs in day to day life? For example, meal prepping instead of going out to eat. 
* How do you balance frugality and still enjoying life without sacrificing doing fun things  in favor of saving as much as possible for later in life? I find that I often don't know where to draw that line in the sand. 
* I've read the info about 401k employer contribution matching and only putting as much as they do to get the match then building up an IRA. My employer only contributes a lump sum annually, so how should I go about that?

Thank you to everyone for your input!",finance
personalfinance,What is the best option to save money for home maintenance?,"So Im in the process of buying a house and want to establish a dedicated account for putting aside funds in case of emergencies. I obviously have insurance for the big expenses, but would prefer having options that avoid making a claim outside of some disaster. As a truck driver, I was taught the concept of a maintenance escrow account where you set aside a small amount, maybe 3-5% of your income, up to a certain amount, and don't use it for anything except these big maintenance expenses.

My question is this: I have checking and saving accounts at a local credit union, but the savings account is used for overdraft protection, which makes it not suitable for an emergency fund. The whole point of this fund is to be able to liquidate it within a day if necessary, so it can't be tied into an investment. But it should ideally still have some amount of interest to hedge against inflation. My CU offers additional savings account, but also a money market account with a limit of 6 transactions per month and tiered interest rates.

I went through the wiki, and it seems like there isn't a definitive answer for debt at less than 4% interest.  If I don't pay off the car loan, the money would go towards retirement.

Banking,Is it a good idea to invest in CDs in Egypt?,"I'm an American, half Egyptian. Father is an Egyptian national. I've never lived in Egypt but I recently read that Egypt offers 11-20% interest rates on CDs for local currency and 4-6% on USD.

I really know nothing about investing but I know that in the US, the best I can expect from a CD is 1.6%

The 11-20% almost seems too good to be true. I understand that it's also to offset the very high inflation rate but I wouldn't be living there so I wouldn't be subject to that. It also looks like the value of the EGP has been steady for the last 3 years.

I’m planning on getting an EV charger after my current car dies (it’s 14 years old and hoping to drive it another 4-6 years). Also, consider getting an EV car to replace my wife’s car in 8-10 years. So rather than getting a SolarEdge 3800, I’m considering getting a SolarEdge 7800 EV Charger (Solar Edge offers 3800 or 7800 EV Charger) instead so I can just attach additional solar panels without having to replace the inverter. I figure I could a) get it 30% off now w/ the federal credit, b) i don’t have to scramble to upgrade whenever my current car dies and I buy an EV car, just need to add a couple panels.

Is that a good idea? Or do I wait to get my EV car to get the additional panels and replace my inverter at that time?

&amp;#x200B;

Panels: 10 Panasonic 325 VBHN325SA16

personalfinance,Have some credit card debt with high interest and wondering about balance transfer options.,"Hello all!

I am currently trying my best to get myself as much out of credit card debt as possible and while I currently have a budget in place for my other bills, it seems no matter how many payments on my credit card I make I don't make a dent. Due to some poor choices in my early 20's, I stupidly opened a retail card and have quite literally been paying for it ever since. I know. Completely unwise and boy have I learned. So here's the poop.

My current balance on this card is $2807.10 at 21.15% APR. I have one other credit card with about an $850 balance which I am paying off as well with a much lower balance and interest rate. This second card was used for school charges. I plan on applying for a balance transfer in order to pay the retail card off completely and also cancelling it once the balance is $0.

I was hoping for some insight into how the banks will look at my credit when doing so. The two banks I went to didn't seem to be much help and I also apologize if this seems like general knowledge. I am really trying to get myself in better financial standing and this is my first step.

What factors will they look at when taking my application into consideration besides the actual statement balance? Should I make a few larger payments from my bi-weekly paychecks in order to pay the balance down some in order to transfer as minimal as possible? 

FYI
I make anywhere from $2100-$2700 monthly and the rest of my total monthly bills total out to around $550. No kids, not married and I don't pay rent. I live in CA. Any advice is much appreciated. Thank you!",finance

personalfinance,Need advice on interest rate,"Hi

I‘m from europe, so excuse my english.

I read some posts here and on /financialindependence and everyone is talking about 8% interests while calculating on invested money.
Where the hell do you get 8% interest? Is this a extreme risky asset with chance to loose everything?
I cannot find anything with no to low risk over 1.5% in my country. Medium risk is mostly about +6% to -6% (yes you can loose money if the assets go down)

At the moment I have 150k in my bank account on 0.25% interest. It is eating my money yearly.

I would like to overcome the yearly rising prices.

personalfinance,Calculation check - calculating what happens if I up my repayments,"Just a quick check in with you all.

&amp;#x200B;

If I have a loan of say;

Loan: $100,000

Repayments: 740 fortnights

Interest Rate: 4.74%

&amp;#x200B;

My repayments are $246.29 and in one years time I would have paid down $1,702 worth of principal.

&amp;#x200B;

Now if I up my repayments to $746.29 ($500 more fortnight/$13,000 more over the year) then my calculation is saying the principal I would have paid down is $15,003.

&amp;#x200B;

This means I would have paid principal down of $13,300.62 more than if I had left my repayments at $246.29 i.e. I raised my repayments by $13k but got $13.3k more of principal paid down. 

Is this correct? Should I get more principal paid down than I have added in repayments? Logically it sounds like I am paying less interest as I am paying more, but I didn't think all of the additional repayment amount would fall through as additional paid down principal - does this seem right?",finance

personalfinance,Apartment Lease Ends in July - Thinking of Purchasing a House,"This will be a long post, sorry!

Background:
Hello personal finance. I’m 26 years old, not married. I’ve been in my apartment since March of last year, and my 16 month lease ends this July. I don’t hate it here, but decided that if I was to purchase a house in July, now is the time to start thinking about it (probably should have even sooner). Hoping to get people’s thoughts and advice.

I have a stable local government job currently, been there for 5 years, full time since beginning of 2018. Instead of a 401K we have PERA, which takes mandatory 6.5% of my pay to contribute, and matches the full 6.5%. As of now I don’t contribute separately to any other 401K/IRA. Health is provided, I have the option of contributing each month but don’t.

Monthly Income:
- $3,351 Net

Monthly Expenses:
- $1,175 Rent w/ Cat fee
- $85 Utilities ($55 electric, $30 trash, water, sewer)
- $12.83 Renters Insurance
- $200 Groceries/cat food/other costco purchases
- $138.50 Entertainment/fun
- $130 Car Insurance
- $100 Eating Out
- $75 Gas
- $75 Other/Car Maintenance/Misc.
- $60 internet
- $48 phone
- $32 Car Wash Pass

Total Monthly Expenses: $2,132 rounded up
Leftover: $1,219

Other details, assets and savings:
I’m pretty good at sticking to these numbers each month, and the leftover goes into my savings. I have no debt of any kind (credit card, car loan, student loans, etc.). I have a reliable, newer car (2013 Lexus) with 80K miles that I plan on keeping for a long time. Credit score of around 750.

Funds (NOT counting/considering PERA/work retirement) available for down payment/closing costs: $68,500
- $40,000 in bank
- $13,000 being received soon (family member gift, I know it’s said not to count on these, but I am 99% confident on receiving it, but can plan for w/o if necessary)
- $8500 in investment funds (through Edward Jones, heard some not great things about them on here...)
- $7000 in savings bond (not sure what interest rate is on it, have to check)

Housing Prices:
I’ve been looking at both townhomes and smaller single family homes in my area. The townhomes I’d be interested in are around $190 - $200K. The houses range from $225K - $260K. I don’t want to get myself into anything that would put me in a bad situation financially, which is the reason for this post.

Going with a townhome at the upper end of that range would put my month payment (including mortgage, taxes, insurance and HOA) around $1280/month, which is only about $100 more that what I’m paying now. However, I realize that with owning, there is often additional costs, so I know it wouldn’t only be $100 more every month. This is also assuming a down payment of 20%, roughly $40K, and extra for closing costs (let’s say $5K).

A single family at the upper end would be $1299/month including the same things (minus HOA). Down payment would be bigger at $52K, closing costs of $7.8K.

With the single family homes on the upper end of that price range, I don’t think I would be comfortable paying $60K between the down payment and closing, leaving me with only $8,500 left. I know that I will want an emergency fund of 3-6 months. For monthly payments on the townhouse or single family, I know I have to factor in utilities on top of the monthly costs I listed, as well as a house repair/maintenance fund.

I guess I’m wondering if getting a house is doable for me right now. It seems that most people have a spouse when looking and calculating the monthly incomes vs expenses, with just me it’s more difficult. I am proud of what I’ve saved and having no debt, but I don’t want to ruin my situation by getting too much house to handle. So I’ve just been weighing all the options: keep renting, townhouse, or smaller/lower end single family. All the unknowns that can happen/come up with a house vs renting are on my mind too (repairs and maintenance).

What would would guys think for my situation? I’d like to start building equity, but I’m thinking a single family house, at least at the top of that price range I put, might be too much. Right now I have $1219 leftover each month, so I have room to spend more, but I’m not sure how much more is okay to spend. I’ve thought about putting less than 20% down, which would add a little PMI each month, but I don’t know how small I want to make my surplus each month, compared to $1219 now. I’d like to have enough left to start contributing to an IRA/additional retirement savings.

Is purchasing a townhome and staying in it for 5 years before thinking of upgrading to a single family a decent idea? I am confident that I want to stay at my current job, or at the very least in this area 5+ years.

I’ve also thought about doing another 16 month lease and just keep saving, but looking at the housing prices around here the past few years, it seems they are going up faster than what I save currently ($1000+ a month), which is insane. This makes me feel like saving up to get to the point where I have enough to comfortably put 20% down won’t ever happen. And I know my rent is high at $1175 for a 1BR, but that’s what most of the rent around here is, and I don’t really have many expenses I could cut to save more without loosing my sanity.

This ended up longer than I expected, but I just wanted to lay out the details and get other people’s thoughts. thanks for reading!",finance
CryptoCurrency,"I've been in since May 2017, lessons learned, and some real talk.","I've only been in the crypto game since mid 2017. I remember back then when I was assessing the market, BTC was below $1k a few months earlier, LTC was around $4 that January and by the time I finally got in BTC had more than doubled to around $2,500 and LTC was $30. I thought ETH and XRP (and everything else) were just shitcoins because I didn't know shit and I just listened to the herd (Back then the argument was ""Bitcoin is digital gold and LTC is digital silver and everything else is a scam."") Now, I'm pretty invested in several coins, because this market is anything but rational.

Screw off if you think otherwise. Try to think logically in this market, and you're going to get smacked in the face.

After exchanging my first fiat for crypto, in the next couple of months the market ""crashed"" and I was fearful. By crashed, I mean BTC went from $2,800 to $1,800. I just decided to let my cryptos ride. I pretended that money was gone, but I'd check prices every day for whatever damn reason.

I wasn't even putting that much in. Hell, I would spend more eating out and going to the bars every weekend with friends or work colleagues than I was dropping into BTC. It was pretty common that I'd drop $100 a night on sushi, beers, and Sake Bombs. But, when money you could get back loses value, it makes you feel dumb for putting money in. Logic is out the window when I can't get that $100 back from my sushi and drink purchases, but my crypto dropped 30% that week, so I was dumb for investing in crypto but not for my $500+ per month on eating out and drinking with friends.

Several weeks later, I was back to even on my crypto investments. Well shit, that was fast. Then I was suddenly up 25%. ""Fuck it, I'm just putting money in. I'm not missing out.""

By the the winter of 2017, I was up over 10x with my crypto speculation. My initial LTC went from $30 to over $350; my BTC went from $2,500 to $20,000. I also just threw $300-$1,000 here and there on random sub-200 market cap coins only to see them 6x in a few weeks.

I remember thinking how stupid I was for not buying during that dip down to $1,800, but how good of an investor I was because my gains. What a fucking dope I was.

I was sitting there looking at my account on December 10th, 2017. I was about to sell because I could have paid off my car and 50% of my student loans. I wasn't even using my car because I was in another country traveling.

""Nah, I can't sell. This is just the beginning; let's wait until I can pay off all my student loans"" my delusional self said.

I never cashed out. I remember sitting there with a dude who had his GDAX account open after BTC ""crashed"" from $20k to $13k two weeks later. We just got back from surfing.

He was still sitting at $250,000 in his account and was nervous as shit. ""What should I do?"" he asked rhetorically. Then immediately answered himself, ""It will rebound,"" he said, ""it always does."" This guy had been through the MTGOX hack and gave me plenty of advice while we surfed.

And I listened as if he was prophetic.

What a fucking dope I was.

When hopium is in the air, we all get irrational.

I still wonder about that guy and his cryptos. He went north back home for the Christmas holiday, while I headed south for more traveling, and I've never seen him again.

February 2018 was both euphoric and scary as shit. ""Holy shit! BTC is under $10k I never thought it would be down here again. But it could keep dropping. But it was just $20k a month ago.""

I was skeptical that it wouldn't keep dropping so I waited. Then, I didn't want to miss out. BTC was making a run from $6,500 up to testing $10k. ""If it breaks $10k, I'm getting back in.""

A short time later, it did break $10k, only to be hit a wall at $12k, then again...then, the inevitable crash to $6,200 happened where it fluctuated in August - November of 2018 up until, what, November 10th-ish when BCH shitfork shat out and then BTC-Shit-Vision and BTC-LMNOP started paying miners to mine their forked fork of BTC and everyone shat themselves as the market tanked yet again.

That was it for me. That was the day I stopped caring. I remember thinking how stupid I was to invest so much time in this.

You can't predict this shit.

I didn't regret investing in crypto, I regret all the time spent looking at my portfolio, trying to time the market, pretending I was some guru in my head because I threw $300 at POE when it was less than a penny and weeks later it was selling for $0.21 and could buy another trip to whatever country I wanted.

Sure, you can use TA to see what support or resistance is there, but it's still a 50-50 chance whether Fake Satoshi is going to spoof trade or some rando is going to drop three 7,000 BTC market buys to break through resistance.

So, what did I learn through this whole experience?

Other than what I've already stated (You have no way to predict whether it's breaking through resistance or crashing through support).

I just remember the main thing that has persisted this last two years. ""I wish I could go back in time to when BTC was around $3,000 and LTC was $30.""

When BTC dropped below, $4k that was heaven. I never thought it would get back to when I was buying when I first got into the market in 2017.

So, I bought, and I bought hard.

This time around, I have strong buy strategies and sell strategies.

They are set; no question.

For me, I'm not selling until two weeks before the LTC halving in August.

Even then, I'm only selling my LTC for BTC. Then I'll sell 25% of my BTC for fiat 2 weeks before the BTC halving in 2020.

I will never have less than my preferred number of BTC's, ETH's, LTC's and a few others.

Don't follow my advice here, I'm just saying I know what I want and what my strategy is.

You need to have a strategy to buy and strategy to sell. Be reasonable. I previously had a ""strategy."" It was once I could pay off my student loans with all of my crypto gains minus taxes, I would sell. Yeah, well, looking back if I would have just sold when could pay off my car and 50% of my student loans, I would have been able to invest even more when BTC was down in $3,xxx range and LTC was $22-$35, etc from December 2018 through March 2019.

DCAing is the way to go. No question. You don't need to do TA, you don't need to check your portfolio, you don't need to do shit but either 1) setup an automatic buy order with your exchange or 2) login and buy whatever you want.

You have your buy strategy (DCA at x interval) and you have your sell strategy.

Figure it out. Don't pretend you're gonna time the market. Don't pretend you're some guru.

Those people, like me, learn the hard way.

No TA, no waiting for google searches of BTC to increase, no waiting for BAKKT, no waiting for Faktoshi to shut the fuck up.

Before November 2018, I would only throw money when BTC was on a run. ""Oh, we're finally on the way up. It's time to buy!"" Like when it went from $2,800 up to $6,200 in the summer 2017, then from $10k to $20k in late 2017. Or when it went from $6,200 back up to $10,000 then to $11,900 in February of 2018.

I would think I could time the market. What a pathetic loser, right?

Some people grow up in this market like the cable version of themselves only to transition to the directv version. Listen to us dopes that have been there and done that.

Learn from our mistakes, but also don't think that we have all the damn answers.

Anyone that comes in here acting like the 2nd coming of Craig Wright's dumpster twin, you can be rest assured they are as delusional as Justin Sun. The problem is, even if they are delusional, this market is anything but rational, so they might just be proven right enough for you to think you should follow their advice.

This shit is crazy. Stop acting like you've got it figured out.

Nobody does, but it feels good to have confidence in this random speculation, right?

I'm here to tell you this. My life has drastically improved since November 2018 when I started viewing Crypto investments like a bill. Every two weeks, I would send money from my paycheck to my exchange. Then, I'd buy a certain amount every single week after it had cleared.

That money, is all but ""gone.""  It was a ""bill"" I paid.

When the market is going down, I send more fiat and I buy more crypto. When it is rising, I still buy, but not as much; I pull back. You may say I'm trying to catch a falling knife. I just learned that the way I was investing before was bad practice. I'd rather people think I'm trying to catch a falling knife than to feel that FOMO and only buy when the market is up.

Right now for example, I'm not buying this week. Not because I think I know what hell is going to happen, but because it's my strategy to not chase a run, and to spend more when it drops.

I'll wait until next weekend and see what the market is doing.

What happens in between now and next weekend, I don't give a shit.

Could I miss out on another run? Sure, but I don't give a shit. Maybe it's because I'm 2 years in and I've seen this shit before, or maybe it's because I've been buying BTC when it was around $3,000 both in 2017 and just about a month ago, so I feel fortunate to have gotten another chance at BTC at $3,xxx.

I also learned my lesson that fakeouts happen. I've been burned enough to not give a shit about being BTC going from $3500 to $5,200 in the last, what, 5 weeks?

Been here, done it, don't give a shit.

I don't know if this helps anyone, but seeing the last two years of this shit, I don't care about some random 30% pump. I also don't care that BCH is up 86%, or ADA is up whatever it is. I'm not into them, but if you made gains, I'm happy for you.

I'm serious too.

Maybe you're new to this game, or maybe you've only been in since $20k. If so, you're still here, and there are plenty others like you. I'm not a BTC maximalist, I don't think LTC is the truth, I don't think only ETH is the dApp platform.

I don't know shit. I'm just some speculator that is speculating on some of this sit.

There are also plenty of people that were like me in 2017 that are waiting in the wings, only to buy when the market is on the rise. There are plenty more that buy when it's rising then set stop losses that whales will fish for only to wreck the market in a day then to see a bounce back even stronger while those people FOMO back in.

Also, the turd version of satoshi could start shitting in public this week and the media could write about how Satoshi is literally shitting on a physical Bitcoin as we speak and some shitcoin creator then posts a Twitter video that goes viral about how the hashrate and energy consumption of the satoshi shit-pile is not sustainable and then some whale market sells down to below the new TA shit-support level of $4,400 and then all the dopes with stop losses in that range get shit fucked only to see a spoof limit order set at $4,400 of 10,000 BTC and everyone's dick shrinks into their stomach as they hurry to Tether as BTC drops back down to $3,500 before whale #2 shit fucks your emotions with a $1,500 green dildo in a 15 minute span sees the ""sell wall"" disappear which starts the next FOMO run on up to $6,200 a few weeks later while TAers say ""We broke out on great volume"" then other TAers agree and the self-fulling prophecy starts another run only to get hit with more whale fuckers.

You can't predict this shit. Give it up.

Market goes up, market goes down, can't explain that.

With the LTC halving in August, the BTC halving in May 2020, I think we are about to get into the 2017 euphoria again though. We are getting close^(TM) to the point you could just thrown money at any coin and get 10x your investment.

What does ""close"" mean? I have no idea. Eff anyone that thinks they know. Someone could predict it is this week, next month, or after this current fakeout bull run, or in December, or next Spring, and someone will be right.

The only advice I have is to do your best to not get emotional about your money or crypto. It's going to do the exact opposite of what you think it will. Even when you try to do the opposite, crypto will shit-fuck you in your sleep.

If you believe that the sentiment is changing, and let's be real, we are in speculation phase and this is all based on hopium and belief, then DCA at certain intervals.

This isn't some cult. It's all based on sentiment. If you think people are starting to get interested, then that is a sign speculation is about to be in our favor.

If you are putting money in that needs to be rent money, do yourself a favor and just walk into a casino and put it all on red. If you win, then put your winnings in crypto. If you lose, I saved you the anguish of checking your portfolio every hour only wish you would have done the opposite of what you did.

You're welcome...

Or, do the opposite. Check the market every hour for the next 12 months only to look back and realize that you kept buying on the way up, got scared and sold on the way down, and then FUD yourself in your sleep because of your stop loss sells were triggered while whales were fishing for fear.

**So, there are all of my shit thoughts. What are yours?**

What are your strategies?

There are plenty of people that have been in longer than me, what are your strategies?

Are we heading for a the next bull run? Is the bottom in? Do we still have a massive, short-lived capitulation event coming?

Let's chat.

**TL;DR**: You can't predict this shit, just DCA, live your life, get a buy strategy, choose a sell point, make this shit as simple as possible. If you try to complicate things by predicting the next run, the next drop, the next consolidation, then you're probably going to be wrong like 99% of people. And don't be that guy that ends up $250,000 in your account in the next bull run only to see it drop down $67,000 literally a week later.",cryptocurrency

Looking for some advice on just about everything because everyone has different perspectives and it can be helpful to learn. I graduated in May at 32 years old after not finishing my first degree when i was 18-22 due to family / personal issues.  Due to those issues and not finishing at the time I am currently on the hook for 100k in student loans which i have @ 6% through SOFI. I also have about 2k in credit card debt which is currently on a 0 % interest rate until Feb 2020.   No car payment, and my job pays 75k-82k a year, with a guaranteed 5% raise each year.

&amp;#x200B;

My retirement is currently sitting at 5% into a Roth per week, and I have a pension plan which puts 3.5 % of my pay + a minimal interest increase of 5% and max of 12%. 

&amp;#x200B;

My housing is sitting at roughly 1300 a month, and my loans are around 750 a month.  I've started looking into side hustles, as i can work under the table and make extra cash, or even do uber eats.  My spending is pretty in check. I could be better, but I just recently moved and had some expenses.

I've also picked up a ccopy of the Intelligent Investor for when I can start investing.

How should i approach my debt? 

My credit score has increased significantly since i refinanced my student loans, should i re-refinance them?

personalfinance,A Guide to Efficient Banking,"**tl;dr** \- Checking accounts are over-used. You should keep most of your money in a high-yield savings account and use credit cards for all of your purchases. The credit cards should AutoPay from your savings account. Checking accounts should only store money you might need for immediate transfers, such as ATM withdraws or Paypal/Venmo.

# A Guide to Efficient Banking

**""Efficiency is intelligent laziness""**

I'm a very lazy person. However - I've found a system for my finances that works well for me. It's easy to manage, and I believe it to be a significant improvement over ""typical"" banking.

When I say **typical banking**, this is what I mean:

* Checking Accounts: Used for money you plan on spending (bills, food, gas, etc.)
* Savings Account: Used for money you don't plan on spending anytime soon (emergencies, retirement)
* Credit Card Account: Used for purchases you can't afford but have to make - avoid if possible (hospital bills, car repairs)

If you agree with ANY of those 3 statements, you may benefit from this post. If you'd like to skip the storytelling, scroll down to the ""Efficient Setup"" section.

**""Are we doing this because it's right, or because it's the way it's always been done?""**

This is one of my favorite questions to ask during meetings at work, and I recently found myself asking the same question about my bank accounts. In order to accurately answer this question, I decided to analyze the different types of accounts and track my thoughts.

**Breakdown: Checking Account**

There is no limit on monthly transactions. Money used in purchases immediately leaves your account. ATMs allow you to withdraw cash. Account balance typically accrues little to no interest.

* A checking account is like a 'digital wallet'. It's almost identical to carrying around cash. I can't spend cash I don't have - cash leaves my wallet as soon as I spend it - I don't earn cash by leaving it in my wallet.

**Breakdown: Savings Account**

There is a limit of 6 monthly transactions. Money used in purchases immediately leaves your account. Account balance can accrue higher amounts of interest.

* Woah - the interest rates on these accounts are nice. If I had a debit card for a savings account, and if it weren't for the monthly transaction limit, I wouldn't even need a checking account.

**Breakdown: Credit Card Account**

There is no limit on monthly transactions, but there is a limit on monthly spending. Money used in purchases stays in your account until the credit card payment is made. Rather than gaining interest, you risk being charged interest if you don't pay the full statement balance. If you can't make the minimum payment, there are other fees as well. To motivate usage, many credit cards have a ""rewards"" program for points or cash back. Some credit cards also have signing bonuses - such as a period of low interest or an 'initial spending' reward. Like most ""bills"", allows for Automatic Payments. Proper usage builds credit history, which may help in future financial situations.

* Being charged fees for missed payments is scary, but if I set up automatic payments than I should be fine. I don't want to be charged interest either, so I definitely don't want to make any purchases I can't afford paying off immediately. The signing bonuses and rewards are enticing though, and I want to improve my credit score.

**Breakdown: Conclusion**

After breaking everything down - I started trying to piece it back together. The ""typical banking"" routine didn't hold up. Rather than only keeping a subset of funds in a savings account and avoiding credit cards, it would be much better to only keep a subset of funds in a checking account and utilize credit cards for all purchases. This would maximize cash back rewards and maximize interest earned on money. Not only that - since a credit card transaction doesn't immediately remove the money from your account, the money will accrue interest in the savings account for longer.

# The ""Efficient"" Setup

* Checking Account: Used for money you may need to use immediately. For example, ATM withdraws and Paypal/Venmo Transfers. I almost never have these types of transactions, so I keep about $150 in my checking account.
* Savings Account: Used for all money that isn't in the checking account. Use for Automatic Payments to your credit cards, adding more funds to your checking account, and transactions that can't go on the credit card (maybe rent, car payment, credit cards)
   * You can open multiple Savings accounts if it helps you track specific savings goals, or if you need more than 6 monthly transactions you can't make on a credit card.
   * If you aren't lazy, you might want to take a portion of this money and do other fancy finance things instead of letting it stay in a high-yield savings account
* Credit Card Accounts: Used for as many transactions as possible to maximize cash back/rewards. You only need 1 card for this setup to work, but you might benefit from having multiple cards.

**Specific Setup**

Checking Account: I use Charles Schwab for my checking account. It's an online bank with no monthly fees, unlimited ATM rebates, and 0.40% APY interest. I never really deal with cash, so I am fine with an online bank. This bank plays well into my expected usage of the account.

* Read More: [https://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/banking\_lending/checking\_account](https://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/banking_lending/checking_account)
* Note: If you can get a referral code, Schwab will give you $100 after 1 month of having your account open.

Savings Account: I use Ally for my savings account. It's also an online bank with no monthly fees. It currently offers 2.18% interest, compounded daily, which is estimated to be a 2.20% Annual Percentage Yield.

* Link:  [https://www.ally.com/bank/online-savings-account/](https://www.ally.com/bank/online-savings-account/) 

Credit Cards: I use 3 different credit cards. You should find the right credit card(s) for you, but here is what worked for me:

* Citi Double Cash
   * This card gets 2% cash back on all purchases. I use this card for monthly bills (power, internet, phone) and any purchase I don't use another card for. If you only wanted to use 1 credit card - this would be my recommendation.
   * Read More:  [https://www.citi.com/credit-cards/credit-card-details/citi.action?ID=citi-double-cash-credit-card](https://www.citi.com/credit-cards/credit-card-details/citi.action?ID=citi-double-cash-credit-card) 
* Barclays Uber
   * I use this for 4% on dining and 3% on hotels/airfare. It also has a signing bonus - spend $500 in the first 90 days for $100 cash back. If you're planning on applying for multiple cards - apply for this one first. Barclays is picky. I have a good credit score, but I was still denied. I called their reconsideration line and was approved after a 2 minute phone call.
   * Read More:  [https://cards.barclaycardus.com/banking/cards/uber-visa-card/](https://cards.barclaycardus.com/banking/cards/uber-visa-card/) 
* CapitalOne SavorOne
   * I use this for 3% on entertainment and 2% on grocery. It also has 2 signing bonuses. First, spend $500 in the first 90 days for $150 cash back. Second, 0% APY for the first 15 months. I'm ""budgeting"" the full statement balance on this card, but only making minimum payments during the 0% APY period. If I had outstanding credit debt, I would have done a balance transfer to this card (3% fee) and then paid off as much as possible when the 0% APY period ended.
   * Link:  [https://www.capitalone.com/credit-cards/savorone-dining-rewards/](https://www.capitalone.com/credit-cards/savorone-dining-rewards/) 

I've been operating like this for a couple of months now. I had to do some work up front, to open the accounts and change my direct deposit account info, but that wasn't too bad. I also had to change my payment info for my monthly bills. My rent charges a $25 fee if I use a credit card, so it pays straight from my savings account. After that, all I had to do is use the right card for the right purchase. The automatic payments take care of the rest. I'm only using 4 of my 6 monthly transactions for my savings account.

**Results**

This setup won't make you rich, but I guarantee it will be better than ""typical"" banking. It will save you 2% to 4% on almost all of your purchases and will earn you \~2.2% APY on more of your money. Since it's a percentage-based difference, the benefit is different for each person and is also different month-to-month. The best part is how simple it is. Once you get it set up, it's mostly automated. Just use the right card for the right purchase, and don't spend money you don't have.",finance
personalfinance,3 years of unfiled taxes and I don’t even know where to begin.,"Hi everyone,
As my title states, I have 3 years of unfiled taxes.  I realize that this is extremely irresponsible and I’m not here looking for criticism, just advice.    

In the year 2016 I was working as a bar manager for a guy who himself never paid any taxes. He swore by itemization and claimed all sorts of things in a massive report he filed with his accountant every year. We were encouraged to follow his lead, and none of us paid Federal Income Tax (I was in Texas, so no state tax). That’s where my problem starts. I was working insane hours for the guy and never had time to actually go through and line item my returns, so when the date of my extension rolled around I let them fall by the wayside. Additionally, one of the businesses I was working for in 2015 dissolved and I can’t get my tax information from them to file in 2016. 

2017 rolls around and being in a bad mental spot at work and home, I end up doing the same thing.    

2018 happens, and I move to California to be with my now girlfriend. I pay all of my taxes, but don’t file because I’m now terrified that I’m going to be taken for every one of my dollars.    

2019: I’ve been in California for over a year now and have been a proper human being paying taxes, etc. I can’t let this shit go on any longer and I need to get it taken care of. I want to marry this woman and really want to have all of my finances in order before we take that step.

As for our cell service, we have to use Verizon as it's the only thing that picks up at our house. We're on a family plan with a couple of other people and we only pay for our half of the service.

Don't have a lawn mower so can't mow our own grass. Have it cut twice per month at $50 a pop.

The Doctor bills mentioned are actually a collection that I've settled on and set up payments. Can't get around that one.

Health insurance is not offered by my job because technically I'm self-employed. I had to purchase through the marketplace, but I did receive some financial assistance with that - otherwise it would have been $500+ a month.

PayPal Credit is definitely our fault. I had to purchase a new laptop in order to do my work ($1,000+) and there are a couple of other things we didn't *need*, but wanted at the time. Nothing we can do about that now since we bought this stuff a long time ago. Most of it is accrued interest.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I'm not sure what to do to make things work. My husband has excellent credit and I have mediocre credit. We tried to get a loan to consolidate a lot of this stuff, but my bad credit made our interest rate ridiculous and he's not able to get the loan on his own. Any advice is appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,"Consolidating credit card debt and paying it off, while abroad","Hey r/personalfinance!

I recently moved to Germany with my husband for his job, which is a 3-year contract. We have some high interest credit card debt back in the US that we’re finally in a position to really tackle, but since it’s high interest, I feel like we’re working harder, unnecessarily, to make the minimum payment AND work off the principal.

(For context, we have about $8,000 on a Capital One Venture card with about 20% interest, [a series of unforeseen events made this debt this high and kept it that way. Glad to finally have a chance to pay it off!] and a Wells Fargo credit card with about $4,000 on it, interest rate unknown.)

I’d like to consolidate both debts and pay them off with a loan, and then pay off the loan (with a lower interest rate) instead.

My questions:

-Is this actually the best idea? Are there other options, aside from a loan, that I should consider? My timeframe to pay all $12,000 off is about 2 years or less.

-Since we’ve already moved, I’m wondering if it’s still possible to get a loan from a US bank. Do I need to apply in person, or do anything that I couldn’t easily do from abroad? (If getting a loan here is an option, I’d prefer *not* to take that route, just in case we, for some reason, aren’t able to fully pay it off before we head back to the US once this contract ends.)

Thanks in advance for any advice!",finance
personalfinance,Graduating in a month with $140K in student loan debt. Looking for reassurance/advice.,"I am a senior studying Mechanical Engineering at Boston University, and in about 5 weeks I will be graduating with what feels like an overwhelming amount of debt. While I am confident in my abilities as a student, I do not yet have a job lined up. I plan to live at home (rent free) for as long as possible, immediately following graduation. I am trying to be as real about this as possible. 

I have been refering to r/personalfinance and r/StudentLoans for guidance, but right now I feel defeated. I'm not looking for pity, and I take ownership of the fact that I alone put myself in this situation. I just hope that you guys will be able to look at my gameplan and be able to tell me that everything will be okay. 

Here's a breakdown of my loans as they stand today:

Loan Type|Servicer|Principal ($)|Interest Rate (%)
:--------|:---------|---------:|---------:
Stafford (Subsidized + Unsubsidized)|MOHELA|27,000|4.39
Private (Academic Answer Loan)|Suntrust|29,300|8.95
Private|Discover|24,130|10.49
Private|Discover|28,665|11.99
Private|Discover|31,093|11.59


I will be moving back home to East Tennessee, where the average base salary for an entry-level mechanical engineer is around $70k. From my experience looking at salaries on various job postings, I believe that my actual salary will be more around $60k. I still need to get a job though... My resume is decent, and my GPA is a 3.66, so I'm not freaking out about that just yet. My credit score is 760-770, and I have been establishing credit over the past 4 years. I'm hoping that this will help me as I look for private loan consolidation options. 

In terms of expected living expenses, I haven't really figured out a good estimate, but I will be keeping these as low as possible. No going out, cooking at home as much as possible, shopping at thrift stores etc. As mentioned before, I plan to live at home, where I my rent will be paid in chores more or less. I do not have any other outstanding loans or consistent payments (i.e. car payment). 

My mom has planned her whole life to help me pay for college, but at this stage in her life I do not know how much of a contribution she will be able to make. She is a single mother and works as a high school teacher. I have nothing  but respect for what she does, but it's just a fact that there's not a lot of money to be made teaching. We also have some money (I'm not sure the exact amount) in a college fund, and I have about 6k in savings. 

I think that the first order of business is to consolidate my private loans at a more favorable interest rate. I am also planning to absolutely pay off the interest on my federal loans before it capitalizes. I also still need to figure out which payment plan to use for the federal loans. I'm confused by how PAYE and other income-based plans work if I still don't have a job by the time the grace period ends.

I guess the questions I have can be summed up as the following:

* Are there any recomendations for a loan consolidation service? Should I go for fixed or variable rate on the consolidated loan?
* How should I use the money that I have in savings + college fund? I know the general advice is to apply it to the highest interest rate loan, but I don't know if I should consolidate first. 
* The values I listed for the federal loans appear as though they are consolidated, but in reality they are a collection of 8 loans with different interest rates. Does the advice of paying off the highest interest rate apply here, or is it better to just consolidate now? 
* What payment method is best for the federal loans? I plan to be employed ASAP, but I'm not sure what to do if I don't get a job soon. 
* Am I gonna make it out of this giant hole alive??

Thank you for reading this. I think that last year is when I really started to feel as though my choice of school was a mistake, given my experiences reading material on this sub. The weight of my decision has suddenly become the only thing that I can think about, and I partially wrote this post as a way to compartmentalize how I'm feeling. I already regret not having gone somewhere in-state, where I could have avoided loans altogether. Hindsight really is a bitch.

personalfinance,Identify Theft and Chase Refuse to Refund My Money After 180 days.,"My credit card was used to purchase things online for $1400 six months ago, the merchandise was sent to the local FedEX and picked up by someone with a fake ID.

and six months later, my bank sent me the letter said they are not going to refund me the money, unless I get the surveillance tape of the pick-up. but Fedex only store the footage for 30 days.

Any experts know what could I do under this condition? Big thank you in advance!

Wondering what else could I do on this case?

Thanks for all the amazing suggestions so far!

**UPDATE 04/10/2019:**

A lot of things happened today.

Received the letter from Chase said they have closed my case, the money will remain on my bills and the case will not be reopened again only if I got the camera footage.

Contacted NYPD this morning, they don't let me to meet the detective, saying the detective is busy, and I should come to the police station only when he called me, but I believe there is no one care about my case and investigating it, I even don't know who the detective is. REAL NYPD.

I asked them for a 2nd police report to prove that the camera footage doesn't exist anymore after 6 months, they said they don't do that.

I can't get any help from NYPD here.

&amp;#x200B;

Contacted with the online store where the fraud order was placed, they told me they also got chargeback for the full amount.

Chase told them the case was resolved in the customer's favor, Chase bank sided with me (What the hell).

That means, the store didn't get the money, I didn't get the money, Chase kept it for themselves. GGWP.",finance

personalfinance,Should I pay of my car now?,"Im normally a lurker, but I'm looking for some advice on my current situation. I recently did a lot of credit repair, I went from about a 515 in Oct 2017, to 670ish right now. I financed a car in Oct of 2017 but due to my poor credit my interest rate is 24%. I know its unbelievably high but live and learn. I owe $6,500 left on it. Payments are $288, and I have the loan until Oct. 2021. I have $7,300 in my savings, and $1,000 in my checking. I make roughly $1500 every two weeks, sometimes more with OT (Ive been averaging $1800 the last couple months). With my car payment, my bills come to $1000 every month. Should I just pay my car off now and be done, or wait until I hit $10,000 in the bank. Waiting was my original plan so I have a little safety net, but with the interest being that high, I figured I can do it now and just continue to save since my total monthly bills will drop to about a quarter of my monthly income, thats including rent. I also thought about opening another savings account, moving $3000 to it, and never touching it. Then put everything left to the car, and aggressively paying off the rest over the next couple months. My rent is only $435 a month, so $3000 would give me roughly a 6 month cushion if something goes wrong. What are your thoughts?",finance

personalfinance,Discontent with my corporate job. Is there a way out?,"Hi everyone,

Not sure if this is the best place to post this but figured it would be a good start at the very least in order to make some changes in my life.

Background: I am a 26 year old single male who is very discontent and unhappy with his work situation.

I perform IT consulting work for a large tech company you have almost certainly heard about but I find the work very soul sucking and the politics/bureaucracy maddening. 

A recent project that I was assigned to required my team to typically work 10-11 hour days and although I got a good review, working that much while doing mind numbing repetitive tasks or participating in long meetings with no clear agenda takes its toll on you after a while.

It has gotten to the point where I am simply ""going through the motions"" and doing just enough to make it look like I am being somewhat productive.

Even that is coming to an end soon though as I was recently released from an internal assignment I was on (the official reason was that somebody else more experienced with the necessary skills required was already staffed on the billable role I was proposed for, but I am not 100% sure this is true because I got chewed out over a conference call over something very minor that was blown out of proportion with the staffing manager present. Either way, it is what it is and I have moved on.)

I would much rather do something creative (I am very passionate about retro arcade games/pinball) as I have finally realized that our time on this earth is limited but unfortunately don't see a way out as I wasn't born into a family with their own business or anything of that nature. 

Regardless, here is my financial situation:

**Before-tax income**: $85,000

**Investments**:Approximately $40,000 (Roth IRA, 401k, crypto currency, etc)

**Savings**: Approximately $28,000 in cash.

**Debts**: None (I paid off my student loans last year and drive a 2008 Ford Mustang GT I paid cash for)

I currently live at home with my parents but would like to either purchase a small house or rent an apartment once my employment situation is straightened out.

What should I do? Should I suck it up and stay with the company I am with right now, find another corporate job that pays less but is more enjoyable (has never been easy due to my anxiety/depression issues) and save more for a possible creative business on the side, or something else?

Thank you for your time.",finance

personalfinance,"Just purchased a Toyota CPO, high interest?","Hello,

I recently purchased a 2017 Toyota Corolla CPO. The car list price was $16,000 and I offered $15200 and drove off with the car. They tried to negotiate monthly payments but I was more interested in the overall price of the car and didn't want any extended warranties. I put down $4000.00 and financed the rest. When I purchased the car, the dealer said there would be multiple credit companies that would offer me different rates. When I purchased the car and got thrown into the finance room, I noticed the interest rate was what I thought was high based on my credit score. I asked if that was the lowest one and he said yes. The interest rate was 6.39% but my credit score is a 773. I am 24, have a stable high paying job, and have six years including two renting years of never missing a payment. I asked him may I see the other interest rates and he wouldn't let me see them based on ""privacy issues"" but let me know one was ~7% and only two companies offered financing.  I have a few questions that I've been looking to clear up.

1.) Is that even legal what he did? It is my credit score, I should be able to see the banks that offered me financing and interest rates. 

2.) Should I just refinance the account through a credit union? I believe I can get around a 3% interest rate with a credit union I just recently joined. Will this take a hit on my credit since it's another hard inquiry?

personalfinance,High yield checking/savings accounts and use of debit cards?,"Hi all! Question for this marvelous community. We currently use one of the big banks and are looking to move our checking/savings account to an online option. We are currently earning 0.5% interest at our big bank and we could be earning 2.25% with an online account. It seems like a no brainer however these online accounts require you to use your debit card at least 10-15 times per month. I don’t like using my debit card anywhere because of all the online hacks at retailers and online. I don’t even have a MasterCard or Visa logo on mine so if someone gets ahold of my card they have to use the pin.  I like the security of using a credit card in cause of fraud.

So why do banks require that you use your debit card to receive those kinds of interest rates? If we have direct deposit and use the account for bill pay and cash withdrawals why isn’t that good enough? Thoughts...",finance
personalfinance,Retirement withdrawal for home purchase questions,"* I am under contract to buy a new home.  
* The new home settlement date is in 39 days.  
* I have a buyer for my current home.

* I have three retirement accounts with various amounts of money from previous jobs.  My retirement account at my current job is still new and isn't worth touching yet.  
* The account with the least money in it is at $28,000.  

In addition to what I have saved, I need to come up with $10,000 to pay for the down payment and closing costs of the new home. If I borrow it, when my current home sells, I will have more than enough money to pay it back. I was told that the IRS allows for a withdrawal from an account without taxes or penalty if I open another account for the same amount within 60 days. Is this accurate? I know that 20% federal and 5% state will be withheld from the $28,000 giving me $21,000 in hand. This is where I get confused and no one at my 401k company can help, as they aren't allowed to give tax advice. If I put 28,000 back into a retirement plan, do I get the $7,000 that was withheld as a refund on my taxes at the end of the year? If I put $21,000 back into the plan before 60 days, does that $7,000 count as income and I get taxed on that? Do they just keep the $7,000? Do I end up paying penalties on money that was actually just a tax payment? Can I put the money directly into my current work 401k or do I need to open yet another account? Do I have other options that I am not aware of? Is there any reason to roll the money from my older 401k's into my current work one? If I roll money into my current work account, can I borrow from it in time? Is this totally not worth doing and I should try to dig up the money some other way?

And I toss some groceries or gas on each card once a month to keep them active and pay the full balance immediately. Our only other debt is 2 vehicles and a camper.

The camper, I've been paying huge chunks on and it'll be paid just before we qualify in June. If we need to refinance the vehicles to lower our monthly payments and debt to income, it shouldn't be a problem. Only reason I haven't is because the length of the current loans are good for credit score, and I don't want ""new loans"". They're both on bankruptcy level interest rates, so they'll get redone very soon after signing on a house. 

I've budgeted the next 3 years, using highest expected expenses and lowest expected income. Planned for property taxes, a repair fund, and family toys I'm sure we will someday want. College for the kids has a great start with veteran benefits, and retirement looks comfy if we keep it within my fixed.

As we hit our final approach to buying in June, what are some common blind spots I may be missing? Is there anything obvious I'm missing or am seeing wrong? It's a big step, and I've put in a lot of work getting us here. I would hate to be blindsided, so don't mind answering inquisition level questions to test our plan.

Thanks for all input and advice! Also, any tips on what to look for and avoid in a mortgage company would be appreciated.

My current savings account has a .25% interest rate compounded quarterly. Not great but also not terrible. This account has no monthly, withdrawal, transfer or ATM fees. It is a state bank with great customer service.

geothermal,Could humanity adapt to survive on geothermal heat if the sun disappeared?,"Amateur sci-fi writer here, pondering the credibility of this concept.

Imagine if the sun effectively vanished. Earth's trajectory would become linear, and, most probably, we'd drift for a thousand years or more without colliding into anything, because space is mostly... well, space. We'd have about 8 minutes before the last of the Sun's light hit us. Thenceforth we'd have to rely on artificial light to live and, if implementable(?) grow food with.   
By the end of 1 week temperature's would reach freezing point. By the end of 1 year temperature's would be colder than Antarctica. Society would have to have adapted radically by this point for any chance at survival.  
I think this might be enough time for humanity to tap into geothermal energy. I don't for a minute imagine this would be done as methodically and future-proofed as would be optimal. But couldn't we crudely hack some heat from below the earth's crust and channel it into some hastily insulated environment? Is that completely implausible? What about the heat emitted from volcanoes? Could we somehow live by this?  
Would love to hear some intelligent discussion of this.

solar,Considering a Lease or PPA? This might be helpful.,"As an installer who sells systems, naturally I'm biased. But I have good reason to be.

&amp;#x200B;

(I'm not sure I can include links in posts here so instead I'll direct you to a recent article published by Bloomberg about a SunRun lease.)

&amp;#x200B;

There was a thread here not to long ago where the homeowner wanted to buy out the lease he had with one of the big nationals. (SolarCity, I think). The buyout amount was around $30K but the homeowner figured that the array was worth about half that. From a material price standpoint, he was probably correct but I did the math and looked at the remaining value of the agreement and its remaining value was, big surprise &lt;sarcasm&gt;, about $30K.

When you are buying out a lease or PPA, you are NOT buying the equipment. You are buying out of the remaining value of the agreement/contract?

Why do these lease/ppa arrangements exist?

1. Big solar company installs array for you does is as cheaply as possible (even cutting corners - yes I know it's hard to imagine that a mega company hiring unskilled workers will cut corners &lt;more sarcasm&gt;)
2. They ""give"" the homeowner a discount on the kWh that are generated on the roof. That discount results in immediate savings to the customer.
3. They take the federal tax credit (30%) - and if they can't use the tax credit themselves, they sell them. Imagine you are &lt;big solar company&gt; and you have $1M tax credit. With the help of lots of lawyers and accountants, you sell that tax credit to &lt;really profitable big company or investor&gt; but you sell it at a 10% discount. So &lt;really profitable big company/investor saves $1,000,000 in taxes for $900,000. Or a 10% Return and &lt;big solar company&gt; gets $900,000 in cash.
4. They also get the accelerated depreciation - further shielding them from taxes (I'm not sure if this can be monetized like the tax credit since I'm not a big company accountant or lawyer but if there is a way, they will find it.) (We've also seen solar companies like SunPower divesting of their leases - that means they sell the lease to another company and they get cash for the lease and they are no longer responsible for it)
5. They collect payments for the homeowner for 20 years. Net effect is that the system they put on your roof is paid for in a few years (my most recent math is about 3-5 years assuming &lt;big solar company&gt; can use or sell all the tax benefits). That means every payment they get from the homeowner after the break-even is profit....

Oh, and as part of the sales process, they tell you that they ""take care of all the maintenance"" - Having been in this business 13 years, I can say with the highest degree of confidence that there is very little if any maintenance on a system other than cleaning if you live in dryer climates. (I'm in New England, it rains and snows, so we do not have to clean panels here). The very first PV system I installed was in 2007 (12 Sanyo 200-watt panels, Solectria PVI-2500, Unirac SunFrame racking). We've been back once because of some sort of power surge (perhaps a lightning strike in the area). A quick clean up of some wire in a junction box, and the array was back and running - we covered it under warranty).

Do systems break down? The number one issue is the customers network - they lose access to their monitoring. That is often fixed with a phone call - in fact, our office manager (non-techie) handles most of the lost internet related calls.

Occasionally an inverter fails. But if you've installed with a reputable installer, they'll fix it (I'll write about reputable installers vs. ""Chuck and a Truck"" installers some other time) . The inverters have 10-25 year warranties (SolarEdge is 12 out of the box and can be extended to 25, Enphase is 25). Even if you had to replace an inverter outside of warranty, or you had to pay a bit of labor on a warranty service call, you'll still be economically way ahead of the lease/PPA.

(It is quite rare for a panel to fail, they do get broken occasionally, branches, snow, ice, soccer balls)

And of course, when you go to sell your house, the solar array is an asset, not a liability. You won't have the lien from &lt;big solar company&gt; (or whoever they sold the lease to) hanging over the property.",energy

I Also bought it at WAY under means at the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

since then, Ive basically doubled my salary, and a lot of my friends/etc have done similar. They all have nicer places, in nicer areas.   

&amp;#x200B;

When I invite people over they are often a little like ""huh?"", when they see my place, given my lifestyle inflation in other areas OTHER than my house. the neighborhood isn't super good either. I like nicer things (foodie, travel, etc), and dress pretty well, so its a bit odd to them (and most people). 

&amp;#x200B;

On one end, I feel the ""pull"" to move to a nicer area closer to the things I enjoy.  I'm not far from them (only about 10 minute drive). I also dont like the odd looks from people and girls ive gone on dates with when they see my place.  I also dont have anything in common with my neighbors(mostly lower income/blue collar), although they are very nice people. 

&amp;#x200B;

on the other end, my mortgate+taxes+insurace is such a low percentage of my take home income (12%) that I barely feel it, which allows me to save a ton for retirement while still going out and enjoying life. If I move and get a nicer place in the area I want, it would move up to around 25% of my take home pay - which is still decent.

personalfinance,10% Down or 20% down to save escrow and avoid PMI? Or invest the difference,"Hello, 

I'm working with a lender and I trying to find out the optimal course of action regarding the loan. Here are some details. 

Purchase 350k

Rate: 3.76% locked in. Conventional loan

Downpayment: 10%

PMI: $60 / month

However, I'm required for escrows (estimated at 10k a year or more) because I have less than 20%. Here is my question, **with such low interest rate, I would like to borrow as much as I can. However,** **is it worth it to put down 20% instead to avoid PMI and have control of my escrow? Which one is financially better?**

If I have no escrow and save to pay my own taxes (I'm quite good with finance and very discipline financially), I will earn 200 a month assuming a 4-5% return. That is in addition to the $720 a year save in PMI. 

On the other hand, if I keep 10%  (35k) in the stock market, assuming a 5% return, I will have $1,700 extra a year while the amortized interest I have to pay for the year on the 35k is $980, I made a profit of almost $700 a year and now have more liquid cash flow.",finance

personalfinance,Form 1040x confusion [New Jersey/New York],"I moved from New Jersey to New York on January 4th 2018.  I quit my old job (in Jersey) in December and started my new job (in New York) in January.

&amp;#x200B;

So I naively thought my tax years would be equally split, I didn't need to worry about anything from New Jersey because that was all in 2017.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, I received my last paycheck from my old job the first week of January, something I completely forgot about.  So I received a small 2018 W-2 from my old job that amounted to about $3,000 or so.  I received this W-2 a day or two *after* I had already filed.  Great luck on my part.

&amp;#x200B;

So to simplify my confusion, let's say I make $50,000 at my new job a year in taxable income.  This w-2 then brings up my total income for the year to $53,000.

&amp;#x200B;

I assume I need to file a 1040x amended return for my federal (not state, right?).  Then, do I need to refile with NY state since the extra $3,000 was from another state?

&amp;#x200B;

Adding to my confusion is [this New Jersey nonresident tax form](https://www.state.nj.us/treasury/taxation/njit24.shtml) which states:  
"" If you are a nonresident and your income for the **entire** year was more than the filing threshold amount for your filing status, you must file a New Jersey nonresident tax return.""  with a threshold of $10,000.

&amp;#x200B;

My income from NJ was only $3,000 so do I not need to file, or are they equating this with the $53,000?

For each entry i gave it the value of 1 ( the conditions holds) and 0 ( does not hold ).

personalfinance,Considering taking a job that pays half as much as my current job.,"Hi Reddit! I need some hopefully unbiased input before I make any decisions.

I'm a student in college studying Applied Mathematics. Currently, for the summer, I have a job lined up that pays $17/hr doing software engineering for a company in my hometown and I'm considering rejecting it for an entry level position at a vintage Italian auto shop that would pay $9/hr.

Here's the problem: over the last several years - basically all the time I spent so far in school - I've realized that it's bad for me. I have terrible episodes of depression regularly and I feel tired and irritable but also restless. I'm not a passionless person, but I feel entirely passionless about what I do on a daily basis here. This semester, rock climbing has been my only escape from that.

Recently, I had to take several weeks off climbing due to an injury and during that time my mental health and consequently my relationships suffered terribly. I've been back at it since the beginning of last week and I've felt a bit better.

Because of these depressive episodes, the idea of next year at school is worrying to me. I only have one year left and I'm still not convinced finishing my degree is the best option for me - mostly because I don't think any of the work it will bring will be satisfying to me. Working a desk job for the rest of my life absolutely terrifies me.

Last week, I got so fed up with school that I skipped the rest of my classes that day, did a little research, and went to give my resume to the owner of an auto shop that I think I would enjoy working for. Within two days, he sent me a job offer for an entry level position at $9/hr for the summer. The thing is, it was so *easy* to get that offer. All I had to do essentially was show up and convince him I wanted to work on cars. I did try negotiating, however, and I know he's firm on that number.

So here's the breakdown: I have about $17,000 in student loan debt. My rent and utilities are $390 per month. When my new lease starts in August, that'll go down to $300. I spend about $175 per month on food. The only other significant monthly expenses are my cell phone and car insurance at $155 per month. If I do return to school next year, tuition is $5500 for the year.

I don't really have any assets to speak of, but my parents are fairly well-off so I have a decent safety net - though I'd like not to use it, obviously.

I know working on vintage cars will probably never make me a millionaire, but it's the only thing I'm really passionate about. The number of people making a living doing this kind of work is small, but they're out there. Long term, there are other cities that have a more significant car culture which I would like to move to, (L.A., Denver, etc.) but at the moment that isn't realistic. This is the type of work that I want to do, but I don't know if this is the right opportunity or the right time to take it.

TL;DR: I'm thinking of rejecting at relatively well-paying software engineering job to take a job working on vintage cars that pays half as much, but would be more personally fulfilling to me.",finance

My mother took out a Parent PLUS loan for me since its interest rates are pretty low compared to private loan providers. She doesn't like the idea of the money being under her name since she already has plenty of debt from getting a doctorate, so I am being guided to take on private loans of my own. Its kind of overwhelming thinking about all of my options. Where should I start looking, or do you guys have any suggestions?

personalfinance,Need advice on what I can do with the 209k I recently received from a trust fund,"So I'm a 25 year old line cook who is immensely fortunate to have had a great grandmother leave him a trust intended for college expenses. I never went to college after deciding to pursue a culinary career knowing that at the age of 25 I would receive the entirety of the money left for me. What I did not expect though was for the amount to be this much. I want to be as responsible as I can with this money and get the most out it as I can so I'm asking r/personalfinance for some advice and answers to a few questions I have seeing as my financial knowledge is minimal to say the least. 

Should I bank with a local credit union over Chase? It's my understanding that a savings account at a credit union has an interest rate that I get at the end of the year. I'm not familiar with the pros of credit unions over big banks. I was also thinking now would be a good time to open my first credit card.

I currently do not have a car and have been looking into the pros and cons of buying from a private seller  or a dealership as well as new versus used. Seeing as I have the funds I think buying from a dealership would be a better idea. But whether or not to buy new or used I'm on the fence. Also seeing as I do not have established credit I was told financing the car then paying it off would help improve my credit. If it matters I'd like to get a Toyota Tacoma haha.

After getting a car I want to spend some money on myself without going too crazy. Just stuff like new clothes and cooking related tools I can use to build my personal kitchen. 

My main question is what can I do with the remainder of my money? I'd like to invest it so it grows and I can buy a house someday or set myself up for later in life. It's a life changing amount of money and I want to make the most of it so thanks in advance for any help anyone can give me!",finance
personalfinance,I have some money from another “loan” to pay off my private student loans. What’s the smartest way to do this?,"So my parents started an Edvest account (Wisconsin’s college savings plan)  for me from birth. The plan was for me to pay for my first 2 years of school and my parents would pay my last 2 years. I took out about $40,000 in loans for my first 2 years. My parents held up their end of the deal and payed for my last 2 years. However, I still did my FAFSA for my third year of school and now have a $5,500 federal student loan  (on top of my private loans and federal loans from my first 2 years). Catching our mistake way too late, my parents said they would use the Edvest money to pay off that loan, since I shouldn’t have taken it out in the first place. 

I am currently paying back my private loans and am in deference for my federal loans, since I don’t make enough to afford the payments (I’m on the Revised Pay as you Earn plan). My parents gave me the option of using that $5,500 to pay off some of my private loan because the interest rates are crazy high. 

As for the private loans: I have 2, one for $15,000 and one for $25,000. Of course with interest, they are much higher now,  both through Lendkey. 

The $15,000 loan has a higher interest rate and I pay $188 each month. If I used the money towards this loan, my monthly payments would be $117. 

The $25,000 loan is a few fractions of a percentage less and I pay $288 per month. The money would bring these monthly payments down to $235. 

Should I use the money towards one of these loans specifically? Or maybe use it towards my monthly payments? 

I have good credit and have been making payments on these loans for about 7 months. Finances are very tight for me and I don’t make enough to refinance or consolidate. I am able to afford these monthly payments, but just barely and I’m not able to build up my savings because of them. 

I’m wondering what the best course of action would be, either short term or long term.",finance

politics,"I am Congressman Jerry McNerney (CA-09). I am a strong supporter of net neutrality and an original cosponsor of the Save the Internet Act.

AMA","Hi, I’m Congressman Jerry McNerney and I represent California’s 9th Congressional district, which includes parts of Contra Costa, San Joaquin, and Sacramento counties. I sit on the House Energy and Commerce Committee’s Subcommittee on Communications and Technology – which oversees the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). I am an original cosponsor of the Save the Internet Act (H.R. 1644) because I believe it’s critical that my constituents and all Americans have strong net neutrality protections.
 
Net neutrality is essential for American innovation and competition, as well as ensuring that the internet is a gateway for economic opportunity and a forum for the free flow of ideas. Since FCC Chairman Ajit Pai’s announcement of his intention to roll back net neutrality protections, more than 8,000 of my constituents reached out to me to express their opposition. On December 14, 2017, the FCC voted to repeal net neutrality protections at its Open Meeting. I have consistently spoken out against the FCC’s actions and prior to the December 2017 meeting, I submitted a formal request to address the full Commission at the Open Meeting so that my constituents’ voices could be heard. My [request was denied](https://mcnerney.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/rep-mcnerney-denied-request-to-address-fcc-open-meeting) by Chairman Pai, but Commissioner Mignon Clyburn – who voted against the repeal – [submitted my written statement](https://mcnerney.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/repmcnerney-submits-written-statement-for-fcc-open-meeting) for the Meeting’s official record. Following the FCC’s decision, I held a [net neutrality town hall](https://www.facebook.com/jerrymcnerney/videos/2051156138252070/) in my district. Veterans, librarians, students, and small business owners all spoke out about the harmful impacts they will face from the elimination of net neutrality protections.
 
Last week, the House Energy and Commerce Committee favorably reported the Save the Internet Act to the full U.S. House of Representatives, and tomorrow the House will consider this crucial piece of legislation. The Save the Internet Act will restore meaningful net neutrality protections that the FCC repealed, and I am urging my colleagues to vote “yes” on this legislation.

personalfinance,Get out of debt the quick way?,"I am looking for some options to help my wife and I get out of our current situation.

We currently have around $23k in credit card debt. About half of it is currently accruing interest(~20% avg) the other half is in interest free accounts for 12 more months. We have been working really hard at tracking our spending habits and have been very good for the last 12 months. We have paid off over $10k in the past year. To speed up the process of paying of the rest of this I thought about selling my vehicle. It is paid off and worth around $30k. My plan was to to use the cash to payoff everything and use the leftovers + a $10k loan to purchase a used vehicle. Obviously not ideal to pull out another loan but $10k at low interest rate is much better than $23k at a higher interest rate. Our only payments at that point would be our mortgage and the car loan payment.

Our credit is pretty solid at 700-750

fintech,An excellent podcast recently on a16z podcast: Fintech for Startups and Incumbents,"I listened to an excellent podcast on fintech startups and existing incumbents recently by Alex Rampell (this guy is amazing by the way..) and Frank Chen over at a16z. Thought I share some of the quotes mentioned there, for folks who haven't listened to it yet. 

# Part 1: How might a startup come after an incumbent?

&gt;I want life insurance and I eat 5 donuts a day. I just had a donut today. I don't eat 5 donuts, but I have 1 donut every Friday as you can testify. And then I have a friend who goes to the gym 5 times a day, never eats a donut. That guy's probably going to live longer than me. Hopefully not, but probabilistically he's probably going to have a better time than I am, in terms of life expectancy. So why is it that we both pay the same rate and that just seems unfair to him. It seems great to me, because he's subsidizing me, and that seems unfair and then the startups can sometimes exploit that psychological unfairness

&amp;#x200B;

* Strategy 1: Selectively targeting profitable customers

&gt;So what they do is they say yeah. Can you run a 9 or an 8 minute mile? Can you do these things to prove that you're better than everybody else? And why is that important? Well from their own balance sheet or profitability perspective they want to get these good customers. Versus, you know, a brand new life insurance company that said, Hey, life insurance takes too long to get it's a big pain and it's expensive. We’ll underwrite you on the spot in one minute, no blood test, that's going to be adverse selection. That's like, ooh, I think I'm gonna die soon. Everybody rejected me for life insurance. I'm going to that company. As opposed to here, they're only getting the customers that kind of hit hit the underwriting standard, which is great. They think it's fair. So it's a differentiator from a brand perspective and then it turns out that again each marginal customer and insurance is kind of a coin flip. They're getting a weighted coin because they're only getting people on the far right side of this normal distribution.

&amp;#x200B;

* Strategy 2: Relying on new data sources to reach out to customers 

&gt;What if you can use different data sources to, again, it's not positive versus adverse selection as in some of the insurance companies, but it's saying can I collect more forms of data so that instead of saying the only way that I can make my operation work is to charge an interest rate, which actually turns out to be illegal. Can I come up with more data sources that effectively even though discrimination sounds like a terrible word and it's certainly used in that construct. If you discriminate against criminals, that's fine. I mean some of the people that try to take advantage of lenders are actual like organized crime, you don't want them in your bin. You want to throw them out? How do you, how do you take more data sources and actually start measuring this?

&amp;#x200B;

* Strategy 3: Changing user behavior to turn customers to profitable ones

&gt;(On how Earnin operates) Then you can tip us, there's no cost. If you want to pay us nothing, that's fine. I mean, we would appreciate if you pay us something because obviously we're providing a valuable service for you, and then you can even give tips for your friends. There's this community that's really emerged of people on Earnin and actually if you look back at different business models, but this idea of microfinance in general. So if you think about Muhammad Yunus and what he did. This idea of can you encourage people to pay back loans using social pressure?So again, not adverse selection versus positive selection, but actually trying to force everybody down positive behavior. Let's get the community to encourage repayment.

# Part 2: As an existing player, what should I do to fend off startups?

* Strategy 1: Sub-segment products by customer

&gt;(You’re in my seat, you're the head of innovation or head of strategy or head of digital at one of these big fintech companies. What should I do with respect to startups?) Well, I think it's actually very hard for a company that's trying to be all things to all customers because if you look at what SoFi is, look at SoFi’s brand. The brand is you know, we are the high like if you're great, you're good enough for us. If you're a HENRY (High Earnings, Not Rich Yet) you're good enough for us. Health IQ, if you're healthy, you're good enough for us. So on that sector of the curve, how does Geico say? Hey, if you're a good driver go to the special part of Geico. If you're a regular driver, you still say 15% if you're a bad driver and you had a DUI. Well, we can we can cover you over here. It's lost in this kind of giant Geico, you know gecko marketing message. So in many cases it actually helps to have sub brands and divide this up which is somewhat anathema to a lot of companies that want to say how do we get as much efficiency in synergy as possible. We're going to have one overarching brand.

&amp;#x200B;

* Strategy 2: Turn down traffic. Co-partnering with startups for certain customer segments

&gt;Probably the easiest way that is often counterintuitive for a lot of big companies is what I call this ""The turn down traffic strategy"". So Chase turns down a lot of people for loans either because again, it's the the bin and ball problem where it's like well you might be good, you might be bad. Sometimes it's not even that. It's like we think you're good, but we just can't profitably underwrite a $400 loan. But Chase has all the traffic. So what is turned down traffic? It's saying okay, we rejected you but hey, here's a friend that you might like. So this is not cream of the crop. This is the bottom tier on the ingestion point for a big financial institution saying we don't want you which is kind of a mean thing to say. A way to ameliorate that potentially is saying we don't want you because we're not far enough yet, or sorry, we're working on it ,but here's a great startup that does.

&amp;#x200B;

* Q1: Should you invest early into a startup?

&gt;(All right, just given those dynamics just wait for the later rounds. Let all the venture guys take all the risk and then like you plow in late. That should be my strategy.) I think in general that's probably a better strategy but again say like we're getting a great deal on this one. Then you know that you're the adverse selection source of capital as opposed to okay, here's something I can't believe we're paying this much money for it. We have to fight our way in there are 10 other people that wanted it. You probably know you're onto a good customer if you will or a good investment.

&amp;#x200B;

* Q2: Should you partner with as many startups as possible?

&gt;I think actually that does make sense. I mean there should be some kind of gating item to make sure like you not a (investing in like) 100, but how do we how do we stay close to different models that are working well, because the main advantage that the incumbents have, again depends on like lending or under or insurance, but it's typically something around cost of capital and something around distribution. So if you have both of those and you're not using it to the fullest extent like you turn down a lot of customers, like you should try to find an intelligent way of using this. Using something that's your unique thing. Like venture capital firms don't have that, I can't find somebody and send them a million customers tomorrow, but Geico could. So, but you can't do that a hundred times. You can probably do that some some sub-segment of times according to how much additional traffic or whatever it is that the unique advantage that you want to bring to bear.

&amp;#x200B;

* Q3: M&amp;A, buy early?

&gt;I'm a big fan of what Facebook has done withM&amp;A and I encourage everybody in pretty much every other industry to do this. So Facebook has two formats for M&amp;A. One is we buy the existential threat that could kill us and we price it probabilistically. So surrender 1% of our market cap to buy Instagram. Yeah, it was way overpriced but everybody said that but there's a 1/100 chance that this is going to be bigger than Facebook. We should probably surrender one percent of our market cap. WhatsApp, 7% chance or whatever it was. That was 7% of Facebook’s fully diluted market cap was spent on WhatsApp. These were brilliant acquisitions. Oculus. I mean Oculus hasn't turned out the same with what WhatsApp has perhaps, but like same idea. It's like this could be the new platform. If we don't buy this and Apple does we are subject to their random whims and fancies. So that's that's Category 1. Category 2 and this is super counterintuitive for a lot of companies. Buy the guys that failed trying because, they had the courage and the tenacity to try to go and build something new. And that's what you want in your company as well. And then this is the most counterintuitive part is like take the person that failed and put them in charge of the person that was successful.

personalfinance,Offered a salaried position and need to make sure I get the most out of my benefits.,"This got to be a lot more information than I expected, so I hope it has enough here to answer most questions. This is my first salaried position, so I'm really unsure of any of this. Thanks a ton for taking a look.

**Personal Details / Debt / Expenditures**:

* **Age**: 27
* **Location**: Oregon, USA
* **Debt**: 26k in student loans (average is ~5.5% interest rate).
* **Car**: Paid off, still paying insurance (~$128 / month. way too high).
* **Rent**: ~$1000 / month in rent.
* **Excess Spending**: ~$1500 in food / fun things.
* **Stocks**: I tend to put ~$1000 into stocks each month.
* The rest I save, or there have been a few other purchases.
* Not married, don't plan to be for a few years.

**Job Details / Benefits**

* **Start Date**: April 29th.
* **Base Salary**: $130,000 base. Paid bi-weekly.
* **Potential Bonus**: 15% yearly. Dependent on company performance.
* **Profit Sharing**: I have to be an employee for the first / last day of the fiscal year, and work 1,000 hours. So this year it doesn't matter. But deposits extra things into my 401k? I'll need more info on this.
* **401k match**: 100% up to 5%. Vested immediately.
* **Profit Sharing**: Have it, don't know exact details.
* **Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP)**: Can purchase shares twice a year, March / September, at the lowest price of the dates at a 15% discount. 
So if March is $100, and September is $80 per stock, i'll get them at $68 ($80 - 15%). Looks like this is called a ""Lookback provision"".
* **Health / Dental / Vision**: A bunch of different plans that I have zero knowledge on.

**Other pre-tax spending accounts**:

* **HSA**: Can contribute up to $3500 per year. No use it or lose it. Entirely my account, doesn't deal with employer. A few other perks it mentions are: funds rollover, balance grows tax free, can make tax-free withdrawals to pay for eligible healthcare expenses.
* **Preschool / child or elder care**: Don't have kids or elderly parents yet, this is a use it or lose it. Probably won't use it.
* **Commuter expense reimbursement**: Talks about taking public transportation or paying for parking a few days a week. Puts some extra money in my pocket by helping to pay for this with pre-tax dollars. I walk to work so this is kind of irrelevant.

**Future Purchase Plans**:

As of right now, I have no plan to purchase a home, car, or any other large purchases.

**Questions**:

* When does my **401k** match ""end"" for the year? How much should I put towards it to assure I don't miss any of that 5%?
* With the **ESPP**, there is a maximum **value** I can receive of $25k per year. With the stock purchasing being every 6 months, how much should I put towards that to make sure I take advantage of it? Rough estimate seems like I'd need to put ~$20k towards it per year, or ~1770 a month. Am I missing something here? I also get refunded any extra that didn't go towards the stock if I hit the $25k limit. Probably not realistically feasible to save that much right now.
* 401k is pre-tax, is the ESPP also pre-tax?
* Best place to learn about healthcare things?
* Is there anything I should do with the pre-tax things like HSA? Or does that depend on if I get other health insurance or not?",finance
personalfinance,Is This How Fixed Mortgage Interest Payments Are Calculated?,"Apologies if I'm using improper terminology. Say I have a loan of amount L is made with interest rate R and fixed monthly payment M. Will the first month's interest payment be I  = R \* L / 12?

\^ That's how I've understood the interest calculation to be. Is it not that simple in practice? Does the original house cost matter in the calculation (since the loan is effectively that minus the down payment)? Is the calculation any different for ARMs during the fixed rate period?

I'm not late or missing any payments and we have some discretionary money, but there some things I would like to get done around the house that I'm putting off because I don't have the money and we seem to be inching closer to living hand to mouth - my wife survived a recent layoff that would have put a serious hurting on us so that's been a wakeup call.  Plus, I'd really like to contribute more to my retirement.  I'm in my early 50s now and I have some ground to make up from so many years of not saving.

I'm REALLY sick of paying 17% interest on one of my credit cards (about $22k of it), and about 12-15% on the others.

I've tried paying heavily on one account and managed to pay off one with about $5k on it, but it seems like I put a ton of money into an account and then something unexpected happens where I have to spend a ton of money and I'm right back where I was.  For instance, I've had to replace two water heaters in the past two years as well as have some septic system work done on the house, and this year (so far) it's a swimming pool liner.  I'm managing the pool liner without using a credit card thanks to using a good chunk of my cash savings and my tax return from this year, but it's tough trying to pay down CC debt with those killer interest rates.  I've still got good credit so I think I should have some decent options, but I just don't know what's the best way to go about it.

I've considered getting a home equity loan for the credit card balances and paying it off in 5 years.  However, the prospect of putting my home on the line to replace unsecured debt troubles my mind.

I've also considered just getting a loan from my 401(k) to pay off the balance of the higher interest card.  Payment would be less than I pay now, and at a much lower interest rate (5.5% paid back to myself).  I know some people don't like taking money out of a 401(k), but I figure the interest savings alone would offset any potential earnings I would get with it sitting in the 401(k) account.

What does this sub think?  How would you handle getting this freaking credit card debt paid off in a reasonable about of time?",finance

worldpolitics,An actuality of the Kuril Islands issue still remains,"One of the main reasons why a peace treaty between Moscow and Tokyo was not signed is the issue of the ownership of the southern part of the Kuril Islands. It should be recalled that these islands: Iturup, Kunashir, Shikotan and a number of small uninhabited islands of the Small Kuril Islands Ridge became part of the USSR following the World War II, in which Tokyo suffered a crushing defeat, and this fact was confirmed by a number of international agreements.

As it is known, the Japanese government for many years intensively forms the opinion that there are supposedly territories belonging to Japan by the right of historical discovery to the north of the Japanese islands, for some reason forgetting that it was the Russian Cossacks who discovered them, and even calling them their ""northern territories"". Japan uses numerous methods of influencing the public in vain attempts to prove not only its citizens, but the whole world that the Kuril Islands were taken away by Russia, and that they belong to the original Land of the Rising Sun. However, everyone knows that this is absolutely not the case, and Russia, in turn, repeatedly responds to its Japanese partners that they have no plans to transfer these islands to Japan. Methods of influence by the Japanese government on the public are propaganda, rallies, the creation of the post of Minister for Okinawa and the Northern Territories, the formation of the Council for Relations with the movement for the return of the ""Northern Territories"", and also special attention is paid to the younger generation.  
 

For example, if Japan used to publish a special magazine about ""northern territories"" for young people, produced short animated films in which the Russian people were shown in the role of ""barbarians"" and invaders, now the Japanese government has also added direction to elementary school students to ensure the relevance of ""revanchist"" policy of the Kuril Islands issue.

Thus, it became known that in Japanese textbooks for elementary school students the southern part of the Kuril Islands is marked as a Japanese territory. It is obvious that the government of Shinzo Abe went to the ""cartographic aggression"", hiding behind the friendly mask of a peaceful neighbor. It is clear that the Japanese intend to defend their position through propaganda attacks on their own younger generation. In turn, on April 4, 2019, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova reported that the Russian diplomatic ministry drew attention to a press release about the introduction of a new edition of junior school textbooks from 2020, published by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports and Science of Japan, where Japan used the absurd formulation about the ""original belonging"" of the South Kuril Islands. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia regards this as one more step by Japan, whose goal is the promotion of a ""well-known position on the problem of a peace treaty"", contrary to the generally accepted assessment of the results of the Great Patriotic War. Nevertheless, despite the constant territorial claims, Tokyo will not be able to decide to move from words to actions and go against the most powerful military potential of Russia, which, of course, will protect the lands legally belonging to it.

Also, it should be noted that no matter what principles the Japanese government is guided by, whatever policy it pursues with regard to the Kuril Islands and whatever resources it spends on shaping the image of Smokers as Japanese territory - any person, at least a little familiar with history, understands that everything these attempts are fruitless. After all, the facts prove the historical identity of the islands Iturup, Kunashir and a group of islands of the small Kuril ridge of Russia. The Kuril Islands finally became part of the USSR, the successor of which was Russia, legally following the Second World War and are an integral part of the territory of the Russian Federation, as has been repeatedly stated by Russian President Vladimir Putin.",technology

personalfinance,"Bought furniture online and it was delivered in broken pieces, no one will respond","I bought some furniture online a few months ago. It was finally delivered 3 weeks ago by FedEx, not white glove. The table top is stone and is very heavy. Fedex carefully unloaded it and leaned it against the house. Everything seemed fine. I carefully opened it that same day and saw that it was split into 3 pieces.  I called FedEx immediately, took pictures, and submitted a report. FedEx sent an inspector out to see if there was any obvious damage to the box. There was some minor wear to the box but overall looked in good shape.    
    I called the online retailer immediately and they said they don’t handle any of this over the phone so I submitted a report online and emailed pics.  Within 24 hours, they tell me that they will submit a report to the company that they bought the table from. Basically saying that they cannot do anything until they hear from the company they bought it from.  I’m a little surprised to learn that they are essentially a distributor and aren’t taking responsibility for fixing this but I wait patiently for a response from them. They seem to not have many people that work at the company or in customer service. I don’t hear anything after a week so I follow up. They say that they haven’t heard back yet. I follow up again and ask for them to reach out to their vendor again. It’s been 4 business days and no response. I call and they say the only person that can respond is the person that was assigned the case that I have been emailing. They wouldn’t let me ask questions and repeatedly interrupted me. They did at least say that she would respond today but she never did.         
    I am anxious to have this resolved as I am really getting the feeling that they don’t care about customer service at all and I’m probably going to get screwed. It’s been 3 weeks since the delivery.  My credit card company gives me 60 days from when the charge happened to dispute and that will be next week. All I want is a new table top delivered that’s not broken. Should I go ahead and escalate to the credit card company?  I’m at a loss as to what to do next.

personalfinance,"Does anyone know of a home budget calc that incorporates tax ""savings"" of owning a home?","I haven't been able to find anything online but I'm looking to use my existing budget for monthly expenses and incorporate a scenario where I own a home with mortgage. Now that's easy to do with any mortgage calc that I  can inpu home loan amoun, loan interest rate etc to get my monthly cost. But that doesn't take into account potentially reducing tax burden for year because of mortgage interest, property taxes (for state) etc.

&amp;#x200B;

For example if I rent a place for $2,000 a month and am looking at mortgage payment on a house of $2,500, the difference is $500. But this doesn't factor in what happens to your tax liability for being able to deduct mortgage interest, property taxes, etc.  If you consider the tax savings the spread between rent and mortgage gets a little closer. Of course none of this considers many other costs of ownership but it's something that I don't hear discussed and has a real impact on your budget... Anyone found anything like this before?",finance

personalfinance,Wrong State Entered For State Return (Turbo Tax),"Long story short, I'm active duty military, stationed in Hawaii. I use Turbo Tax for my tax returns, and I mistakenly put down Hawaii as my residency (I'm from Florida).  I already did the whole process with Turbo Tax and submitted my state returns/federal returns. The federal returns got accepted and the state return is pending.

Basically, since I'm from Florida I wouldn't be paying state taxes. Since I mistakenly put down Hawaii as my residency, I would be paying $1070. (This is only my second time filing taxes, new to this adult stuff and making stupid choices). So my question for anyone who uses Turbo Tax is, since the state return is still pending, are they going to notice that I put the wrong residency down and give me the chance to fix it? Or is it too late and now I have to cough up $1000?

(P.S.) Turbo Tax does not provide me the option to change my state now that I have already submitted the state returns.",finance

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

stocks,How Wells Fargo ($WFC) regulators and employees drove out its CEO,"NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The day after former Wells Fargo &amp; Co Chief Executive Tim Sloan told U.S. lawmakers he was transforming the bank’s high-pressure culture, Federal Reserve officials met privately with bank employees.

At the meeting on March 13, which has not been previously reported, Fed officials were told by four bank employees that little had changed within the bank’s culture since the scandal that engulfed Wells Fargo almost three years ago.

Among those present at the meeting was Fed Governor Lael Brainard, who is overseeing a decree requiring that Wells Fargo fix its risk management before it can resume growing, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said. The employees belonged to an advocacy group, Committee For Better Banks, which confirmed the meeting.

Brainard told the group she was there to listen and get insight into the mood among Wells Fargo staff but declined to say if or how the Fed would respond, the sources said.

While regulators occasionally meet with consumer advocacy or industry groups, it is unusual for a Fed board member to meet with an individual firm’s employees. It is not clear who asked for the meeting.

Sloan abruptly departed the bank last month, making him the second CEO to leave Wells Fargo in the wake of its sales practice scandal. Sloan, who declined to comment on this story through a representative, has previously said he stepped down because he felt the external attention on him had become a distraction.

His departure was at least partly the result of the board’s conclusion that Sloan had failed to convince regulators that he could transform the bank and rally a staff that had low confidence in its leadership, according to a source with knowledge of the board’s thinking.

Wells Fargo spokesman Mark Folk declined to comment on regulatory matters but disputed the employee group’s characterization of the bank’s culture.

Sloan’s struggles underscore the challenges faced by the bank’s next chief executive. They will not only have to transform the bank and its sales practices, but also persuade regulators and its 260,000 employees that they have done so.

Finding a new CEO who can win over the bank’s employees is as important as finding someone who can charm regulators and Wall Street, said Russell Raath, president of management consulting firm Kotter.

“The whole bank needs to know that this person cares about their contribution to the top and bottom line,” he said.

STRAINED RELATIONSHIP

Wells Fargo’s relationship with regulators has been strained since 2016, when employee whistleblowers revealed the bank had opened potentially millions of unauthorized accounts.

Internal and regulatory probes have since discovered other issues in the bank’s businesses, resulting in billions of dollars in fines and penalties.

In February 2018, Wells Fargo signed a Fed consent order that required the bank to fix its risk-management and governance problems before it could grow its balance sheet.

Two months later, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Wells Fargo’s other key regulator, ordered the bank to make similar fixes and repay customers to whom it had improperly sold mortgages and auto insurance.

In December, Reuters reported that the Fed had rejected the bank’s initial remediation plan, putting it behind schedule. Days later, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told Congress the Fed would not lift the asset cap until it was satisfied that Wells Fargo had fixed its risk problems.

LOW MORALE

An internal company-wide survey around that time also pointed to low morale, according to the Committee For Better Banks and other Wells Fargo employees.

The bank internally published a write-up about the survey, saying Wells Fargo found itself at a “challenging and interesting” crossroads. Some employees felt that the description sugar-coated the findings, sources said.

That sparked dozens of comments from workers criticizing management for being out of touch, according to the sources and screenshots of the internal site reviewed by Reuters.

A consumer loan underwriter complained on the internal site that the concerns about pay and employee benefits were falling on deaf ears.

“For years (team members) have been expressing their concerns and frustrations,” the employee wrote. “The only response (if any) are canned answers and talking points which we all know is baloney.”

An analysis of the survey Wells Fargo published publicly showed only 38 percent of employees felt senior management understood obstacles faced by frontline workers.

Wells Fargo’s Folk said the company seeks and values input from employees, and that the bank has already made a number of improvements based on the feedback.

He pointed to other categories in the survey that showed employees believed in the bank’s values and were satisfied. For example, 72 percent of employees said they believe Wells Fargo is a good place to work.

REGULATORY REBUKE

Sloan testified before Congress on March 12 in a hearing about the bank’s progress since 2016.

As a gesture of goodwill, Wells Fargo took the unusual step of offering the OCC the opportunity to review his testimony in advance, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter. It is unclear how the OCC responded.

In his testimony, Sloan detailed Wells Fargo’s extensive transformation efforts, but regulators remained skeptical.

Sloan had barely finished speaking when the OCC said it was still “disappointed” by the bank’s remediation efforts.

The next day, after Wells Fargo disclosed Sloan had gotten a 5 percent pay raise, the Fed responded that it expects boards “to hold management accountable.”

A week later, Powell told reporters the bank had suffered a “remarkably widespread series of breakdowns” that needed to be addressed in a “fundamental” way.

These rebukes undermined Sloan’s position at the bank, the source with knowledge of the board’s thinking said.

On March 26, Sloan told the board he had decided to resign, according to a regulatory filing. Three days later, he publicly stepped down.

My home will appraise at around $300k. If I refinance my mortgage to pay off my student loans my house payment would increase approximately $600 which I could afford.

I am still putting a good chunk of money into my retirement plans and getting full match with my 401k. I know circumstance can change but if i were to work here my entire career and retire from the same company I want to know how much trust I can put into the pension plan for my future retirement.

personalfinance,"Recent grad, looking to change my current bank/cc situation","Like the title says, I’m a recent college grad and I’m trying to change up my current financial situation to make everything easier/more lucrative. 

So I currently have a college bank account with Chase linked to my parents account, a Discover It credit card, and the Chase Freedom Unlimited card. 

My financial background: I have a student loan of 3,750 with a 5.05% interest rate. I took the loan out in August so it’s currently at 3,860. I am currently employed but will be unemployed soon (studying abroad and moving back home after). I have a credit score of 780 and have a couple thousand saved up.

I recently opened a Schwabs checking account, primarily because it reimburses for all ATM fees and has no foreign transaction fees (this will be helpful as I’m studying abroad in Japan for the summer), but also because I’ve just heard good things about it and want to make the transition to online banking. 

So here are my questions:

1) should I switch to a stand-alone checking account with Chase or just close the account and have Schwabs as my primary checking account? The only reason I see keeping the account open is in the rare, rare occasion I “need” to deposit cash. Thinking back, I can’t recall depositing cash once in 2 years. I do plan to go to my local Chase branch this week, so any advice on what to say/ask will be very much appreciated. 

2) should I defer my loan payments until after I return from studying abroad? Right now it looks like my payments are $50 a month. I’m hoping I’ll have a full time job by the end of the year, and would rather pay off the loan in large payments over a short period than it just sucking $50/mo from my bank account while I’m unemployed and studying abroad. 

3) I’m looking to open a new credit card before studying abroad—I’m looking for a card that has no foreign transaction fees and little/no annual payment. 1.5/2% cash back and a sign up/early spending bonus would be nice too. I’ve looked at a few cards. Capital One Venture seems like a great deal, my only concern is the sign up bonus is miles and not cash back. Capital One Quicksilver also seems fine just less cash back. 

4) when is the best time to open a savings account/which savings account should I open? I’ve been considering Ally because of their high interest rates and again being an online savings account, but if you advise a different one I might go with that. Also, because I’ll be unemployed and studying abroad I’m wondering if it’s better to wait until I’m back and have a job.",finance
personalfinance,Funding for Residency. Need some advice :(,"Hey guys,

I am about to graduate from dental school and am starting a residency which will last for the next three years. In order to start residency, we are required to buy approximately $7,000 worth of equipment which is not covered by our normal, federal financial aid package. I talked to previous students and many of them simply charged equipment to their credit cards and then slowly paid it off with some of the money they made from residency stipend (essentially negligible). I am concerned with this as I don't want it to adversely effect my credit score and building credit card debt right now doesn't seem like a great idea. I've looked at taking out seperate personal loans on top of my federal student loans but am overwhelmed with the sheer ammount of lenders. For example, I have talked to discover and they would be willing to loan me the required money but would only offer a deferment period of 9 months from when I currently graduate which would make me start paying only 1 year into my three year residency.

And  lastly that article blew the lid off this whole thing and i still cant  get my head around the nerve of the guy who made the ""cost of  transparency"" comment. I mean he KNEW he was lying to the loyal  playerbase's face. Its disgusting.

personalfinance,"Stuck between owing IRS $3000 a year, or receiving a $3000 refund","So I don't think my situation is unique, but its unique enough that friends, family, and my company don't have solutions.  Rough numbers, I make approximately $100K a year and my wife makes approximately $50K a year.  She works for the public sector and owes a substantial amount of federal student loans.  She is half way through the ten year payment plan, Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF), and pays a specified amount every month (determined by the government).  We can't pay more than the amount owed, and five years from now the remaining balance should be forgiven (including any taxes).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the rub.  Her loan payment amount is determined by her adjusted gross income and filing status.  We file as ""married filing separately"" in order for them to not take my income into account.  This is by design, filing together would increase her payment amount substantially.  The issue we've had for a few years now is when we file our taxes.  Even when I claim the mortgage interest, if I claim 1 allowance, I end up owing roughly $3000 a year in taxes.  The previous year I claimed 0 and received a $3000 refund.

&amp;#x200B;

So I know the goal is to receive no refund and owe nothing come tax season, but can I control anything outside of claiming 1 or 0 on my W-2?  My wife claims 0 on both state and federal and always owes around $1000.  This is because I claim the mortgage interest which doesn't allow her to take the standard deduction.

Thinking of dumping $5,500 into a Roth IRA this week to max it out for 2018, limiting my 401k cont to 6% (still getting the full match), digging into my emergency savings for the down payment, and getting the car. 

Post purchase, all money not going to the car payment would be funneled towards re-topping off the emergency fund with a small portion going to the Roth IRA. Once fulfilled of then go all in to the Roth IRA. My logic is 1.) Income is steady (boss actually just put in for a promotion which could net 95k) 2.) the returns on the Roth IRA &gt; interest rate on the car, and 3.) I have the RSUs vesting shortly/my personal investments could cover me if shit were to carpet bomb the fan.  


Financials:

Currently each month I put $1,250 into my 401k and have $3,600 take home. Out of the $3,600 I save roughly $850 a month (my savings rate will be closer to 1k this month -- would readjust some life things to make that about $650 after factoring in car related expenses). 

- Net Worth: $67k

- Emergency Fund: $10k in HYSA

- Car Savings: 5k in HYSA

- Personal Investments: $3k (VTSAX doot doot)

- RSU: I'll have another $3k vesting in July. 

- 401k: $48k

- Debt: None other than my regular purchases all on card ($500 at the moment). 

- Salary: 80k pretax (my manager put in for a promotion to 95k but obviously won't bank on that till I see the new paycheck -- would be effective in June). 

Also if I were to do that, would I have to amend my 2018 taxes in any way (I already filed).

A family relative just passed away and I am the sole beneficiary of a **$100K life insurance policy** \- I come to you, the personal finance Gods of Reddit, to ask for advice on how to best utilize this newly acquired money. I must admit that I've somewhat ignored skill development in financial literacy, but I'm working to change all of that!

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, I am a single resident physician with 2 kids in my mid/late-20s with a **salary of \~$55K/year.** I'm in a specialty where the average starting salary **AFTER** residency is between $300-400K/year; I have 3 years of residency remaining.

Below is a quick summary of my current financial situation.

&amp;#x200B;

**DEBT &amp; INTEREST RATES**:

|Student loans|$155K @ 4-6% (all unsubsidized)|
|:-|:-|
|Mortgage|$138K @ 5%|
|Car loan|$26K @ 4.4%|

**CURRENT TAKE HOME PAY**: $3000/mo

**SIDE HUSTLE**: $400-500/mo (on avg)

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see, I'm barely breaking even each month and as such, I have not been able to put much towards investments/retirement accounts (although I do have a cumulative total of \~$12K in these accounts from prior jobs and such).  I don't really have a ""true"" savings account at this time as most of my assets are in retirement accounts.

&amp;#x200B;

So what would be the best use of this $100K windfall?  Here are the steps that I've come up with, but I'd like you guys to really critic this plan because I'm obviously not a financial guru by any means lol.

&amp;#x200B;

**1)** Pay off car loan ($26K) - This would eliminate my $450/mo payment plus reduce my insurance premium as I wouldn't require comprehensive coverage.

&amp;#x200B;

**2)** Pay off credit card debt ($8K)

&amp;#x200B;

**3)** Pay portion of student loans - not sure how much? maybe pay off the higher interest rate ones first (eg. &gt;5.5%) which is anywhere between $10-30K depending on where I draw the threshold.

&amp;#x200B;

**4)** Set aside savings/emergency fund in a high-yield savings account ($8-10K)

&amp;#x200B;

**5)** Invest the remaining amount in Roth/retirement/brokerage accounts. For the Roth IRA, I'd like to put $5500 in for 2018 if the life insurance check comes before April 15th plus $6000 for 2019.

personalfinance,Debt Consolidation for convenience?,"Greetings everyone!

I've been reading up on debt consolidation, and it seems like it would make my life a lot easier in terms of payments. Not because I am struggling to make said payments, but because I am paying on many different smaller loans, which totals to a larger amount at the end of the month. The simplicity of having to make a single, large payment is much better than 10 smaller ones (college loans).

Attempting to search for advice has been a bit difficult, as most of the results I can see are dealing with consolidating credit card debt to get out of super high interest rates, which is not my case at all. I am working on the principal amount on each of the loans, and I can very well continue this without issue. I would just love to have only one loan to worry about each month instead of 10.

My biggest pause is that I'm seeing a lot of these posts saying that they consolidated all of their (credit card) debt and they're now paying 14% APR, which is *way more* than I'm paying on all of my loans right now (between 4-8%).

From September to February I was living on my 457 fund (retirement similar to a 401k). My income should be roughly the same for 2018 as it would have been except that some of it came from my 457 instead of my employer.  Each 457 withdrawal had 20% withheld for taxes.

Emergency fund is currently at $6200 which is a little shy of 6 months of my absolute needs (rent, food, gas) 
Mutual fund is just over $16k 
Only debt I have is $3000 in student loans at a 4.1% interest rate.

After joining this subreddit I’ve seen many people recommend “maxing out your 401k” but people seem to have different opinions on what that actually means. Some people say put the minimum needed to have your employer match and some say put in the max allowed by law (think it’s $19,000 for 2019). Once my emergency fund is fully funded should I just flip that $600 a month into my 401k investments?

This car will mainly be driven by wife around town and for any road trips to see family (maybe 10 trips a year) We want something with room for me (I'm pretty tall, and some cars aren't very comfy), room for stroller and other baby stuff, and our middle sized dog.



This has led us to initially looking at leasing either a Honda Accord/CRV or Ford Fusion/Escape for about $290-$330 a month ($10,500-12,000 total) for now and once we're done with that we would buy a used vehicle since any student loans should be gone by then.



We both have good but not amazing credit at this point in time, which is one reason why we wouldn't want to add another loan with more interest on top of it. I have about $2k saved up for a car that we could use to potentially drop the interest rate on a loan.",finance
personalfinance,Investment Property or Payoff Graduate Loans?,"EDIT (4/11/2019): Thanks to everyone who commented and sent me messages. It seems like the common wisdom is that if the interest rates on my debt are higher than 5%, paying them off before reinvesting is the smarter move. Also halting 401k contributions instead of taking loans out against the 401k is the smarter move to pay off debt. I'm still undecided but will likely pay off the $26k portion of my graduate loan (6.1%) and leave the $18k portion (5.5%), keeping the remaining cash in a more robust emergency fund.

First time posting in this subreddit (with an alt as my friends know my main) so apologies for any mistakes, faux pas, or if I included too much information. Going for completeness here.


I recently sold a bunch of stock after leaving a company and now find myself with cash and conflicting ideas of how I should use it. There are several local properties I would like to consider purchasing to generate income and build wealth. I rent several rooms at present in my house so I'm generally familiar with the logistics of being a landlord.


The Question: Considering my financial situation below, should I take ~$35,000 and up to a $20,000 loan from my 401k to pay off my Grad School loans ($44,000), put 20% down on a rental property (expected monthly income $500 - $1000 after mortgage payments), or something else entirely? Thank you in advance!

personalfinance,Wife only has $10k in student loans on her credit report. She is considering paying an advisor $89/month for advice on boosting her credit.,"My wife has been wanting to boost her credit for a few years now, however, her student loans have been in deferment because we couldn't afford to make payments, until recently.

She spoke to an advisor, my wife told her the $10k in student loans is the only thing on her report. The advisor mentioned something about a class action lawsuit with Naviant and told her she can help her boost her credit for $89 a month.

Hearing this, I told my wife there is nothing the advisor can do/tell her to do with a federal student loan except pay it or call them and claim a hardship and get a reduced payment. Either way it will boost her credit. 

She accepts this but does not quite believe it, she is hoping the advisor can work out a deal or find a way to lessen her total debt. I told her she can do that with credit cards or private loans but not federal/school. 

Am I wrong, should we try the advisor?

personalfinance,Have a great job in a HCOL area but hate living here. Considering my options.,"So here is my situation, it's a bit complex and covers many different topics that are usually covered in this sub so I figured this would be the right place to share it. I have lived in a HCOL area (LA) for three years after obtaining my masters degree with a pretty good job. It has flexible hours, telecommuting, and the retirement plan is also a pretty nice. It's a 403b with a guaranteed 5-12% employer contribution (NOT match) depending on seniority and salary (Unless my raise is really low this year it should soon be around 8% for me) and has some low cost index funds to choose from. But perhaps most importantly of all, my job should be pretty secure since it's more or less a public sector one, and most of the work fits my skill set really well. 


I did not make this thread to humble brag, because I know I am very fortunate to have this job. Rather what I want to get off my chest is that I have come to despise living here. Like many other transplants to the area I was initially enjoying the mild winters and diverse food options, but after about two years or so I realized that the honeymoon period has ended. To summarize my main gripes with living here (feel free to skip these bullets since this is mostly just me ranting):  

- The climate utterly bores me. Sure not having to scrape ice off my car is convenient but I miss having thunderstorms and four distinct seasons (My field is meteorology after all). I especially hate the summers here which are wretchedly dry and unbearably hot.
- I am feeling more and more worn out by the horrendous traffic. It's not bad in my main commute route to where I work but it's hard to escape if I want to go anywhere else. I find myself having to honk my horn way too often because I have to constantly deal with aggressive self-centered drivers on the freeways. And my wallet is feeling it because of the unsurprisingly high car insurance rates due to how frequent accidents are.
- As the title suggests, the cost of living here is insane. Even though my job pays better than most others in the area (I am currently making $107k and could very well be making above $120k if I receive a promotion soon), it's still nowhere near enough to afford a home here on one income. Since I do not want roommates, I rent a studio apartment for around $2400 a month that's close to my job. I still think it's way too expensive for what it is, but I don't think I could afford anything bigger without drastically increasing my commute. I am the type of person who would prefer to be a homeowner, but it's unrealistic in this area even with my salary. Saving up for a large down payment can take a very long time without sacrificing retirement contributions.
- Perhaps most of all, I feel like there is no sense of community here. This one is a bit hard to explain in words but basically I grew up in an area where everyone knew each other and there was a sense of togetherness. Every time I walk around my neighborhood to do anything I never see someone I recognize. Perhaps the turnover rate in my apartment and this city as a whole is high. It quite literally feels like I am living in a rat race.

These have been my general feelings for the past year or so and I mean no offense to anyone that does enjoy living here, however I have become convinced that it's not for me. My initial idea at a solution was to take advantage of the fact that my job offers telecommuting on most days and buy a home in a small mountain town 75 miles away from where I worked. I had been researching the area for the past four months or so and was extremely close to putting an offer on a house I really liked, but after I thought it over I got a reality check. I initially wanted to go with NFCU's 0-down 0 PMI Homebuyers Choice program. It sounded great on paper, but after finally getting my pre-approval letter from them my jaw dropped at the closing costs: $28k! That's exactly how much I have in the bank, which made the whole thing a no go. The PMI that I thought I was avoiding was really just being paid upfront. I still have another backup lender with significantly lower closing costs ($12k) that also offers 3.5% down payment assistance via a subordinate loan, but the main mortgage they offered now has a subpar interest rate (5%) and has standard monthly PMI. For the house in question, this would result in an estimated monthly payment (P&amp;I, PMI, taxes, and homeowners insurance) of around $2.8k, which is a bit more that I am comfortable with even considering how much I expect my income to increase in the next year. As much as I loved the house, I am thinking that I have no choice but to walk away.

And then it all hit me: For what reason am I going through all this trouble and rushing myself to buy a house when I still have less funds available for a down payment than I am comfortable with? The answer to that is of course my desire to keep my job while trying to escape the hustle and bustle of urban living. If I went with this method, I would have to accept living in a small town without most of the amenities I am used to having here for at least five years with the fear of potential buyers remorse. Is all this worth it just to remain in a position to keep the job that I may have grown too comfortable with while attaining my dream of homeownership?  

As a result I am now starting to think I should call off my house hunting plans and sit tight as a renter for another year or two, both to give me the opportunity to save up for a larger down payment and to consider my future. Specifically, I am thinking I might be better off leaving California entirely and finding another job in a less expensive area that I like more. Northern Colorado immediately comes to mind since this is where I previously lived and I honestly really miss living there. The down side is it's also somewhat expensive (but much less so than SoCal) and I would have to most likely take a 10-20% cut in pay. I know this was a very long and roundabout rant, but I figured this was the right place to put this since the subjects of homeownership and career development are commonly brought up here. I was wondering if anyone here who has been in a situation could chime in?

Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,I love this debt reduction Excel template &amp; I hope you do too.,"(On mobile.....sorry for format issues)

EDIT: There’s templates for Google Sheets and OpenOffice too!

Over the past 10 years I got myself into ~$17,000 in credit card debt across 5 different cards, plus $51,000 in federal student loans and (at time of purchase) a $13,000 car loan. 

At a certain point I became the kind of person who spent their free time researching methods/calculators/advice on how to pay off debt as efficiently as possible because it was legitimately fun to me. It became a game and I wanted to win, with the grand prize being able to start saving for a down payment on a house. After months of looking for a free, comprehensive template to use for Excel (not proficient enough to make my own) I found it:

www.vertex42.com/Calculators/debt-reduction-calculator.html

It’s easy, user friendly, has a great quick start video on the site, &amp; features multiple strategies on how to repay your debts (I will note that I haven’t input my student loans, just my personal debts, so I don’t know if this template is right for them. Uncle Sam can wait....) It has every single feature I could ask for, plus some I didn’t even know I wanted. 

I have seen a lot of debt management tools in the past year or two, and in my opinion this one is the absolute best for laypeople like me. I’ve been able to stick to the payment plan it provides for 10 months now, and I’m actually 2 months ahead on my payoff schedule due to small additions to my snowball. It’s fun to sip a glass of wine and see how an extra $10 here, $20 there can lessen the amount of time (&amp; total interest!) it will take to pay everything off. 

I hope this tool helps someone as much as it’s helped me. I can’t wait for July, 2021 to be (mostly) debt free!!!!",finance

CryptoCurrency,SEC Creating a Chilling Effect on Blockchain Innovation,"Hey everyone!  


I created an article based on the new SEC guidelines concerning digital assets.  
[https://medium.com/theblockchainbench/sec-issues-guidelines-on-digital-assets-nobody-panic-821ebae769d5](https://medium.com/theblockchainbench/sec-issues-guidelines-on-digital-assets-nobody-panic-821ebae769d5)  


TLDR: The main takeaway is that the SEC guidelines aren't codified into law and don't supersede any existing case law. These new guidelines echo past statements and the application of the Howey test to digital assets. The SEC is basically casting a wide net and saying that basically all crypto is a security (besides ones that it deems to be sufficiently decentralized like Bitcoin and Ethereum). It is very telling when members of congress comment on the same day and say that only meaningful regulation and laws can come from Congress.

4. Residential construction is very slightly increasing, but the housing stock is poor (new homes are expensive, existing homes are out of date)
5. Car dealerships are increasing inventories, especially new car dealers very recently to levels which appear outsized to the population. Used car dealerships seem have to rebounded 3 ish years ago, but prices seem lower and inventories higher

personalfinance,Incoming Medical Resident - Amend Return to Married Filing Separately,"Hello PF,

I'm a medical student set to graduate in a little over a month. As I'm preparing for intern year and residency, I'm researching and reading up to get my finances in order. To be honest, it's all a bit overwhelming so I'd love to get any advice from this sub as I've already learned a lot from you folks. Here's a bit of my finances as background:

1. Fed loans (principal): 280k
2. Fed loans (interest): 30k
3. Private loans (undergrad): 25k
4. Spouse Fed loans: 6k

I believe my expected salary for the next 3 years is 54k, 56k, 60k. My spouse made 30.5k last year (our 2018 taxes) and will make 42k this year with a 5% increase per year.

Firstly, I'm going to refinance my private loans to get the lowest interest rate possible. Then enroll in PAYE and apply for PSLF since my 3 years of training will be at a 501(c)(3) hospital.

The main dilemma I'm running into is that I already submitted my taxes with TurboTax as married filing jointly. From what I've read, in order to maximize the benefits of PAYE, I need to have submitted as married filing separately so it only takes into account my 2018 salary (big fat zero) when calculating my payments during intern year.

1. Should I look to amend it to married filing separately? Or should I pull out of deferment asap, let it calculate my payments with my wife's income, and start making payments while my salary is low? Or is the calculated ""$0"" payment under PAYE counted as a payment month?
2. Is it difficult to amend from MFJ to MFS using TurboTax? Edit: I just tried to amend it and it looks like we'd owe 2.7k (unless I didn't do it right). Since our 2018 AGI is 30.5k, even with MFJ and PAYE, our payments will be $42 a month \* 12 = $504 during my first year of training. I'd rather keep the MFJ status and 2.7k. Then for our 2019 taxes, I'll file MFS since it would calculate my income from July-Dec. Does this sound right?
3. Is there anything else I'm overlooking or should consider?

personalfinance,"Husband, father of two, veteran going back to school but can't make ends meet...","I'm 30 yrs old, I have a wife, 2 1/2 yr old son, 4 month old daughter, I rent a house from my mom (long story there, I maintain hers and our home and lot, we are all on the same lot), I am in the Navy Reserves, my wife works part time, I am also a full time student. 

Without all of the details for the month to month (we pay our bills and whatever else and have $200 left over usually for savings) I can't get financial aid due to my SAP qualifications not meeting their standards (I've attempted more than 150% credit hours than an associates degree requires, I already have an A.A.). I've filed an appeal but it's a long shot that will get approved, the grounds I used for the appeal was that the courses affecting me the most are from 10 or more years ago and that I was recently diagnosed with ADD, regardless the feds tend to be black and white and I don't see why they would overlook my previous courses based on those excuses (I'm grabbing at straws, I'm throwing everything I've got). 

I am also a dual enrollment student (2 community colleges, it had to be done). I was informed to submit my private loan to my parents school (I only have 5 credit hours there and I have 7 at my other college, but the VA designated the 5 credit hr school as my parent, they explained it to me but it still didn't make any sense), and I found out two weeks ago that the check my private loan company had sent in was processed but my school couldn't find it.  

Over the past two weeks I've been calling the loan company and several depts at the college to figure out where my loan money was cuz the college had no record. Ultimately, the private loan officer for my college had voided the check and sent it back to the same address (there's a different address for returned mail, so she sent it to the wrong address) based on that I hadn't met SAP criteria, but I went with this company because they didn't have any requirements other than a 2.0 GPA min, which I had. After missing half of my two hour lecture, after finishing my lab early, I found out that they can't accept the loan because I am not enrolled in half time or more, I only have 5 credit hours. This was news to everyone including the director of financial aid, who I managed to coax out of his building by refusing to leave and find a resolution to this issue since I'm already paying my interest on a loan I don't have access to and I'm the only one that cares apparently.

There were several instances where I feel like I was being targeted as well. I had had a nasty dispute with a financial aid officer a month prior (not her fault, I was in a bad place from stress and overreacted, but I did apologize not that that makes everything all better) and my loan company dispersed my fund to my college very early last month but I was told to wait until this month to meet the next disbursement period (there was a disbursement window shortly after they received my funds, but maybe they need more time for processing...idk). So, I waited a month and went to pick up my check on the day I was told to go pick up a check and they had nothing in their system for me. Not the business Dept, not financial aid, no one. The personal loan fin. aid. lady never called me back after I left voicemails and never answered her phone when I called (she probably was legitimately out of the office, I assume, but I never got a response to my messages is what is part of the problem). 

A list of events to why I think I'm being targeted:

1. I've never gotten a call back from her after leaving several messages on her personal work voicemail.

2. I had called her to try to resolve the issue over the phone and actually got her after a couple transfers (I'd have to be transferred to a different department and get transferred back and after a transferred call comes back to the main desk and I was transferred to her it would work). She insisted that she didn't have any funds and that my loan agency was all she was waiting on. 

2-3) I numbered it this way because they tie in together somehow. I had just talked to the loan agency and they told me the payment was processed and they don't know why my school can't find my account (it's because the school cancelled it and sent the check back to the wrong address. The loan company never received the funds back and it appeared to them that they processed it, since it's a deadend P.O. Box they sent it to). It ended up resulting in the fact that I wasn't enrolled more than half-time with my school (5 credit hours there, and 7 at my 'daughter' college) and that was the final determination, which doesn't have anything to do with SAP.

4. The really shady part is when I had informed her (the schools primary private loan officer) that I would come to her office so we could figure it out because the bank and my college seemed to be on two-seperate-pages (she laughed at me while on the phone when I offered to come by her office now, it was 2 p.m. btw) and we could work out the discrepancy with all three of us as part of the discussion, as I had my bank on hold for me awaiting their officer.

5. But when I got to the office she was just sitting at her desk eating a vending machine snack and I saw her go over to her receptionist, while holding two folders in front of her mouth so I couldn't see what she was saying (she knew I was there, I told her I was coming, and the sign-in log just so happened to be started on a new page where I wasn't listed, I was only halfway through the page I had signed in on and never got an employee signature for having seen me) and I saw her receptionist write something on a blue sticky note.

6. I was curious what was on this sticky note since she and I made eye contact prior and I considered myself an exceptional case when it comes to loans since no one knew where my loan was at, and I would think that would be unusual. So, I made small chat with the receptionist and got a good view if the sticky note she had written and it had my name with a large X next to it and circled. I think she had told her receptionist to not allow me to see her while she held those folders in front of her face.  

7. Long story short, I don't want to rock the boat because I committed the first wrong against someone that holds my financial well being in their hands and I don't want it to go any further, but without this loan I will have to drop out of college and get whatever mundane job I can to make it through the next 4 months. I literally can't make it past mid June without it. 

Idk what my options are, I'm drowning in school, kids, life (my grandfather apparently won't make to the end of the month now and Grandma needs all kinds of help, plus I have to figure out a way to be on grandpa's miitary honor guard team for my grandma, so that's even more time than I have)

I've been in emergency mode for the last 6 months (IRS stuff, DFAS stuff, Treasury stuff) and I always get screwed over in the end (they all garnished my tax return after me verifying that it wouldn't be with each of them, through multiple departments). 

Maybe this isn't the right forum, but I'm out of options. If I can make it to fall I can start my bachelor's degree program, but as for now I won't make it through the end of the month (I can charge things and move stuff around and cash out investments, with a penalty, to make it to mid June, but I've been saving those investments for years and they aren't able to be drawn on for a long time still)

I might be done, I thought there may be a life after active duty service but it's so far reaching idk how anyone can achieve it. The last year and a half have been far more detrimental to my mental well-being than anything I ever encountered while serving. Ironically, I joined so I wouldn't have to worry about education expenses, since I couldn't afford it and didn't know what I wanted to be when I grew up back the  (aside from the feeling that I owed my service to my country, that's changed btw).

So here's just another lost soul, overwhelmed by everything life has beaten him down with over time. I'm tired. I am constantly drowning. I am broken. Any advice is welcome. I do already have a ""counselor"" (he's a joke) and I have filled out every form I can find for a mental health eval but, as Americans know, it's a broke system.",finance

personalfinance,"Want to move to a new area, but is it worth?","Just soliciting some public feedback. I currently live in a 3 year old home, built brand new, but the area is slightly undesirable. The major upside is that the cost of the home is quite affordable and the mortgage is 20% of my current after tax income. I live within 15 mins of my job, but work remotely 80-100 percent of the time. Most amenities such as Costco, whole foods, target are  roughly 20 mins away. Downside is that the schools are not quite as good as some areas and less diverse in cultures.

&amp;#x200B;

In the city we live, there is a lot of opportunity to build new homes, but my wife and I have an interest in potentially building a new home in an area that would put us closer to certain desirable amenities listed above. The travel distance would be cut to 10 mins. Schools are better in this area and there is a high chance of the homes in this area to go up in value. There are some very large companies building new facilities in the area and this will bring in a large number of skilled employees to the area, which would drive home costs up. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is it worth going from a 280,000 mortgage (3.75 interest rate) to a potentially 400k+ (4%+ interest?) mortgage just to be 10 mins closer to amenities and the potential for home value to go up? Access to new restaurants and coffee shops would be closer which is important to me and my wife. Diversity and other cultures is much higher in the new area which is also important because we like to experience other cultures. I did the math and i would have to spend more than $1000 a month in fuel and maintenance costs to justify the increase in mortgage. The math doesn't make financial sense, but time does play a large role as well as potential for a large increase in value of the home. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you made it this far, thanks for reading. Looking for honest feedback and maybe a new perspective. Or maybe just call me crazy. All feedback welcome.",finance
personalfinance,"About $49,000 in credit card debt and looking for some help. Not sure if best options or methods to proceed regarding minimizing interest rates and payment timeline.","Just need some advice on best method to proceed. I recently found out that, and assume fault of not checking or communicating apparently enough, that my spouse drained our $25k in savings in an account that has been sitting for some time and opened a decent amount of credit lines that now have roughly $49k on them.

We make decent money, combined income of about $103k, take home around $70k. The monthly payments on these is going to be about $2k which then equates to about 33% roughly of monthly.

It’s cliche, but I didn’t know there was a problem. Are there any options that would be best course of advice? I am not familiar with debt consolidation or other options as we have always managed just fine. 

We are not behind any payments, and I understand the fault we played here. Just looking for some sound advice that people familiar with these issues may have.

Takeaways on this article: market seems to be buying into this as a stronger signal of slow rate rise.

The new data is collected directly from a department store company. Department store numbers are generally volatile.

A rise in energy prices did not broadly impact other prices. (Anyone else see that as something other than squeezing margins?)

Fed’s Powell reaffirms data dependence. (But the data just changed a bit...)

Investors broadly expect a rate cut in the coming year.

Low unemployment isn’t doing the usual inflation thing.

Used car prices are down, new car are up. 0.4 both ways. (Both had weak sales in March possibly due to weather. The Manheim index is worth following https://publish.manheim.com/content/dam/consulting/ManheimUsedVehicleValueIndex-LineGraph.png)

investing,Explainer: how banks fed Aramco bond frenzy: Record orders of $100bn for debut oil bond shine a light on Wall Street tactics,"https://www.ft.com/content/6c4d38c0-5ada-11e9-939a-341f5ada9d40

Saudi Aramco’s debut international bond sale drew $100bn of investor orders for the initial $10bn available to buy, smashing records for an emerging-market bond sale. How does that imbalance between orders and allocations happen, and what does it mean?

How does a company issue a bond?

In this case, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley are the global co-ordinators, meaning they are running the show. Citi, Goldman Sachs, HSBC and NCB Capital Company are helping out as “joint bookrunners”.

A so-called roadshow was held last week, where bankers and Saudi Aramco executives travelled around the globe to talk to investors, answer questions and drum up demand.

Bankers provide the first suggestions of how much the bond will yield and in turn, investors respond with early indications of interest — a sort of hypothetical order to buy the bond if the final price matches what the bankers had said. By the end of last week those indicative orders had reached about $30bn.

So, the banks’ work is done?

Not quite. The next step for the bankers is to firm up the price. They send out a summary to investors with details about each chunk of the bond, its maturity and its likely price. This is known as initial price talk.

Investors now submit fresh offers to buy the bond — and how much of it they want. But here is where it gets tricky, as Paul McNamara, investment director at GAM, a Swiss-based asset manager, points out.

Investors already know there are more investors wanting to buy the bond than the banks can sell to. As a result, investors routinely ask for more than they actually want, expecting the banks to sell them only a sliver of their order. “Once you get into a cycle where the order book is seen as reflective of demand, it creates demand in its own right,” says Mr McNamara.

Which investors get what?

It depends on who you are and what you are asking for. If you are a large and important client to the bank selling the bond, then you are more likely to get what you want. Similarly, if you are asking for just a small amount, it is easier to fulfil that order.

Investors say small and midsized fund managers who want to buy a decent amount are often stuck. “It’s like game theory in a way for us, as a medium-sized client,” says Mr McNamara of GAM, which had about $130bn of assets at the end of last year. “We have a final amount we’d like to get. But someone like Pimco or the big sovereign wealth funds will get a better allocation because of their size and the fact that they are regarded as strong hands that won’t try to flip the bond” if the price rises.

Doesn’t this complicate things for the banks?

Rampant overbidding is a nice problem to have. Part of the solution is to tweak the deal terms.

If orders really pile up, banks tend to increase the amount to be borrowed or improve the price for the borrower, or both, trying to let demand more closely match what is on offer. If this happens, investors can change their order or drop out. For Aramco’s deal, banks increased the size of the deal from $10bn to $12bn while also lowering the interest rate paid to investors.

Banks, often in close consultation with the issuer, must choose who gets what. In the case of Saudi Aramco, a key reason for issuing the bond — bearing in mind that the company does not need the money — was to ingratiate itself with investors at a time when the country is stung by controversy over the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

For that reason, banks may look to include as many investors in the deal as possible, rather than prioritising larger buyers.

“It’s tricky for any issuer that comes to the market for the first time,” says Tim Jagger, head of emerging market debt at Columbia Threadneedle. “They want to get the lowest cost of funds possible but they are also entering a new relationship with investors.”

personalfinance,homebuying- budget freakout,"My wife and I have been preapproved for $200K. This was sort of an arbitrary amount, and we knew it, and are looking closer to $150-75.

We gross just over $90K per year, which for our area is quite good for a household. We have $30K in liquid savings but would prefer to keep around $10K for contingencies, leaving $20K for closing and down payment (which is enough for the 5% but not much more). Both have credit scores in the mid 700s. We have an infant daughter in day care but that's a payroll deduction and not in our gross, out of sight, out of mind. So far so good.

I have a preteen son from a previous relationship, with an informal child support arrangement to his mother of about $400 a month. Groan. I also have modest-to-high student loan debt ($55K for undergrad) with just a shockingly high monthly payment. I refinanced about $22K of them recently at 5.42%, $330/mo. Then the remainder are federal consolidation loans at 5%, on income-based repayment (required for public service loan forgiveness, I work at a nonprofit, but who the hell knows if that'll ever happen), that have just gone up to a gutwrenching $530/mo. So, $860/mo total just for that.

Obviously if I could go back in time I'd tell myself to spend less time getting my undergrad, on less borrowed. But we're here now.

I also have a $225/mo car payment, for one more year. But the wife's car is starting to really rack up the miles and may need replacing in the next couple years.

And, to add insult to injury, we drive a LOT — about an hour each way, both of us in opposite directions, and live in the middle. We spend something like $400/mo in gas. It's absurd.

We just looked at a house for $175K. It ticks all the boxes. We love it. We ""technically"" could afford it, but looking at our budget gives me chills. There are things we could scale back on, but we're not very extravagant spenders. In real terms, we've been netting close to breakeven, within $100-$200 above or below, for the past few months, and our rent is relatively cheap for our area at $750/mo (but with the kids now we've outgrown the space).

Various calculators put our ""affordability"" figure at $136K with 36% DTI. We could possibly find something acceptable in the area at that price, but likely with large concessions.

personalfinance,Difficulty with Purchasing or Leasing a Car for Bank Regulator,"Hello,

I would like to obtain financing for a car lease or purchase; however, this is difficult because of constraints from my job. I am a bank examiner for a federal agency and we are not allowed to obtain loans from any bank/financial institution that we supervise. I was told that it is virtually impossible to find a dealership whose financing is not through one of our institutions or holding companies. I thought of applying for a loan through a credit union but have not found one that offers a competitive rate. Any suggestions?

personalfinance,Debt plan review,"I'll save the story of how I got into this debt and go with the facts. I am a 32 year old single parent working in IT and I've accumulated approximately $32,000 in credit card debt. I have worked on creating a budget and plan on snowballing the debt since they are all relatively around the same interest rate. I'm hoping for some feedback and suggestions for anything I've missed or haven't thought of.  

Monthly:  
Net Income: $6100  

Rent: $1700  
Auto Lease: $340 (a safe and reliable vehicle is very important to me as I'm often driving my own and other's children)  
Auto ins.: Prepaid $1000 every 6 months to save, so $167  
Grocery: $800  
Gym memberships: $295 (Lifetime 160/JiuJitsu 135) Yes the cost is high, self care is very important to me and I spend a lot of time here training.  
Child-specific expenses: $200  
Utilities: (Netflix, Internet, Electricity): $200  
Gas/Tolls: $75  
Misc. Spending to keep my sanity (We go out to eat once, maybe twice a month, movie theater, always looking for deals): $200  

So overall I hope to put $1800-2100 a month towards my debt. My credit score has dropped from ~700 to ~600 because of my high utilization, a lot of the cards actually lowered my credit line to below my balance over the past 6 months... I am hoping that if I snowball pay, some of my cards will present 0% Balance Transfer opportunities, as right now I don't have any so I am stuck paying interest.

I've really done my best to clean up costs where I could. We don't have cable, I work from home as much as I can to save on gas and tolls, I prepay my auto insurance to save, I buy food in bulk and meal prep every Sunday for both of us, I've paused my contributions to 401k until I get my debt under control, I've adjusted my paycheck withholding so I owe about $500 a year in taxes which I figure is better than getting back a 0% interest return every April.

stocks,"Should we just trust what IMF says about usa's current situation? because Federal reserve ""misread crisis in 2008""","On the morning after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy in 2008, most Federal Reserve officials still believed that the American economy would keep growing despite the metastasizing financial crisis.

The Fed’s policy-making committee voted unanimously against bolstering the economy by cutting interest rates, and several officials praised what they described as the decision to let Lehman fail, saying it would help to restore a sense of accountability on Wall Street.

James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, urged his colleagues “to wait for some time to assess the impact of the Lehman bankruptcy filing, if any, on the national economy,” according to transcripts of the Fed’s 2008 meetings that it published on Friday.

The hundreds of pages of transcripts, based on recordings made at the time, reveal the ignorance of Fed officials about economic conditions during the climactic months of the financial crisis. Officials repeatedly fretted about overstimulating the economy, only to realize time and again that they needed to redouble efforts to contain the crisis.

The Fed’s chairman at the time, Ben S. Bernanke, was unusually clearsighted in warning of the risk of a severe recession as the nation entered into a presidential election year. But he struggled to persuade his colleagues, and at crucial junctures he did not push forcefully for stronger action.

The Fed’s current chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, then the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, was even more alarmed by the deterioration of economic conditions. She and Eric Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, are the most forceful and persistent advocates for stronger action in the transcripts. But they, too, underestimated the downturn until the final months of 2008.

The transcripts also show, however, that Fed officials responded decisively in those final months, probably preventing an even deeper recession. By the end of 2008, the Fed had reduced short-term interest rates nearly to zero for the first time since the Great Depression, and it had become a primary source of funding not just for the global financial system but for American homeowners and for companies that made food and cars.

Ms. Yellen summed up this new ethos at a Fed meeting six weeks after Lehman’s failure, telling colleagues, “Given the seriousness of the situation, I believe that we should put as much stimulus into the system as we can as soon as we can.”

In normal times, the Fed is a powerful but somnolent institution, charged with keeping a steady hand on the rudder of the economy. It moves interest rates up and down to moderate inflation and minimize unemployment. But beginning in 2007, it was forced to take on a far more challenging role as the central backstop for the global financial system.

The Fed’s understanding of the crisis, however, was clouded by its reliance on indicators that tend to miss sharp changes in conditions. The government initially estimated, for example, that the economy expanded in the first half of 2008 because it basically assumed that some economic trends, like the pace of business creation, had continued apace. The Fed also relied on economic models that assumed the existence of smoothly functioning financial markets, limiting its ability to project the consequences of a breakdown. And the outlook of Fed officials also reflected a deeply ingrained bias to worry more about the risk of inflation than the reality of rising unemployment.

As Fed officials gathered on Sept. 16 at their marble headquarters in Washington for a previously scheduled meeting, stock markets were in free fall. Housing prices had been collapsing for two years, and unemployment was climbing.

Yet most officials did not see clear evidence of a broad crisis. They expected the economy to grow slowly in 2008 and then more quickly in 2009.

The transcript for that meeting contains 129 mentions of “inflation” and five of “recession.”

Mr. Bernanke even told his colleagues that it was clear the economy had entered a downturn but that he still did not favor cutting rates.

“I think that our policy is looking actually pretty good,” he said.

That optimism would not long endure. Just minutes after the end of that first meeting, a smaller group of Fed officials agreed to rescue the faltering insurance giant the American International Group, a company never before subject to Fed supervision that until then was barely on the government’s radar.

In the succeeding weeks, as evidence of a downturn became unmistakable, the Fed would announce a seemingly endless series of programs to buttress the economy, leading Fed officials to joke about the resulting alphabet soup of acronyms.

In early October, a few weeks after the decision to stand pat, the Fed convened an unscheduled meeting to cut interest rates in an action coordinated with other major central banks.

“It’s more than obvious that we have an extraordinary situation,” Mr. Bernanke told colleagues.

“I should say that this comes as a surprise to me,” he said. “I very much expected that we could stay at 2 percent for a long time, and then when the economy began to recover, we could begin to normalize interest rates. But clearly things have gone off in a direction that is quite worrisome.”

He closed on a prescient note, telling the committee that he did not expect that monetary policy could solve the problem, but that the Fed should not be hesitant to use the tools that it had.

By the end of the year, the Fed had cut interest rates nearly to zero and started to buy mortgage bonds in a further effort to stimulate the housing market and the broader economy. More than five years later, it is still pursuing both policies even as the economic recovery remains incomplete.

Some Fed officials have argued that the Fed was blind in 2008 because it relied, like everyone else, on a standard set of economic indicators.

As late as August 2008, “there were no clear signs that many financial firms were about to fail catastrophically,” Mr. Bullard said in a November presentation in Arkansas that the St. Louis Fed recirculated on Friday. “There was a reasonable case that the U.S. could continue to ‘muddle through.’ ”

Within weeks, Mr. Bernanke also began to insist that the failure of Lehman could not have been prevented without changes in federal law. Furthermore, some officials began to argue that the importance of the failure had been overstated because the economy was already falling apart.

“The whole framing, which seems to have hardened now, that the world ended with the Lehman bankruptcy is just deeply unfair to the basic truth,” Timothy F. Geithner, then the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said at an October meeting. “Independent of whether there was an option available at the time, the erosion in underlying economic conditions and in confidence in the future outlook was powerful and substantial going into August and early September.”

The Fed entered the year on edge. Officials did not know that the economy already was in recession, but Mr. Bernanke and his closest advisers worried that the Fed’s initial response to the financial crisis at the end of 2007 had been insufficient, and that tumbling stock prices were the beginning of a broader pullback.

Mr. Bernanke hoped to delay any action until the first scheduled meeting of 2008 in late January, but over the three-day Martin Luther King weekend, he concluded that the Fed could not wait. He convened a conference call at 6 p.m. on Monday, Jan. 21, and won agreement to cut the Fed’s benchmark interest rate 0.75 percentage point, the largest cut in more than two decades.

“The risk of a severe recession and credit crisis is unacceptably high,” Ms. Yellen said at the meeting.

Dennis Lockhart, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, said this week that the decision was an awakening. “If maybe we were a little slow to recognize what was happening, Martin Luther King weekend in January 2008 was a decisive point in terms of interest rate policy,” he said.

By early March, the Fed was moving to replace investors as a source of funding for Wall Street.

Financial firms, particularly in the mortgage business, were beginning to fail because they could not borrow money. Investors had lost confidence in their ability to predict which loans would be repaid. Countrywide Financial, the nation’s largest mortgage lender, sold itself for a relative pittance to Bank of America. Bear Stearns, one of the largest packagers and sellers of mortgage-backed securities, was teetering toward collapse.

On March 7, the Fed offered companies up to $200 billion in funding. Three days later, Mr. Bernanke secured the Fed policy-making committee’s approval to double that amount to $400 billion, telling his colleagues, “We live in a very special time.”

Finally, on March 16, the Fed effectively removed any limit on Wall Street funding even as it arranged the Bear Stearns rescue.

And then the Fed paused. By the end of April, it had cut short-term rates to 2 percent from 5.25 percent the previous September — one of the fastest falls in Fed history — and officials said they had done enough to shore up the financial system. They predicted that the economy would narrowly avoid a recession.

“I think it is very possible that we will look back and say, particularly after the Bear Stearns episode, that we have turned the corner in terms of the financial disruption that we have just experienced,” Frederic S. Mishkin, a Fed governor, said during a meeting at the end of April.

The summer passed relatively quietly. Officials began to fret about inflation. The transcripts include long conversations about when the Fed should start to raise interest rates.

“We saw growth of about 2 percent in the second quarter, which suggests a campaign slogan for the Republicans, ‘The Economy: It Could Be Worse,” Mr. Bernanke joked in early August.

But it was only the eye of the storm. By the third week of September, it was clear that Mr. Bernanke was right: Things could be worse. The financial crisis had arrived, as Ernest Hemingway once wrote of bankruptcy, “Gradually and then suddenly.”

personalfinance,Refinancing Parent Plus Loan from Parent to Student,"Hi guys, I'm looking to refinance the Parent Plus Loan that's currently in my father's name. I've already been paying on this loan for about 5 years on a graduated plan, with 5 years remaining. I'm looking to lock in my payment where it is now and hopefully shave off some interest.

**Current:**

* Balance: $76,500 - Interest Rate: 7.9%
* Monthly payment: $1,136.85 
* Total Lifetime Paid: $93,119.85 (based on the non-graduated monthly payment of $1,552 because I couldn't figure out how to calculate being on the graduated plan)


I've looked into SoFi and Commonbond. SoFi gave me a lower interest rate and a slightly lower monthly payment.

**SoFi details:**

* 5 Year term with 4.77% fixed interest rate or 4.5% variable
* 7 Year Term with 5.024% fixed rate OR 4.77% variable 


* 5 year, Monthly Payment: $1,444.49
* 7 year, Monthly Payment: $1,091.12

* 7 Year Total Lifetime Paid: $91,654

The plan would be to go forward with the 7 year term because I can't currently afford the 5 year term's monthly payment but wanted to include it anyway for comparison's sake.

I'm not sure if these rates will change once they run a hard credit report, but this seems worthwhile to me to get a static monthly payment that no longer increases every few years. And it seems like I'll have paid around 2k less in interest at the end.

Does this seem to check out and make sense as I have calculated? Did I omit any essential info? Thanks guys",finance

Are Federal debts subject to the “7-year delete” rule?

I have about $75k that DFAS claims I owe. The debt dates  back to 2010, but no attempt to collect was made until 2017.  Check my post history if you want to know the details of that incident, but the long and short is I refused to pay.  DFAS attempted to garnish wages, but I won a hearing to stop that.  DFAS responded by charging off the debt. They also put it in  the treasury recovery program to siege my tax returns (Not a big deal as I owe less than $100 each year). The charge off was a relatively minor hit to credit all told.

However, I was just made aware that the debt is now being reported as a charge off, plus it is entered for collections by DFAS too. They are entering every month as a missed payments too.

The whole validity of the debt is an entirely different story I don’t want to get in to at this time (see post history), but is still being disputed in court.

investing,Will Steve Moore be the Market’s White Knight?,"Global growth concerns continued this week. On Wednesday, data on Chinese industrial profits slowed the most since 2011. We also saw weak factory data and consumer confidence reported in the U.S., Europe and Japan. Like the Federal Reserve (Fed), the European Central Bank (ECB) also delayed planned interest rate increases due to growth concerns.

The U.S. 10-Year Treasury yield continued to fall this week to the lowest level since the end of 2017. The drop in yields caused some selling pressure in the stock market this week, as we saw money moving into bonds. Remember, as bond yields drop, bond prices rise. A move into bonds (perceived as safer investments) may be indicative of investors’ lack of confidence in the strength of the U.S. economy. Financials and small-cap stocks remain the weakest areas of the stock market, which suggests investors are still risk-averse. 

It seems investors are pricing-in possibly two interest rate cuts this year. Even if Steve Moore is appointed to the Fed's committee, the question remains how many rate cuts are necessary to bring economic growth back to expansion. Remember, GDP is currently contracting. Although the stock market may react positively to lower rates, it would mean the U.S. economy is slowing faster than anticipated. It’s no surprise that U.S. 4th Quarter 2018 GDP was revised down to 2.2% yesterday. 

The S&amp;P500 has pretty much moved sideways during the last few weeks, stalling less than 5% below its October all-time high. Although we remain bullish on the broader market, the trading range remains between 2700-2854 for the S&amp;P500. Needless to say, a breakdown below the 2700 area would mean further weakness ahead. A breakout above 2854 with higher volume and lower volatility would be an indication that the bull market will most likely continue to test the October highs.",finance
Bitcoin,The one reason why Bitcoin could fail,"Since I first got to know Bitcoin two years ago, I've had one question which has driven me to continue learning more about it: what could cause Bitcoin to fail?

The simple answer came to me pretty quickly. As Bitcoin's main selling point is that it is 'sound money' (money that can't just be printed/generated at will by, for example, a central bank), then the only threat to me is an alternative 'sound money'. (I rejected any other technological 'crash' like possibility).

Now, in relation to the possibility of an alternative 'sound money', I also rejected the possibility of a different crypto taking that place (for reasons many of you will be familiar with). 

The only possibility left (at least in my mind) is 'sound money' through Central Bank policy. I.e. The Central Banks are forced into a position of being prudent and, well, doing their job. And, perhaps Bitcoin is important not because it will replace fiat, but it provides a very, very useful (""Reserve Banking for Dummies"") indicator to Central Bankers of what will happen if they don't adjust.

My reading of the financial press leads me to believe (often reading through the lines) that some of the members of the Fed are aware of Bitcoin and the threat it poses. Even today there is an article in the Financial Times suggesting there is uncertainty on the Fed Board as to whether rates should go up (towards a 'sounder' monetary stance) or down (towards ruin). I think they are arguing amongst themselves (and I would suggest Jerome knows what's happening but he has a few idiots to contend with.) 

So, the questions that remain in my mind are, can the Fed (and other central banks) allow interest rates to increase? Can they pull it off? Can they allow the stock market (and other asset bubbles) to pop, simply because they have no choice if they want to retain control? Will going down that path destroy them anyway due to the blame they would face?

Is Bitcoin a return to sound money that will replace fiat or is it just a tool for them to come to their senses and fix the currencies that they already control?",cryptocurrency

But my question is about a policy I have been paying on for 28 years. Should I take the cash value or should I stick it out? Am I missing a piece of the puzzle that would make sticking it out the right financial decision?

* Policy is flexible premium universal life. 
* Issue date is 29 years ago, age 32
* Maturity date at age 96
* Guaranteed interest rate 4.5%
* Death benefit: $100K
* Cash value: $17K ($900 less than total premiums paid)

   * Continue to pay current/previous premium – policy ends age 80

personalfinance,Tax Deferred vs Taxable,"Investing in a 401K through your employer and a ROTH IRA through a broker are contradictory. In the 401K we are betting that taxes will be lower in retirement but when we contribute to a ROTH we are betting taxes will be higher in the future. If you truly believe taxes are going to be higher in the future, wouldn't it make sense to not contribute to a 401K (given you don't have a company match) and just contribute to a taxable account instead? Does anyone know of any calculators online that can compare 401K returns to Taxable account returns with varying interest rates? I think the biggest objection is that with the taxable account you are paying taxes as you go. However, this is more in line with ROTH. I think it's also important to take the ability to pay taxes into consideration since I am young and working rather than when I'm not working. Looking forward to hearing everyone's thoughts.",finance

We also found a realtor who is willing to give us around $28K back in credit out of his 3% commission.  However, we can only use the builder + realtor credit for closing costs and impound account and not towards down payment or anything else. The impound account can have up to 1 year's HOA and 7 months of property taxes.

worldpolitics,Russian NPP,"The decline in the nuclear industry began in the 1980s, and the accident at the Japanese nuclear power plant «Fukushima», caused by the devastating tsunami, finally knocked down the industry. In just two years, the share of atomic energy in world electricity production fell to 11% - and it has not recovered to its previous level. Thus, against the background of a general decline in the nuclear industry, the market for the development and export of new reactors was undermined by one single country - Russia.

As it is known, 10 nuclear power plants controlled by the «RosEnergoAtom» concern are operated in the Russian Federation. Also, Russia ranks first in the world in the construction of nuclear power plants abroad. Currently, foreign activities in the field of nuclear energy are carried out by companies within the structure of the state corporation «Rosatom», which in turn takes first place in the world in the number of NPP construction projects abroad - 34 power units in 12 countries around the world Middle East, North Africa, Asia-Pacific and CIS countries). At the moment, Russia has no serious rivals in the export of atomic technologies. 

However, many environmentalists from Europe and the United States speak out against the activities of Russian nuclear power plants, citing the fact that nuclear energy is extremely dangerous, recalling the historical events of the disasters at the Japanese Fukushima nuclear power plant and the Ukrainian Chernobyl nuclear power plant. However, to cite as an example the events that occurred 10 to 30 years ago is not reasonable.

Modern nuclear power plants, in particular in Russia, are created with high levels of security and safety. They meet the highest requirements of supervisory authorities, including protection from contamination by radionuclides and other harmful substances, and in the event of an accident, scientists are developing ways to reduce the risk of environmental impacts of nuclear power plants. To address this issue, development of safer in design reactors with impressive internal indicators of self-defense and self-compensation is being carried out. NPPs are built with multiple redundant protection systems.

Also, Russian NPPs practically do not pollute the environment, and the energy resources of nuclear fuel (uranium, plutonium, and others) substantially exceed the energy resources of the natural reserves of organic, fuel (oil, coal, natural gas, and others). This opens up broad prospects for meeting the rapidly growing fuel needs.",energy

personalfinance,I accidentally forgot to include my 1099-B form when e-filing my tax returns (I made a net loss on sale of stock). How do I go about filing an amended tax return?,"Of course I realize this as soon as I hit the e-file button..

So I made about $1500 loss on sale of a single stock in 2018; no other stock transactions. When I added this form to an online tax filing software, different than the one I used to e-file, I stood to gain about $500 in additional federal and state return.

Since this is a significant sum, I'm going to file an amended tax return, but I have no idea where to begin with this. The tax software + the rate plan I used doesn't seems to support 1099-B and I don't think I can pick a higher plan for the amendment part only.

So I know I have to fill and file 1040X manually. But I don't see any obvious boxes to add the -$1500 to. 

1. Do I simply deduct it from what I previously had in box 1? and cascade the change all the way down the form?
2. Are there any other forms I need to attach besides my 1099-B that shows my loss? I think Schedule-D is one. Anything else?

My 1099-B has boxes 1d/6, 1e, and 7 filled in, with box 7 showing -$1500 (which equals box 1e minux box 1d).

How do I send the IRS this info now? Also, am I forced to hire an accountant for the coming years?

Budgeting for an accountant is hard because severe health problems also popped up last year and income/savings go to that (we've actually spent our emergency budget and \~$40k of the overseas savings, worst timing to immigrate to the US and give up Euro health care :P ).

I couldn't wrap my head around taxes myself (super complicated; grants, military, students, multiple businesses but also several W2 incomes, dependents, ...) despite taking two months to read up on it and whenever I called the IRS with a question it took me 3 transfers and a few hours, lol. 

That's why I used Turbotax. (kinda hesitant to call right now because I feel like I messed up). Anyway, that's too much background info. Is hiring an accountant to file the right call for the years to come?

I’ve been a long time lurker on this sub and I have a little dilemma, I've been working at this great Marketing firm since October 2018. In my offer letter It states I would receive a 5k raise to my base salary starting January 2019.

It is now April and I have yet to receive this 5k increase to my base salary. I must note that since October 2018 we have had 20 person  layoff period which I survived back in December. I have had two reviews in this time and both have been satisfactory, yet when I ask about the 5k Im getting the runaround “ We are working on it/ We are talking to our accountants about it”.

So Reddit I’ve a little fed up and I feel as though they are testing my integrity by underpaying me for 4 months now.  

I like the company culture &amp; the job is in my degree, what should I do?",finance
personalfinance,"Waiting on a large tax refund, don't have as much time to wait as I expected","I am getting a rather large tax refund this year that is coming in 2 weeks. The problem is that I don't have 2 weeks to wait for it like I originally thought I did. Simply put I should have done my taxes earlier. I pay health insurance outside of my job so I just overestimate my earnings to the marketplace (my earnings can vary) and just pay until taxes are due and get back what I overpay through taxes. I planned on using these taxes to cover all my expenses for this month.

I have 2 things due, my car payment and my rent. My rent can probably wait as this is the first time I've ever been late (usually pay it on the 8th). So this leaves the car situation. I purchased my first car this year. I had successfully paid a 3 year lease off and just figured it would be best to buy it in the end. I bought it through a credit union. Honda always told me if I were late I could be anywhere from like 1-2 months late (I assume they would just have applied late fees) before they would even think about threatening to take the car back. I have never been in that situation, but it put a preconceived idea in my mind that it was the norm. 

I am about 20 days late on my first car payment to the credit union. They called my yesterday telling me if I don't come up with the money ASAP they will take my car due to having no history with me and not trusting first payments. When I was initially late I was going to just get a tax refund advanced and use that to pay it, but I figured out those ended on February 15th~. So now I am trying to figure out a way to use my taxes to finance my way through this mess. I have no clue what to do and am looking for any advice.

I can't take a personal loan because the interest rates I would get would bleed me for much more money down the road and put me in this situation for more than just this month. I went to /r/borrow as I thought if I paid them a one time interest charge in 2 weeks I would come out much better. I have no clue what to do and I'm not sure how to navigate this mess.

I made 2 stupid life first mistakes. #1 I didn't file my taxes early enough and got into the situation where I wanted/needed the advance and as a result #2 I didn't realize if I were to get into this type of sitatuion the credit union would be on my ass so fast. 

Does anyone have any suggestions or advice at all? Right now /r/borrow is the only thing I can think of but since I am a first time borrower I'm afraid no one is going to be willing to lend me the amount I am asking for.",finance

personalfinance,Is there really such a thing as good debt? Is credit really a good thing?,"Can someone explain what exactly Good Credit is?


 
I live in a family where my parents live well, newest model cars, very nice neighborhood, newest phones etc. They also make a combined income of ~$200,000/year. My parents are FIRM believers of keeping credit and having good credit. They both have an 800+ credit score and have never missed payments. They raised me to always pay off my balance in full every month, and at the very minimum pay off the statement to not accumulate interest. They had me lease a new car when my car broke down, and due to their cosign I only have a 2% interest rate. My parents said to stay under 30% of your credit limit at all time. Only buy what you can afford already. Due to them, I gained a 788 score in only a year or so with 1 car lease and 2 credit cards.


With that being said.
 

My girlfriends father, who makes roughly the same or a little more than my parents say ""No debt is good debt."" He believes in paying everything in full. Want a $40,000 car? He will save up $42,000 and buy the car in full. He believes in buying a house vs a mortgage. He says credit is for fools and that you should never pay anything over time and you should buy everything in cash. So he has 1 credit card that he hasn't used. He lives the same life style as my parents. He's more frugal with his money though. He'd rather drive a 2001 car with 230,000 miles for $2,000 that will last a year or two, then buy another one, than to buy a 2014 car with 30,000 miles for $10,000 that may last a good 10+ years.

 
What is good debt? Is it a thing? Why would people rather avoid it or flat out claim that building your credit is a fools game? Doesn't seem like either is any better than the other. But some people, even on here, have said ""Don't buy a credit card."" ""Never lease a vehicle"" ""Only buy a house in full."" I can't imagine saving up $320,000 for a house.",finance

personalfinance,Thinking about taking money from my 403(b),"Okay, for starters, I know this is kind of a cardinal sin of personal finance, to raid the retirement plan, and I'm sure some people have already got their pitchforks and torches out, but please hear me out before we get to the crucifyin'.

I have a great job. I make pretty good money. However, I am also responsible for a lot of things and a lot of people. So, money is tight. Like, really tight. I've got my student loans in forbearance, right now, just trying to ride things out until youngest kiddo finishes preschool in a couple of months (didn't qualify for any of the ""free"" or reduced payment options) which is just killing me, because I know the month to month expense of the loans is just going up the longer they have to sit like that.

I am pretty frugal. That's not to say I don't have any leisure expense at all, I have a spotify subscription because I like to listen to music while I go for walks and ride the bus, I have netflix because it helps keep everybody sane while I cook dinner. The part of my budget that goes to these things is very small. I sometimes ride the bus to work, but even if I drive, I park far away from the office and walk in to avoid paying for parking. I bring my lunch, which is usually just an apple or two. Most all of my clothes come from thrift stores, etc. I hope y'all get the idea. I don't really have many places I feel like I can cut expenses much further.

Credit card is maxed. It's only $3,500, but the interest rate on it is terrible. I've had this card since I was 18, and you can tell the rate on it is something they would offer an 18yo. One of my student loans is private and has an atrocious rate (11%) for a student loan (ITT scammed me hard, but no taksie backsies.) I'd really love to knock out the CC and the private student loan, which would give me enough breathing room to not feel like I'm permanently on the precipice of doom. I feel like the return on the retirement account doesn't come close to these rates, so the money is probably doing more work for me getting them off my back, than it is collecting interest, right now. This would free up about $400 a month of money I'm currently throwing at these items to save a little for emergency, and maybe expedite the paying off of my federal loans, I dunno.

I know I will have to pay taxes, and penalties, if I do this. I'm not really sure how much, but even if this knocks out the credit card and half the student loan, I'd still consider that a lot of weight off my shoulders. It's so depressing holding everything up, trying to do everything right, and even having a pretty good job and all, and still get to the end of the month and the bank account is empty for the last week and a half, and just praying that nothing will go wrong (and it will, it always, eventually, will.)

Thoughts? Anything else I should consider? Thanks for reading.",finance
personalfinance,Moving to Baltimore from Rural Pennsylvania with Little Budgeting Experience,"I'm 22 years old and for the past 4 years, I've lived at a residential college in rural Pennsylvania. I've lived in a small dorm room with a roommate, have all of my meals in a dining hall, and have a few small jobs that don't get me more than $250 every month. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've just accept a position as a research fellow at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore. For the fellowship, I'll have a stipend of $30,650 for the first year, and it will go up a little bit my second year. The problem is that FICA and payrool (federal and state) taxes don't be withheld. I don't know how much money I should put away for tax returns. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've lived on my own over summers, but I stayed on campus working for our office of residential life, so I had free housing. I have no experience budgeting and I have no idea where to even start. 

&amp;#x200B;

As far as expenses go, I'll need to get renters insurance. I am lucky enough that my parents cover both my cell phone bill and car insurance but I pay for gas and any other maintenance that my car has. My position will also be paying for my health insurance since I am currently not on my parent's plan. 

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, I have about $3,000 in my savings that I can use to move and have as a deposit for an apartment. My credit score is also 731, which I think is good?

&amp;#x200B;

Being from rural Pennsylvania, I don't really know how expensive it is to live in a city (especially Baltimore). I've been abroad and lived in cities for a semester or a summer, but I've always lived in homestays and had everything covered before I left so I never needed to do anything. Any advice on how to create a budget, find housing that fits in my budget, or anything else that I might be missing and not thinking about would be greatly appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,Can non-refundable tax credits offset Self-Employment (FICA) taxes?,"My GF owes $500 in federal taxes but had $100 withheld and has $1,300 in non-refundable credits (Life-Time Learning Credit).

1. She owes $1,300 FICA and gets only the $100 that she paid in refunded.

CryptoCurrency,Doing your own research is not enough.,"I'm recycling a previous comment in large part because I think this needs its own discussion.

One of the biggest problem with crypto is mis/disinformation. Journalism has gone downhill *hard* in the last decade, partially because of the proliferation of dubious sources and the watering down of professional reporting with a torrent of at best semi-true garbage.

Even then, cryptojournalism is in a league of its own when it comes to how laughably bad it is. Most news 'outlets' exclusively produce:

1. Nearly copy-pasted articles from other sources (those sources are often far from being professional);
2. Press releases paid for by companies/projects who basically just provide the content themselves;
3. Price analyses, because high school level TA is definitely what this space needs.

It is sad to see how little development there has been in the media regarding distributed ledger technology, but the low quality of reporting can be explained quite elegantly. 

First off, conflicts of interest abound and are rarely reported, leading to a lack of trust that is reinforced by rampant tribalism and wishful thinking. In other words, echo chambers are formed to reinforce investment decisions and conflicting data is rejected. Secondly, in-depth understanding of DLT alone is rare and understanding of both DLT and economics is essentially inexistent, leading to misinformed articles that fill the gap with opinions and assumptions.

The result is a hot mess of anchors being briefed about BTC price action 20 minutes before going on air despite zero interest or prior knowledge, a never-ending stream of articles advertising scams and never any context for retail investors. Without neutral experts explaining the real impact of X or Y events/breakthroughs, the hurdles they need to overcome, the competitors working on similar projects and the perceived effect of a successful implementation, how are we to know who are the real leaders in this field? We aren't, and we get a market like this one: where nothing makes sense and con artists thrive.

As a community, we need to help each other and encourage newbies not only to do their own research, but to be extremely critical and remain wary of conflicts of interest. As a subreddit, we have advanced quite a bit: arguments for/against known projects help with transparency a lot, for example. I believe we can go farther and bring even more clarity, however, by identifying outright false claims and generally poor journalism to establish higher standards for the space.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,How to file taxes on supplemental wages,"My job provides compensation in two forms: base salary and RSUs. My base salary comes in the form of a standard monthly paycheck, whereas the RSUs vest as a lump sum amount a couple times per year.

For base pay, the company withholds federal taxes from my paycheck as regular income using the normal brackets. RSUs are treated as supplemental income, and are withheld at a flat 22% rate. However, the W2 I receive at year's end combines both forms of pay into my Box 1 wages.

I have two questions:

1) Do I still owe regular income tax on the RSU vestings withheld at 22%? ie, do I owe the IRS the difference between the flat 22% RSU withholding and what my taxes would have been if all my income were lumped together as standard income (as it is in Box 1 of my W2).

2) If I do not owe this difference, how do I separate out the supplemental wage income on my taxes (since it is combined in the W2)? If anyone can provide TurboTax specific instructions, that would be super helpful.",finance

\- I'm 27 years old and live in AZ

\- I have about $30,000 sitting in a Chase bank account (split between checking/savings). 

\- My take home pay is about $2,350 a month after taxes. (I work in sales, so this is before bonuses/extras. This year I made a $8,000 bonus, after taxes in addition to other bonuses here and there).

\- My fixed bills are about $1,482 a month without counting things like gas, groceries, entertainment, personal, etc. I want to cut bills (see below)

\- I have nothing contributed to any retirement accounts, but I plan to start. (my company starts matching 401k contributions in June and I want to open an IRA)

\- I have $17,500 in student loan debt (half at an interest rate of 6.55% and the other at 3.15%). Monthly payments are $236

\- I have a car loan with $12,400 remaining at 3.3% interest. Monthly payments are $353

Perhaps my main question is this. I am seriously considering paying off my car loan then selling my car (2017 Toyota Corolla SE with about 50,000 miles). The KBB value is about $13k - $15k. Then, I would buy an older used car (Toyota or Honda) for about $5k - $7k in cash, because I hate having a car payment and this would save money. I do drive a lot for work/personal - about 100 miles a day. Is this a wise decision, or should I stick with the newer car? I don't know how big of a hassle it'll be to sell. 

My job also has an ESPP program where they offer the option to purchase/sell stock at a 10% discount. I am contributing the full 15% option of my paycheck, and will sell immediately on the sale date on June 1 to make at least a 10% return. This should be about \~$2k - $3k added to my worth.  

My main goals are to get rid of my car debt, student loan debt, invest/contribute to a retirement account, and save for a house down payment. I plan on contributing up to the matching of the 401k, then opening my own Vanguard Roth IRA. Is a Target Date Retirement fund my best/easiest choice?

I have a decent credit score, and part of me wants to dive in and get this stuff in order before I start working full-time.

So, long story short I have a lot of credit card debt (bad decisions, I'm living with it, yada yada). I've been slowly paying it off, and then BOOM, I'm in the hospital and lose my job early last year. 

So husband and I are dirt poor because I'm sick and can't work up until I got a full time job last week.

I tried to keep up on credit cards, I was VERY communicative with all of them about what was happening, every single one has been wonderful and has been helpful in arranging payment arrangements EXCEPT the one from my credit union.

They've been fucking monsters the entire time.

The problem right now is that they disabled my checking account access (i.e., I can't use my debit or atm card) a while ago, (edit for clarity) and when I was there a while ago and had a $0 balance they refused to close my checking account. I was frustrated but I figured: whatever, not worth fighting them.

Well, at one point I called all of my creditors and changed my payment accounts from my checking, to a joint checking with my husband at the same credit union. Well, I effed up and forgot one (I'm an idiot). They tried to pull out a monthly payment twice, and now I'm negative $93 dollars in my checking.

I called today to challenge them on the ""we can't close your checking"" nonsense and she tried to say it was Federal Regulation (edited for clarity) that they can't close my checking account (even if it was $0 balance) because I have a balance left to pay on my credit card. Please tell me that isn't right. It sounds like crap to me. Maybe bank policy, maybe something I agreed to when I opened the credit card, but Federal regulation?

Basically I want to fight them and get my damn checking account closed so I can avoid any future potential fees. I'm poor and I'm sick of paying them money in fees when it could be going towards paying down my debt. I also have an empty savings account with them if that means anything.

Both of us are smart people, but financially under-educated (we both come from paycheck to paycheck families). Can anyone advise us what to do with the inheritance? We have read on the complications of the types of inherited IRAs, RMDs, etc- but until we have final estate details aren’t sure exactly what we’re dealing with, or what our best options will be. We live in a very small town, with no major financial advisory institutions (no Edward Jones/Morgan Stanley etc).

Income:
Annual salary wife = 82,000

Annual salary me = 68,000

At least 15% of salary is based on bonuses and incentives, meaning if we had a REALLY bad year in our line of work, we could make roughly 10% less- as the above year was a good year. That would be unusual, but certainly possible. 

Which equals rough pretax monthly income = $12,500



Monthly expenses:
 Two years into a 30 year first-time homebuyer mortgage @ 3.75 interest + PMI/property taxes insurance all in escrow = $1400/month

Daycare (hurts!)- $40 day full time, so varies month to month, but $850/ month would be a good average 
Health insurance (monthly premiums for all three of us for garbage care): $1200. Our baby has been sick a lot, and our deductibles are all $5,000 with 30% copays. 

Vehicle payments: Mine, $440/month, with $18,000 left at 1.99% interest. Hers, $270/month, with $3,000 left at 5% interest

I commute a long way each day, so at least $250-$300 month in gas and vehicle upkeep costs, with the expectation our vehicles will depreciate quickly due to mileage

No credit card debt

After that we have normal expenses, food, electric and water bill.



Savings:
We have about $17,000 in a normal savings account.
We have no retirement, no HSAs (no employer sponsored benefits of any kind, including HSAs). We know nothing about investment. What should be our priority with this 40k? We’ve talked about paying off the vehicles to free up the cash to save more, but the vehicles are low interest rate, and I don’t know if it makes sense to take the lump sum payment in that case. I’d happily provide more information if you need it. Thank you so much for the help in advance.",finance

datascience,Confused Data Analyst,"Hey all!
tl;dr at bottom
My dillema: 
I don’t know how to move forward with the experience that I have. In fact, I don’t know which routes I can take yet as I’m not sure whether the experience I have is enough to move forward. Very confused!
So I’m pretty stumped at the moment as to where I can go with the experience I have.

Experience I have: 
6 months of SQL(stored procedures and created one custom table)
2 years of VBA (automated a few processes as well as helping another department when they called upon me for help)
3 years of Excel (definitely know my way around formulas and would be confident creating a complicated spreadsheet for anybody, although have never had experience creating graphs.....ever)
Also, I’ve used Cognos Cubes in my current role to extract data but these are simple pivot tables so I don’t see a point in naming this out on my resume.

The roles that I have held have always been the types where the tasks and responsibilities are repetitive and have never allowed me to call upon my creativity (tbh, I'm not sure if I have any creativity at this point). They have been roles where, if you wrote down a step by step guide, anybody could do the job. This is not to say that the jobs were super easy. The jobs were repetitive but one wrong step, and you've effed up the whole file (you may not even notice you messes up).

The issue is, I feel, that I do not have soft skills that I see in many job specifications that I feel I could go for.
For example, most of the roles require an individual to have experience in pulling insights from data. I have never been in a role where I have helped in this type of way, so this excludes me from many roles.
Additionally, all of the more technical roles require more specialisation in the technical competencies mentioned in the job posting.
For example, SQL Developer roles require specialised SQL experience.

So, what now??
The experience I have puts me in a position where I am unable to do much as I don't any sort of significant experience. I have looked into learning Python, but it is such a diverse language with so many uses that I'm not sure where to start, I mean for one I need to pick a path first.
The goal is, in 5 years, to be able to offer my services to companies as a contractor and become established as a contractor in a field that I choose to go down.
I have looked into roles such as DBA and BI Developer but do not want to pick these two path before I know every possible path I can take from here.

What do you guys think? Are my options wide open because I'm still at an early stage of my career?
For those of you who have been in similar positions, where have you gone on from there?
Are there any recommended websites, blogs, reddit posts you think would help clearing up my head with this at the moment?

Thanks for reading the long post!

TL;DR: 3 years excel, 2 years vba and 6 months sql  experience. With the lack on of insight analysis experience what routes can I take from here??

personalfinance,Is there anything I could be doing?,"Hey everyone,
I’m seventeen with a part-time job (15 hours a week usually). I’ve been a saver, and I only buy what I really want.

Over the year and a half of working I’ve saved up roughly $7,000 in my bank account. Also I’ve been investing $15 into stocks/etfs through an app the last six months. I’m at positive +7%.  My portfolio is at $350ish.  Also, next year I’m going on a trip, my contribution for that is $1000.

Right now at my bank, I’m only getting 25 cents in interest every 3 months or so (just for context) (.01 interest rate) 

The money that I have been saving so far (my plan at least) will be for college and/or getting a car. 
Since I know I’m going to be spending that $1000 next year, I was thinking I might get a 12 month CD, so that way it’s put away and I might get a little money in interest. 

When I turn 18, I’m planning on getting a credit card either as a secured line or a regular one and spending it on my daily purchases that I can pay back at the end of the month, so that I am able to build credit.

I’m wondering if their are some things that I can do, that might be helpful for me in the long run or just to continue the path I’m on.  Thanks for reading.",finance

personalfinance,Student and Auto Loan Hole,"I've been paying more and more attention to my finances over the past months and have slowly come to the realization that my student and auto loans are preventing me from being able to put away more money into my IRA, or back into other investments. On top of that, the loans themselves are practically not progressing at all, actually, I have not been able over the past four months to out pay the amount of interest per month. 

&amp;#x200B;

A quick summary of the loans. 

**Car loan:**

* 19614.78 total owed
* APR @ 7.99%
* 43 payments remaining (40% of the way paid off, this ford's projection, probably based on minimum payments)
* Minimum monthly payment $454.86
* Actual monthly payments have been averaging 683.66 (highest payment I'll do is 1k, lowest I'll do is 500)
* Car is in pretty good shape, 17k miles on it
* KBB value is 20-22k

**Student loan  collection 1 :**

* 5105.73 total owed
* APR @ 4.04%
* Minimum monthly payment is 171.46
* I've kept to the minimum payment on this one to concentrate on the higher interest loans

**Student loan collection 2:** 

* 24043.14 total owed split over four loans
* APR @ 6.84% for a $13014.12 loan
* APR @ 7.21% for three small loans, 
   * loan 1 $1540.29
   * loan 2 $4053.88
   * loan 3 $5240.63
   * total 10834
* Minimum monthly payment is 364.69
* I've been averaging 313.72 monthly payments
* Actually, looking at this guy, I was paid ahead, which caused the auto payments to not deposit their monthly amount into the account, so there were cases where I went to pay $250 extra and instead it was $250 for the month. Bad that I only just now caught this. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, that was a quick summary right? More like a comprehensive summary. Now that's out of the way. I'd like to ask what my options are for these. I've gone ahead and read the relative pages on auto loans and student loans and I think I kind of get the general idea of what I should do. But I'd like to ask for advice on the matter regardless. Here's my general take on the loans and what to do. Forgive me, but I'm going to write this like I'm talking to myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Car Loan:** 

* Pay off the car loan
   * Obviously will take a long time, and I'll lose quite a bit of money in the process from interest (that's unavoidable I suppose)
* Trade the car to a dealership and get a new cheaper car
   * I'll take a bit of a loss on the total sale value of the car, probably (according to the auto loan post) around 20% of the car's value, so I'd still be 3-4k in debt from my loan
   * I'll also have to take on the debt of another new car again, which isn't much less than what I currently have. 
   * I'll likely also have to put money down on a new car, which I can do, but I'd prefer to avoid spending more money on this matter
* Sell the car on craigslist on my own volition
   * I'll be able to get more out of the car, which is definitely more desirable
   * I'd have to buy my own beater car prior to this, which can be a long drawn out process, and is problematic whenever you live by yourself and don't have anyone near by to drive a new car back with you whenever you purchase from an individual. 
   * Probably more headache than what it's worth in my opinion
* Refinance the loan
   * Low effort compared to the others
   * Better interest rate means more money in my pocket at the end of the day
   * I get to keep my nice car

**Student Loan:** 

* **Pay off the student loans**
   * Works completely fine for the lower interest loan, but I'll lose more for the higher interest loans
   * Low effort, but not desirable
* Refinance the student loans
   * The low interest loan can be ignored for this one and left alone if need be
   * I'll need to shop around for the best price, looking at the post about refinancing, there's some nice links that may prove useful in the near future
   * Most probable course of action
   * Really, my only option on this loan

&amp;#x200B;

So that about sums it up. I'd ultimately like to ask for advice, either on, what option is going to be the best, maybe success with certain banks for refinancing, or maybe I even missed something in my analysis of what I should be able to do. This is a pretty lengthy post so thank you if you've read this all.",finance

Bitcoin,Can someone help me to find articles/academic studies/concepts about inflation?,"I'm trying to better understand inflation (in the context of BTC use-case/ownership).

I understand there is price inflation and monetary inflation (being the increase in the money supply). I understand that Central Banks are not allowing interest rates to increase due to 'low inflation'. Which is, low price inflation (CPI/basket of goods etc.)

My theory is that with current technological innovations (particularly automation/online price comparisons/smarter consumer base) prices are falling (if they are measured in terms of sound money like gold - or assets - in the sense that assets prices go up while the CPI basket prices are fairly static.

Therefore, even though the CPI might be positive but low, the reality is real prices should be falling. The price falls in a sense are a kind of compensation to the general population  for automation and machine replacement.

So, can we say that although CPI is positive, but very low, actually price inflation rate is higher (in keeping with monetary inflation). E.g. If there is a natural fall in real prices, then any increase in CPI above the 'CPI adjusted for tech innovation' is the real rate of inflation. Rather than being 1%, it might be 5-6% (you could even work that out against a basket of asset prices).

Obviously, I need a better explanation of what I'm trying to express in my own lay thinking. Anyone can refer me to some good reading? Is there a technical word to describe 'the true inflation rate that is arrived at by adjusting for tech innovation deflation' that I'm trying to describe? 

Perhaps it's easier to just say setting rates using CPI as a measure is fallacious and central bankers should base it on monetary inflation? To say in this way seems fine to me, but in my mind, I want that link to price inflation, because I think they think they can get away with things as long as price tags in the shops don't change too much - we should understand and fight for the benefits/compensation of 'innovation deflation'. Or in other words, a sound currency that reflects the true value of things.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Refinancing my house - is it too good to be true?,"I received a letter in the mail today from the company that services my mortgage offering to refinance.

With the additional money, my husband and I could pay off all of our current debt, overall we would have a huge quality of life increase with the money saved each month. Is this too good to be true? Is there something I’m missing here? 

Facts: 

-We purchased the house in 2016 with an fha loan. So we currently have pmi attached for 150 a month. With an fha loan, the only way to get rid of pmi is to refinance 

-The house is in Colorado where the housing market is hottt and it is worth much more than it was when we purchased, we also got a great deal. The house is probably worth about 325k today

-Current loan balance is 218k. Total mortgage Payments are $1430 per month. Percentage is 4.2 I believe. New loan balance would be $233,683 and payments would be $1065.71 with 3.625% interest. 

-we have about 4000 in credit card debt that isn’t currently collected interest. We also have about 6k in student loan debt between the two of us.

*I have left my post intact below for posterity's sake.*  

***

So I will be working on an hourly wage of 20 dollars. I usually work anywhere between 10-20 hrs overtime per week at 1.5 times my normal hourly wage all hours after 40 hours. I haven't been employed since before I filed my 2018 taxes. I'll start this new job in May.

From my understanding, for the 2019 tax year, I will be taxed 12% federally if I earn $39,475 or less this year. With overtime, over a 1 year period, I will most definitely exceed that, but given that I started in the middle of the year, I won't get past $39,475 by tax season so I will remain in the 12% bracket for the 2019 tax year rather than being bumped up to the 22% tax bracket. Is my line of reasoning correct?

Given that I live with my mother and she's the head of household and I'm filing as single, would it behoove me to move out in 2020 to my own place and become head of household to extend the 12% tax bracket to a maximum of $52,850 (assuming I cap my overtime to make sure I don't exceed that)? If so, does it matter when I become head of household in 2020 for tax purposes? Suppose for the 2020 tax year, I still lived with my mother up until the month before tax season in 2021 for the 2020 tax year, would I be able to file as head of household still or would have to file as single since I spent most of the year living with my mother?

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

personalfinance,Continue to rent or sell our previous home?,"Wife and I bought a townhome in 2008 at 145k total investment (remaining mortgage is 78K)

&amp;#x200B;

In 2013 we bought a single family home across town (218k investment, 158k remaining) but due to soft market did not want to sell the townhome at a loss so we have rented it out since without any *major* disasters.

&amp;#x200B;

Townhome monthly expenses total \~$1225. We charge $1600 for rent currently.

&amp;#x200B;

Rental gross income is $4500/yr. (plus mortgage paid down by $3600/yr)

Repairs have averaged $700/yr but we fear the next phone call is a disaster.

&amp;#x200B;

A similar townhome just sold for 190K so we think it is the right time to sell.

&amp;#x200B;

We would walk away with an estimated 70k or more if we sold.

&amp;#x200B;

Should we continue to rent it out (tenant leaves in June) or should we sell and reinvest that money elsewhere? Pay down our primary home mortgage (which is our highest interest rate loan currently at 3.5%)? What would you do?

personalfinance,Question about high yield savings accounts,"Hello all, I recently opened a high yield savings account and was wondering about the interest. Currently it's set at 2.1 percent apy, I have a very vague understanding that something to do with law changes is allowing Banks to have higher interest rates on savings accounts. But my question is will the interest rate change over time, with the potential of going down further down the road or will I be grandfathered into this rate forever? Also less important is I didn't really shop around I believe my account gets compounded monthly are there better options/is it worth fussing over and jumping from Bank to bank? Thanks for any and all advice!",finance

Anyway, I've just finished e-filing my taxes through TurboTax, however it's saying I need to print off a nicely prepared .pdf and mail it in. On the last page it list two address. One is listed under ""Balance Due"" and the other is listed under ""Refund or No Amount Due"", both of which are addressed to the Department of Revenue in my state; the only difference being the P.O. Box. I'm receiving a Federal return, but owe on my State, so this is whats causing the confusion. The first two pages of this .pdf just say ""1040"", with the remainder showing ""my state-1040"", but I don't see any addresses to mail the ""1040"" too... just the above mentioned addresses. So, do I mail the entire document to the ""Balance Due"" address, or vise versa?

personalfinance,Saving For School,"This fall I'm going back to school for a certificate program. I've done my research and feel satisfied with both my choice in school and program. Unfortunately I make too much money for federal financial aid, and due to poor credit I can't get loans (part of the reason I am going back to school ofc is so I can get a better job and among other things improve my credit). 

I'm already doing a budget and saving meticulously.  So I don't need help coming up with a budget I'm just looking for additional suggestions to make saving and budgeting easier. For example I'm already doing all of my cooking from home and taking a lunch for work as well as snacks like fresh fruit throughout the day to avoid the vending machines and making unplanned purchases. I've gone down from five subscription to two I canceled amazon prime, doordash and CBS all access. I'll probably cancel Netflix, leaving me with just spotify/hulu for 9.99/month. 

I'm working full-time and living with my sister so I don't have to pay any utilities for now. I already switched to the cheapest phone plan. I don't have a car and I am able to walk to work. 

One area I've always struggled with budgeting is personal care and household because it's a bit inconsistent and harder to anticipate how often you'll need those products.

personalfinance,HCL area and home purchase,"Currently, I am living and working in a relatively high cost of living area, Washington dc subburbs. I am wondering if I am looking at the cost of ownership and benefits that come along with it incorrectly. Currently, single living with a partner and working in technology, salary has been increasing over the years and is currently at $180,000. It has not always been this high, but over the past two years, I've seen significant growth. 

Anyways I've been renting a condo and the rent has not increased for ~4 years, the current rent is $1500 which I am splitting with my partner. I've been 'house hunting' over the past few years, made a few offers but always been outbid by all cash and no contingencies. After stepping back and thinking about the cost of ownership in this area I am baffled how people make it work and justify it. The overall cost of ownership vs what the property would rent for does not seem to be adding up. 

These are the numbers I've run; 

Let's say we have a condo 2br 1 bath desierable area (https://www.redfin.com/VA/Arlington/2101-N-Monroe-St-22207/unit-210/home/56337586)

* Price: $500,000
* Down Payment: $100,000
* Interest Rate: 4.25%
* -----------
* Monthly mortgage: $2481
* Condo fee: $450

Total: $2931

It looks like this is a new building built in 2016 and the initial sales price was: $490,000

Over a 3 year period whoever owned this property actually lost a significant amount of money; 

* Initial sales price: $490,000
* Current sales price: $500,000
* profit: $10,0000
* 5% commission fee for agents: $25000
* Net: -$15,000

This does not even factor in the loss related to the interest paid on the property, some of which I know you can deduct. 

Let's say that instead of selling this property the owner actually kept it and rented it out. Their monthly cost would be(using pp of $490k) $2873, looking at rent it looks as if 2br units can rent for ~$2600(https://hotpads.com/2101-n-monroe-st-arlington-va-22207-snurk0/building?lat=38.8962&amp;lon=-77.1044&amp;z=15). 


Factoring in vacancy and other costs, I do not see how the market price makes sense vs upside in terms of property value and rental income. Considering a scenario where you put that 100k into SPY ETF over the same period of time share price would return you a profit of $55,000 and probably another 5k in dividends.",finance

personalfinance,Student and Auto Loan Hole,"I've been paying more and more attention to my finances over the past months and have slowly come to the realization that my student and auto loans are preventing me from being able to put away more money into my IRA, or back into other investments. On top of that, the loans themselves are practically not progressing at all, actually, I have not been able over the past four months to out pay the amount of interest per month.

A quick summary of the loans.

**Car loan:**

* 19614.78 total owed
* APR @ 7.99%
* 43 payments remaining (40% of the way paid off, this ford's projection, probably based on minimum payments)
* Minimum monthly payment $454.86
* Actual monthly payments have been averaging 683.66 (highest payment I'll do is 1k, lowest I'll do is 500)
* Car is in pretty good shape, 17k miles on it
* KBB value is 20-22k

**Student loan collection 1 :**

* 5105.73 total owed
* APR @ 4.04%
* Minimum monthly payment is 171.46
* I've kept to the minimum payment on this one to concentrate on the higher interest loans

**Student loan collection 2:**

* 24043.14 total owed split over four loans
* APR @ 6.84% for a $13014.12 loan
* APR @ 7.21% for three small loans,  

   * loan 1 $1540.29
   * loan 2 $4053.88
   * loan 3 $5240.63
   * total 10834
* Minimum monthly payment is 364.69
* I've been averaging 313.72 monthly payments
* Actually, looking at this guy, I was paid ahead, which caused the auto payments to not deposit their monthly amount into the account, so there were cases where I went to pay $250 extra and instead it was $250 for the month. Bad that I only just now caught this.

So, that was a quick summary right? More like a comprehensive summary. Now that's out of the way. I'd like to ask what my options are for these. I've gone ahead and read the relative pages on auto loans and student loans and I think I kind of get the general idea of what I should do. But I'd like to ask for advice on the matter regardless. Here's my general take on the loans and what to do. Forgive me, but I'm going to write this like I'm talking to myself.

**Car Loan:**

* Pay off the car loan  

   * Obviously will take a long time, and I'll lose quite a bit of money in the process from interest (that's unavoidable I suppose)
* Trade the car to a dealership and get a new cheaper car  

   * I'll take a bit of a loss on the total sale value of the car, probably (according to the auto loan post) around 20% of the car's value, so I'd still be 3-4k in debt from my loan
   * I'll also have to take on the debt of another new car again, which isn't much less than what I currently have.
   * I'll likely also have to put money down on a new car, which I can do, but I'd prefer to avoid spending more money on this matter
* Sell the car on craigslist on my own volition  

   * I'll be able to get more out of the car, which is definitely more desirable
   * I'd have to buy my own beater car prior to this, which can be a long drawn out process, and is problematic whenever you live by yourself and don't have anyone near by to drive a new car back with you whenever you purchase from an individual.
   * Probably more headache than what it's worth in my opinion
* Refinance the loan  

   * Low effort compared to the others
   * Better interest rate means more money in my pocket at the end of the day
   * I get to keep my nice car

**Student Loan:**

* **Pay off the student loans**  

   * Works completely fine for the lower interest loan, but I'll lose more for the higher interest loans
   * Low effort, but not desirable
* Refinance the student loans  

   * The low interest loan can be ignored for this one and left alone if need be
   * I'll need to shop around for the best price, looking at the post about refinancing, there's some nice links that may prove useful in the near future
   * Most probable course of action
   * Really, my only option on this loan

So that about sums it up. I'd ultimately like to ask for advice, either on, what option is going to be the best, maybe success with certain banks for refinancing, or maybe I even missed something in my analysis of what I should be able to do. This is a pretty lengthy post so thank you if you've read this all.",finance

I am a junior in college and graduating in December 2019. I have a full tuition scholarship, but because of my scholarship, I am required to live on campus and pay for a meal plan. This is a cost of about $10,000/year or $5,000/semester. So far, I have a little over $11,000 in federal subsidized stafford loans. They have an interest rate of about 8%, but because they are subsidized the interest does not start accruing until after I graduate. 

I have about $13,000 in personal savings from working. I have one semester left, and depending on whether or not I receive a few grants and scholarships, it will cost between $3 and $5,000. For each previous semester, I have accepted the subsidized loan ($1,500-$2,500) and then paid the remaining balance ($1,500-$3,000) from my savings. I have been cautious about using my a large part of my savings to pay for college since my loans do not accrue interest while I'm in school, and I want to maintain an emergency fund (I used it to buy a used car last year and I will likely use it for a security deposit on an apartment when I graduate). I work on campus, which provides enough for groceries and some fun money, so I don't access my savings regularly. 

Should I use a subsidized stafford loan to cover all or part of my last college payment or should I dig into my savings and pay it in full? Is there anything else I should be thinking about? Thanks!",finance

Some quick information, I currently owe 15k (have paid off 5k) in student loans from my BA a few years ago. Under my current income based plan, my monthly payment is $0.

I make around 35k a year, with monthly rent and food expenses about $1000 a month.

Wanted to get your thoughts on this. So currently, I have 7 student loans left (all from Dept. of Ed) with varying amounts of interest rates but all under 5%.

Interest is accruing on all of the others and the current interest tracker since last payment continues to grow whenever I log in (sitting at $90 at the moment). Since it's in forbearance, none of my payments are going to other loan tokens apart from the one with 4.66%.

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, I am in a good position financially. I don't struggle paycheck to paycheck, and I live within my means. I am simply looking to objectively analyze an opportunity and get feedback.

&amp;#x200B;

I just installed solar panels on my home, and when I was going through the details with the company they offered to let me speak with a mortgage consultant to see if rolling the cost into my mortgage would be beneficial.   


I started our weary, but as the conversation went along, and the math was presented, it sounded like it made all of the sense in the world. But I'm no financial wizard, so I wanted to post here. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here are the details. I currently owe 85K+ on my house that before the panels were installed is valued at 190k+ on zillow. I owe 14,400 on my truck, 3350 on new windows, 30k on the solar panels, and 5k on a new AC unit. Total debt is \~137,750. Each of these individual debts is on its own note. Various interest rates, various lengths of time left on each. What I pay monthly on all of these items combined (including the additional payments I add to pay off things quicker) is $2327.  


The idea that I was presented with would be to combine all of them onto a new mortgage in the range of 145k at 4.25%. By combining the debts my new mortgage payment would come in around $1000 give or take 50 for insurance/tax difference. I would then take the additional $1327 and put it on the principal each month. By doing this the math appears to show that I could pay this loan off before the end of the seventh year.

&amp;#x200B;

I plan to be in this home another 5-6 years, and if our situation is right, keep the house and rent it out after we move.

&amp;#x200B;

This all sounds too good to be true. I can pay off all of my debt in less than 7 years without spending another dime each month?

personalfinance,30 year or 15 year mortgage?,"/r/finance, I am asking for your input:

I currently spend 3k/mo on rent.  I'm ready to buy.  The problem is I don't have a lot of money to put down (because I spend 3k/mo on rent).  

My question is, should I get a smaller house with a 15 year mortgage, meaning that I'll pay the principal down faster; or

should I get the bigger house with a 30 year mortgage?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not very savvy so I created a false scenario where I get a 400k mortgage for 15 years with 4.5% interest, and a 600k mortgage for 30 years with 4.5% interest.  I know I'm automatically starting from a falsehood because the 15 year mortgage would not have the same interest rate as a 30 year mortgage.  (Can someone provide me with more realistic interest rate scenarios?)

&amp;#x200B;

Bigger House Scenario: 600k mortgage, 30 year loan, 4.5% interest, after 5 years the remaining principal is: $545,958.44 

My monthly mortgage payment is:  $3,040.11

I've paid off: $54,041.56

&amp;#x200B;

Smaller House Scenario: 400k mortgage, 15 year loan, 4.5% interest, after 5 years the remaining principal is: $293,301.97

My monthly mortgage payment is: $3,059.97

I've paid off: $106,698.03

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, who would take the 30 year mortgage?!  I should definitely do the smaller house with the 15 year mortgage, right?  Conceivably, I walk away at the end of 5 years with roughly 107k to put down on my next house.  Houses appreciate, but hopefully I'd be able to buy that bigger house, which maybe has appreciated to 650k in 5 years, and I'll have 107k to put down, so I'll only need a loan for 550k.  

&amp;#x200B;

Is this a logical move?  Does how quickly houses appreciate in my area effect my decision to buy the smaller vs bigger house?  For example, I'm wondering if I buy the smaller house now, will the other house have appreciated so much in value that it will negate the money I was able to put down on the principal?",finance

personalfinance,Will my 18 year old brother have to pay a 37% effective federal tax rate because of the Kiddy tax?,"Here's the story.  My brother who turned 18 last year made a high 5 figure amount of money actively trading cryptocurrency which counts as unearned income.  After a multiple month long nightmare of trying to calculate the exact gain with the expectation that it would be taxed at the short term capital gains rate (aka normal income taxes), he finally put it in Turbotax and it said he owes over $30k in federal taxes, which is an effective tax rate of 37% and that's not even including state taxes.  He was expecting something in the neighborhood of 15-20%.  

It turns out there is a law called the ""Kiddy tax"" which is meant to stop parents from putting investments in their kids' names to get their lower tax rate. Any unearned income a ""child"" makes above ~$1k is taxed at 37%. Turbotax says it applies when 

The child is under 18 at the end of the year

The child is 18 years old and does not have earned income that is more than half of the child's support for the year (this is what applies to him), or

The child was a full-time student age 19-23 and does not have earned income that is more than half of the child's support.

My brother was a part time high school student at the beginning of the year (had a period off and had to sign a form acknowledging he was not full time), worked very part time at a real job over the summer, went to college in the fall, and dropped out at after the first semester.  His tuition was paid for mostly by scholarships and room and board through an educational IRA.  The rest of the year he lived with our parents.  

Our parents had absolutely nothing to do with this trading strategy and honestly don't even know how much it made.  I'm guessing they filed their taxes months ago.  He could claim his ~$1,000 of earned income was more than half the ""child's support"" which seems very vague to me or maybe retroactively pay rent.  

Anyway, will my brother have to pay the 37% tax rate, or is there a way to just pay normal income taxes as an 18 year old?",finance
personalfinance,Need help negotiating a restaurant general manager raise -- with my father.,"TL:DR - Worked for father for 15 years, with one raise 10 years ago. Have family now and need help with restaurant general manager salary comps and tips in approaching him for what will probably be my only raise until he retires. If anyone is willing to share what their salary/compensation was at their general manager position(or ideas on how to find them), I would be greatly appreciative.

Backstory:

Good afternoon Personal Finance. I need some help with negotiating a raise with my father. I’ve worked for him in his restaurants full time for the past 15 years, with a four year break from ‘13-’17. I still worked two days a week during this period.

I left in 2013 after our first child was born to work in a field with normal hours, paid time off, and benefits. My father had several things go sideways at once two years ago and asked me to come back. It was kind of understood that we’d give things several months, or a year to calm down and then figure out what we’re going to do going forward but two years in he’s no closer to resolution in almost any category than he was when I came back.

Now as I’m struggling to put money away, and considering pulling my child out of an important (to me; inexpensive) private school I’m having this epiphany that I don’t owe him any more time. 

My current take home weekly is right around 800. That was more than fair, especially considering most of my hours were tipped, when I got the raise 10 years ago(500/week initially). Since I’ve been back though many of my hours are off the floor, and the hours I do spend on the floor I’m looked at as the owner, not bartender, so my tips are significantly lower than other staff. I would expect to take home ~$300/week in tips before taking on the role of manager. Now my take home tips are less than $100. 

In regards to benefits, there are none. No paid time off, no sick days, no insurance, no profit sharing. Another “unspoken thing” has always been that the restaurant is going to be left to me, so part of me not being too pushy with money is because there’s been this unknown equity that I’ve been building over the years. With the company I left paid a similar salary, I had two weeks paid vacation/sick days, 400/mo in insurance benefits, and quarterly + annual bonuses.

I just have no idea how to approach him on this. The manager I replaced was making 14/hr + tips, but he was just a floor manager -- he didn’t do social media, advertising, networking, hiring, firing, staff meetings, etc etc. He had a week of paid vacation, and no other benefits. 

My father has often preached that what the prior manager was making is the upper echelon of small restaurant day managers, and I agree with him. The guy was taking home over $1,000 a week most times after tips, and for a position typically staffed by a 20 something with no degree that’s fantastic pay.

The issue is that I eventually moved to a different industry because it was clear that I wouldn’t be able to provide for a growing family if I couldn’t have access to benefits and a clear view of a higher salary down the road. He also knew what he was asking me to give up when I came back. 

I don’t know what to ask for. I know what I gave up, but I’m not sure what’s fair. I want to take on more duties of the owner, as he is already past the typical retirement age, but he insists on remaining involved in many of the menial day to day commitments.

I’ve never had to use the internet to search for a job before, so I just have no idea how accurate the Indeed, or Glassdoor numbers are when I’m trying to find salary comps. 

If Indeed has a position that says: “Restaurant GM - 55k+/year + benefits”.   

Does that mean minimum 55k a year?     
Is there any sort of benefits “average” that I can try to factor in?  
Am I safe to use those figures when trying to negotiate with him?   
All of the jobs I see would be referring to starting pay though, right?   
How to I adjust those numbers for having been with him for over 15 years now? 

Paid time off is my last big issue. I have young children that I would like to be able to spend time with. I haven’t had a paid day off in the two years since I’ve come back to work with him. I’ve worked for him for 15 years. I know the restaurant industry isn’t the best place for vacation time, but it’s my understanding that it’s usually different for real general managers. How do I tell him that I would like to work my way up to two weeks (or four would be a dream) over the next several years?

I apologize for any rambling, and greatly appreciate anyone that’s made it this far. I would be so grateful for any tips or feedback you have in regards to my issue here. I hope you have a wonderful day!",finance

gaming,A case of false advertising by EA and how they blamed the FIFA community for it,"I don't even know where to start with this post but I think it's necessary to shed some light on this debacle.  
**Short intro to FIFA**  
For the people not familiar with FIFA, it's a  highly populair football/soccer-game ran by EA Sports. They have 1 competitor which is Pro Evolution Soccer but their player base is dwarfed by that of FIFA for numerous reasons, the most important one being Fifa Ultimate Team or FUT for short.  
FUT is a card game based-mode where you can build your own team with cards that differ in rarity and coin-price. Packs containing these players can be bought with FP which costs real money.  
Now, this doesn't seem too bad right? Micro-transactions are a part of most games these days. 
I'd agree if it wasn't for the fact it would cost you **~$150000** - **$20000** to get the best team in the game. Now this is obviously unattainable for most, besides some Youtubers and streamers, so most competitive players aim a little lower. A competitive ready squad would cost you about **$5000**, and then you'd be on the low spectrum of playability. Mind you, official qualifiers for competitive events did not have any squad restrictions until very recently, so you'd have players with a $100 squad competing against players with a $15k squad for a spot in these events. 3 guesses which players qualified.  Then, after 6 months of qualifiers being played this way, they decided to implement squad restrictions, right after a lot of competitors invested hefty amounts of money in the game.
Honestly, I can write 10 books about EA's numerous amounts of fuck ups and debacles over the past 3 years but I'll save it for another day.  
**The current situation**  
For the past years EA has been releasing 'Icons', cards of retired players that are in high demand because they fit in every team and because of how good some of them are. They introduced a new system where every Icon card got divided into 3 different versions: baby, middle and prime. Baby being the worst version and prime being the best. 
They also have a concept called Squad Building Challenges (SBC) where you exchange a high amount of player cards you own for 1 SBC-card, so they gave us the option to obtain these prime Icons through these SBCs.  
Unfortunately there are only a few Icons that are a staple in every competitive team, so naturally they don't release the SBCs of those cards until the end of the yearly game-cycle, to keep people playing. 
Here's where it get's interesting or shockingly incompetitent, you decide.  In february, after the whole community waited 6 months for a decent Icon SBC they released a new promotion called **'Prime Moments Icons'**, slightly better versions of every prime Icon card.  
[Here they are claiming there won't be any more Prime Icon SBCs in a Q&amp;A following the announcement](https://imgur.com/a/WO3SvTA). 
[And here's the community manager telling us they changed it 'so we can get the best possible Icon version'](https://imgur.com/a/FNCpt91)  

Fast forward to today. After a long long wait for the good Prime Moments SBCs, they tell us they decided to release the Prime Icons in stead of the Moments Icons, because, and I quote: [*""The cost of some Prime ICON Moments are above the threshold that we aim for an ICON SBC. The feedback from the community has been that you want to progress towards getting your favourite ICONS and therefore we made the decision to release them as Prime SBCs.""](https://twitter.com/EASPORTSFIFA/status/1116748092626223105?s=09)  
Somehow they flipped it on us, **while they're the ones setting the cost of the SBC in the first place! It's literally up to them how much we pay for a SBC**. Then to top it all off, they doubled the cost of the Prime SBCs compared to last year, as one big final fuck you. 
Obviously the whole community is in shambles right now, even the biggest EA apologists are lost for words.  They crossed a line this time and I think it's important that people know how EA run things. Thank you for your time.",technology

personalfinance,High yield savings account vs Certificates of Deposit?,"I'm a little stumped as to why someone would want a short term CD when there are high yield online savings accounts?

I use CIT bank which offers a 2.45% savings account rate if you can meet the qualifications:  [https://www.cit.com/cit-bank/](https://www.cit.com/cit-bank/)

When I login to my Schwab brokerage account and search for CDs across numerous banks, I see that it takes 3+ year CDs to beat the high yield savings. (Schwab is showing 2.6% for a 3-year CD). So why would I lock up money for 3+ years if I can get a savings account that's almost as good but has liquidity?

The handful of reasons I can think of are:

* If a recession is looming, then the long term 3+ year CD locks me in while my savings rate is adjustable and would fall with declining interest rates.
* If I had an extremely large amount of cash ($10 million or something) where the 0.15% difference begins to make a dent. But at that point, I'd probably find some other investment if I had a spare $10 million laying around.

Is there any reason why I should consider a CD at this point? I feel like I'm misunderstanding something about CDs and bonds. Maybe CDs/bond rates compound differently than savings? Do they have better tax benefits compared to savings interest which is income taxed? Why else should I care about short term CDs or bonds? I ask because I'm trying to diversify and I'm reading some strategies which say to have some cash investments.

I'm 32, no significant debt other than a mortgage, stable income, contribute 12% to employer 401k, contribute maximum to personal Roth IRA retirement. I have over $20,000 in savings accounts and various ETFs that can be easily sold for emergencies. I think I have a basic foundation covered. I'm looking next is to better diversify what I got in case a recession is around the corner and my savings account and ETFs take a shit. Hence why I was wondering about CDs or other stable cash investments. Or maybe non-accredited real estate funds (REITs) like the Fundrise platform that simple joes like me can use.

personalfinance,Save for 20% down on house to avoid PMI?,"Background: Two artist DINKS - no plans for kids - in our mid 30's. We are debt free and pull in about 50-80k/year depending on how much work we are able to get. We currently have about $8,000 in savings/stocks. 

Objective: We are trying to save up for 20% down (to avoid private mortgage insurance) to purchase a $350,000 house/condo that can double as creative space for work. Our only major expense is rent ($1,400 month). I'd much rather be paying a mortgage for around the same price. 

Question: With interest rates being insanely low, should we try to hop in and buy and then pay off the loan aggressively to get to the 20% equity to have the private mortgage insurance dropped -- OR should we just wait until we have the cash to purchase later? With housing prices increasing in my area and interest rates being unknown, I'm thinking now is the time to buy. Thoughts?",finance

personalfinance,Financed a new car through a dealership with a completely approved loan roughly two weeks ago and now the lender doesn't want to pay...,"Hey all,

I bought a 2018 Chevy Cruze LT RS on the 30th of March in the state of South Dakota. On the Retail Installment Contract has listed my loan payments and interest rate (3.5% interest at 469/mo for 72 months). I got the car with no money down but I had a trade-in with negative equity (car was worth $3,100 with an existing loan of $9,300). 

That loan has already been paid off according to the bank that I was originally making my payments to and my old car has already been posted for sale. I get a call today from the finance manager saying that the lender (GM Financial) wasn't willing to fund the purchase of the car despite the agreed to, and approved, aforementioned loan. He said this was because my employment status is temporary. I am currently 8 months into a renewable 4 year contract with my employer. When my information was obtained by the salesman, the salesman only asked where I work and how long I have worked there so I told him the name of my employer and how long I've worked there. I was never asked to disclose the fact that I was a contractor.

Regardless, I orally mentioned that I was a contractor to this salesman later on is the process (before I signed anything). The finance manager asked for a copy of the contract I signed stating the duration of my contract with the hope that the lender would then uphold/honor the contract. I was told I would get an update Monday. 

I want to know what can happen now. Upon research I've conducted I, allegedly, have the option to return the vehicle if the conditions of the contract change. Is this true? Am I legally/contractually obligated to pay a higher monthly rate despite only agreeing to 469/mo in the event the lender cannot uphold what I signed on? If I return the vehicle do I owe any money? Do I get my trade-in back? Will I be put into debt even if I return the vehicle? Do I have the option to absolve myself of the situation and leave both my new and old car with dealership with no accrued debt or fees? Any information you could provide would help put my mind at ease. 

Thank you!

Edit: As of today (4/17/19) there is still no update from the Dealership.

personalfinance,"[Age: 22] Planning on buying a house with my brother in NC, USA","Hello Personal Finance, I would like to consult y'all before I make a huge mistake (or a good decision!).

Recently, my brother started working in the city of Durham as a part-time worker. I realize that makes us qualified for joining the credit union in my state. I also stumble across a special mortgage program provided by the credit union that has the following features:

\- 0% down payment, up to 400K

\- 5/1 ARM, interest starts at 4.875%

\- No PMI needed

\- $2000 can be advanced towards closing cost

Since my brother and I are really close, and we both have living space anxiety, we decided we must snatch a piece of real estate before the Raleigh market goes ballistic (note: we both grew up in Hong Kong so we witness the bubbles). We talked to the mortgage person at the credit union and found out we should qualify for the full 400K. It looks like everything aligns and it is up to us to make the decision. So personalfinance, please stop/encourage us before we make a decision.

&amp;#x200B;

Profile of me:

\- Fulltime worker, age: 23

\- income: 77K, could be an increase in a few months to 90k

\- student loan: 30k, paying $550 a month

\- car: $360

\- rent: $1500

\- utility: $150

Profile of my brother:

\- Student, Partime worker, age: 21

\- income: 15K from work + 10k from financial aid

\- student loan: 20k, does not need to repay soon

\- rent: $700

&amp;#x200B;

One reason that we would love to buy a house is that the combined rent for both of us should be sufficient to buy a $350k house and we are eyeing for $350k to $400k house

&amp;#x200B;

We hope to close on a house in July so that we both don't have to move rapidly + getting in short term lease. But that leaves us 3 months to decide and process. Luckily, we both want to live close to Raleigh downtown, which limited the options (less house tour). And if we couldn't find anything that we like, we could also take a 6-month lease separately, and keep searching at that time.

&amp;#x200B;

I also followed the guideline in personal finance and used the NYTimes calculator:

\- 0% down

\- 6% growth rate

\- 8k closing cost

\- 4.88% interest rate

and it says:

**If you can rent a similar home for less than ...**

**$615** PER MONTH

**... then renting is better.**

&amp;#x200B;

From the calculator, it seems like it's a decent choice? Am I too aggressive on the numbers?

First, me and my wife have accumulated a good amount of money in the past several years. We have kept it in pour savings and have realized recently that we are not gaining much in interest. We are currently with Navy Fed. What would you suggest we do in order to benefit most from our savings?  A follow up to this is she also has about 40K in student loan debt that we’re paying off. Is it smarter to use our savings to pay that off?  And next question to follow up on that is my wife has a rare disease in which she was born without a uterus, so in order to have kids we need my sperm and her eggs placed into a willing persons belly in order to give birth to our child. We have done research and have come to the conclusion that it will cost upwards of 90K for this to be done in its entirety.

We plan to stay in the house for 5-7 years, until our oldest child, gets to middle school age.  At this point hopefully we'll then move to our dream home with a mortgage in the more typically 3x AGI range.

With this plan in mind, would a 7/1 ARM mortgage make the most sense rather than a 30 year fixed?  Given that its a mortgage below our means, I'm thinking even if move in year 8-9, we can accommodate any possible increase in interest rate and still come out ahead since it would typically mean a good economy and thus good time to sell?",finance

Let me give you some background information:

\- It was my first car purchase

\-My first ""loan/credit"" anything using my own credit, previously I was just a secondary card holder on my mom's credit card (who has an excellent credit score)

\- Bought the car in Mid May 2018

\- Since then I've gotten two credit cards in my own name and should have both of them paid off by August if the stars, moons and planets align.

\- Plan originally was to continue paying the loan and once the balance remaining hits $4k, pay it off and drive the car until the wheels drop off (figure speaking) or until monthly maintenance starts being more than just having a new car payment.

&amp;#x200B;

When would be a good time into looking to refinancing the loan for lower payments? As it stands the current loan, I can pay off any remaining balance at anytime without fees or penalties (its currently 14k, that is left so that won't be happening)

&amp;#x200B;

Who should I go to my current bank? (Chase)

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 15th, 2019.

# **Some optimistic corporate outlooks in the week ahead could lift the stock market to a record  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/12/get-ready-for-companies-to-tell-you-more-about-the-economy.html)**
*****
&gt; It’s now up to corporate America to reveal whether the U.S. economy simply hit a soft patch this winter, as many suspect, or is on the verge of falling into an even deeper rut.
*****
&gt; Earnings from a broad swath of industries, like financials, technology, transportation and consumer products roll out in the coming week as the first-quarter earnings season gets underway. According to Refinitiv, earnings are expected to decline 2.3 percent in the first negative quarter in three years, but it is business leaders’ comments on the future outlook that are even more important.
*****
&gt; Commentary and guidance is always a big deal, but this quarter it is critical. Analysts do not agree on whether the first quarter earnings season represents the trough, or even whether the second quarter will see a gain or decline in profit growth.
*****
&gt; At the same time, economic data, like March’s jobs report, are beginning to turn more positive, and first quarter growth has quickly gone from forecasts of nearly flattish back in January to now around 2%, on the back of better March releases. The economic data has been uneven, in part because of the government shutdown, but it has yet to prove the economy is back on track.
*****
&gt; “The market has been very sensitive to data that’s been picking up. The market is reflecting that, even though there’s talk of an earnings recession. What you don’t want is an earnings recession leading to an economic recession. If companies believe there’s a major downturn in revenue growth, they stop spending and ultimately they fire people and that leads to a recession,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.
*****
&gt; The stock market is also at an important inflection point, with the major indexes closing in on all-time highs. The S&amp;P 500 pressed through 2,900 Friday, seen as a point of psychological resistance. The S&amp;P ended the week at 2,907, for a weekly gain of 0.5%. The next target traders are watching is the closing high 2,930 on the S&amp;P. The all-time high was an intraday 2,940, reached on Sept. 21.
*****
&gt; Earnings season got off to a good start with J.P. Morgan Chase’s quarterly earnings report Friday. CEO Jamie Dimon was very positive, saying the U.S. economy’s expansion “could go on for years.”
*****
&gt; “If you look at the American economy, the consumer is in good shape, balance sheets are in good shape, people are going back to the workforce, companies have plenty of capital,” Dimon told analysts during a conference call. J.P. Morgan stock rose sharply, after its record profits beat analysts’ expectations.
*****
&gt; “Positive guidance, that’s what the market needs. [The S&amp;P] could cross 2,900, but then again it could pull back,” said Krosby, but she said the momentum has been pointing higher. “The market has basically been endorsing 2,900 and beyond.”
*****
&gt; Krosby said important upcoming economic reports include Empire State and Philadelphia Fed surveys Monday and Thursday respectively, for a current look at manufacturing activity in New York and the Mid-Atlantic region. There is also industrial production and retail sales Tuesday.
*****
&gt; “Jobs data was strong. Everybody was really negative on the economy, and now we’re getting pleasant surprises,” said Marc Chandler, Bannockburn Global Forex chief market strategist. The economy added 196,000 jobs in March, bringing the monthly average to 180,000 over the past three months, even with February’s shockingly low 33,000 payrolls.
*****
&gt; Chandler said industrial production and other data should show an improved trend over last month.
*****
&gt; As stocks have shaken off growth fears, bond yields have also moved higher. The 10-year Treasury note was yielding 2.55% Friday, well above the lows of 2.34% reached on March 28.

# Typical April Trading: Mid-Month Surge Stronger Second Half

&gt; Over the recent 21 years April is the top-ranked month for DJIA. April ranks #3 S&amp;P 500, #5 for NASDAQ, #2 for Russell 1000 and #4 for Russell 2000. Average gains over the period range from a low of 1.19% by NASDAQ to a respectable 2.29% by DJIA. The first half of April used to outperform the second half, but since 1994 that has no longer been the case. In fact the second half of April is stronger over the recent 21-year period.

&gt; Early April trading is usually positive for the first 4 days then flattens off until mid-month. Then the market tends to surge from the tenth to the fifteenth trading days. DJIA tends to close out the month strongest with NASDAQ closing weakest.

&gt; Except for DJIA weighed down by Boeing (BA), stocks are having an above average month so far, which is quite typical in Pre-Election years where April has tended to be even stronger.

# Claims Bode Well For Equities

&gt; Earlier today on our Twitter account, we retweeted a chart from Bloomberg's Joe Weisenthal of inverted Jobless Claims versus the S&amp;P 500. We have used this chart as an argument for the bullish case for the past several years. As we mentioned in a blog post this morning, Initial Jobless Claims came in earlier this week with a sizable drop off, down to 196K versus last week's revised 204K and expectations of 210K. This week's print was not only a new low for the current cycle, it is also the lowest reading since 1969. That sort of new low could be a good sign for equities. As shown in the chart below, claims and the S&amp;P have mirrored each other since bottoming following the financial crisis. (In the chart, we have inverted claims on the right axis.) As the S&amp;P 500 inches its way back towards all time highs, so has claims towards new lows. Additionally, with recent low prints for claims bucking what had previously appeared to be an upside trend reversal, the bullish case for the S&amp;P 500 is growing.

# Optimism Growing Again

&gt; The American Association of Individual Investors updated their weekly investor sentiment survey this morning and the results are very similar to the final days of February with bullish sentiment around 40%, bearish down near 20%, and neutral once again in the upper 30's. Up from 35.02% last week, bullish sentiment has crossed back over the 40% threshold; the first time it has done so since the previously mentioned week in February. While bullish sentiment is sitting a couple of points above the historical average, this is still several percentage points from reaching any sort of extreme level (more than one standard deviation above the aforementioned average). For that to happen, bullish sentiment would have to come in above 48.36%. If that occurs, then it could be a sign that investors are getting a little too optimistic.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/041119-AAII-Bullish-Sentiment.png))**

&gt; Bearish sentiment, on the other hand, fell all the way back down to 20.38% this week, the lowest since its 20% reading on February 28th. That is around 10% less than the historical average for bearish sentiment. That is also at the lower end of the range bearish sentiment has stayed within in the past decade.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/041119-AAII-Bearish-Sentiment.png))**

&gt; Neutral sentiment has still yet to have moved above or below the upper 30's coming in at 39.33% this week after falling from similar levels down to 36.71% last week. That is the third time in the past month that neutral sentiment has come in between 39% and 40%.

# The December Low Indicator Has Bulls Smiling

&gt; After the best first quarter for the S&amp;P 500 Index since 1998, the big question is: What happens next? We’ve already discussed why a good start to a year could lead to more gains (here and here), but today we will take a look at another potentially positive signal.

&gt; The December Low Indicator was created in the 1970s by Lucien Hooper, a former Forbes columnist and Wall Street analyst. Simply put, the indicator says that if the S&amp;P 500 closes beneath the December low during the first quarter, it’s a warning sign for potential weakness over the balance of the year. The flipside is if it doesn’t, good times could be coming. Given the S&amp;P 500 just went all of the first quarter without closing beneath the December 24 low, it’s worth taking a deeper dive.

&gt; Sure enough, there appears to be some truth to this concept. “The December low indicator seems quite simple, but it has a tremendous track record,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “When the S&amp;P 500 stays above the December lows throughout the first quarter, the full year has been higher an incredible 34 out of the last 34 times, which bodes well for 2019.” In fact, this warning even worked last year, as it triggered in the first quarter of 2018 and eventually played out during the big fourth quarter sell-off.

&gt; As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, when the S&amp;P 500 stays above the December lows in the first quarter, the full year does quite well.

personalfinance,Wife’s credit score tanked 100 points to 680 after paying off her car! Desperate for help.,"So my wife and I started the process to turn in my car (lease) and get a new leased car. Everything was done and good until the dealership called and told me her score was down to 680! One year ago (approx) it was 780. 
Background: she’s a SAHM and has been for 2.5 years so her employment situation hasn’t changed in a long time. 
Her only revolving account has a balance of $3k on $29k limit
Her student loans are $30k from fed loans and $19k from private (inexplicably showing as 99% credit usage rate on her annual credit report this morning) 
0 hard inquiries 
There is a small installment loan for a mattress  (int free over 5 years) 
The only change was we paid off her car bc we came into some inheritance money. Owed $15k. 
All account in her history show as never late, paid in full, open or closed. All in good standing. I cannot understand the drop in credit score outside of the car loan being paid off. Anyone have an explanation that I’m missing?",finance
personalfinance,Resident alien tax return,"Posted in r/tax

&amp;#x200B;

Hi,  I realize I've left this fairly late but I've had a lot on my plate  recently. I have a few questions about filing my return as a foreign  national, having left the US to start a new job.

I  was a foreign born graduate student in the US from 2013-2018, and then  moved to Europe last year (Oct 2018) for a job. In the past, my  university provided some special software that allowed me to prepare my  tax return, and I used to file 1040NR-EZ as a non-resident alien.

Having  moved abroad, I have been trying to file my tax return with this  software\* again, but it now informs me that I have become a resident for  tax purposes, and as such I can no longer use this software. I think  that this is true - **having spent 5  calendar years in the US, I believe I passed the substantial presence  test last year to become a resident for tax purposes. Without going into  too much detail, does this sound correct?**

Assuming  it is, I have started to use TurboTax to complete my return and it  appears that I will be getting a reasonable federal refund. However, my  W-2 form shows that I had no taxable state income (presumably because I  was there for only part of the year) and no state taxes were deducted.  My city has a wage tax however, and that was deducted.  **Is the fact that the state tax boxes in my W-2 were blank a sign that something wrong was going on?**

Finally,  I'm trying to work out how to file for an extension, but TurboTax asks  me for how much I owe in taxes in order to do so. It appears as though I  have to agree to pay some amount in order to file, which does not seem  correct to me. **Can anyone advise me on how to file for an extension given my situation?**

I realize my position is quite complicated but I would appreciate any advice. I can't get

TLDR:  Status changed from non-resident alien to resident (alien?). Trying to  use TurboTax to file, but don't have any state tax details in W2.

So my two dreams growing up was marry my elementary crush and own a home. I have done one of those. Didn't think buying a home would be the hard one.

So we are completely swamped with debt. All of it is school debt(-11,000 for car). All my wife's. She's about to graduate for her Masters in social work (4.0gpa she's a smarty pants). She's great, no anger or resentment towards her. Just kind of in shock of just how much we owe. Now almost all of the loans say they will be paid off in 05/2036(min payments). I can't do that. I want a home , start a family, and maybe get a couple of pets before I'm almost 50. I'm not going to win the lottery. And I just don't know how I'm going to buy a home and pay this debt off. We just can't afford this and I just don't know what to do. Deferment ends in June. AND THERE GONNA WANT THERE MONEY. I have no idea what to do so I thought

personalfinance,Employment falsely terminated and 401k wiped out.,"TLDR at bottom of post. 


I have been working for the same company for 2.5 years it’s a large automobile dealer. I opened a 401k with them whenever I became eligible. 

I’ll preface the issue by saying the dealer I work for operates under two different businesses owned by the same corporation. On April 2018 I switched from business A to business B nothing changed accounting wise apart from the business name on my check. 

I wanted to find out how much was in my 401k so setup an online account this March. Everything was fine and dandy until the following week. My account registered $0 with a -$20~~(my contribution) and a -$8~~(employers contribution) transfer. The $20~~ went to a IRA trust and the $8~~ disappeared. I immediately contacted my HR department and the 401k company shows me as terminated due to me switching from business A to business B. This has since been fixed. 

However, the $28~~ has still not been returned to my account ever though the 401k company said they will reverse everything. Multiple calls to this company yield the same result. “Your money will be back in you account in 7-10 days” but still to no avail. 

Is there a way for me to get all of this sorted, I’m fed up about worrying if I’m going to get all the money back. I’m not worried about the $20~~ as I know where that is but I’m concerned that I won’t be able to get the employer contribution back. 

Any advice?

Thanks in advance. 

TLDR: 401k wiped clean because of error in job transfer. $20~~ went to IRA $8~~ disappeared. It’s been over a month how do I get it back even after 401k company said they would return the money?",finance
MachineLearning,[D] GPT-2 Training Data Augmentation,"Hey y'all, I'm pretty much a complete novice when it comes to machine learning, but I had what seemed to me like an interesting idea. Don't hesitate to dismiss this as the hunch of a layman if that is what it seems to be in your more educated opinions.

So, I've been screwing around with GPT-2-Lite recently just for fun. Something I noticed is that one skill the model has 100% on lock is always closing parentheses (Yes, I'm anthropomorphizing lol). Further, it seems to have a pretty good sense of how parentheticals relate to preceding text -- i.e. they tend to contain elaboration or qualification on the immediately preceding topic, or a digression that somewhat interrupts the flow of the text. You can get this behavior on demand by feeding the model a prompt that ends with an open paren. For example, both parentheticals in this sentence from the Gettysburg address were generated that way:

&gt;It is for us the living ***(who, in fact are in perpetual combat here, and who are still here)***, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work ***(and for that work to be paid)*** which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced.

So, I guess it must have picked up on the characteristics of phrases following the '(' character in the training set. Same would apply to the open quote character, em-dash, and function words like ""which"" that head clauses with certain predictable characteristics. My thought is that there may be other semantic features in the training set which could be detected programmatically but are not currently delimited by such explicit and compact cues. Would you expect there to be any value in augmenting the training data with some made up cues for those features? E.g., you could trawl through the text and insert '|' characters bounding every sentence that meets some sentiment analysis criterion (maybe extreme negative sentiment); or you could do the same for compound or complex sentences. What do you reckon would happen if you fed the resulting trained model some text that ends with the opening delimiter? Would that give you a way to reliably elicit completions that have the target semantic feature? I don't have the hardware or know-how to do the training part, so I can't test this myself.",technology

personalfinance,Borrow from Roth IRA to pay off mortgage?,"I have built up enough principal contributions in my Roth IRA by maxing it out each year that I could make a withdrawal big enough to pay off my mortgage. The mortgage interest rate is at 4.5%, so paying it off can be seen as an instant 4.5% return on investment (in the form of avoided interest payments). Due to changes in tax laws I'm unlikely to be deducting that interest on my taxes anymore. If I were to pay it all off with my Roth IRA principal, and then start re-contributing to my Roth each month in the same amount as my former mortgage payment, it would take me about 8 years to catch back up.

As I understand it, there are no early withdrawal penalties for a Roth IRA, so the only real disadvantage to doing this would be missing out on any tax-advantaged investment returns over the time that I'm repaying the principal back to the IRA.

Are there any factors that I haven't considered that might affect my decision? Does this sound like a good or bad idea?",finance
investing,S&amp;P 500: Strength in the Technology Sector,"On Monday, the information technology sector of the index showed tremendous competence in the stock exchange in New York, closing the rally by a record of 1,337.63, passing its preceding top results from last October by less than five points. This takes the index up by 0.41 percent, making this the eighth session that the S&amp;P 500 was able to maintain its record high. This adds to the index’s technology sector to the line-up of sectors that were able to reclaim their record highs. Having achieved the same were the real estate and utilities sectors which were able to recover from the previous two weeks.

Investors' outlook regarding the segment’s circumstances lies heavily on the projections of the Federal Reserve’s interest rates. Around the end of September and early October of last year, issues about the Fed raising interest rates this year played an important part in bringing about a sell-off which dragged the sector from a record high and into a great fall that we experienced during the Christmas season.

In January, the Federal Reserve announced its promise of being forbearing when it comes to its interest rate strategy. This served as a chance for the broader market to recover and display future potential. The prior month, the US central bank released an announcement of fulfilling this promise and is no longer considering an interest rate hike this year. This news essentially sealed the deal for the information technology sector of the market which is expected to experience rapid growth in earnings by the time the economy catches up.",finance

I work part time and have no federal taxes taken from my check only State. I’m also slightly confused on how/ if we need to be saving money to go towards Medicare &amp;Social Security. We both put all money into savings after we take out Gas &amp; Food and try to only buy things we want on occasion. I would like to have him take out a certain amount each week to prevent taking money out of our saving next tax season. Is there some sorts of easy way to calculate what we should be saving to prevent this?

personalfinance,My Tax guy made a mistake and I need some advice.,"hi.

I did my Tax at the same guy I go to for taxes each year for past 8 years. I am a single person with no dependents. 

After he filed my taxes and told me what I am getting back in taxes this year *(said it will go to my checking account he has on file)*, he emailed me after wards and told me that he made a mistake. He forgot to add/claim the money from the shares/stocks I sold earlier last year. He said I have to come back again and that he needs to re-file my taxes. I offered to come back to the tax guy right away, and he said, no I have to wait. Told me to come back after April 20, which I won't be able to. To his credit I should add, if he didn't tell me, I wouldn't have known, and he hasn't made any mistakes in the previous years.

The problem: **1.** I am leaving early morning tomorrow out of the country and won't be back until middle of August. I know I goofed up for waiting until last minute to file my taxes, but in my defense I still did it before the filing deadline of Apr 15. I have a busy professional life. **2.** Before going in to see him, I had decided that this would be the last time I would be using this tax person. Also my personal circumstances are going to be soon changing. 

**1.** How bad is this situation? Will I get in trouble?  **2.** Can this problem be addressed on next years taxes?

personalfinance,31/F Canada looking for advice on my next goal.,"Hey personal finance!

long time lurker here and I've had lots of success paying down debt and saving over the last year from the advice in this subreddit and I've paid off over $16,000 in debt and created some savings thanks to the advice I've followed here. I've met my first few goals of paying off my CC and LOC debt and now I'm ready to conquer my student debt and I'm feeling a little impulsive/ lost in how to do it. Anyways heres a break down of cost and debt that i carry.

I am a 31/F living in a HCOL in the PNW of Canada

No CC or LOC debt

Work in health care full time and i have the ability to pick up OT. Take home pay ranges \~ $3700- $5000 monthly. 

only debt i currently carry is two student loans (i am Canadian so it is federal and provincial debt)

Federal student loan: $13,956 with 6.45% floating interest  (i pay $350 a month to this loan)

Provincial loan : $10,241 with 3.95% floating interest (i pay $191 monthly to this loan)

Savings:

General savings account : $2100

High interest TSFA: $5000 (interest is 1.05%)

I consider the above two accounts to be my emergency fund as they are easily accessible and my goal is to reach $10,000

RRSP: $16,000 (with manulife)

Pension: ill be honest i do not know the current amount but have been contributing for the last 6 years. Set it and forget it.

No car payments.

Monthly costs include :

Rent $900 all inclusive

internet: $25

Phone bill :$70

Groceries: $400

Car insurance + gas= $250

yoga pass = $95 (i know pricey but i love it and it keeps me healthy)

I will be very honest i do not create any budgets but rather i squirrel away money into savings or throw it at debt.. my next small goal is to build up my cheuqing account.

So i a very familiar with the various approaches to paying off debt i.e.: snowball method and David Ramsay's methods of having $1000 in savings and throwing the rest to debt. 

I know that over time it would be beneficial to pay off the student debt with higher interest. Im feeling impulsive and would want to throw everything i have at one of the loans to abolish it. At the same time i feel like having &lt;$1000 in savings would stress me out and i don't feel like $1000 would take me far at all in an emergency..  I know my biggest down fall is that i don't really budget and i definitely go out. is having $10,000 in savings too much and am i losing out on paying this interest? In canada my student loan interest is tax deductible if thats anything. 

Not planning on buying a house at this time as my rental situation is bomb but i am driving a 11 year old car which seems to be holding up but a car in the future is inevitable. 

Thank you for taking the time to read my post looking forward to hearing your thoughts on how to approach this next goal.

personalfinance,Withdrawing my initial contributions to my Roth IRA account.,"I need to withdraw some money and I don't wish to take a loan out. I have put in 11k (5500 for the last 2 years) in my Roth IRA and i was wondering if i could withdraw this without being penalized. Here are the emails I received from VANGUARD. I'm trying to understand this. Why wont they just say yes, you will be penalized or no, you wont. 

Thank you for taking the time to contact us.

You can withdraw the amount contributed to your Roth IRA at any time, tax
and penalty free. However, if you are under age 59-1/2, and a portion of
your withdrawal includes earnings, the earnings may be subject to ordinary
income tax and a 10% federal penalty, unless an exception applies.
Conversion amounts withdrawn within five years of the conversion may also
be subject to the 10% penalty.

THEN I SENT another email saying im under 59, BUT I don't want to withdraw my earnings, just my contributions (which would be the initial 11k i put in). 

They sent me this:

The ""however"" portion of that paragraph refers to whether you withdraw
earnings versus your own contributions. Your Roth IRA contributions are
always free to be withdrawn with no penalties or tax implications.

Since you are under the age of 59 1/2, if you pull out these contributions
as well as any earnings, you go beyond what the IRS permits and risk taxes
and penalties on the earnings portion, unless you qualify for an exception.

A traditional IRA differs in that any withdrawals made before  you turn age
59 1/2, contributions or earnings, can potentially trigger taxes and
penalties, unless you qualify for an exception.


This Quote, "" Your Roth IRA contributions are
always free to be withdrawn with no penalties or tax implications"" 
SHould be the bottom line, right? 

Then why do they add this Sentence in though?! ""Since you are under the age of 59 1/2, if you pull out these contributions
as well as any earnings, you go beyond what the IRS permits and risk taxes""

TLDR - Can someone clarify. I emailed them again and they sent me the same thing. I just want a yes or no answer. Can I withdraw my initial 11k that i put in to my Roth IRA Vanguard account without it being taxed? Will I get all of my 11k?",finance
personalfinance,Estimated taxes - does a payrise equate to 100% of last year's return?,"California, we file jointly.

I'm a normal W2 employee, but my partner is self employed and receives a 1099 for a single job.

In 2018, my gross was $75k, and my partner earned about 9k in the last quarter of the year. She had not filed a tax return before in the US as she's a recent resident, so didn't pay any estimated taxes.

My withholdings left us with about $220 to pay on Federal, and about a $300 refund from California.

Her expected AGI is now $36,000 this year.

I have received a payrise in Jan to $81,000, so my withholding has gone up.

Am I right in thinking that because my withholding has gone up as a result of the pay rise, it will automatically mean that we're paying over 100% of last year's return, so we don't need to commit the 25% (I get this is the generally regarding ""safe"" level without getting to specific dollar amounts) of my partner's income to estimated taxes?

I'd rather put the money we're setting aside for her taxes into Ally @ 2%, basically.

For the sake of safety, we've done a $500 federal payment but I haven't done anything for CA yet but we're happy to if needed.

Today they went to go file their taxes with their accountant that they had for years and the long of the short is that they owe $14,000 to the federal government due to them making too much money to qualify for Obamacare. They have been on the ACA plan for a while and their premium was roughly $300 a month. Apparently my mother in law got a new job and reported a higher income then expected and with their combined income it put them over the threshold to qualify for the assistance. They basically have to back pay all the premium help they got for last year which is just a little over $14,000. 

Are they supposed to pay all of that? Is there anything they can do? It does seem excessive? Any ideas on what they can or should do? Both of them work in jobs that don't have employee sponsored healthcare plans so they have to buy they healthcare from the market. If any other information is needed from my end, please let me know.

personalfinance,HESAA / NJCLASS interest calculation - 1098E is wrong,"TLDR:  Does anyone know how to find in the NJCLASS portal a resource that explains 1. how interest is calculated on an NJCLASS student loan?  2. What the loan history is?  The amount shown on my tax doc from NJ doesn't match what I've paid in interest (not by a lot; their # is higher than reality).  I can't find anything when I log into my account that explains it (just the interest rate, 7.5%).

&amp;#x200B;

Hi friends, I have a fairly small NJCLASS loan, but I'm at a total loss to figure out how it works.  Looking back at my records, it appears about 50% of my payment has gone to interest and 50% to principal.  It seems to work out to way more than the 7.5% interest shown on the loan documents.  Big pic, I paid about $1000 for the year and it's gone down by about $500.  This has been true for at least 5 years.  

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone with an NJCLASS student loan know how to find out how the thing actually works?  When you get a credit card, there's a section that explains how interest is charged, how payments are applied, etc.  From a fairly young age I learned the importance of reading this brutally dry fine print.  

&amp;#x200B;

However, it honestly never occurred to me to find out how my student loans worked.  For a different (private company loan), I discovered a few years after college that the repayment amount they gave me didn't even cover interest, which I think is illegal now - that loan had honest fine print, I had just never read it.  Stupidly, I assumed I was safe from that kind of thing with a government loan.

&amp;#x200B;

Now we're doing our taxes, and my 1098E from NJCLASS says I paid $811 in interest - nearly double the $450ish that I actually paid in interest.  While this is a little extra deduction, how is it possible that the numbers are off by that much?

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone else received a 1098E that doesn't match the interest they paid on their loan(s)?

&amp;#x200B;

If you want to put your kids through college and need to borrow money, just put it on a credit card or a loan shark (shouldn't be hard in NJ).  At least my credit cards are required to make this shit clear.  I read an article from a couple of years ago about how NJ created an ombuds position that you could ask to audit your account - anyone have experience with this?  

&amp;#x200B;

To wrap it up, I know I'm so lucky compared to a lot of people in terms of loan size.  My parents took a lot of it.  They also have no sense with money and never explained anything to me, and I feel horrible about asking them for records because I don't think they have them, but I feel like I should really understand my student loan at least as well as my credit card.",finance

I currently work at my university but won't be allowed to work after graduation. Most of my money right now will be going towards car maintenance and security deposits for my apartment. I'm basically not getting paid till the end of July.

I also have some credit card loans (helped out the family because of some emergencies) but those I've been pretty good about paying off and my parents will be giving me some of their tax returns to pay me back on that. 

I've heard it's important to build an emergency savings. I feel like if I focus solely on paying off my loans I will have little left to put in savings and will be tight on money for a few months till I get everything paid off.

personalfinance,"Investing in Honduras, Please help.","Hello,

I live in Honduras, I am new at investing and don’t know what to do, so I thought I would ask here and maybe someone who is more seasoned could give me some advice so I can make the best decision.


I’ve been doing some research and I can’t come up with a good answer, my main question is should I invest the money I have in US Dollars or should I just stick with my local currency? Our currency, the Honduran lempira devaluates every year against the dollar anywhere from 3% to 5%, 2012: 1USD = 19.21 HNL, right now 1 USD = 24.43 Lempiras. With the investment accounts available here I can get 5% annual return If I invest in US Dollars, but If I invest in my local currency, I can get 7% to 12% annual return, so my question is, is it better to invest in dollars because it appreciates against my currency, or should I invest in lempiras because I will get a higher rate of return?


My second question is, should I invest my money in a private pension plan run by the biggest banks here, they offer 9% to 12% annual depending on market returns but charge a 10% commission fee every time you make a deposit, which I will be making every month, but the interest you make isn’t taxed so you only pay that 10% fee and nothing else.


The other option are certificate of deposits(CD’S), they offer anywhere from 7% to 11% depending on the financial institution, they have no fees but the interest you make monthly is taxed 10% by the government and you are required to deposit 1 million lempiras ($42,000 USD) to get the highest interest rate, which I have, otherwise if you put in less you just get around 4-6% until you meet the requirement amount.


FYI Inflation at the end of 2018 in Honduras was 4%, up until march of 2019 it was up to 4.1%

personalfinance,"Need advice for parents inheriting money, located in California.","As the title says, my parents just inherited a not insignificant amount of money and we need help managing it properly. They have asked my brother and I to assist them. We grew up poor, and as such learned little to nothing about personal finance. To make things easy I’m going to break this up into a couple of sections. The first will be details, the second will be what we have already considered just from intuition and a little bit of advice from my tax preparer, and the last will be some specific questions. Thank you all in advance for you’re help! We really need it.

**Details** 

So essentially my mother just inherited 1.5 million dollars. Roughly half of it is in cash, and the other half in property (two homes). The inheritance isn’t straight forward though. The two properties will go to her immediately, but the cash is another story. Essentially she will be paid $30,000 upfront, with $3000 paid monthly for the next 4 years, until a balloon payment of over $500,000 can be paid to her after the four years. The upside for my mom is that there is a 5% interest rate attached to this, so she’ll get a little extra money out of the whole thing. 

Both the homes are old. One is worth almost $600,000 and is in an ok but old neighborhood. The house needs work, like a full roof replacement and various renovations, to be made comfortable for them to live in. The other property is worth about $200,000 but is in a bad neighborhood (they could rent this property for maybe $2500 per month in this area). It would need a good amount of work to make it rent worthy as it has been sitting unoccupied for about 5 years. 

**What we’ve come up with**

Based on limited research and speaking with the gentlemen who has done my taxes for the last few years, we had a rough idea of what we wanted to do but are unsure of how to proceed. Given the need for cash immediately, we are considering looking into a mortgage on the more expensive property. Not the full value of the property, but a few hundred thousand dollars so they can take care of the roof, handle my mom’s medical needs, pay taxes and fees, and just generally live comfortably until the large cash inheritance in four years. We are hoping the 3000 a month plus my dad’s social security and the paperwork detailing the large cash payment coming in four years will be enough to secure a mortgage. I am a little concerned about this though since they would be putting themselves in debt, and if anything happens to the $3000 a month, they could find themselves in a tight spot.

Besides that, I have encouraged them to look for a financial adviser, who is a fiduciary, to help them invest the money wisely. They aren’t trying to get rich or quadruple the money or anything. They want to be comfortable in their golden years, get the money to work well enough to support them and put some away because they want to have something to leave to my brother and me.

**Questions**

Are there resources that can help get us started? My parents have asked my brother and I to be heavily involved and we essentially have to educate ourselves on personal finance.

How should we modify our plans?

What kind of investments should they be looking for? How can they get the money to work for them with a relatively low amount of risk, but enough interest to compensate for the mortgage?

What should they do to protect themselves?

Any additional advice would be greatly appreciated, as I probably don’t even know enough to ask all the right questions. If you read this but don’t have any input, could you throw us an upvote for visibility? We really need help here. Thanks again to everyone in this sub.",finance

personalfinance,"I have $30k in savings, and have read the FAQs, but still have some questions","I created a second account since I don't want any of this information to be tied to my main one.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm asking for some financial advice. I've read through much of the FAQs on this subreddit as well as r/financialindependence. Although, they have helped me get an idea of what I \*should\* do in the future, I still need some clarification for what I should do now. I've followed this subreddit for a few years now and am hoping I can get some help from you guys.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 25, single (but in a long-term relationship), no children, no debt (paid off new car/student loans) and am renting an apartment. I'm in the US military and my income is roughly $55-60k per year. My monthly expenses are roughly $1500 or (rent/internet/food/etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

I contribute $1020 each month to my Roth TSP and I add between $1-2k to my savings each month. It's hard for me to calculate exactly since for the last 5-6 months, I've been spending more than normal for holiday, home stuff and other travel. My income has also changed recently and I've adjusted my TSP contribution a few times over the last few months and so I don't have a solid number. I don't have an issue saving or following budgets and so I'm not concerned about being able to get a good track on that.

&amp;#x200B;

I, unfortunately, didn't enroll in the TSP Blended Retirement System since I had legitimately forgotten about it. So, I am missing out on that sweet federal contribution to the traditional TSP.

&amp;#x200B;

As of now, the only thing I have done for my retirement/future is contribute to the TSP and save money. I'm well aware that more needs to be done, but I'm not sure which steps I should take now, and which I should do later.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, I have roughly $30k in savings/checking accounts, of which I consider $10k to be for emergency funds, which leaves me with $20k to invest. I'm in the military and so losing my job isn't a worry and I have a pretty sure line on jobs with better pay following the end of my service late next year. I'm not worried about employment and I'm not worried about losing my apartment or anything else etc. That $10k would solely be for car issues / family deaths, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like to ask what the next step I should take is. My idea is that I take care of the extra money in my savings and then continue to slowly accrue my savings again while also contributing to my TSP.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously, my money isn't doing me any good just sitting in my savings and so I think that I should invest that extra $20k into some index fund (Vanguard?). Is there any other diversification I should do when it comes to that, or would this money be better used somewhere else entirely?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, once that is taken care of, I'd like to ask if it would be better for me to completely max out my contributions to my TSP and still save money on the side, or should I leave my contributions at $1020 a month and contribute to something else instead? I'm not sure, yet, if I can happily contribute $1.5k a month or so to max my TSP yet since I would like to slowly save money for vacations and other purchases in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, I should so something with the $20k then figure out contributions/investing and also save some money on the side for purchases I'd like. I don't need help figuring out exact numbers or anything like that, but rather what steps I should take and when should I take them?

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have an age in mind for when I'd like to retire. My main goal is to give future self as much financial flexibility to make that decision.

&amp;#x200B;

personalfinance,I'm fed up with TurboTax,"I've been using TurboTax for a long time. Yes I know there were cheaper options but its mostly inertia and convenience.

I made very little money the last few years, so I was happy that I could still use it and file my taxes for free. This year when I started my return I was just over the free versions limit I guess, and it said that I couldn't use it to file. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I looked for an Upgrade option and couldn't find one. I use the online version and all I saw was 'TurboTax Free file', and it only gave me a link to [irs.gov](https://irs.gov) when it complained. Signing in/out didn't do anything. I then googled and it seems many people online have this exact issue. Then I spent 2+hr waiting for customer support (there's no chat option, only phone) and after another 45min with the CSR, the only solution was - 'create a new account' !!! 

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the rant, but I just cannot believe it. A new account and all my previous years tax returns etc won't be linked to it. This is such a simple thing they need to have - why would you not allow a free user to pay you ??!!

&amp;#x200B;

I also checked out hrblock and their cost is not that much cheaper but from what I saw TurboTax is still a lot better. e.g in the guidance, the level of information etc. So it seems even though I don't like their business practices and I know they are responsible for a lot of the mess with tax filing, I will end up using them.",finance

Portfolio:

15% Natural Gas Futures {unless you find low maintenance ETF that tracks 1 to 1 NG.F}

15% Oil Futures

15% Inflation Benefiting (Not just resistant) Company Stocks, like Wells Fargo, Coca Cola. Others like Pepsi and Home Depot, while good, are expensive compared to the prior. MCD is also killing it.

20% Cash (safety net for the below)

35% Housing down payment on Maximum Leverage. Rental/Agricultural income must be &gt;= mortgage. Must be low property tax zone to avoid inflation rising it too high. Ideal to buy now (we look like we are the same time period as 1985 for housing) and sell when ratio is like in 2001 and 1970s. Use your leverage now to make 50% profit at least, even if we deflate a bit soon, and swap for gold and then swap the gold for housing. Even with bullion tax, you're making stacks.

&amp;#x200B;

Thoughts on Future:

&amp;#x200B;

We are likely to have a repeat of the 70s/80s inflationary recessions \[Stock market rises 2x but dollar worth is 10x less, so 5x relative loss at best in general stock market, unless you buy businesses that benefit from it\]. Combine this with larger uneducated population now, and you will have RIOTS on street due to 3x larger wealth gap. Housing can fall 50% to GOLD but GOLD can rise 50% without $ price decline, or it can fall 50% in $ price and no movement in GOLD, but that leads to another 2001-2011 currency devaluation and a 2011 style MEGA bounce, so BTFD time there, if we get lucky.

Either way, best spot is NGAS and OIL. Expect heavy sanctions or income embargo or war on countries with petroleum.

This can lead to as much as $250/barrel of petroleum with current M.

personalfinance,Retirement Planning,"Hey guys,

After reading through the wiki just have some clarifying questions about my own retirement plan and any recommendations. 

About me: 21 years old, ~50k annually, roughly 2500 a month after taxes. Expenses of $1000 for car insurance + rent and $500ish for everything else a month for a total of around $1500. 

My current employer gives 6% matching for a 401k so that 2500 is after the 6% and I also put 20% ($500) of my after tax paycheck into a Roth IRA per month. 

I keep $2000 as an emergency fund in a bank account but honestly am thinking about dumping it all in my Roth since the interest rate is tiny and I can withdraw from the Roth anyways. 

My main confusion is about why more people don’t use a Roth IRA. Why are 401ks pushed so much more than Roth IRAs? I read that for people with a tax bracket higher than 25%, a 401k is better than a Roth. Isn’t having the money always available more important than the higher tax hit? I get a 401k is post tax but what reason is there to put more than the match if you can’t touch it until you’re 60? 

Also, any recommendations for my current retirement plan? More? Less? Something completely different? Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Personal Loan or Balance Transfer for CC debt,"I am looking for advice on how to tackle some CC debt I have. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have about $4000 in CC debt that I accumulated while in college. This CC is maxed out. I am here for advice, mainly due to the fact that my CC balance never seems to go down, no matter what payments I make. My Interest Rate is 17.99%. Would it make sense for me to transfer this balance to a CC with 0% APR for a year and aggressively pay down, or should I take out a personal loan to pay off? If I take out a loan, I would definitely close the CC account, to avoid the cycle of debt that usually happens to those who ""pay off a CC"" but then use that excuse to charge more to it. Should I just ""buckle down"" and try to throw any penny I can spare at the CC I currently have? 

&amp;#x200B;

I know a big part of solving this issue is managing my money more wisely, which I am in the process of doing.  I have set up a savings account that is not tied to my checking, and will have a portion of my paycheck deposited there to establish an emergency fund. I recently started using a new budget program to help me track where my money is going. I do have student loans that I pay monthly, which is a large portion of my income, and part of why I can never seem to throw any ""extra money"" towards my CC. My credit score is \~670. I just paid off a car loan as well, not sure if that's relevant.

I may be in the very fortunate position to pay off the entirety of the mortgage this year. Should I do it by just continuing to make the regular payments and put in the lump sum of 37.5k every year? Or should I risk whatever fee they charge for discharging the mortgage early? Which option will end up costing me the least amount of money in terms of interest vs fees?

personalfinance,Possible way to estimate/prepay retirement withdrawal taxes?,"Hey r/personalfinance! 

I had a chance to pull from my ESOP (company buyout) and I had so much debt (credit cards, personal loans, car payment, mortgage) that I had very little money to live off of each month. I always had everything paid on time but I would only have about $200/month for gas/food and I had $0 in savings and no emergency fund.

Although a lot of people say not to do it, I decided to do it because I knew I needed to change because my lifestyle wasn’t sustainable. I pulled about $30K and put the rest into the new company ESOP and paid off everything except my mortgage (~$370/month at 4.875%). Doing this saved me probably about ~$1500-$1600/month.

I’ve decided to keep the car until the wheels fall off and then bolt them back on and do it again because I don’t want another payment and the car has plenty of life left in it.

I only use my credit card to pay small bills (I try to do everything else in cash) and I pay them off almost immediately (usually within a week).

I sold my other vehicle, bought a laptop to use for online schooling, and did a few minor upgrades to my house.

Some of the taxes were covered but not all of them and I know come tax season next year, I’m going to have to pay in a lot.

Is there a way that can estimate taxes for federal income, state income, and penalties? After that, is there a way I can prepay now so that way I don’t have a huge tax bill next year?

I also have a thought that if I kept my car and if I didn’t get the money saved up, I could use it as collateral for a loan to pay the tax bill.

Any thoughts, comments, questions, and concerns are welcome and greatly appreciated! Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Is it worth transferring banks with a relatively low amount of cash?,"I'm 22, wondering if it's the right time to move my money out of my traditional bank and into an online account for my savings/checking account.

I understand the whole increased yearly interest rate, but is it worth the hassle for me to move my money with such a low balance? Are there any drawbacks to it? I'm someone who uses cash once in a while, so having it available at least in reasonable time is important.

personalfinance,Students Loans Asking for Payments while still in College. Is it worth it to just start paying them back now?,"Hey all,

I'm currently finishing my junior year of college and have about $30,000 in federal student loans, mix of subsidized and unsubsidized. My understanding is that I shouldn't have to make payments until 6 months after I graduate. Is this wrong to assume? Or was there possibly a mix up on their end?

Alternatively, should I be making the payments anyway to get a head start on them? They're about $330 a month right now.

 I have about $1,500 in my bank account right now and will be starting work the day after the end of the semester (May 3rd) with my only expenses for the summer being gas and food (no housing, will be living on campus for free). I'd be able to make the payments through the whole summer and have money left over to keep paying them through the fall semester before working winter break. ($11/hr for 40hr/week)

 I'm mostly worried about not having enough saved to be able to find a place to live after graduation. 

So I guess my options are:
1. Get the payments pushed back to the end up my senior year and save my money for after I graduate
Or
2. Start making payments now and continue paying them throughout my senior year
Or
3. Something I'm not considering?

personalfinance,Best strategy for allocating windfall to debt,"I currently have about $75k in debt broken down as follows:
$15k car loan @ 2.5%
$4k credit card @ 2.99%
$14k credit card @ 8.5%

I pay $500/month towards the credit card debt, $500/month towards the car loan, and am currently on the income based repayment plan for the student loan paying $520/month. 

I am coming into a lump sum of $33k. I am wondering how best to allocate this towards my debt. Is it best to attack the credit card with the highest interest rate first or the student loans because it’s the largest balance?

personalfinance,Should I pay my tax bill and file an amended return later or file an extension now?,"TL;DR - I think my tax bill is too high. If I am correct, is it better to pay the bill now and file an amended return later OR file an extension?

I relocated for a new job in 2018. My employer covered all my relocation expenses (which are considered taxable income) and paid the taxes for me (the taxes they paid ALSO appear to be taxable income- they were reported as income on my W-2). The problem is that my employer paid federal taxes on my relocation expenses at the wrong rate (or so I believe). 

My relocation expenses were approximately $27,000. 
My employer paid about $7,000 in taxes (including $4138 in federal taxes) to cover the tax expense. 
I was paid about $48,000 in actual income. 
My total taxable income for 2018 at that job was about $82,000.

My actual income alone puts me in the 22% marginal tax bracket, and when you add in my relocation expenses and the taxes paid on the relocation expenses (also taxable income), I'm in the 24% marginal tax bracket. My employer only paid 12% federal taxes on my relocation expenses. By my accounting, my employer underpaid my federal taxes by at least $2700 (10% of $27,000).

I figured this out three weeks ago and disputed it with my employer. 
At first, they told me it was because my they paid my income in October, at which time I had only earned $31,000 and was irrefutably in the 12% marginal tax bracket. I explained that my end of year income put me in a higher bracket and asked them to look into the matter.
On Thursday (April 11), payroll called back and informed me that since my taxes are withheld as married, my income puts me in the 12% bracket and there was no mistake. That is only correct if I'm filing married JOINTLY. I intend to file married SEPARATELY. I disputed again and I'm still waiting to hear back from them. I doubt I'll have resolution by end of day today, so I guess I need to pay my tax bill.

Back to my question: I think my tax bill is too high (I owe about $1,800). If I am correct, is it better to pay the bill now and file an amended return later (1040X?) OR file an extension?

Has anyone been in this situation with relocation expenses? Am I incorrect in assuming my employer should be paying more than 12% taxes on the relocation expenses? Am I obligated to file as married JOINTLY because of my tax withholding status with my employer? Thanks!

ETA: I am able to pay the tax bill today, in cash, if necessary. I have the funds to cover the bill. My spouse and I do not have any deductions (no mortgage, no student loans, no ANYTHING. We will both be taking the standard deduction).",finance
personalfinance,Will refinancing student loans (another hard pull) impact home loan rates?,"TL;DR: How much of an impact will an extra hard credit inquiry impact my credit score and home lending rate in 12-18 months. Current credit score = 770-800. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking to refinance student loans ($20K) in order to take advantage of a bonus offer ($500).  But I am concerned that I have put on too many hard credit inquiries, which will negative impact my interest rate of a new home loan in the next 12-18 months. Credit score is between 770-800 by at least 2 of the 3 agencies. Obviously a slight increase in lending interest rate will be a much bigger impact than $500 saved by refinancing. 

I am on track to finish payment on my student loan ($20K @4.18%, monthly payment = $500)  by the end of the year. 

The one thing keeping my from refinancing is that I've opened up 2 CC's in the past 5 months, refinanced my loans twice (first time I got a windfall, paid down loans and refinanced to get better rate; second time I had an initial bonus offer of $500).  The churning on basic spending has net me quite a bit in the short term, but I'm concerned the payoff will evaporate there if my home loan rate is higher as a result.",finance

personalfinance,i have a presentation on a MNC hedging using forward and options,"would you guys be able to pick it apart for errors?

We are using forwards and options to selectively hedge our position to protect us from any Transaction exposure while doing business in Japan. We can do this by protecting our receivables by locking in a favorable rate. One way of doing this is by utilizing forwards contracts. The customization of a forward contract would make it possible to tailor it to our needs. It would also set other parts of the contract, such as the date, amount and more. Forward contracts are privately negotiated with an institution, instead of being traded on an exchange.  These contracts will help protect us against depreciation of the Japanese Yen. Another way we can hedge our position is by using options. For example, we can use put-options on our receivables. Therefore, if the yen falls in value, we would be able to exercise the option and still receive the same amount and if it rises we can choose to let the option expire and only lose the premium on that option. This would help stabilize our company, so that the value of our company is not strongly impacted by fluctuating exchange rates or interest rates. As a result of hedging, our company will look more stable to our investors. Currently the Japanese yen spot rate is sitting at 112 meaning every dollar is worth 112 yen. So, if the yen was to fall even a dollar we would be able to hedge against it using forwards and options.",finance

I have been prudent in building my credit since my teenage years. I have around a 760 FICO right now. I am very secure in my finances with much more credit available than I need and adequate cash reserves. I currently rent and do not plan on making a major purchase where credit would be pulled.

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend and I would like to build her credit to attain better interest rates when we buy a house or a new car down the road. Credit is not being used to attain something we cannot afford. We effectively use it as cash (paid off each month, not spend more then we can pay).

I added her as an authorized user on one of my credit cards to help her build her credit. I understand the relevant risks (I am liable for payments, my credit utilization will probably go up, etc.). I told her I am keeping the extra cash rewards to compensate for this. I can freeze the card or remove her should she spend irresponsibly (which I do not anticipate at all). 

&amp;#x200B;

Our plan is for her to be an authorized user for at least 6 months. By she should have enough credit history to open her own card.

- Military reservist, activated all year and stationed abroad
- Maintaining residence in US home state of record 
- Wife works as military contractor abroad (with me), pays no federal tax under SOFA status
- I receive partial payment from my US employer (about 45k last year)

hydro,Irrigation Question,"Hoping to get some insight on irrigating my plants this year to remove some of the labor, hauling five gallon buckets isn’t cutting it and thinking of moving to a drip system. I understand this isn’t hydro but thought someone from here might be able to help. I have a row of 8 plants on a hill and was wondering the easiest way to build an irrigation system for fertilizing them. Thankfully this is also on a friend’s farm and I am tied into their main irrigation, so I will only be using this system to feed the plants once a week or so. Does anyone else have any system that is similar to this that they can recommend? I would like to use something that regulates the flow, but am worried about the lines getting clogged up due to the nutrients, I use the fox farms dirty dozen pack once a week. It doesn’t have to be gravity fed, but this would be preferable, as I have the hill to put the reservoir, so I thought this would be a good option.  Also, was thinking about using a 50 gallon plastic drum as a reservoir. 

Thanks for any help and good luck with the growing season!",energy
personalfinance,Need help with a car problem I have,"So in April of 2017 I went to the Ford dealership and picked up a 2013 Ford F-150. I put 4k down and cost of the truck was $28,574.11. I got shitty financing (due to a number of factors) and got an interest rate of 12.07% bringing the overall cost of the truck up to $40,558.26. In total I’ve paid $13,230.96 and have $27,327.50 left to pay. At the current moment I can’t refinance because I’m in the process of buying a house and my mortgage broker along with my realtor both advised against any potential hits until everything is finalized. Getting to the main point my truck began to give me engine problems with only a year of having it. Took it to the dealer and they quoted me 5k to fix the camshaft phasers. At that moment I couldn’t afford to spend it. Recently I’ve been doing a lot better financially. I own a small business and business for the past year or so has been great. I finally decided to fix the truck since I had the 5k. When I took it back to the dealer they told me they would work on it. Got a call the very next day claiming they didn’t realize the turbos were non responsive and that would be an additional 5k to fix making the total 10k to fix the truck. I’m at a loss and I need the truck to continue to operate my business. Any chance I could trade it in or something of the sorts? I literally don’t know what to do with the truck anymore. Any help is great thanks!

TLDR; bought a truck. Less than a year later truck gives out. Still owe about 27k on it. Wondering what I can do in order to get a new truck or something of the sorts.",finance

One of the websites/banks recommended only went to 3.5% if you did a 5-year plan without checking my credit or anything.

I have another 'advertised' mailed bank I will look into when I get home. But should I just go to my personal national bank and ask to talk to a banker? Should I go to a smaller local bank and just say I want to see if they will refinance me?

personalfinance,"Trying to get an understanding of which vehicle to put my savings in (401k/retirement, savings acct, personal stocks/bonds, etc)","I'm 25 years old currently making $72k a year, paying off $50k private/$30k federal student loans. I'm aggressively trying to pay them off (double min payments), which after typical life expenses, leaves me with &lt;$500 a month to potentially save. Note: I am not asking for ways to spend less money so I can save more, I'm asking for where I should put this &lt;$500/month to make the most return out of it.

The only thing I am currently doing is contributing to my 401k to get my employee's max match. My employer matches 25% of my contributions between 0-6%, so I put 6% into my 401k which equates to around $167/month (not part of the &lt;$500 I have left per month). In that plan, I put 80% into Vanguard Institutional 500 Index Trust and 20% into Vanguard Global Equity Fund(VHGEX) (100% stocks). I don't really have a good reason for splitting it like this aside from I feel like S&amp;P index is a good place to put money and the other is a global fund which in my mind seems like good diversification. 

I was thinking about opening a savings account with Ally (2.20%) to have a place to save cash, but I'm sure there's better places to get a return (although I do think I should open this savings account just to have some saved money that's easily accessible). PS, I currently have a savings account with the bank I have my checkings account with but their return is in the decimals so I don't even bother.

Given I only have $500/month to save:

* Should I contribute more to my 401k?

* Should I contribute to a IRA/Roth IRA?

* Should I put money into CD's like those offered by Ally?

* Should I sign up for a brokerage account outside of my 401K plan and invest into index stocks/bonds? (Including looking at those that give me dividends)

* Should I contribute to real estate investment with something like fundrise?

* Something else I'm missing?

Keep in mind I am 25 and only have &lt;$500/month to play with. I am planning for a big move from TX to CA, expecting to rent, not buy a house. Aside from that I don't have any foreseeable big expenditures.",finance

3. *Novated Lease* - We have the option to sign up for a novated lease, where a proportion of the car cost and also the registration/servicing/petrol is taken out of pre-tax salary.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

26-Week Bill

Par Amount:
$1,000.00

Yield:

Discount:

Issue Date:

Maturity Date:
08-08-2019

Number of Reinvestments:
1

1) What is the difference between the ""Investment/Interest rate"" and the ""Yield"", in this case? Since it's a zero coupon bond, my effective return is 2.49%  (12.34 * 2/987.66)

2) Since I selected 1 reinvestment, does this mean the money automatically rolls over at the end of 6 months into another on-the-run 6M treasury bill? If so, I presume the yield on that would be the yield 6 months from now (ie I don't lock in the current price/return). Is this right?

personalfinance,Need Help With Loan Budgeting,"Looking for advice on how to best manage my current debt, as well as what I plan to borrow for medical school.

&amp;#x200B;

Current debt broken down as follows

* Undergrad Fed-loan: $62,500 \[6% interest\]
* Grad-school Private Loan: $15,000 \[10% interest\]
* Credit Cards:
   * BOA $12,000/14,000 \[20%\]
   * Amazon $5,000/$6000 \[20%\]
   * AMEX: $1,100/$2,000 \[0%\]
* Auto Loan: $12,000 \[5%\]
* **Total**: $107,500

BOA and Amazon cards were used to pay for half of grad school as I was denied any more private loans for what I assume was because I had no source of income at the time in school. Ideally, I'd want to shave those down but am not really sure how to approach it.

Cost of attendance for school next four years is about $97,000 per year, half covered by scholariships, and $46k/year in unsub fedloans. So each year after tuition and fees, I have about $28,500 left which doesn't cover my projected yearly expenses.

&amp;#x200B;

Below is my expected monthly budget based on my current monthly spending, without academic loan payments that would go into deferrment:

* Rent: $1,500 \[Boston\]
* CC bill: $700
* Food: $300
* Car Payment: $250
* Car Insurance: $250
* Entertainment: $100
* Shopping: $100
* Gas: $50
* Memberships: $50

**Total**:

* $3,300/month
* $39,600/year
* Deficit: $11,100/year

&amp;#x200B;

Rent could ideally be cheaper to potentially around $1100-$1200/month, but I havent had any luck finding decent places close to school/public transit. For now, I'm leaving it at $1500 as a spend ceiling with utilities included.

&amp;#x200B;

**Lastly**

Projected future debt after school:

* $290-$300K.
* $340-$355K If I take out the additional 11K per year

&amp;#x200B;

My questions now are,

1. What would be the best avenue to go about borrowing the extra $11k per year
2. Is there a way to bring down my credit card debt since I can't defer it like my private and fed loans, while in school?

Is it smart to open a card with my credit union or should I not put all my eggs in one basket?

I recently got a new job with $78k salary and when I refinanced my student loans last month they said I had a credit score of ~700(can’t find the paper right now for an exact number)

Does this sound like a smart plan? I don’t plan on switching banks anytime soon since everyone has told me how great Navy Federal can be.",finance

gaming,Friendly Discussion: Is Mainstream Interest in Gaming Declining?,"So a friend and I had a discussion yesterday. We both think gaming is on its way out. Here are some notes supporting our position.

* With a few exceptions gaming hasn't appealed to the masses since 2015/2016. For example the last non-Battlefield game that I cared about and actually loved was Batman: Arkham Knight. Almost everything since then hasn't been interesting. More on this later. In short there seems to be a general feeling collectively about the lack of interest in gaming to the mainstream.

* Gaming advertising has gone down. On the note of Battlefield the most recent title had a horrendous marketing campaign with no effort. I didn't see a single commercial on any media platform for the game nor did my EB Game shops have any cardboard cutouts for it to promote the game. Contrast this to BF1 which had a massive marketing campaign with ads on Youtube, TV channels, websites, etc. If publishers aren't advertising games as much as they used to then that's the writing on the wall for gaming's fate.

* Almost all new IPs from this decade have failed. Think of all the successful games from this decade. They're all old IPs. Spider-Man is as old as gaming itself. Red Dead Redemption is an old IP. DOOM is an old IP. Pokemon is old. Pretty much everything that is successful is an old IP. In contrast all the attempts as new ones have failed. Destiny failed. Anthem failed. Watch Dogs is meh and the second one didn't attract attention. In short gaming looks like it's dying from the lack of successful new IPs. This isn't the 2000s where everyone had to play Halo. Again an attempt to recapture the Halo success failed. Battle royale isn't going to last and in short the lack of successful new IPs spells doom for gaming's future.

* And on the note of failed IPs gaming news is only known to those who are part of the gaming community. If someone's outside of it, ie where I'm at in life right now, then he/she has no idea what the next triple A title is, etc. You have to follow gaming to know what's happening. Again in the 2000s almost everyone at least heard of the next Halo game, the next Pokemon game, etc. Now only gamers know what's going on.

* Sports are still popular. A couple of years ago people were saying how e-sports would become so big in North America they'd be accepted alongside hockey, etc. However that looks to not be happening as the NBA, NFL, etc are still popular. And almost everyone in the general public does not care to follow e-sports. Ask a random person about this e-sports player and he/she will have no idea what you're talking about. In contrast ask someone about Roger Federer, Andy Murray, Lebron James or Steph Curry and he/she will at least have heard of those names.

* And lastly VR will kill gaming as we know it. In the future with VR the lines between reality and illusion will be blurred. See gaming is in a weird spot because it's an illusion but you're aware you're not actually in the game. Because you're sitting your ass on a couch or a chair using a controller or keyboard and mouse. There's a hud telling you info. There are limits to what you can do. With VR developing in the future you'd be able to type in so many billing reports all while having a Pikachu by your side. And also maybe if you can't get to a sports game you can purchase a ticket and turn on your headset and boom! You're in the Scotiabank Centre seeing the Raptors vs the Bucks. In short VR will make gaming unappealing since you can do whatever you want.

That's what I think. What are y'all thoughts?",technology

personalfinance,"So, how much did you really pay in taxes?","I still see lots of people on reddit, facebook, etc equating how much of a refund they got with their taxes paid (i.e., I got a smaller refund this year, Trump Sucks...).  What everyone needs to know is how much tax you actually paid, as a percentage of your income.

This information is simple to calculate, and everyone should know how to do it.  So, to make it clear to everyone:

2018 IRS Form 1040, Line 7: This is your Adjusted Gross Income. Write that down.

2018 IRS Form 1040, Line 15: This is the total tax your paid. It's a pretty big number, isnt it?

&amp;#x200B;

Now figure out what percentage the tax you paid is of your AGI. For example, if you made $100,000 and paid $10,000 in taxes, you effectively paid 10% of your income in taxes. If you paid $20,000, then its 20%. Very simple math, even I can do it.

It seems to me that most people don't do this. Many have no idea how much total tax they paid, they only think about how much of a refund they got, or how much they owe.

&amp;#x200B;

You can do this for your 2017 numbers too.  The lines may be different, but you basically want the one that says AGI, and the one that says total tax.  You can then compare how much you paid in 2017 to how much you paid in 2018.

&amp;#x200B;

On Edit:  Example is for Federal taxes. You can do this for state as well to determine how much you paid in state taxes.  Find the state AGI on your tax forms, then find the line that states how much tax you paid, and calculate the percentage.",finance

personalfinance,[TAXES] When to expect federal return after mailing in requested documentation / How to claim previous state refunds never claimed?,"Hey all!

I’m curious what the wait time is for a refund if the IRS requires further documentation to process your return? I filed on 1/31 and was accepted same day. However due to a technical “quirk” on TurboTax I was unaware of, I incorrectly input some numbers wrong on my 1095-A. The IRS ended up sending me a letter which I received about a month and a half ago requesting me to fill out my monthly premium info by hand as well as a copy of my 1095-A. I sent the documents off maybe a few days after receiving the letter. I believe they’ll have to amend my return, but I was wondering how long the process will take? I know I’m due a refund, and am not in desperate need of the money but would love to have the extra cash soon. At what point should I try to give them a call?

In that same line of wanting to have some extra cash, I have filed CA state returns with TurboTax since 2016. Previously my uncle who is a CPA had done my taxes and I never had any issues receiving my refunds, but since switching to TT I have never received a state refund. In 2016 I should have received $87 and in 2017 $81. I’ve checked the state website for unclaimed property/assets and it doesn’t come up. When I try to track my refund on the CA FTB site it says the information is unavailable. Is this money just gone now? I definitely never received it. I signed up for direct deposit and had no issues with my federal in either of those years. It’s not a huge loss if I can’t retrieve it, but I just financed a car and any extra money I can throw on my loan the better.

personalfinance,"Settling $41,300 defaulted federal school loan for ~$29,100. What do I need to prepare for next years taxes?","So at the end of last year my ~$32k federal school loan went into default and collections. Immediately this of course added almost $10k in fees and such, jumping my balance to ~$41,300. I recently got a new full time and part time job, so I called the govt to figure out how to start the repayment process to avoid wage garnishment and the govt hoarding my tax refund.

They offered a ~$29,000 compromise for the 41k debt, or a 20 year repayment at 6.625%. I've decided to take the compromise, and the check is basically in the mail.

However, I know that the repayment doesn't just end here. I've heard that the difference between the compromise and the amount due on the account (approx $12k) will be added to my taxable income for next year, and I will be required to pay taxes on it.

So I have a couple of questions:

1) How exactly does this work for tax purposes exactly? And, what can I expect to owe next year based on the settlement? My current financial situation is:

* Job A: Full time hourly, $48,750 a year (plus minor overtime) before taxes. Currently have 2 allowances for my W4.

* Job B: Part time, $30 an hour, expected to make ~$8k before taxes this year. Currently 0 allowances for my W4.

With this recent development I was thinking it might be smart to change my allowances for my primary job to 0. I am single with no dependents for tax purposes.

2) Are there any forms or other documentation I need or should prepare for next year?

3) For insolvency purposes, does the compromise or federal debt I am paying off count towards my debt, or because I am paying it off can I not include it for insolvency (I assume the latter is the case).

I don't think declaring insolvency is a realistic option with my 2 new jobs, but figured I should explore it.

personalfinance,Question about a store credit card offering 24 months 0% interest with 48 equal monthly payments required,"EDIT: It's 24 months 0% interest with 24 equal monthly payments required*****

I assume these are a good idea if I plan on making the payments on time every month because if I don't the interest rates are very high. My question is regarding the ""24 equal monthly payments required"" stipulation. Does that mean I must pay in exactly equal payments so that it is completely paid off in 24 months or does that mean that it just needs to be paid before 24 months and it won't incur any interest?

You might not be able to tell but I'm not a credit card guru so take it easy on me. I appreciate any advice.",finance
personalfinance,"Auto loan - Cash back/higher APR from GM Financial, or no cash back/lower APR from federal credit union?","I'm shopping for a new truck and had decided to try to get a loan from an FCU, not through a dealership. Then, I saw some cash-back offers from the dealership, as much as $3000. I'll list some best-case scenarios:



Loaner | Financed amount | APR | Term | Payment | Total cost of loan
------|---------------|---|---| ------- | --------- | ------
FCU | $31,388 | 4.35 | 72 mo | $496 | $35,719
GM | $28,388 | 6.84 | 72 mo | $482 | $34,690

personalfinance,How many allowances should I claim on my state and federal W4s?,"Hi everyone!

I'm starting a job in June that will be paying $3750 a month before tax. I'm thinking about how many allowances to claim as I don't want to have too much withheld. Because it starts in June, my pretax annual income (including about $2500 in income I earned during school) is going to be $25k. Working another half of the year in 2020, my income will be ~$25k. This only puts me in the first two income tax brackets because my income is divided evenly throughout both years.

I did the IRS withholding form, and it suggests 4 allowances, but I read you generally only want to put 2 if you're single with only one job. Am I reading that right? Would it be okay to put 4 allowances on my W4?

My MD heard that I gave notice and asked if I would be willing to stay on for another month or two. I explained the situation with my apartment and he said that the firm would be willing to cover my housing if I were to stay on longer.

personalfinance,401K Loan.. Am I Crazy?,"Hey pf! I am aware of the general outlook on 401K loans. They should be a last resort, etc.. I am hoping I can relay my situation and perhaps someone will be able to provide alternate avenues for moving forward in my situation.



In the near future, I will be leaving my company and subsequently owe them between 15 and 20k. I am leaving a seemingly dead-end job to pursue an amazing career opportunity that pays 25k higher than what I am currently in. Some of the 15-20k, I can pay from my emergency fund, which I keep around 3-5 months of expenses in. However, I typically keep my savings accounts pretty lean as I aggressively pay down my student loans. Only one more year of that, and I will be backing off the high payments in the short term.



The remainder of the owed money, I need to come up with from.. somewhere. That is where I would appreciate some guidance. Logistically, I can easily do a 401K loan (EDIT: after rolling over my current 401K to the 401K provided by the new company). I’m confident it would be paid back in short order. However, since the idea is so frowned upon, does anybody have any suggestions for better avenues for a loan of this size that can be paid back in less than a year?

Some answers I am anticipating:

* Borrow from a family member. This may be a possibility, but I’ve never done this before so although I may broach the subject, I would probably choose to handle this whole situation on my own.

* Private loan. I have about a 760 credit score, so I am not sure what companies are reputable or what interest rates typically would be for this amount and my score.

personalfinance,401(a) to 401(k) rollover through conduit IRA?,"I have a few thousand dollars sitting into a Governmental 401(a) plan, for a job that I quit last year. I have not reach the minimum amount of years for vesting, and my interest payable upon refund is capped at 4.5%, so I really want to move the money out of that account. I currently have a job in the private sector with a decent 401(k). I also have a Roth IRA with Vanguard (above deduction limit for traditional IRA), and do expect that I will be above the MAGI limit for Roth IRA contribution within 2 years, so I would like to use the backdoor Roth IRA technique then. To avoid the pro rata rule, I would rather not have any money in a pre-tax IRA.

The rollover rules from the 401(a) plan state: ""You may roll over the payment to either an IRA (an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity) or an employer plan (a tax-qualified section 401(a) plan, section 403(b) plan, or governmental section 457(b) deferred compensation plan) that will accept the rollover"". So direct rollover to 401(k) is not an option.

The 401(k) plan rules also state I cannot roll money in from a 401(a). Additionally, it states: ""If IRAs are eligible for rollover into your plan, you are certifying on the Rollover form that the proceeds from the IRA originated either from a qualified employer-sponsored plan or from contributions distributed from a “traditional IRA” from which you took a tax deduction on your federal income tax return. Required: Include a copy of your IRA statement.""

personalfinance,"In debt with multiple collections, should we declare bankruptcy or are there other worthwhile options? (Wisconsin)","Hello Personal Finance Redditors, 
About 5 years ago I got leukemia and went through expensive medical treatments, lost my job, and everything crashed otherwise. Insurance covered the majority of my medical charges but didn't handle everything else. I used all my credit cards and even got a few loans along the way try to keep myself afloat until I could recover enough to get back to work. However, most everything (credit cards, auto/personal loans, medical) went into collections before I could get a job again. My wife is disabled and cannot keep a serious job, so we're relying on my income alone.


I have been trying to deal with the collections, trying to budget, trying to be smart about money these days but everything has piled up quickly. I make about $94k before taxes and deductions at my new job, but feel like I am climbing a mountain. I was sued a couple of weeks ago for $3500 of my medical debt and now they are going to garnish my wages (20% limit in Wisconsin?). I'm figuring about $1000/month for the next 3.5 months. I have a substantial amount in collections and I am fearing that if I can be sued and garnished for $3500 of my medical debt, that I will be sued for everything else in due time.


Here is my rough breakdown:

**Current Income:**
$2500/2 weeks

**Main Known Budgeted Expenses:**

* Rent: $1,400/month (After a $300 discount because of my work)
* Car 1 (Volkswagen GTI): $370/month (I have about $1.5k left on this before it is paid off and I own it. )
* Car 2 (Toyota Prius): $470/month (This is at 24% APR and $17k left on the loan. We have concluded this needs to go)
* Cell phones: $100/month Project FI on older used phones
* Auto/Rental insurance: $210/month
* Utilities: $160/month
* Student Loans: $300/month 
* Internet: $50/month
* Groceries: ~$500/month
* Gas/maintenance: $200/month

Income minus budgeted expenses: $1,240 left over without taking into account any other expenses.

**Debt in Collections:**

* $10,000 Mayo Clinic (medical)
* $17,000 Soon to be the Toyota Prius
* $15,466 Credit card
* $11,331 Credit card
* $4,386 Credit card
* $565 Credit card
* $4,175 Unsecured Loan
* $3,032 Unsecured Loan
* $2,880 Unsecured Loan
* $3,125 (From wedding rings that I could no longer make payments on)
* $929 Charge account
* $750 Charge account
* $1,767 Line of credit I had at my bank
* $3,719 Auto Loan (One of the vehicles that got repossessed)
* $3,001 (2year Verizon contract that was accelerated and they charged full price for everything)
* $7,838 (Sum of other medical accounts in collections)

The rough sum of my debt in collections: $89,964
My wife has some as well - not as much though.

I have about $20,000 in federal student loans as well.

At this point, my wife and I (age 34) don't know what to do and what our best options are. I have $400 in an emergency fund and otherwise, have not been making much of a dent in collections.

I suspect that bankruptcy is the only real viable option at this point. I'm scared about the consequences of bankruptcy, but I feel like we are running out of options and we could really use some advice.

personalfinance,Financial planning for prospective grad student,"Hi, this might be a little long, and the questions a little specific, but hoping you guys would still be nice enough to offer some advice!

I'm a Singaporean (27M) just out of university and trying to sort out my long-term financial decisions.

I currently have (values in my currency, about 0.7 US$ each)

&amp;#x200B;

Assets:

500 in the bank (1.8% interest rate)

28k in VWRD. Global equity ETF. This is an Irish-domiciled VT equivalent that incurs a 15% dividend withholding tax (as opposed to 30%) for foreign investors like me

6k in ES3. Singapore equity ETF.

5k in EA. A bet on upcoming earnings, but one that am happy to hold for the medium term (3-7 years).

11k in individual large cap stocks in my country (telcos, oil rig builders).

600 in P2P lending (loans to local SMEs)

6k in CPF. This is a mandatory state retirement account (returns 5% up til 60k, then 4% up til 240k, and 2.5% after) which is inaccessible until 55, at which point an annuity must be purchased that pays out from 65 until death, and the remainder may be immediately withdrawn.

&amp;#x200B;

Liabilities:

6k in margin loans (3.9% interest rate) for the EA bet and 1k in VWRD. 

No dependents.

&amp;#x200B;

Networth: 51k.

&amp;#x200B;

Income (monthly):

550 mandatory contribution to CPF

550 mandatory employer contribution to CPF

2400 after tax/contributions income

&amp;#x200B;

Expenditure (monthly):

Living with my parents, so I get to spend just 300-600 a month.

&amp;#x200B;

Plans:

Savings goal is 1800 a month, 100 into ES3 and 1700 in VWRD.

More long-term, I'd like to add a separate bond component when I'm 40, and re-balance till my equities are around 40% of my networth by the time I retire.

&amp;#x200B;

Main Questions:

1. I'm looking to do a PhD in Sociology in the US in the next three years. After that, I'm hoping to return to Singapore, but will more likely go to any English-speaking country that might offer faculty positions. How might this impact the assets I'm currently accumulating tax-wise (Singapore has no capital gains or dividends tax)? When should I switch to VT, if ever?
2. I don't currently have much of an emergency fund, since my circumstances are not volatile. How much of one should I prepare for being a grad student in the US? I realise this is dependent both on my real expenditure and location, but still, what's a good ballpark?
3. About that bond component, what are good instruments/how should I decide what to invest in? US Treasuries? Sovereign bond ETFs?
4. That 10k in individual stocks are a leftover from several years ago when I had no idea what I was doing and bought some large companies my parents had faith in. I don't really want individual stocks in any major proportion any longer, but I'm leery of selling them off immediately because it would be at a (5-20%) loss :(. I think this may not really be optimal, but am still waiting to break even for psychological reasons. Is this very silly?
5. Regarding those margin loans, I figured some leverage was necessary, and am actually thinking of increasing this amount. Currently, the market has to lose 70% of its value before I'll be called. I'm thinking 60% would be a better target. Any thoughts?

personalfinance,Advice with paying large amount of student loan debt,"I have a lot of federal student loan debt right now (95k) from a graduate degree I eventually failed out of due to barely missing the core classes grades requirement. It really hurt my psyche and I couldn't find a job for a year where around another 12k of interest piled up and 6-7k of credit card debt. I also applied to get back in twice and they did not take me so it's basically just wasted money.

I have been working for the past 6 months (1 month off due to gov shutdown) and paid off all the credit cards quickly and  6k of my student loan debt. Below are the numbers for my current financial situation.

**Salary:** $71,000 a year (Paid weekly at $976.85) Will do 401k with my company this month as well.

**Student Loans:** $95,000 (35k at 5.84% and 60k at 6.84%)

**Credit Cards:** Very minimal

**Stocks:** $64,000

I live at home and pay no rent, I have budgeted $1500-2000 a month to pay for the student loans and my mom has pledged to give me $500 a month toward the student loans. I don't plan on living home for more than 2 more years and this rate of pay may not be sustainable when I move out. I also plan on getting a new job in the next 4-6 months with a feasible pay of 100k+.

Am I on the right track to paying it off or is there something I can do better? I also did a refinancing application at Sofi and Earnest. Earnest gave me the better rates with options of (4.73%, $1800, 5 years), (4.92%, $1350, 7 years), (5.16%, $1000, 10 years). Would refinancing be the best option?

personalfinance,Having a baby and trying to make the right decision about my debt.,"I'm having a baby in July. And my current debt situation is out of control. I need some advice. 

TLDR: Here is a rundown of my current financial position and my thoughts about how to deal with it. Maybe steer me in the right direction. I really need help and I know it, I'm just not quite sure where to turn or which resources to trust. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Annual NET household income: $52,000 (I make about 24,000, husband makes about 28,000)**

Notes: My husband and I do not make much money. I know that the easiest advice here is ""make more money"". I respect that this is a reasonable solution but it is not the solution for us. My husband is a bipolar artist with literally no other documented job history who is making a serious career for himself and has sustained a consistent and predictable income for 5 years now. I run a small beverage company that is only three years old. We turned a profit last year and are set for steady and dependable growth which will guarantee my income will increase at a decent rate for the foreseeable future. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Assets:**

**House: currently valued at $250,000.** 

NOTES: purchased with an FHA rehab loan in 2017 for $190,000, currently owe about $180,000. We have done extensive remodeling as it was on the brink of being condemned. 

**Cars: $16,000 total**

2011 Nissan Juke and 2008 Toyota Camry 

NOTES: I estimated costs based on Kelly Blue Book values

&amp;#x200B;

**Expenses:** 

Notes: Our income covers our expenses without a problem. It's a tight budget with the other payments we make on debts, but I've worked pretty hard to keep this budget tight. Husband could always drink less beer and he's working on it, but there just isn't much more to cut back on than we already have. I also have a long commute (40 miles each way) which I make on average 3 times a week, so gas is a significant regular expense as well. 

**Mortgage- $1495/mo.** 

Notes: We currently have a part-time roommate who pays $200 a month. He moves out in September and we have a full-time roommate lined up who will pay $500 a month. So our adjusted mortgage is more like $1295 now, and will be about $995 come September.

**Utilities- average $450/ mo.** 

Notes: includes electricity, internet, trash, cell phone bill

**Insurance premiums-  $200/mo.** 

Notes: includes car insurance and health insurance

&amp;#x200B;

**Debts:**

Notes: Our debts are a story of stupidity and I'm well aware of that. 

**Medical- $5130.25 (monthly payments currently average about $150)**

NOTES: we just applied for financial assistance for this, and should hear back within 2 weeks. We are currently not making payments of $75 a month for some of it, and have paid it down from a total of 11,000 in the past year with some help from family and from chipping away at smaller bills that we can afford to take care of. 

Our medical debt is due to not understanding the plans that I chose on the marketplace- twice in a damn row. The info about which providers are covered and estimated costs for services on the marketplace are EXTREMELY inaccurate. And I did not understand that I could not trust the information provided there and accrued significant out of pocket costs because I misunderstood or was misinformed about coverage.  Also- my husband had to have surgery for kidney stones last year and that did not do us any favors, even after our co-insurance paid we owed thousands. 

**Credit Card- $8303.03 with an interest rate of about 20% (currently paying about $200/ mo)**

We haven't accumulated any new cc debt in years, we have just been paying minimum payments on a big nasty credit card bill that I accumulated in grad school because I got bad advice that I shouldn't take out a student loan when my stipend didn't cover our expenses and my husband was looking for a new job in a new city for 6 months. Instead I put it on a card. This assumed that the job market was stable and that I could pay the card off quickly when I finished my masters degree. As it turns out, it wasn't. I worked extremely low wage jobs for years before getting to the place I am today. I know it's best to pay more than the minimum (obviously), but it's not an option I've had. 

**Taxes- 3948.36 (currently have a payment plan for $300/ month that will drop to $250/mo in December 2019, and be paid in full by April 2020)**

Our tax debt is due to my husband's inattention to his business finances. No excuse really, just didn't make estimated payments throughout the year, and was surprised when he owed a large lump sum. We have payment plans in place but essentially they suck up all of the budget we have for making estimated payments, so we are always behind by a year playing catch up instead of staying ahead of the game. 

&amp;#x200B;

**CREDIT SCORES:**

my score: 615

husbands score: 721

&amp;#x200B;

**Current plan:**

A. See what help we might get from family on taxes and medical bills, although I don't expect much. 

B. See what kind of financial aid we might get on medical bills. According to all the forms I filled out, we qualify for at least some. 

C. Sell the Camry and use half of the money to buy an old truck for about $4,000 (we super need one, we live on a farm and are currently transporting farm supplies in the Juke and it's not sustainable), use about $2000 to knock out some debt, and use the other $1500ish to do a tune up on the Juke and repair a vintage RV on the property that has a resale value of probably $5,000 if it's running.  Sell the RV. 

B. I think we need to take out a loan to consolidate the rest of the debt. It seems like the two routes available are a home equity loan (which I don't know if we would qualify for), or a debt consolidation loan (and I don't understand how to choose one thats legit and a good deal). It seems like paying $650 a month for debts that are all disconnected is a bad plan, and that we could steer our money more wisely. But I just don't know how. What are the next steps?

&amp;#x200B;

**Goal:**

I need for us to have a plan in place by the time we have a baby. We do not need to pay for childcare, but we will incur probably $4,000 more in medical bills (which I should have some financial help with). I want to be proactive about the situation. I feel like we have been so reactive to all of our various debts that we don't have a comprehensive vision for how to set ourselves up for success in the future at all.

personalfinance,About to obtain a car from my grandmother. Is it better for her to gift or sell it to me? She owns the vehicle outright. (CO),"My grandmother has recently made the humble decision to stop driving and knows I need a new car, so she asked if I wanted it. I do, but I don't want to get stuck with a new headache of tax and money problems if I accept. 

I have no idea what I'm looking for. Looking at the DMV website for Colorado, I'm not sure where (or if) it talks about this, like taxes due on gifts, etc. 

She already owns the vehicle outright and has paid applicable sales tax, but I've heard I would need to pay taxes if it's a ""gift"" worth over $13,000.

So is it better for her to write out a bill of sale for some amount? Or should she gift the vehicle to me? I know this is pretty run of the mill, but everyone I ask seems to be hazy on the matter and I don't really know how to search for the information I need.

Even if all you do is direct me to where I should be looking for this kind of information, I would be grateful.

Thank you.

EDIT: Sounds like everyone is saying there's no reason to write a bill of sale if it will be significantly under fair market value, because it will be treated the same as a gift.

EDIT 2: As I've read, she doesn't even have to gift or sell it to me. Since she's immediate family, she can simply transfer the title to me and be tax exempt for the state of Colorado for that transaction. Otherwise, she can claim lifetime gift exemptions (those over $15,000) to the IRS for federal tax purposes, if needed. So neither of us should have to pay anything, besides the usual fees, registration, etc associated with this kind of transfer. Thanks to everyone!",finance

personalfinance,Using Student Loans to Purchase a Vehicle,"I have seen many posts about this and regarding the legality there seems to be a grey area. I am attending a CC and my financial/academic advisor has advised me that I can use a federal student loan to purchase a vehicle as it will be used for transportation to and from work and school which is required for me to attend the school, and thus constitutes a living expense. The vehicle I would be purchasing is through a private party and an extremely good deal that will provide me with a reliable car well past my graduation 3 years from now. The loan would be for $6,000 of which $4500 is subsidized, the remaining $1500 will have to be paid off with a 4.67% interest rate. I will not need to start making payments on the loan until 6 months after I graduate. My plan is to stow away money in a separate savings account for 3 years and of the day of my graduation pay off the full $6,000 and about $130 in interest in one big payment. I don't see why I wouldn't take this option when my only other option is to take out an auto loan at about 7% interest rate for the full $6000.

TL;DR: Why would I take out an auto loan at 7% interest on $6,000 when I can take out a student loan of $6,000 and only $1,500 of it has a 4.67% interest rate?

investing,Bloomberg: Powell Adopts an Inflation Stance Yellen Shunned,"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-04-17/powell-adopts-whites-of-the-eyes-inflation-stance-yellen-shunned?srnd=premium

&gt; The central bank has backed off the interest-rate hikes it had been delivering to avoid a potentially dangerous rise in inflation that economic theory says could result from the hot jobs market. Instead, Powell &amp; Co. have put policy on hold until sub-par inflation rises convincingly.

&gt; “The Fed is evolving to a ‘whites-of-the-eyes’ approach in terms of inflation’’ under which it won’t hike rates until price rises accelerate, said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities LLC.

&gt; Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said this week that the central bank may hold policy steady until the fall of 2020 and might even reduce rates in the unlikely event that underlying inflation softened.

&gt; Such a stance could eventually lead to faster price rises, lower unemployment and a longer expansion as officials refrain from raising rates to rein in the economy.

&gt; Then-Fed Chair Janet Yellen rejected a “whites of their eyes’’ strategy in 2016, arguing that the central bank needed to be pre-emptive in dealing with inflation because monetary policy acts with a lag. Powell, a central bank governor at the time, supported her.

&gt; That’s the impetus behind the Fed’s decision to reconsider its inflation framework. While Powell has ruled out increasing the 2 percent goal, he’s raised the possibility that the central bank could adopt a “make-up’’ strategy when it concludes its review in the first half of 2020.",finance

gaming,Help me find an old pirate game,"I've played this as a kid, so game should be somewhere around 1995-2005(2010?)

First thing I remember for hundred percent is that in dialogs everyone just mumbles (no foreign language, literally mumbling).

Somewhere at the beginning you have boxing match(or you can bet money on yourself/play as many times as you want- idk really) and as far as I remember its in 3rd person.

You play as a buffed character probably shirtless or with white sleeveless shirt(don't hold me on that tho). You can trade/sell stuff you acquired on sea by fighting AI's and taking their loot. There's upgrading/buying new/better/bigger ship...

If I remember something else I'll add, btw so far I've checked [this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Video_games_about_pirates) and found that [Tortuga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3SWSQKdgxY) and [Sid Meier's Pirates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3if7ls_sBc) are somewhat similar to the one I was playing by looking at the sea traveling, it could be one of it's series but I didn't checked them as I couldn't recall anything by watching those videos...

personalfinance,"Older college student, going through divorce, swimming in credit card debt...not sure how to make it all work.","I am in my early 30's, and I started back at school for engineering a couple years ago, taking the pre-requisites at community college first to save money, and then planning to transfer to a four year school.  At the time I started back, I was happily married, and my spouse was supporting me largely.  I worked part time, and we used credit cards to fill in the gaps, and they have been accumulating to the point of now having 6 of them fully maxed out.  This didn't seem like a huge issue because my spouse had enough of an income that I could work part time while they worked full time, and we were still ok, being able to make the minimum payments, with the idea that upon graduation, I would start aggressively paying all of them down with my higher income.  The field I am going into pays a median salary of roughly $100,000, so it seemed justifiable.    


Fast forward to today, and due to personal differences, my spouse and I are getting a divorce (not related to my educational expenses or anything, other stuff).  We have agreed that each of our debts is our own, which is a fair agreement since we each have our own credit cards that we put different things on.  However, this is rather inconvenient for me overall, because I was just finishing up at the community college, and have been accepted to my school of choice, and was about to start working on making that transition for the fall.  Doing the math on my budget as a single person, and I am not really sure I can make it work.  To break it down, I have about $550 in credit card payments a month if I only pay the minimum payments.  The cheapest rent I could find in the area is between $400 and $500, assuming I can find a room in a house, which is quite common to see in this college town.  Adding these two things plus food and gas, and I am looking at probably close to $400 a week minimum, which means if I am working a minimum wage job, I would need to work over 40 hours a week.  If I can find something higher paying, that would be better, but I was kind of hoping to not have to work more than 30 hours a week while making this transition, so I can focus maximum time on my school work.    


Overall, I'm just overwhelmed in what I should do.  I had been doing so good going back to school, after many past failures.  This time was actually working out well.  However, things just had to get more complicated and take a nose dive right when they were looking the best.  To make matters worse, I may have reached, or be very close to reaching, the maximum federal loan limit, since I had been enrolled previously for a totally different degree, which I decided I did not want to pursue as a career.  So I'm hoping that maybe I can find scholarships, or at worst private loans.  However, I'm almost wondering if it's really worth it in the end.  I am passionate about what I want to do, but I'm already swimming in debt from all sides, and will be swimming in more debt in the future.  This will be hanging over my head for a long time, and I am struggling to justify it.  I really want to make this work, but I'm not sure it will pay off in the end, and may end up bankrupting me.

personalfinance,Refinancing without a job offer,"Hello! My wife and I are going through a lot of changes over the next few months. We are both graduating, and upon graduation we are moving to a new city across the US (2,100 miles!) without any connections. I want to refinance some loans from a credit union that have an outrageously high interest rate (\~10%). However, I have not had a job offer yet and am curious if I should wait until I have a contract or just file for refinancing now. This decision is made harder by the fact that I have been applying on job boards and local searches for the past 4 weeks and have not heard anything back (\~100 applications). So there is no guarantee that a job is coming within the next month. Is it worth it to put off refinancing until I have verified income to lock in a lower interest rate?

(48 month term) I’ve been making additional payments; therefore I am paying extra towards my principal.  Well now my statement says nothing is due until July.  What does this mean?

personalfinance,"If it takes you 5 years to save up $15,000 for a car, why is it so bad to lease a car for a low interest rate that would bring it to $17,000 for 5 years?","I'm super ignorant about this and it doesn't seem to bother me or my family as much as others.

If I put $250 a month away, for 5 years, I can go out and buy a $15,000 car in cash, no payment. Definitely a good decision, in no way do I deny that. It's actually preferable.

The part that gets me is that if I find a car I love, and plan to drive it into the dirt. I pay $275 in payments for 5 years for the car. Then I own it, paid an extra 2% which is bad, I understand interest is bad, but I paid the same amount of money that I would in saving for a car that I'll keep and drive into the ground. Sure I'm locked in, but my mom has been driving the same car for 13 years. She leased it and loves it more than any other car she's had. 

I hear that cars lose value, but if you don't plan to sell then the value doesn't matter. 

I feel super ignorant and maybe I'm missing something. I understand if you plan to just get a different car after the lease then I don't really find it worth. My dad makes $140,000/year and pays $300/month for his truck. He loves his truck more than anything and takes care of it, and he said he doesn't even feel the payments. I guess our family is just used to it.

Edit: apparently there's a big difference between finance and lease

Finance: Pay overtime to own at an interest rate (LOW INTEREST PREFERRED)

Lease: You pay monthly for a car for 2-5 years and then switch to another car and continue payments. So you always have a new car but have a payment forever and never own, or if you do pay a large sum.

personalfinance,"Consolidating credit card debt, offered loan for lower amount","Hi PF!

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm trying to get a hold on my debt and decided I should inquire with my credit union to see if they would give me a loan at a lower interest rate to help me pay it off.  My debt break down is as follows:

\- Credit Card #1: $2,145 @22.05%

\- Credit Card #2: $2,750 @ 27.240%

\- Credit Card #3: $3,145 @ 27.24%

\- Credit Card #4: $5,639 @ 18.49%

\- Credit Card #5: $6,810 @14.49%

All and all is is $20,795 of debt, which I requested the loan for from my credit union.  My credit union offered me a $10,000 loan at 13.74%.  My credit is at 672 right now. 

Now I'm wondering what I should do.  Should I:

1) Take the $10,000 loan and pay off the three cards with the highest interest rate and then aggressively pay off the the two with the highest balances.

2) Shop around and see if I can find a loan for the full amount

3) Use the snowball method and pay off the loans as they are now as fast as possible.

personalfinance,"FHA streamline refinance, I'm clueless....","Looking for opinions and/or experience with this process. Long story short, been in home 2yrs on a 30yr fixed. Current interest rate is 4.375%, payment $1450/mo, owe 214k.

Streamline would maintain current term (28yr left), lower my interest at 3.875%, payment would drop about $50/mo to $1400, savings over the life of the loan would be $17k. The loan balance however would increase by about $2000 to $216k and change.

Is there any downside at all? Fine print that I don't know about? I'd really love to eliminate PMI but he said house would need to appraise at about $260k, which I'm sure it isn't. Our property tax assessment did jump pretty significantly though from last year to this, $216k to $247k, although  I'm aware assessment doesn't = appraisal.

While I'd like to lower the term to 25yr or less, I can't afford to due to a pretty stiff child support monthly payment. I can't really afford to have my mortgage payment go up right now.

personalfinance,24 year old college student trying to get finances in order,"Like the title says, I'm a college student in a not-so-great financial situation looking for suggestions on ways I can improve it. I'm graduating from my community college next week with my associate's degree in science and am planning to begin taking classes at a four-year college in fall 2020 to work toward my bachelor's. In the meantime, I'm continuing classes at my community college to earn an Environmental Tech certificate so I can find a better job. I currently work as a student assistant for the state, which allows me the opportunity to contribute toward a 401(k). The state matches my contribution, though I am unsure of the details or my current savings in the account so far. I've been contributing into it for the year that I've been in my position. As a student, I am limited to working 29 hours per week and I'm currently making $14.31/hour. I work on average 24 hours a week, so bring home approximately $530-550 every two weeks after deductions, taxes, and union dues. My biggest debts are credit cards and the auto loan I've got on my truck. Selling it is out of the question because I have negative equity in it and am sure I wouldn't be able to break even on it, much less turn a profit. I live in a rural area and commute frequently between work and class so I spend around $30/week on gas.

Some basics on my financial situation, including my debts:

Student loans: $9,255

Credit cards: $7,800

Auto loan: $7,260

Credit score: 510

My student loans are currently in deferment until graduation (from the four-year college) so I do not pay anything on them at the moment. My credit card debt is a combination of Visa, PayPal, Best Buy, Capital One, and a couple small loans from my credit union. My auto loan interest rate is 4.25%. I have a 2007 Dodge Dakota that is coming up on 200,000 miles. The KBB value on it is $4,650 for private party sale.

Out of my net income of $1,100/mo., approximately half of it goes toward my bills, gas, groceries and other necessities. I know I put a lot of my income towards dumb shit, like clothes and hobbies, and it is something I am aware of and am trying to cut drastically. I recently moved home after leaving an unhealthy relationship and would like to look at renting an apartment in the same town as my university when I begin taking classes next fall.

My biggest question is: other than cut out my disposable spending (which I'm working on), what would you suggest I do next to pay off my debt and create a better financial situation for myself? Should I try debt consolidation services like Greenpath, or just focus on making as many payments as I can on each debt?

The dealer said the best rate they could get me was 13% with Ally Auto. It just seemed really high, and was hoping to not get more than 6 or 7%. Was just wondering if anyone had a similar situation recently, and what kind of rates you were given.

fintech,"Very interesting discussion featuring Kris Hansen, the CTO of a digital bank KOHO that I came across on a fintech startup’s podcast: Building a digital bank around great customer experience","To provide some context, KOHO was in the news lately for [calling out big banks](https://betakit.com/koho-launches-new-feature-helping-uncover-hidden-bank-fees/) on hidden fees.   
I included the podcast’s main discussion points below so you have an idea about what is discussed in the podcast.  
If you would like to listen to the podcast, you can find it [here](https://flinks.io/blog/kris-hansen-digital-bank-customer-experience/)

1. “Creativity thrives on the tension between freedom and constraint”

We feel this quote from Brent Rosso, organizational psychology professor at Montana State University, could be KOHO’s motto. Working within already established systems — accounts, cards, transfers, etc. — their approach to innovation is to allow themselves to give their own, digital-only interpretations. “Why not-” and “what if-” questions are used to think creatively.

2. To fight apathy, give the power back — people will thank you

No one likes to feel stuck in the passenger seat — especially not in this day and age. In more and more areas, consumers are able to self-educate and want to assume control. Offering financial services products that give them the tools to set and achieve their goals puts them in the driver’s seat. And who knew, apparently you can get people excited about financial services products.

3. The next stop on the road to open banking: alignment on liability and security

Data access is no longer the big obstacle to open banking. In fact, it’s already happening. The pressing questions now fall along the lines of: where does liability lie? Which security standards should we implement to protect consumers’ data? How do we make sure new players are not prevented from entering the playing field?

4. Open banking should come with a side of open source

Because why reinvent the wheel — or the good old checking account — when someone has built it and a whole community can improve it. An open source and collaborative open banking ecosystem would free time and energy to build new products. And this would benefit everyone.",finance

personalfinance,Should I treat Savings Bonds as part of my cash holdings or investment portfolio?,"28 years old, looking for some advice on fine tuning my financial strategy.


I have approx. $20K (current value) in Series EE and I (majority EE) bonds that I received as gifts throughout my childhood. The maturity dates range from 2020 to 2036 with a significant chunk of that falling between 2020-2025. Average interest rate is around 3.4%. These were all originally paper bonds that I've electronically converted through TreasuryDirect. Once they mature they will automatically be transferred to my checking account.


My question really lies in trying to determine if I should be putting more of my idle cash into the market. I currently have $40K cash in Ally/checking, $86K in my 401(k), $28K in a Roth IRA, and $26K in a taxable brokerage account. I have maxed out my Roth IRA for the year and am on track to max out my 401(k) as well. I do not have an HSA at work and my employer does not allow for after-tax non-Roth 401(k) contributions.


Do I effectively have $60K of idle cash here? I've always viewed the bonds as part of my investment portfolio and not part of my cash holdings. If that's the case, should I put more money into my taxable brokerage? Big upcoming purchases (over next five years) would include an engagement ring, wedding, possible house down payment.",finance

personalfinance,Tell me how to use my first credit card in the best way possible,"I’ve been getting mixed answers by searching YouTube and online about using your utilization correctly, and similar things so I would really appreciate your help! 

So I’m 21, and just got approved for my first credit card. I want to get an excellent credit score started as quickly as possible, so I should’ve got one a long time ago, but here we are. 

A little context, I have great income right now and have around $10k and rising in my checking account. I’ve just been swiping my debit card everywhere but I need to start building credit. 

So far I have a five month credit history from my car loan, which I managed to get approved for as a null by putting a lot of money down, and the LTV was somewhere less than 80%. I’m currently paying an 11% interest rate through a credit union, so one of the reasons I want to raise my score is to refinance my car to avoid paying so much interest some point. But for now, the payment is not bad at all and I’ve even been paying extra every month towards it. Currently my score is around 615. 

So on to the question: This capital one platinum card has a dinky 300$ limit. From what I’ve read online it’s best to stay below a 10% utilization rate, so I can only put 30$ on this card every month? Less than a tank of gas? Won’t I never get my limit raised that way? Some people say anywhere below 30% utilization will work, there’s tons of mixed opinions out there. 

Also, I have coworkers that tell me I should carry over a balance of a few dollars every month to help build my score a little faster. Some people claim that’s a myth, so any help on that would be greatly appreciated as well. I have the funds to pay off the card in full every month, I don’t plan to use it like free money. 

I’m probably being nit picky but I want to start off my adult life with the best credit possible. Thanks in advance for the help!",finance

I’ll explain my situation so bare with me; any advice is welcomed as I’m incredibly new to this and appreciate the help!

I have been working for Target over the last few years while I was attending school, and recently opened up a ROTH 401k with them due to them matching up to 5% of each paycheck, which I thought would be a much better investment then the 1.7% interest I was gaining in my IRA account at my local bank, which all things considered is pretty awful. 

Over time I have put about $2,000 into the IRA, so I thought it would be a good move to place that into the 401k just to have it all in one place since my funds are so small being that I’m just getting started with everything, but come to find out my ROTH IRA cannot be rolled over into the ROTH 401k. 

So basically, I’m wondering what I should do with the money already in the account, should I just attempt to max it out while I’m gone to basic and tech school since having more in the account would be inherently a bad thing, or should I try to look into placing it into something else since the interest rate is so incredibly low at the bank? If any more details are necessary I can share that as well, just some sort of guidance or advice going forward would be helpful.

investing,Thoughts on the Golden Butterfly portfolio (and using leverage)?,"Hi all,

I'm curious about what experienced investors here think of the Golden Butterfly portfolio allocation [https://portfoliocharts.com/2015/09/22/catching-a-golden-butterfly/](https://portfoliocharts.com/2015/09/22/catching-a-golden-butterfly/) 

It seems like over the last 50 years this allocation has nearly matched the Total US stock market in terms of real CAGR while having only a small fraction of the volatility as well as much shorter drawdown periods. There's some analysis of why this has been the case here [https://portfoliocharts.com/2016/04/18/the-theory-behind-the-golden-butterfly/](https://portfoliocharts.com/2016/04/18/the-theory-behind-the-golden-butterfly/).

My personal investment goals currently are a mix of capital preservation while still maintaining competitive returns, and this portfolio seems to fit the bill at least in terms of historical results. What I'm particularly interested in is what experienced investors think about using leverage to maintain this strategy as the long term core of my portfolio. As shown in the analysis, over the last 50 years the biggest drawdown this strategy has experienced is only 11%! While at the same time still generating a modest but competitive inflation adjusted CAGR. This strategy has performed well and generated consistent positive returns even during decade long periods of underperformance in both the equities and treasury markets. It seems to me that using leverage to maintain something between a 1.2x-2x exposure to this strategy is a no brainer assuming I can find cheap credit. Even with a 2x exposure to this strategy your max drawdown over the last 50 years would have only been 22% (before margin costs). Currently I see that I can get a margin interest rate of about 3.55% on IB, while the historical CAGR of this strategy is shown as 5.7%.

Someone please tell me why using modest amounts of leverage into this strategy as the core of my portfolio isn't a slam dunk! Thanks for any and all advice/comments.",finance
btc,"I'm a ""statist"" and stand by Bitcoin Cash NOT BSV or BTC. This is my reasoning...","There definitely isn't very many vocal people in crypto that say they like the government, but I believe democratic government is key to the social evolution of humanity and I want to use BCH in particular to make it better. I have also given BCH (Roger ver style) to many in the legal profession, and talk with finance people regularly. Here is why I choose to stand by BCH:

* The most important thing about BCH is that it **emphasizes onchain transactions**. With BCH, a farmer in Kenya with a cellphone has access to the same core financial services that Goldman Sachs does. What scares me about BTC and LN, is that it will lead to a small minority who can afford the proof of work chain, and most people around the world are 2nd class citizens, unable to ever make an onchain transaction. Worse, they will be forced to receive salary with offchain custodial solutions. If capitalism is a baseball game, BCH makes sure each team is given a fair chance to play. Also the less people have to pay in fees to move money, the more types of commerce are possible.

&amp;#x200B;

* **I want to pay my taxes in BCH**, and I want to audit government agencies/banks who transact on the blockchain. If the transactions are off-chain, I can't do that. This is part of the reason we have such tremendous waste and corruption.

&amp;#x200B;

* **I like that Cash Shuffle is an application layer  tool, not baked into the core protocol code**. I think it's great that a small shopkeeper doesn't have to reveal to customers or employees how much they've made and where it is stored. However, when I pay my taxes, I don't want the government to shuffle its funds. I want to know exactly which departments control which address, and how much funds they are using.

&amp;#x200B;

* I dislike that BSV encourages file storage on-chain. If I choose to run a node, I do not want to host other people's files, and see no purpose in bundling together my payment processor with file storage. Two completely different use case that are best kept separate. Also, file storage is a huge legal liability, as well as useless hard disk expense for a feature that does not have to do with ""peer to peer electronic cash.""

&amp;#x200B;

* I like that BCH is encouraging the creation of tokens on top of it. A democratic government has a choice to receive its taxes in whatever currency it wants. If that is in BCH, so be it. But it can also be in a token with a governed monetary policy (like USD). If citizens choose to support this, I like that BCH makes it possible, while also cheap and scalable.

&amp;#x200B;

* I don't think a welfare state needs to be funded by arbitrary money printing. In the 1940s, the US government actively solicited citizens to buy war bonds, which was successful. It can also deploy bonds on the blockchain in the future, with an arbitrary token that can be used to redeem BCH plus some interest.

&amp;#x200B;

* I like Proof of Work because it is a fair system that anyone can participate in. Doesn't matter if it's a company, some guy in a garage, or a national government. As long as they can produce verifiable block headers they deserve the block reward.

Hopefully this gave you some insight, and talking points when interacting with those that are not already part of the Libertarian/Cryptocurrency/Cypherpunk community. I think most governments and people in public service are actually very interested in using cryptocurrency to make the world better, and just have heard about it being used to fund terrorists or buy drugs.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Should I refinance a year into my mortgage?,"I bought a house last year - the house was $250,000, I put down $12,500 for a total loan of $237,500. The loan rate was 4.5% on a 30 year fixed rate mortgage.

I'm now almost a year into the mortgage (it'll be a year in June) and am getting letters in the mail from my mortgage lender saying I can refinance to a lower rate, which is 3.875% also at 30 years fixed according to their letter.

I know rates have gone down since last year, so refinancing at a lower rate seems like a no-brainer, especially when mortgage calculators seem to show I'd save almost $100 a month.

That said, my understanding is that I would have to pay closing costs again, and of course my mortgage timer resets back to 30 years again.

So, is it worth it to refinance now? Should I wait and see if interest rates will keep dropping? Is it worth paying the closing costs again just to save $100 a month?

I have applied for 3 credit cards within the last year.  One with Alaska Airlines.  One with Discover and one with my local Federal Credit Union for a ""Secured Credit Card"".

worldpolitics,The United States is trying to limit the influence of Russia,"Due to historical events, Alaska, which came under US administration on October 18, 1867, and the Baltic states (Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia), becoming independent states on September 6, 1991, ceased to exist as Russian lands on the world cartography. Russia then established diplomatic relations with the Baltic countries, and during the sale of Alaska, relations between Russia and the United States were at the peak of friendly relations, and there were no grounds for political conflicts between the states. 

However, today the situation between these states is different, partly due to the unresolved Ukrainian issue. Washington is not satisfied with the activity of Moscow in the Arctic zone, which is considered as one of the main potential areas of the future military conflict due to the huge deposits of oil, gas and the favorable location of the Russian Northern Sea Route.

For example, on January 11, 2019, the US Navy Minister Richard Spencer announced his intention to strengthen the US position in the Arctic and respond to Russia's ""excessive claims"": P-8 ""Poseidon"" ships and anti-submarine patrol aircraft will be deployed in the Adak Island area to monitor the activities of the Pacific fleet of the Russian Federation. In turn, the State Duma of the Russian Federation believes that the actions of the United States are aggressive in nature and do not exclude that Americans will disregard the rules of international law. 

Moreover, Americans today are creating the necessary infrastructure for the operational redeployment of troops and in the Baltic States, against the background of the supposedly existing threat to the Baltic countries from Russia. It should be recalled that in 2017, the US Vice President Michael Pence in Tallinn said that Russia poses a threat to the Baltic States and promised that NATO will strictly adhere to the fifth article of the alliance's charter, according to which an attack on one of the NATO members is an attack on all members of the North Atlantic Alliance. Speaking about relations between the United States and Russia, Pence noted that President Donald Trump is ready to improve them, but ""first, the Russians must stop the hostile actions that led to the adoption of sanctions"". 

At the same time, Moscow has repeatedly stressed that Russia will never attack any of the NATO countries. According to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, NATO is well aware of the absence of Moscow’s plans to attack anyone, but simply uses the occasion to deploy more equipment and battalions near the Russian borders. 

For example, the Americans place their military bases and ranges in the territory of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, having even signed a joint communiqué between these countries in November 2018, where they expressed their determination to continue to increase military budgets.

But, despite the statements of the Baltic countries that their military doctrines are exclusively defensive in nature, it is obvious that the government of the US President D. Trump, sponsoring Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia in the military sphere simply invests the budget in itself, imposing three countries their ideas and crushing them under their control. And also, strengthening its position in the former territories of Russia, including Alaska, clearly demonstrates attempts to influence Russia, acting together with these states, making them puppets, continuing to fuel the confrontational line that stems from the unresolved Ukrainian issue. Therefore, we are witnessing the process of increasing the grouping of the US and NATO troops on the western borders of the Russian Federation. And it is obvious that in response to this activity of the Pentagon, Moscow will take retaliatory measures.",energy
personalfinance,Lowering my 2019 AGI to eliminate capital gains taxes,"I am single and live in a major city where I'm fortunate to own a co-op apartment that increased greatly in equity over the past 20 years, but that I can no longer afford because of the combination of my not huge income, steadily increasing maintenance, co-op loan, and a HELOC. So I'm about to sell it at a great price, and have found another nice apt. with much lower maintenance that I can buy with all cash. (My monthly housing costs will decrease by 50%, and will be a lot less than renting.) But I figured out what the federal and state capital gains taxes will be, and even after factoring in the exclusions ($250,000 singe flier exemption, initial closing costs of current apt., improvements made by the building over the past 20 years, closing costs on my sale), those taxes will eat up most of my profit. 

My AGI for $2018 was $50,000. It seems to me that I can avoid a whopping tax bill by getting my income down to the tax bracket where capital gains taxes are zero—for 2019 that's an AGI of $39,475. I’m over 50, so can contribute $7,000 from the proceeds of my sale to my IRA, lowering my AGI to $43,000. But that's still not low enough. I’m a freelancer and itemize, so already take deductions for my home office, charitable contributions, and so forth.

personalfinance,Pay off student loans or new car?,"I have enough money to pay off one. After decades of paying on the student loans (they were 8.25%-9% interest and included unsudsidized loans back in the late 80's and early 90's and I went to grad school too), I owe 30K. My original balance was about 45K and I have paid about 60K through the years. I just replaced my old minivan with a new one so I have a loan on the car for about 32K. The old one went kaput so there was not really a much for trade in. The old one was quite old. There is an issue with my student loans where it is showing a double balance. I have already done everything to straighten it out, I think. I have been assured it is being fixed and it is consolidated though the government. But needless to say, I have little faith in how things are handled with the student loans. The interest rate is just over 5%. The interest rate on the car is 1.9%.

&amp;#x200B;

These are my only two debts.  My credit rating is over 800. We have even paid off our mortgage. We are in our late 40's. I have about $38K sitting in my checking account. I know it is bad to have that much just sit there, but it is because I had been planning to pay off the student loans once the balance issue is straightened out. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know it makes more sense to pay off the student loans (over 5% interest debt) than the car (1.9% interest). But there are two advantages to paying off the car instead. 1) I worry I will pay off the student loans and have paperwork issues again and 2) if we lose our jobs or die or end up disabled, the student loans can be deferred or cancelled. The car loan cannot. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel dumb paying off the car first, especially since they offered me an additional $750 off if I did not finance, but I did. But it is sort of appearing it might be safer to pay the car off and then concern myself with the student loans when the balance issue is fixed (it is showing the loan twice, but under two loan numbers so as if I owe on two sets of loans, I have been assured the one extra loan will be cancelled, but already worry the payments I have sent in have been applied wrong. They have put them on an administrative hold in the meantime).

The problem is I am completely emotionally burned out with my job dealing with other people's problems and a high stress environment for so long. Right now I work an average of 8 hour days, but some 12s too if we are short staffed. Been there for 4 years and also can't advance past where I am now, as I am the highest position in my department as a manager. The next highest up is the Executive Director. This job only offers insurance for me, not my family. They are not able to give me a raise, I have already asked.

&amp;#x200B;

I have applied to 16 or 17 other jobs and the only one that was interested in my was a local trucking company. The owner said that if I can get my CDL permit, they will set up an obstacle course there and I can practice with their driving manager. This job is a home every day local semi driving job where you pick up sand and take it to a railyard one city over. $40 per load, and the goal is to get 5 loads per day. Some days will only be 4 loads if it is slow, rare days you can get 6 loads depending on which quarry you are assigned to. Winter time will make this harder.  Every day is 10-12 hour shifts, and you work Monday through Friday with optional Saturdays depending on who wants it first but PTO doesn't start until after you work a year, then it is 5 days off. If I can do 5 loads per day then my salary would be significantly more then what I make now. If I can only get 4 though then the salary will be roughly the same as what I get now, just more hours worked. I did a ride along today before work with the driving manager for one load and it seemed low stress and kind of peaceful. This job offers family health insurance.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now I am the sole provider for my family, and I recently have a larger family, as I am newly married and have an adopted daughter. My wife right not is not able to work for several months due to being a new immigrant until work release passes. Money is pretty tight right now but we always have enough, while being able to save a little bit of each paycheck into savings. 

&amp;#x200B;

Being home is very important due to my new family.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you think this is wise decision to pursue this career option or is it too risky?

Everything was going okay, sort of, but I was dissatisfied my child's school, and generally dissatisfied with my professional/intellectual life.

A few months ago, I decided to change from barista to full FI/RE. I did this for several reasons:

* to move to an area with better schools for my daughter
* to develop my career and use my brain a bit more
* just generally for an adventure

Questions:

1. Roast me. Anyone see any problems with the above plan? What am I forgetting? What are the possible points of failure?

Forex,Turkey is misrepresenting its current reserves by as much as 100%,"***Do NOT read this and then go 'all in' at 500:1 leverage.  The usdtry is an insanely volatile pair.  Be extra careful, but there are huge riches to be made from this (also be very careful of the swaps, they are massive for longs).  This will spread like fire soon***

&amp;#x200B;

Three weeks ago, when Turkey was scrambling to defend the lira ahead of local municipal elections, a potentially destabilizing event which saw significant selling of the currency (and which ended up badly for Erdogan's ruling AKP party, which lost control of the two most important cities, Ankara and Istanbul),  ""*the Turkish central bank had burnt through at least a third of its foreign reserves in March in an effort to stem a plunge in the lira"",* in a repeat of the crisis that engulfed the lira last summer and triggered a blast of inflation and the first recession in a decade, and was ""putting the country on path to a full-blown currency and funding crisis.""

And despite what was a clear, continued central bank defense of the Turkish lira since then, Turkey's official reserves actually appeared to rise, in what was meant to telegraph confidence in the currency and give the impression that the lira was stable without continued central bank support.

**There was just one problem: the central bank appears to have been if not lying, then grossly misrepresenting the true state of the country's foreign reserves .**

As it turns out, Turkey has been pulling a financial trick popularized by China's PBOC for the past several years, and [according to the FT](https://www.ft.com/content/9718e75e-611d-11e9-b285-3acd5d43599e?emailId=5cb7599d8b95a100044f8b6c&amp;segmentId=ce31c7f5-c2de-09db-abdc-f2fd624da608), **the country's central bank was propping up its foreign currency reserves with billions of dollars of short-term borrowed money,** ""raising fears among analysts and investors that the country is overstating its ability to defend itself in a fresh lira crisis.""

After tumbling from a recent high of $34 billion to $25 billion at the end of March, Turkey reported that the net foreign reserves held by the central bank stood at $28.1 billion in early April — a sum which the FT notes was already believed to be inadequate because of Turkey’s heavy need for dollars to cover debt and foreign trade. But what the Financial Times uncovered is that this total was ""enhanced"" by a surge in the use of swaps, or short-term borrowings, since March 25. **Stripping those swaps out, the total is an alarmingly low $16 billion, an amount which could be depleted in just months, if not weeks,** especially if the news of the CB's plunging reserves creates a self-fulfilling prophecy in which lira holders rush to convert their currency before the central banks runs out of dollars.

Confirming the FT's analysis, a former senior official at Turkey’s central bank, who did not wish to be named (as it would mean an instant prison sentence by the country's ""executive president""), said the extra dollars had been borrowed, not earned. **""This is not an orthodox \[approach to\] central bank reserve build-up.""**

To be sure, the Turkish currency market has been a shitshow for the past month: at the end of March, just days ahead of the elections, Turkey pulled another popular Chinese trick, when in an attempt to crush speculators and lira shorts, it briefly pushed up its overnight swap rates to 1350%, a level which resulted in swift condemnation from the international finance community which was furious at the ridiculous tricks pulled by the Erdogan government, as it instantly locked up the local financial system making international currency transfers impossible.

Then, once the central bank realized it couldn't keep swap rates at stratospheric levels for long, it decided to change its approach, and opted to lie about its reserve situation instead. So, starting roughly around the time the overnight swap rate collapsed back to normal on March 28 the central bank’s use of swaps exploded, rising from virtually nothing to as much as $13bn by April 8, and a sharp increase from January 1 — March 25, when borrowing never exceeded $500m, according to the central bank’s own figures. And as one would expect, when adding the impact of the swaps, the bank’s reserve figures started to climb again... but as shown in the top chart, the real number excluding the borrowings, was far lower.

What exactly are these swaps? Stated simply, this is money that Turkey borrowed from the country's commercial banks, which just so happens, are flush with dollars after individuals and companies flocked to hard currency as a haven.

For those following the fund flows, this circular arrangement was a delightfully Machiavellian construct by Erdogan: first, as a result of its collapsing reserves, the central bank prompted fears among the local population that its funding situation was unsustainable, forcing a surge in lira to dollar conversions among the local population (and foreign speculators). However, since the dollars that were received following the conversion were parked with the local banks, the central bank had easy access to use them - in the form of swaps - and as it received more dollars from the commercial banks, it not only could defend the lira further, using the people's money against them, but also misrepresent the true level of its net foreign reserves!

To be sure, if and when this check kiting scheme was exposed, it would lead to even greater panic as a second wave of lira selling would ensue, as not only was the true level of reserves lower, but the central bank was in effect leveraging commercial banks' own dollar holdings in its defense of the currency. In doing so, if and when this valiant defense - which most likely will culminate with another IMF bailout - fails, then the commercial banks would go down too, as bank clients, realizing all their dollar deposits had been quietly carted over to the central bank, would be, how should we say it... furious.

This also explains why, as the FT further note, ""five other investors and analysts who have closely studied the bank’s activities in recent weeks spoke on condition of anonymity to the FT about their concerns over the reserves. **Several of them were fearful of speaking out on the issue after Turkish regulators launched probes into JPMorgan last month over its advice to clients to sell the lira**.""

&gt;*Investors said they were worried about this practice of using one-week currency swaps, in which liras are exchanged for US dollars with local banks with an agreement to later reverse the transaction. They believe that this borrowing has flattered the central bank’s reserves data.*  
*Some investors argue that the borrowed money should be stripped out of net foreign reserve data, leaving a remaining sum that is well below $20bn.*

Responding to the FT, the central bank reluctantly confirmed that dollars borrowed in the first part of these transactions are added to the balance sheet. The obligation to later repay the dollars is recorded as an “off balance sheet item"", which is precisely why Turkey is doing this entire scheme to make its reserves appear far greater than they are in reality.

Naturally, the use of such reserve-masking swaps ""sharpened fears that began to gather last month that the bank was burning through its hard currency to hold the lira steady in the run-up to local elections on March 31. The central bank declined to comment on whether it has intervened in this way.""

The impact of the swaps transactions is most vividly illustrated in the central bank’s daily balance sheet, which contains figures for foreign assets and liabilities that have been intensely scrutinised by analysts in recent weeks. Another way of representing the chart up top, net foreign assets — calculated by subtracting the bank’s foreign liabilities from its assets and converting into dollars — have risen and fallen in parallel with the amount borrowed through swaps. **The net foreign assets figure — a proxy for how much assets Turkey has to continue defending the onslaught of lira sellers — slumped by $9.4bn between March 6 and March 22 to $19.5bn, the lowest level on a US dollar basis since 2007**.

Where things get interesting is what happened next: by April 5, the net reserve figure had swelled to $23.6BN, boosted by an increase in swaps. However, excluding swaps, **net foreign assets have stood at less than $11.5bn during the entire month of April, down from $28.7bn at the start of March on the same basis**.

In other words, **Turkey is officially misrepresenting its current reserves by as much as 100%** just to give the impression that it can continue defending the lira, *when in reality is it using the very same dollars - swapped out from commercial banks - that the local population had converted into dollars as part of their flight away from the lira.*

The condemnation from the analyst community was brutal: Piotr Matys, an emerging market currency strategist at Rabobank, said the use of swaps seemed to be “**some sort of window dressing**” to create the impression of higher reserves.

Furthermore, it is very likely that Turkey has been using these very swaps to support the lira. The central bank did not directly respond to an FT question about the use of funds, nor to a question about whether it used measures to prop up the currency since March 31 elections. However, it did say ""a variety of factors could account for the shifting total.""

With little left in its defense, the central bank has demanded that analysts are wrong to focus on a net international reserves figure that is published once a week, and instead stressed that international reserve adequacy measures used the gross figure to test a country’s preparedness. And while Turkey’s gross foreign reserves stood at around $77BN in the first week of April, that number too is irrelevant considering the elephant in the room which we discussed last summer: **Turkey has $177bn in short-term external debt coming due in the next 12 months**; it has nowhere near the funds to repay it, virtually assuring some form of default and IMF bailout is inevitable.

""There’s a general unease about what’s going on behind the scenes,” said Tim Ash, an emerging markets strategist at BlueBay Asset Management. A lack of transparency was undermining the bank’s already fragile credibility, he warned.

**“The bottom line is that they don’t have enough, whether it’s net or gross,”** Ash added. **""Everyone in the market knows that Turkey doesn’t have enough foreign currency reserves to mount a sustained and credible defence of the lira.""**

The only question is when will the price of the lira, which at the current level of 5.75 vs the dollar is wildly overvalued, start reflecting Turkey's dismal situation.  **Bye Bye Erdocunt ;)**",finance
personalfinance,"Will soon be able to pay off credit card debt with lump sum, not sure how to best approach","Super quick background: I made a number of budgeting mistakes as well as general strategic life mistakes that led me to accumulate a lot of credit card debt during college really quickly (parents stopped giving me money but I kept going on trips, keeping up appearances, bought a dog, etc.). I got a handle on things around three years ago and have been steadily paying off debt since then. I've gone from around $28k owed to around $17k (around half of that is currently at 0% interest) using the avalanche method and being as frugal as possible. My dad has agreed to lend me the money to pay off the rest and I can pay him back over time with no interest. That obviously is great, but I'm wondering as to how I should approach this.

Should I ask for a discount for a lump sum payment? From what I've read online, they usually only do that for accounts that are delinquent. I've always paid at least the minimum, and usually 2-5x the minimum on both of my credit cards. Would they even consider a discount for a lump sum payment for someone with my history? I feel like I'm an ideal customer for them so I have leverage in that regard, but it might not be credible for me to threaten to close my account and leave since I've been meeting my obligations for three years and a substantial chunk of what I still owe is already at 0% interest.

My guess is that lump sum settlement isn't something available to people in my situation, but probably asking for an APR reduction is. If so, should I do that before paying off the debt, or after? I would have more leverage before, but appear safer after, does that sound about right? Maybe I should just pay everything and wait for credit score to recover and 6ish months later ask for a reduced interest rate?",finance

oil,If oil does not grow - Russia will become second Venezuela,"It's not a secret that the entire Russian economy depends primarily on the export of oil and gas. Moreover, in a certain way, it also largely depends on oil, because the price of natural gas is tied to its price. 

https://i.redd.it/dx7gkftffzs21.jpg

Meanwhile, from the officials of the Russian Federation, more and more comments are heard that Russia should not be afraid of falling oil prices.

That is, government officials are trying to convince investors that a country completely dependent on hydrocarbons was able to get rid of this dependence.

Looking ahead, we answer - no, but then in order.

&amp;#x200B;

The another day, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov, while on a visit to Washington, said that if OPEC countries and Russia did not agree to extend the transaction to reduce oil production, and black gold again begins to fall in price, you should not worry, because Russia has enough reserves not to feel the serious impact of the next crisis.

https://i.redd.it/cy87mamhfzs21.jpg

It makes sense to clarify that Russia is less satisfied with the agreements reached with OPEC to reduce production. Firstly, due to the fact that the vacated market niches are filled with slate from the USA, which is not regulated by any agreements. And secondly, by reducing production, the Russian Federation threatens those fields that it has to conserve because many of them were developed during the Soviet era, and when their production ceases, in fact, the self-destruction mechanism of the well starts.

&amp;#x200B;

Earlier, the head of the Bank of Russia Elvira Nabiullina said that even with the price of oil at $ 35 per barrel, the Russian Federation had nothing to fear. Then she supported her words with the fact of the growing gold and foreign exchange reserves of the Russian Federation.

&amp;#x200B;

But the current level of the gold and foreign currency reserves of the Russian Federation, taking into account the troubled assets of Russian banks, did not rise at all, but rather remained at the level (and even lower) of April 2015.

&amp;#x200B;

One more thing is important - the unprofitability of production at many Russian fields, which were developed, as noted above, in the era of the USSR. Their development was carried out taking into account other, extremely inefficient and costly technologies today, and with a completely different price framework. Roughly speaking, the network of Russian drilling is not a monotonous, but rather a motley picture of representatives of ‘the Stone and the Iron Ages’, with elements of modern technology.

&amp;#x200B;

If you look at the rating of oil prices, then we are on an uptrend, which the maximum in a month should turn into a strong fall to reach the peak price. An additional reason for the strong decline in the price of black gold could be the global economic crisis, which most experts predict. And there is an opinion that Russia, as a country whose budget depends on the prices of sulfur-hydrogens (as if its officials did not assure us of the opposite), may not survive it. It is likely that we will observe a complete paralysis of the economy, as in Venezuela.

personalfinance,Open CD to offset loan?,"Good morning PF!

&amp;#x200B;

Last month wifey and I bought a car for her.  $25.5k out the door, put 10.5k down in cash, borrowed 15k @3.54% (5yr loan).  I could have paid it all in cash, but didn't want to dip THAT far into savings.  Navy Federal offers a 40-month CD at 3.75% APY (3.68 dividend).  I'm considering putting the 15k into that CD to offset any interest I'd pay on the car loan, plus make a dollar or two, then maybe just pay off the loan when the CD matures.  Thoughts?",finance

So, basically I’m paying them $156 for the loan. I am trying to figure out what the interest rate is even tho they “Don’t do interest rates”.

I’m using the loan to pay down a credit card that has an insane interest rate 26%. I want to know if I keep doing this and eventually paying off that card, if its better than paying my crazy minimum payment/fee’s.

personalfinance,Where should I put 100k for 12-18 months?,"I have ~$100k cash sitting in a savings account collecting some pitiful amount of interest.  In ~18 months, I plan to use this money to buy a fixed upper. In the meantime I'd like to maximize return on said money with minimal risk.  From the research I've conducted, some options are:

CD - 12 month CDs are ~2.7%... money is locked up but that's fine as I definitely won't need it for a year

High yield savings account - ~2.25%... more liquid, but again, irrelevant in this case

Municipal bond [fund] - I gather these are exempt from federal income tax as well as state income tax, which is not inconsequential here in CA ~9%.  Something like Vanguard VCLAX at ~2.4%.  I don't fully understand the potential risk or fluctuations in return here.

S&amp;P index fund - possibly better return but over 12 months seems equally likely I'll lose some, and I'd rather not worry about that

&amp;#x200B;

I work at Anon Tech Company \[ATC\], a company that had an IPO in the last year. I was there pre-ipo and hold a large amount of options. Annual base income is 182k, but I haven't earned at this level for very long. I live in a silly expensive area. Rent is 3500 / month for an apartment that most people would laugh at.

&amp;#x200B;

I currently hold 70k of Amazon RSU's that I've vested and sold-to-cover on vest day. My only tax obligation on those shares will be capital gains. I also hold Anon Tech Company \[ATC\] options with a value of 98k if I exercised all of them at my strike price with a total potential value of 250k (including un-vested) at today's stock price. I would have to pay income tax on those because I don't want to buy the shares and hold onto them for a year. I'm not comfortable with that risk. My oh-shit cash fund is around 30k, don't want to touch that, maxing out my 401k, no CC debt, have other smaller / higher risk investments.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure which shares to sell in order to pay off my 30k high interest loans. I guess is comes down to my faith in ATC? There's something appealing to not touching the Amazon stock since it's almost tripled in value since I got it, and with ATC being new on the market with a more uncertain future, mixed with the fact that I hold more of it, makes me thing I should exercise ATC. On the other hand, the potential upside for 1 option of ATC going up in price is higher than 1 share of AMZN.

personalfinance,"120k in student debt/marriage Finances, how to stay on track?","# Basic financial info 

&amp;#x200B;

\- 30 years old 

\- I have 120k in student loan debt (art school). The loans are ALL private, cause fuck me.  

\- Loan payments are 1500 a month. 

\- I'm at about 50k a year, but I contract for a company based out of Canada and pay quarterly taxes. 

\- No LLC right now, pay about 2.5k in taxes a quarter. Got a 4k return this year. My state has no income tax. 

\- I plan to get married next spring, My partner is employed with a w-2 here in the us. For now all of this info is completely independent of him as we split things mostly even and manage our finances separately.  

&amp;#x200B;

Over the last 5 years, I've gone from being destitute in working retail and into a relatively stable career in tech support. I used to have terrible credit from not paying my loans for a brief period in the retail days (1500 was more than my bank account held, twice over!) . I've repaired my credit, at 700 and looking to get into that 750 range soon. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have no credit card debt, I put slightly larger purchases on my credit card, like plane tickets, and then pay it off in a month or two. I try not to buy anything that I couldn't immediately pay off, if I had to. My student loans make me sick enough. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am growing my savings slowly and steadily by increasing the amount I put aside, at first I was putting my taxes aside, and now I'm consciously growing my savings. My Savings fluctuate be because every quarter I pay taxes, but I have about 5k in cushion. I think I'd like that to be 10k, then I would focus on my loan, then retirement. 

&amp;#x200B;

Between loans, car payments, and buying my own health care, I think I budget well these days and spend pretty well in my means. If I seriously sacrificed my basic living comforts, I could probably scrape up another 500 a month.

&amp;#x200B;

# Problems. 

&amp;#x200B;

**- Out of the 4 loans I have, one is  $16,600 at an interest rate of 13.000.** 

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously, this loan is shit and I want to pay it down faster. The reason I want the larger emergency fund is because , though my partner is getting paid a bit more, he also is in an industry rife with layoffs that can come at any moment. He has some of his own savings, and I wonder if I should give up this paranoia and focus on the loan.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm running out of time in the day to work, my secondary skill (the art thing) pays pretty weakly for the effort a single work takes to produce, and I'm killing my wrist. Still, I cant think of much else to do at this point other than earn more? It seems like a poor idea to consolidate through sofi or something like that, at least until either my credit is at 750 and I can get a better rate, or I just pay off this one stupid loan and only have the other three, 6.7% interest loans left. I feel like I might have that backwards, though?

&amp;#x200B;

**- Getting married**

&amp;#x200B;

My parents are going to help to keep the costs low. I'll probably be throwing 2k at it personally. After that, I'd like to not get blindsided by my taxes. What resources should I look at for being self-employed, having a partner with a w-2, and what to expect? 

&amp;#x200B;

I calculate my quarterly taxes through the self-employed turbo tax, to help me itemize expenses. My partner also went to art school, and occasionally freelances but usually through companies and gets a 1099. Will anything significant change about how we want to tackle this when we are filing together? Should I start seeing a tax guy, or can we continue to navigate this through turbo tax? 

&amp;#x200B;

\- **House Buying**

&amp;#x200B;

This is a major goal for me, but seems just impossible with my loans. We are doing pretty good on rent, splitting 1200 a month, but I need a home office, and would love a studio and a garden. It like to just own instead of pushing my rent to 2000 a month for an extra room. Should I just shelve this dream till I'm 35?

&amp;#x200B;

**TL:DR**

**-** Is 16k of student loan debt too much to sacrifice saving to focus on, even with a 13% interest rate?

\- Is tying the knot going to fuck up my taxes since I'm self employed?

\- Will I die before I can afford a house because I went to art school?

I haven't used the cards in a year, I only bought parts for my car with them but then it was totaled in a flood so that hobby has been put on hold until I can actually afford it, I realized I was being stupid with credit cards.



So that's my current budget. If there is anything left over it goes into savings/emergency budget. I want to contribute more to retirement accounts but I figure at least the credit debt should be taken care of first.

personalfinance,looking to move out of my parent's home soon- does rent affect auto loan payment?,"## 

📷

So I'm looking to move out of home soon, and I am currently earning $4200 a month from my current job. In addition, I have a car payment of $440/month. I found an apartment for which I would be paying $950 a month, all inclusive(rent, utilities, etc). The thing is, for the car I bought, they charged a higher interest rate than normal, because my credit score isn't as high as they want for much lower interest rates, and once it improves(which I am in the process of working towards), they will refinance my car, we're looking at a timeline of 6 months from now. My question is, does adding rent payment into the equation reduce the likelihood of refinancing and therefore lowering my car payments in the long run? In other words, does it make more sense to stay at home for a few more months until I am able to pay off more of my car loan, and then move out? I don't want to be in a situation where the loaner says ""ohh you're now paying rent, so we have less confidence that you will make care payments in time"".",finance
personalfinance,"Sister refinanced her student loans, why do I not qualify to as well?","I humbly request that nobody advise me to ""move back in with my parents"" or ""move to another state"" because that is not going to help me lower my monthly payments and that is the root of my current issue.

&amp;#x200B;

The long version:

&amp;#x200B;

When my private student loans from Wells Fargo went into repayment, I got blindsided with a shocking $1,200 minimum. I am now two years in to paying this balance which has been slowly increasing every 3 months to ""keep me on track"". I have shelled out $26,000 at this point, with the total of my loans only decreasing $6,000.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, my principal balance is sitting at just over $100,000. My credit has been sitting below 700 for a while due to my family using my credit card for their own use and leaving me to pay it down + interest. So it hurt to carry that full balance for such a long time. So on top of the monthly loan payments, I have also whittled down the $5,000 credit card debt to $1,300 right now. I have opened new credit cards to help lower the % usage in my credit reports and it has helped top me out at around 728.

&amp;#x200B;

Back when my repayments first began, I met with Wells employees to figure out how I could do this and not die, and the only thing they offered me was to refinance but I would need a cosigner with a score over 800. I... don't know anyone with that- at least not that would agree to cosign on my 6-figure debt. Each loan is different but interest rates range from 9.5% to 12.4% or something. When speaking with credit unions, they tell me that they cannot do amounts greater than $35,000 and that even then, the interest rates would not be any better than what I am currently getting.

&amp;#x200B;

My sister who is a year younger than I am, has only one credit card which she seems to always carry a balance on, and had more than I did in student loan debt was able to apply for refinancing through SoFi and was approved and is now paying a couple hundred less per month. I tried the same, and continue to be rejected. I literally do not know what to do or what could be so different about our situations. I asked her credit score and it is comparable to my own. She is a flight attendant, so she isn't pulling in more money than I am at my supervisor role in an office. I would think I have longer credit history, and definitely have a higher number of credit accounts in good standing. What in the world could I or SHOULD I be doing differently so that I can finally qualify for a refinance?

&amp;#x200B;

The whole purpose is to lower the monthly minimums so that I can continue making my same payments at $1200 and be able to chip away at the principal balance faster. It just absolutely kills me inside to throw $1200 at this every month and only lower my balance by $300 each time.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR

I pay $1200 a month minimum on my now $100,000 private student loans from Wells Fargo. My credit score is 728 with no hopes of greatly increasing unless someone has a secret to tell me. My younger sister with similar credit score, and higher amount of student debt was approved to refinance, and I continue to be rejected and cannot understand why.",finance
MachineLearning,[Discussion] When ML and Data Science are the death of a good company: A cautionary tale.,"TD;LR: At Company A, Team X does advanced analytics using on-prem ERP tools and older programming languages. Their tools work very well and are designed based on very deep business and domain expertise. Team Y is a new and ambitious Data Science team that thinks they can replace Team X's tools with a bunch of R scripts and a custom built ML platform. Their models are simplistic, but more ""fashionable"" compared to the econometric models used by Team X, and team Y benefits from the ML/DS moniker so leadership is allowing Team Y to start a large scale overhaul of the analytics platform in question. Team Y doesn't have the experience for such a larger scale transformation, and is refusing to collaborate with team X. This project is very likely going to fail, and cause serious harm to the company as a whole financially and from a people perspective. I argue that this is not just because of bad leadership, but also because of various trends and mindsets in the DS community at large. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update (Jump to below the line for the original story): 

Several people in the comments are pointing out that this just a management failure, not something due to ML/DS, and that you can replace DS with any buzz tech and the story will still be relevant. 

My response: 
Of course, any failure at an organization level is ultimately a management failure one way or the other. 
Moreover, it is also the case that ML/DS when done correctly, will always improve a company's bottom line. There is no scenario where the proper ML solution, delivered at a reasonable cost and in a timely fashion, will somehow hurt the company's bottom line.

My point is that in this case management is failing because of certain trends and practices that are specific to the ML/DS community, namely: 
* The idea that DS teams should operate independently of tech and business orgs -- too much autonomy for DS teams 
* The disregard for domain knowledge that seems prevalent nowadays  thanks to the ML hype, that DS can be generalists and someone with good enough ML chops can solve any business problem.  That wasn't the case when I first left academia for the industry in 2009  (back then nobody would even bother with a phone screen if you didn't have the right domain knowledge). 
* Over reliance on resources who check all the ML hype related boxes (knows Python, R, Tensorflow, Shiny, etc..., has the right Coursera certifications, has blogged on the topic, etc...), but are lacking in depth of  experience. DS interviews nowadays all seem to be: Can you tell me what a p-value is? What is elastic net regression? Show me how to fit a model in sklearn? How do you impute NAs in an R dataframe? Any smart person can look those up on Stackoverflow or Cross-Validated,.....Instead teams should be asking stuff like: why does portfolio optimization use QP not LP? How does a forecast influence a customer service level? When should a recommendation engine be content based and when should it use collaborative filtering? etc...

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*(This is a true story, happening to the company I currently work for. Names, domains, algorithms, and roles have been shuffled around to protect my anonymity)* 

Company A has been around for several decades. It is not the biggest name in its domain, but it is a well respected one. Risk analysis and portfolio optimization have been a core of Company A's business since the 90s. They have a large team of 30 or so analysts who perform those tasks on a daily basis. These analysts use ERP solutions implemented for them by one the big ERP companies (SAP, Teradata, Oracle, JD Edwards,...) or one of the major tech consulting companies (Deloitte, Accenture, PWC, Capgemini, etc...) in collaboration with their own in house engineering team. The tools used are embarrassingly old school: Classic RDBMS running on on-prem servers or maybe even on mainframes, code written in COBOL, Fortran, weird proprietary stuff like ABAP or SPSS.....you get the picture. But the models and analytic functions were pretty sophisticated, and surprisingly cutting edge compared to the published academic literature. Most of all, they fit well with the company's enterprise ecosystem, and were honed based on years of deep domain knowledge. 

They have a tech team of several engineers (poached from the aforementioned software and consulting companies) and product managers (who came from the experienced pools of analysts and managers who use the software, or poached from business rivals) maintaining and running this software. Their technology might be old school, but collectively, they know the domain and the company's overall architecture very, very well. They've guided the company through several large scale upgrades and migrations and they have a track record of delivering on time, without too much overhead. The few times they've stumbled, they knew how to pick themselves up very quickly. In fact within their industry niche, they have a reputation for their expertise, and have very good relations with the various vendors they've had to deal with. They were the launching pad of several successful ERP consulting careers. 

Interestingly, despite dealing on a daily basis with statistical modeling and optimization algorithms, none of the analysts, engineers, or product managers involved describe themselves as data scientists or machine learning experts. It is mostly a cultural thing: Their expertise predates the Data Science/ML hype that started circa 2010, and they got most of their chops using proprietary enterprise tools instead of the open source tools popular nowadays. A few of them have formal statistical training, but most of them came from engineering or domain backgrounds and learned stats on the fly while doing their job. Call this team ""Team X"". 

Sometime around the mid 2010s, Company A started having some serious anxiety issues: Although still doing very well for a company its size, overall economic and demographic trends were shrinking its customer base, and a couple of so called disruptors came up with a new app and business model that started seriously eating into their revenue. A suitable reaction to appease shareholders and Wall Street was necessary. The company already had a decent website and a pretty snazzy app, what more could be done? Leadership decided that it was high time that AI and ML become a core part of the company's business. An ambitious Manager, with no science or engineering background, but who had very briefly toyed with a recommender system a couple of years back, was chosen to build a data science team, call it team ""Y"" (he had a bachelor's in history from the local state college and worked for several years in the company's marketing org). Team ""Y"" consists mostly of internal hires who decided they wanted to be data scientists and completed a Coursera certification or a Galvanize boot camp, before being brought on to the team, along with a few of fresh Ph.D or M.Sc holders who didn't like academia and wanted to try their hand at an industry role. All of them were very bright people, they could write great Medium blog posts and give inspiring TED talks, but collectively they had very little real world industry experience. 

As is the fashion nowadays, this group was made part of a data science org that reported directly to the CEO and Board, bypassing the CIO and any tech or business VPs, since Company A wanted to claim the monikers ""data driven"" and ""AI powered"" in their upcoming shareholder meetings. In 3 or 4 years of existence, team Y produced a few Python and R scripts. Their architectural experience  consisted almost entirely in connecting Flask to S3 buckets or Redshift tables, with a couple of the more resourceful ones learning how to plug their models into Tableau or how to spin up a Kuberneties pod.  But they needn't worry: The aforementioned manager, who was now a director (and was also doing an online Masters to make up for his qualifications gap and bolster his chances of becoming VP soon - at least he now understands what L1 regularization is), was a master at playing corporate politics and self-promotion. No matter how few actionable insights team Y produced or how little code they deployed to production, he always had their back and made sure they had ample funding. In fact he now had grandiose plans for setting up an all-purpose machine learning platform that can be used to solve all of the company's data problems. 

A couple of sharp minded members of team Y, upon googling their industry name along with the word ""data science"", realized that risk analysis was a prime candidate for being solved with Bayesian models, and there was already a nifty R package for doing just that, whose tutorial they went through on R-Bloggers.com. One of them had even submitted a Bayesian classifier Kernel for a competition on Kaggle (he was 203rd on the leaderboard), and was eager to put his new-found expertise to use on a real world problem. They pitched the idea to their director, who saw a perfect use case for his upcoming ML platform. They started work on it immediately, without bothering to check whether anybody at Company A was already doing risk analysis. Since their org was independent, they didn't really need to check with anybody else before they got funding for their initiative. Although it was basically a Naive Bayes classifier, the term ML was added to the project tile, to impress the board. 

As they progressed with their work however, tensions started to build. They had asked the data warehousing and CA analytics teams to build pipelines for them, and word eventually got out to team X about their project. Team X was initially thrilled: They offered to collaborate whole heartedly, and would have loved to add an ML based feather to their already impressive cap. The product owners and analysts were totally onboard as well: They saw a chance to get in on the whole Data Science hype that they kept hearing about. But through some weird mix of arrogance and insecurity, team Y refused to collaborate with them or share any of their long term goals with them, even as they went to other parts of the company giving brown bag presentations and tutorials on the new model they created. 

Team X got resentful: from what they saw of team Y's model, their approach was hopelessly naive and had little chances of scaling or being sustainable in production, and they knew exactly how to help with that. Deploying the model to production would have taken them a few days, given how comfortable they were with DevOps and continuous delivery (team Y had taken several months to figure out how to deploy a simple R script to production). And despite how old school their own tech was, team X were crafty enough to be able to plug it in to their existing architecture. Moreover, the output of the model was such that it didn't take into account how the business will consume it or how it was going to be fed to downstream systems, and the product owners could have gone a long way in making the model more amenable to adoption by the business stakeholders. But team Y wouldn't listen, and their leads brushed off any attempts at communication, let alone collaboration. The vibe that team Y was giving off was ""We are the cutting edge ML team, you guys are the legacy server grunts. We don't need your opinion."", and they seemed to have a complete disregard for domain knowledge, or worse, they thought that all that domain knowledge consisted of was being able to grasp the definitions of a few business metrics. 

Team X got frustrated and tried to express their concerns to leadership. But despite owning a vital link in Company A's business process, they were only \~50 people in a large 1000 strong technology and operations org, and they were several layers removed from the C-suite, so it was impossible for them to get their voices heard. 

Meanwhile, the unstoppable director was doing what he did best: Playing corporate politics. Despite how little his team had actually delivered, he had convinced the board that all analysis and optimization tasks should now be migrated to his yet to be delivered ML platform. Since most leaders now knew that there was overlap between team Y and team X's objectives, his pitch was no longer that team Y was going to create a new insight, but that they were going to replace (or modernize) the legacy statistics based on-prem tools with more accurate cloud based ML tools. Never mind that there was no support in the academic literature for the idea that Naive Bayes works better than the Econometric approaches used by team X, let alone the additional wacky idea that Bayesian Optimization would definitely outperform the QP solvers that were running in production. 

Unbeknownst to team X, the original Bayesian risk analysis project has now grown into a multimillion dollar major overhaul initiative, which included the eventual replacement of all of the tools and functions supported by team X along with the necessary migration to the cloud. The CIO and a couple of business VPs are on now board, and tech leadership is treating it as a done deal.

An outside vendor, a startup who nobody had heard of, was contracted to help build the platform, since team Y has no engineering skills. The choice was deliberate, as calling on any of the established consulting or software companies would have eventually led leadership to the conclusion that team X was better suited for a transformation on this scale than team Y. 

Team Y has no experience with any major ERP deployments, and no domain knowledge, yet they are being tasked with fundamentally changing the business process that is at the core of Company A's business. Their models actually perform worse than those deployed by team X, and their architecture is hopelessly simplistic, compared to what is necessary for running such a solution in production. 

Ironically, using Bayesian thinking and based on all the evidence, the likelihood that team Y succeeds is close to 0%. 

At best, the project is going to end up being a write off of 50 million dollars or more. Once the !@#$!@# hits the fan, a couple of executive heads are going to role, and dozens of people will get laid off.

At worst, given how vital risk analysis and portfolio optimization is to Company A's revenue stream, the failure will eventually sink the whole company. It probably won't go bankrupt, but it will lose a significant portion of its business and work force. Failed ERP implementations can and do sink large companies: Just see what happened to National Grid US, SuperValu or Target Canada. 

One might argue that this is more about corporate disfunction and bad leadership than about data science and AI. 

But I disagree. I think the core driver of this debacle is indeed the blind faith in Data Scientists, ML models and the promise of AI, and the overall culture of hype and self promotion that is very common among the ML crowd. 

We haven't seen the end of this story: I sincerely hope that this ends well for the sake of my colleagues and all involved. Company A is a good company, and both its customers and its employees deserver better. But the chances of that happening are negligible given all the information available, and this failure will hit my company hard.",technology

personalfinance,State tax return went wrong,"Disclaimer: English is not my first language, so I apologize in advance if I make any mistakes, also, this is my first post on Reddit :)

My friend and I filed our taxes 3 weeks ago and both of our tax returns were approved. I received my federal tax return via direct deposit and for some reason my state tax return was sent to me as a check. Whereas my friend made a mistake in his bank account info so his state return was sent to him as check as well as mine, but there is another problem, his federal tax return is nowhere to be found at the moment. Right now we’re not in the US so there’s really not much we can do. 

There are a few questions I wanted to ask:
1) Why did I receive a paper check instead of direct deposit? I’m sure my bank account information is right as I received my federal return with no problem. 
2) What can my friend do to find out where his federal return is?
3) Is there anything we can do to get direct deposits for our state returns instead of paper checks? Mailing them to us is not an option unfortunately.",finance

personalfinance,$50k in Credit Card debt (25%+) to Bestegg?,"Hi, I'm very close to moving my current credit card debt of around $50k to Bestegg to basically consolidate my credit cards and lower my interest rate (probably on average of 20-30%). Thankfully, this was due to a one time thing and not a lifestyle thing, and my credit score before was pretty good, so with Bestegg I got an offer for 9% APR. Monthly payments would be roughly the same with no prepayment penalties. I've had most of this debt in 0% credit card offers, but that time is now up.

personalfinance,Tax withholding on 100% 401k contribution,"I was expecting to receive a bonus check during my next pay cycle, and decided to contribute 100% to my 401k, so as to maximize the tax savings from my bonus.

However, Schwab let me enter ""100%"" as my contribution rate, so I thought it was fine.

personalfinance,My mortgage has disappeared from my credit report but I'm still paying for it. Need help refinancing.,"Writing on behalf of my friend, but I'm going to use first person pronouns:

Back in 2003 my wife had a medical issue that resulted $100k of medical bills. We filed for bankruptcy in 2005 but did not file on the house. We continued to make payments on the home. The mortgage was through a bank I will call “Stagecoach”. We continued to receive monthly statements from Stagecoach regarding the payments and are currently 15 years into a 30 year mortgage and have not missed a payment since the bankruptcy had been file in 2005. My credit score has recovered and is hovering just below 800 (Equifax).

My local bank is a Federal Credit Union, I’ll call it the “River” bank. I’ve banked with them for 30+ years during which time I’ve not had any issues. I’ve had several vehicle loans (before, after, and even during the bankruptcy) and opened my childrens’ first accounts there too. About a month ago, my wife and I decided to build a shed in the back yard. We decided this would be a good time to refinance with River bank and separate fully from Stagecoach bank. We approached River bank with the refinance request bundled with a home improvement loan (not home equity loan).

The local office of River bank was wonderfully helpful and confirmed our good credit score. The next day, River bank called us and said that Stagecoach is not showing up as a lender on the credit report. In fact, our mortgage (that we are currently paying and in good standing) is not on the credit report at all. I called Stagecoach and they said that the mortgage had not been “reaffirmed” during the bankruptcy process. It should have been done within 30 days of the bankruptcy filing and there was nothing they could do. They said that my bankruptcy attorney failed to submit the reaffirmation paperwork to Stagecoach bank in the allotted time.

I called the Bankruptcy attorney who said that its Stagecoach’s responsibility to submit the affirmation letter to the bankruptcy attorney. This is currently where my leads end. The attorney says its Stagecoach’s responsibility, Stagecoach says its attorney’s responsibility, and I can’t get a conventional refinance through River if Stagecoach can’t/won’t reaffirm the loan. River has offered to run the loan application as an FHA loan and attempt to refinance that way, but the banker was not optimistic about that going through. This is where all my leads go cold.

This feels like Stagecoach is trying to hold onto the loan, OR failed to do the paperwork, OR is too lazy to do the paperwork.

How can I get this straightened out? I just want to separate from Stagecoach and build a shed.",finance

personalfinance,How to avoid over contributing to Roth IRA when conversions are involved (and settlement funds)?,"I deposited $5,500 into a traditional IRA in vanguard with the intention to convert it to a Roth (I have to use the backdoor method). 

By the time I converted it and the amount showed up in the Roth, it had gained just over $2 while sitting in the ""Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund"". I didn't know that this money would accrue value before I invested it in anything.

Didn't realize at the time that the max contributions for this year is now $6000, so I deposited another $500 in my traditional IRA to max out the contribution and convert that into the Roth as well. But I'm wondering what I need to do to avoid over contributing to the Roth? What happens if it's $6002? How can I correct that down to 6000. This is my first time doing this so I could use advice.

personalfinance,Are Multiple Loans the Same as 1 Large Loan?,"I have 6 student debt loans at different (but fairly similar) interest rates that I'm soon to start repaying.

I understand that's not perfectly accurate but as best I can tell it's a ballpark.

My question is, whilst I'm repaying the loans I plan to pay the minimum on all loans but 1, and then use the bulk of my payment towards a single loan at a time, working my way through them highest rate to lowest. Does repayment of multiple loans in this fashion take a similar amount of time as 1 large loan would?",finance
personalfinance,Tax Questions. Living and working in two different states.,"Hello PF,

I was wondering if someone could give me a definitive answer for this question I have. Yes I googled, and yes I checked the faq. 

I live in NW Indiana but work in Illinois. I have to pay Illinois, Indiana, and Lake County tax. My employer is taking out money for my Federal, Indiana, and Lake County. I am a little confused, as I pay property taxes, which are taken out of my escrow account. Doesn’t this count as county or state tax already? And shouldn’t my employer take out money for Illinois, not Indiana? I had to pay 1500 out of pocket to Indiana this year, and do not want to do that again next year.

Edit: I love in Lake County, Indiana.",finance

I'm trying to figure out whether or not I need to take out a loan, so some financial advice would be appreciated. Here's some information to help out:

&amp;#x200B;

Tuition: $0

Fees: approximately $927 per semester

Stipend: $913.92 per month (paid twice a month)

 

I'm planning on living off-campus because it's about $1200 per month to live on, with roommates, and about $650-$900 to live off without one. I'd like to live alone if possible, and I haven't found a place to live yet. I've never lived off-campus before, so I'm unsure how much it'll cost for utilities and such.

&amp;#x200B;

If I were to take out a loan, it'd probably be a federal loan. I have about $27K in student loan debt right now. The field I'm going into requires a graduate degree and there are loads of jobs available, so I'm not concerned about paying back my loans. I just don't want to take out one without a good reason.

personalfinance,Does a bank give a lower interest rate on a car loan if an extended warranty is purchased?,"I already fell for it. I'm fully prepared to accept my $2200 mistake as a learning experience...

When I purchased my vehicle, the dealership told me the bank was offering a lower interest rate if I added a 3rd party extended warranty. They explained since the interest rate was lower, it would only be an extra few dollars per month with the warranty. I said I'd rather have the lower rate without the warranty. The salesman started selling the warranty again. 

I was wondering why the bank would even care if the car had a warranty. I should've listened to my gut. 

Also, after reading reviews of the warranty company, I'd rather just put the money into a savings account. Then, I'd call the shots on what repair is covered and when! 

Anyway, before I call tomorrow to attempt to cancel my warranty, is this for sure just a sales tactic? Is there anything they might say that will make it sound like I cannot cancel it?",finance
personalfinance,Roth 401(k) contribution numbers seem to be pretax contribution. Payroll mistake or something else?,"Suppose, $A is my raw income, $B is the tax deductions, and Y% is my Roth contribution selection, then my Roth contribution amount on my paystub is Y% \* $A instead of Y% \* $(A-B). My Roth 401(k) contribution numbers seem to be calculated as a % of my pretax salary rather than after tax salary. I just noticed this the other day and thought this was a glitch and went back to my paystubs from 2017-18, but this has always been the case, despite the changes in the contribution (Y% ranging from 3% to 30%) I have made over these past couple years. The Roth 401k deduction has always been off the pretax salary than the after tax. I double checked on my 401(k) service provider's website to see if maybe the contributed Roth amount was taxed in the 401(k) account instead of the paystub, but no, the pretax proportion that is deducted as Roth 401(k) on my paystub is what's fully deposited in my Roth 401(k) account. Also, folks at my workplace who have contributed to Roth401k said that their Roth deductions are made off the after tax amount. Additionally, I double checked my taxes and W-2s from last years and I wasn't penalized, made to over pay, pay later during tax season (April) or anything like that. In fact, my fed tax due were minimal each year making me think, that the tax deductions on my paystub have been very close to accurate.

A little background, I am an international student who joined this company after school on an F1 student visa (OPT). Now, I know F1 students don't have to pay FICA taxes, could this be something similar? Is there some provision that shelters students on F1 visa from taxation on Roth 401k contributions? Or is my understanding of Roth 401k calculation/taxation just wrong? Or has my company's payroll been calculating this all wrong all this time? I am not trying to evade tax here. As I said, I only noticed this this week, but wanted to check to see what's up.",finance
personalfinance,Credit Dropped ~75pts In One Month. No Idea Why,"I have been checking my credit score every month for a year on Credit Karma and Mint. It has been rising steadily as I have been maintaining good credit practices. In Feb/Mar I was able to make a big payment to zero out a couple of credit cards. I just recently opened an account at a local credit union to start working towards my first auto loan (and later mortgage).

Monday morning, I checked my credit report and it is showing a 76pt drop for TransUnion and 73pt drop for Equifax.

I spent an hour on the phone with TU playing Guess the Derogatory Report. The guy on the phone was very dodgy about telling me what it was.

The account was in forbearance at the time, having been that way since 2016. The forbearance expired in March, when I made  a whopping $600 payment.

When I check my Fed Loan account, there is no record or indication of missed payments. I am planning on calling them to have the error in my report corrected. After that, will I need to contact all of the credit bureaus and have them “refresh” my records?

Realistically 75K is a decent enough emergency stash for me to sleep soundly at night, so what should I do with the rest? I do not want to put this entire thing in anything particularly volatile.

personalfinance,"First time home buyer, looking for financials review &amp; advice","Hello!

&amp;#x200B;

As the title says, I'm a first time buyer and would really appreciate anyone taking a look at my numbers to help figure out if I'm making a good choice (by the numbers) in purchasing this property.

&amp;#x200B;

So first some high level stuff; The property is a triplex that was listed for $1,150,000. The seller accepted our offer of $1,080,000. We just finished inspections.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the APOD I did for the property: [https://imagebin.ca/v/4e9HHah5nqht](https://imagebin.ca/v/4e9HHah5nqht), Important numbers are summarized below.

&amp;#x200B;

Gross Operating Income less 3% vacancy: $73,558.98

Total Expenses: $20,519.30

Net Operating Income: $53,039.68 ($4,419 per. month)

&amp;#x200B;

I've been offered a fixed 30-year conventional loan at 5.5% interest rate with 20% down.

Financing monthly payments: $4,906.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be owner occupying one unit that costs about $1,800 per. mo. I'll cover the financing gap ($487 per. mo),

My monthly payments: $2,287

&amp;#x200B;

I intend to hold the property indefinitely, but for the purpose of valuation, pretend that I sell at year 10. Assuming:

\* 1% property value appreciation per year

\* 2% rent increase per year (not including my own rent. That stays fixed @ $2,287 per mo)

&amp;#x200B;

Rental income after financing (includes my own fixed monthly payment) @ 10 years: $36,896

Equity + appreciation @ 10 years: $301,307

Total value @ 10 years: $338,204

&amp;#x200B;

Avg. Annual ROI ( Total value @ 10 years / 10 years /  \[downpayment + closing costs\] ): $338,204 / 10 / $255,800 = 13.2%

&amp;#x200B;

\------- SINGLE FAMILY FOR BENCHMARK -----------

&amp;#x200B;

To compare this to a potential alternative, let's consider a  $500,000 single-family home in the same area with $200,000 down.

&amp;#x200B;

$300,000, 15 years at 4.5% equal monthly payments of $2,295 (roughly what I'd pay to owner occupy the triplex)

&amp;#x200B;

The 10 year value, assuming 1% appreciation per. year

Equity + appreciation (Total value @ 10 years): $250,818

&amp;#x200B;

Avg. Annual ROI ( Total value @ 10 years / 10 years /  downpayment ): $250,818 / 10 / $200,000 = 12.5%

&amp;#x200B;

\-----------------

&amp;#x200B;

In many aspects the triplex is more risky. 1) I'm putting a lot more capital on the line and 2)  I'm exposing myself to potential lawsuits. Interestingly, the triplex doesn't seem that much more profitable than buying a single-family home. What do you guys think? Did I miss anything with my numbers? Are there other benefits / disadvantages I should be considering?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks ahead of time, I really appreciate it

personalfinance,Tax/legality question about reimbursing myself as the treasurer of a nonprofit,"Sorry if this isn't really the right subreddit for this.

I manage the finances for a very large organization at my university that is very profitable. We put on several conferences per year (I won't give details for anonymity). We are a registered non-profit, and we are careful to make sure we file everything correctly, e.g. we have an accountant to help us file taxes, we extensively train successors to ensure we submit proper forms to the state and federal governments, etc. As we are a student organization, no one gets paid for their work, and all of the money we make is reinvested into the organization, as well as for some charitable programs related to our conferences, including improving access for those who struggle to afford it.

Now that you have that context, I have a question about reimbursing myself for large expenses. I recently got a credit card with a really good rewards program, and I'm wondering about the legality of using my personal credit card for our expenses and reimbursing myself. For example, we make one purchase for a hotel for the conference that is about $17,000, which is under my credit limit. Could it potentially cause a problem with the IRS if I paid for that on my credit card and reimbursed myself? Would it look very shady? I am very careful to document receipts for all reimbursements in the case of an audit, and every year we train our replacements to continue to track reimbursements diligently. I'm just a little nervous it could look bad for me or the organization if the organization or I got audited. Also, what about for purchases that are large, but a bit smaller (like maybe $2000)?",finance

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

personalfinance,Boyfriend got payday loan,"Sorry for formatting first post and I'm on mobile.


So I just learned today that my boyfriend's mother threatened him with homelessness if he didn't get a payday loan of $300 for her from Cashmoney in August. He hasn't paid any of it off.

 Right now he's set to start working for a temp agency (probably construction work) starting next week (he lost all forms of ID a year ago and just received his ID) he doesn't know the interest rate but I assume it's the usual for Cash money in BC, Canada (47% holy smokes). 

He also wasn't able to pay off the loan asap as his mother had drained his entire account (he has since added more protections on it) and he got fired from work for taking too many days off (having to deal with her drug problems) 

Can anyone please give us some financial advice to deal with this whopping debt? 

I don't know how to help him and he's seriously considering bankruptcy at age 20.

personalfinance,Should I transfer my HSA from Optum to Fidelity?,"My employer contributes $450 to my HSA at the end of Q1, Q2, and Q3, and I contribute an additional $50 each pay period. The HSA is administered through Optum Bank. Last year, after Fidelity started its free HSA, I opened one and put some extra cash in it ($300). My plan was to, after the end of Q1 when my employer contributed its first $450 for this year, roll all the money from the Optum account (~$1,550) into the Fidelity account and continue doing so every 365 days as allowed (if I do a trustee-to-trustee transfer, there is a fee). That’s because Optum had an investment threshold of, I think, $2,000. Any funds in excess of $2,000 could be invested, but all funds up to $2,000 would have to remain in the cash account (0.05% interest rate). Apparently though, my minimum investment threshold has now been lowered to $500.

My question is whether it makes sense to do as I originally planned and roll that $1,550 from the Optum account to my Fidelity account, or just invest the funds in excess of $500 with Optum. With the Optum account, I have access to VTSAX, VEIRX, VHGEX, VGHAX, VASGX, VSCGX, VSMGX, VIMAX, VGSLX, VFIAX, VSMAX, VUSXX, VWENX, some Schwab target date retirement funds, some PIMCO funds, TRBCX, and a few others. I would also incur a $2.50 per month “investment fee.” The Fidelity account has no fees, and I have access to anything I want. Currently, the money there is invested in 4 different Fidelity index funds (two of which have no fees).

I view the HSA currently as an investment vehicle. Thankfully, I am currently in good health, and I rarely seek healthcare other than flu shots and going to an urgent care clinic a couple times a year for routine/minor issues. I do not pay any premium for the plan, and no one else is covered by it (child is covered by wife’s employer’s insurance). I would continue with the HSA as investment vehicle and transfer all the funds in the Optum account to the Fidelity account every 365 days and then switch over to my employer’s PPO option if and when I start having health issues or my wife no longer has access to insurance for our child.

I’m having a hard time figuring out how to determine what numbers I should analyze in order to make this decision. Any thoughts would be much appreciated.",finance

3 months ago I purchased a 2016 Ford Explorer  including a major systems warranty for around $33k. Interest rate is 14.8%. Car currently has 49k miles. 

I was rushed the day I bought the vehicle, and obviously didn’t read the agreement for the warranty well enough. I thought it covered me for 70k ADDITIONAL miles from the moment I bought the vehicle. I was skimming the agreement the other day and realized my mistake. It only covers the vehicle UNTIL it hits 70k total miles. My fault for letting the sales guy work his magic. 

It also requires me to change the timing belt before 60k (which is quite early) and change the oil about twice as many times as the owners manual states. 

My question is at this point would it be worth it to sell it back to the dealership or just keep it? I can sell it back for a portion of the original value which was about 4k. If my math is correct 50k miles puts me about 72% of the way through the contract and .72 times $4000 rounds to $2900. This leaves me about $1100 minus a $50 contract cancellation fee. 

I know this is only a small portion of what I paid but I would apply the $1050 straight to my principal which could help take away a least a little of what I’m losing to interest. If it helps the car is in great condition and I plan on doing all I can to keep it that way. Thanks ahead for your advice!

This is almost never a problem… except that the laundry in my apartment building is coin-op, and there's no change machine. So I need some way to get quarters, and don't have a bank branch to go to.

- Using the change machine at a nearby laundromat. This feels wrong as I'm not using their services.
- Grocery store customer service desk. Hit or miss - they'll only do one or two rolls at a time and sometimes are out of quarters entirely; and the only grocery stores which will do this are too far to be convenient if I can only get one roll per trip.
- Open an account at a bank with a local branch. Options with convenient branches are BofA, Chase, Upqua, or Sterling. All of these have ridiculous fees and laughably low interest rates.

So I have a some questions regarding a possible route my family and I are looking into...I will be speaking to a mortgage broker regarding all my questions, but I wanted to gather some information before we meet, so that I have some understanding of what we're getting into.

With that being said, we are wondering if it's possible to take out money from our current home, and use that for a down payment on a new home that we will be using as our primary home; while renting out our former home.  (either using a HELOC or cash-out-refi)

&amp;#x200B;

For context, my home is in California, valued at around 298,000 , and we owe 102,000 on the mortgage.   The down payment on the NEW homes we are looking at range from about 100,000 - 130,000 for a 20% down payment.   This will be done with my mom as a cosigner for the loans. 

Also, my home is a FHA loan (bought over 10 years ago) with a 5.5 % interest rate (which seems a little higher than current interest rates).   Currently mortgage is about $1100/month.  

Depending on what the new repayment amount is (we are thinking maybe around 1300-1400/ month) we can rent out that home for about 2000/month (according to similar home rentals in the area). 

After these steps are done, we want to get a mortgage to buy a home ($500,000-$600,000 price range) which will be our primary residence.

So with that being said, is this a feasible plan? Are there any restrictions or any important points to consider? Please let me know if I can clarify anything, I realize that my question seems a little complicated.

Bitcoin,The Fruit Tree Economy,"Any kind of economy is like a fruit tree, that is, an economy can only be profitable until a certain time, like a fruit tree. It is well known that almost all fruit trees bear fruit only for about two months, and they can no longer bear fruit for the remaining ten months of the year. Exactly the same story with the economy. For example, take a grape tree as a sample. Within two months you collect grapes. You sell one serving fresh, from the other you produce juice, raisins, vinegar and wine to sell them within ten months before the next harvest. But this natural formula, fruit tree, economy and everything else cannot work perfectly all the time. Because it depends on us, society and nature. Thus, basically we can expose two types of economy.

The first economy is natural or physical. When agriculture, trade and industry depend on bad and good relationships with yourself, that is, it means to what extent we are fair or truthful and favorable conditions of nature in which we all live. In this type of economy, the valuation of goods takes place in accordance with actual circumstances, which we cannot control. The second economy is artificial and virtual. This type of economy sooner or later arises from the natural economy, when people start to get excessive profits. To save these excessive incomes, people start looking for ways to save and multiply profits. In this case, the pricing process for goods becomes an attempt by people to impose their will on society and nature. Basically, banks, stock markets and government bonds are used for this purpose. The comedy and utopia of artificial economy is an attempt to subordinate nature to human will. This has never happened in the history of mankind. Man may be deceived, but there is no chance of deceiving nature, even the slightest chance. The first, that is the natural economy, basically depends on rains. The second type, that is, artificial economy, depends on how long people want to deceive each other. Such an economy cannot last long and has a very short period of existence, as historically known. This is because it has nothing to do with nature or with the true reality in us and the nature around us. Historically, a person can successfully deceive another person, but nature cannot.

All the scriptures claim that usury or money given and taken on interest loans is a sin. Why? Because there is no such thing as an increase in interest rates on loans in nature or, in other words, in the physical and spiritual world.

For example, a person invested his money in a bank in order to receive interest, for example, 10% per annum as profit. Let's take as a sample $ 100,000. His 100,000 will theoretically rise to 110,000 a year with a 10% interest rate. Suppose that if this person invested his money in a bank in 2016, then in 2019 his money should grow to 130,000 dollars. But he decided to take all his money this year, that is 130,000 due to fear of a financial crisis. But the bank has no such amount. If in the country where he lives, 10% of inflation is observed annually, this means that his 100,000 dollars annually lose their value by 10%, which, in turn, means that his money lost its value by 30% within three years. That is, in fact, his amount in the bank is 70.000. This is not the end. As I said above, interest rate increases do not exist. It may not be possible to believe, but it is true. If this person received 10% of the annual income from their money, you can ask where the bank gets the money to pay this 10% annual profit, that is, 10,000 US dollars. The answer is pretty simple. His entire annual payment of 10%, that is, $ 10,000, is made at the expense of his own money. That is, in three years he received 30,000 dollars, or, in other words, he was paid with his own money, that is, this means that we must cut an additional 30,000 of his 70,000 dollars. And ultimately, there is only $ 40,000 in his bank account. Even this amount cannot be returned to him due to the fact that the remaining $ 40,000 was spent by the bank or given to someone as a loan. And it is unlikely that these borrowed money will ever return.﻿",cryptocurrency

""The Settlement provides immediate relief through Equifax’s agreement to cease reporting (1) civil judgment and (2) state and federal tax lien public records while also adding significant consumer protections to Equifax’s credit-reporting procedures""

&amp;#x200B;

""1. Equifax will cease reporting civil judgment and state and federal tax lien information (“CJ/TL Public Records”) for five years after the effective date but may, if certain criteria such as the presentation of a proposed new system to Class Counsel are met, begin reporting it the later of (1) December 31, 2019 or (2) eighteen months after the Effective Date of this Settlement or Equifax’s declaration of its intent to propose a new system for gathering, updating, and reporting CJ/TL Public Records. (Ex. 2, Settlement Agmt. ¶ 4.4.) After Equifax declares its intent to resume reporting CJ/TL Public Records, it may only do so after providing Class Counsel with the details of its proposed new collection process, which must: (1) collect dispositions at least every sixty days; and (2) be “sufficiently standardized and rigorous to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the CJ/TL Public Records (including updates) obtained.” (Id.) Equifax may also resume reporting CJ/TL Public Records if it brings its collection and reporting procedures in line with those used by Trans Union and Experian, so long as Equifax gives Class Counsel 30 days’ written notice of its intent to do so. (Id.)

Gist of it is they should remove ALL civil judgments and tax liens from your credit report and the very earliest they could start reporting again is Dec 31, 2019.   And if they incorrectly reported a civil judgment or tax lien for you, for example they failed to note that you satisfied the judgement or that it had been appealed, there are potential monetary damages.

Because of that, 4 years later I'm selling it at about 100k more than my current mortgage payoff. I am planning to purchase a nicer home in a better area for somewhere around 270k. I am expecting to pay about 15k combined closing costs and realtor fees. I know that I want to put at least 20% down on the home because of mortgage insurance, but unless I spend more than I've planned for on a home, I'm hoping to have \~15k more than I need for that 20%. I'm expecting a 4.5% interest rate on the mortgage. 

I have about 18k left on my auto loan, which started about 23k. I'm expecting to pay it off in 4 years if I keep up with minimum payments. I have an 8.24% interest rate on the auto loan.

My only other debt is a credit card that is at 12% capacity for credit boosting and about 4k in student loans.

That being said, because of tax write-offs on mortgage interest, is it a smarter investment to put that money into my down payment to reduce my mortgage, or to (mostly) pay off my car?",finance

personalfinance,"Should I pay off $12,250 in student loans right now?","Hello everyone - just looking for some friendly guidance/advice.

&amp;#x200B;

Breakdown/basics:

25 years old

$36,000/year income (if I don't pick up any shifts - I work in a hospital so I often do, but being cautious here - last year was $45,000)

$1600-2000/month expenses (no cc debt or car payment, live with roommates, etc. - $1600 is what I need to spend, the extra $400 is stuff I would cut out immediately if I were to lose my job or something)

8% contribution to employer matched 403b (up to 6% match, I currently contribute 8% for a total of 14% of salary, 66% vested, will be 100% vested next January)

Probably going to start pursuing an online MBA in healthcare administration in June, $4000 a term with employer tuition reimbursement of $3000/year after grades released, I am timing it so it is only $2,000 out of pocket for me total. ABSOLUTELY NO MORE LOANS are being taken out, though!

$26,600 currently in accounts (not including 403b obviously)- I have a $9600 emergency fund (6 months expenses), $360 balance on a 0% APR card (paying off this month), so $9,960 is ""untouchable"", leaving $16,613 free, with the $4000 for tuition taken out, leaves $12,613. 

$0 in Roth, real estate, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Total balance on student loans: $33,338. ( :( )

&amp;#x200B;

I have mapped out my individual loans and ranked them by interest rate, balance, and how much they cost me a year in interest. I could save myself $685 a year in interest by paying off my 4 most expensive loans right now, which would be about $12,250. That would drop my remaining balance to \~$21,100, and making the new average interest rate \~3.7%. It's a lot of money - especially for someone making $35,000 a year, but I need to start tackling these loans. They're hanging over my head and they're a huge source of shame in my life. Loan forgiveness isn't panning out and I can't count on it. I have to move away from income based repayment, move away from the idea of cancellation/forgiveness, and just bite the bullet.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess my only question left is - would it be more beneficial for me to open and max a Roth ($5500) and then use $6750 to pay off the loans? I think I could be comfortable moving $12,250 but if I move more than that I am getting closer to my emergency fund ($9600) and knowing that I have enough for my program's tuition out of pocket is essential (again, NO more student loans, EVER!).

His house was purchased with little money down a few months ago, so he has almost no equity in the house to do a HELOC.

The only things I can think to try are:

1) Get a 0% balance transfer credit card (Navy Fed has one with 0% APR for 12 months, 0% balance transfer fee, 8.24%-18% APR thereafter)

2) Get a personal loan for the rest, if possible (NavyFed personal loans are 8.19%-18% APR)

3) For the first 12 months, pay the minimum on the credit card and the rest into the loan

4) After the balance transfer promo expires, use the avalanche method and pay off the higher interest account first.

investing,Wheel Strategy Candidate: $XLF,"Before we get started, this is a good writeup for the wheel option strategy.


https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/a36k4j/the_wheel_aka_triple_income_strategy_explained/


I’ve been re-adjusting my portfolio to slowly try get a better risk-adjusted return. The bulk of my portfolio is stuck index funds but my individual picks (thus far) have all exceeded my benchmark SP500 and total market tickers.  Given my portfolio size, running the wheel (and being able to take lots of 100 shares) doesn’t make sense because it would make up too large of a holding in my portfolio. I had been relentlessly searching for a company I was happy with &lt;$10 but I largely didn’t find any. After several weeks to months of waiting and researching, I found the perfect solution for me. What I intend on sharing is my due diligence for your digestion, with the caveat that I’d love feedback on my line of thought.



The Play: Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund ($XLF)


$XLF is an ETF that’s been around for about 2 decades. It primarily tracks financial institutions with banks making up its largest holding followed by other financial entities such as insurance agencies. Their top 10 holdings (as for 3/31/2019) are: 1) BRK at 13%, 2) JPM at 11%, 3) BAC at 8%, 4) WFC at 6%, 5) C at 5%.   The remaining include AXP, USB, GS, CB, and CME. $XLF has an expense ratio of 0.13% and quarterly dividend payments currently yielding about 1.9%.


The primary advantage of $XLF is that it is well-diversified. Everyone should already appreciate BRK and it’s diversity of assets but you would also own a few of the top banks all bundled in this ETF. As far as why I believe this is a good play? “Banks aren’t going anywhere.” I often see this as reasoning for a lot of causes. This isn’t going anywhere, that isn’t going anywhere. But let’s try to qualify this. $JPM processes about a trillion dollars alone every year. That number alone should be scary. Adding in other banks into this investment only strengthens the case to own $XLF unless you believe the world will somehow adopt a different vehicle to exchange currencies. (No, this isn’t a subtle endorsement of crypto so don’t even get me started.) The ETF’s top two banks are also well-diversified in their revenue streams, unlike (for example) $GS which is primarily an investment bank. This gives a bit of industry specific added protection against a downturn.


Specific to the wheel, $XLF offers a neat advantage in that you are less exposed to earnings. You don’t have to dodge your expiry dates since the risk is really spread out over the course of time, allowing you to move in and out of positions with a bit more freedom. $XLF also pays a modest 1.9% quarterly dividend, so if you do get assigned- at least you can earn some money. $XLF, despite being an ETF, actually has pretty darn good volume/liquidity. It’s no $SPY, but it certainly has weekly options for your picking.


The biggest risks I see to this play included current interest rates and the industry’s low PE multiple. Since the financial crisis, this ETF has poorly performed compared to the SP500. Banks have not gotten a good return in this historic recovery, though have made steady, less volatile gains. (This can be a benefit if your goal is to get more of continuous income rather than high flying growth.) The current state of interest rates also leave a big question mark. Undoubtedly, the 2Y10Y is the lowest it has been since the crisis, suggesting that the banks have very little room to improve their earnings. Couple this with the now apparent global slowdown, growth is likely to decrease. All this being said, every industry will be affected by interest rates, banks just moreso.



Summary:
$XLF is a decent candidate to run the wheel strategy with. It is well diversified, dividend bearing, and has good liquidity. The primary holdings are well established companies that I believe most investors would be happy to own. However, the recent (&lt;10 year) return in this industry has been meager and is most susceptible to current economic fears (interest rates and global slowdown/lending slowdown).",finance
Bitcoin,Taxing Sound Money ?,"In 1812, the US began taxing gold and silver (sales tax). This is an important event that laid the foundational blocks of transforming gold and silver from 'sound money' to just an 'asset class' / and in doing so they helped promote their money printing machine to fund the 1812 War which led to the Treaty of Ghent.   This paper money printer was conveniently picked up by the Federal Reserve in 1913 (and they slapped Gold / Silver with capital gains tax).

We currently pay capital gains tax on Bitcoin.  Why pay tax on sound money ? It is highly probable that IRS and Feds would implement a means of enforcing a sales tax on Bitcoin on major exchanges in years to come.  The taxation events on Bitcoin will be a move to ensure Bitcoin becomes fundamentally an asset class  - this would protect their version of fake 'money' and their printers that are running full steam to enrich the shadowy owners of federal reserve / and enslave the sleeping masses who have failed to unchain themselves from a broken 'money' system.

CryptoCurrency,Change my mind: cryptocurrency must be taxable if it is going to replace FIAT globally...,"Yes I know this is a clickbait title but I feel like it is also a topic that is most definitely worth discussing.


I know you guys hate the Federal Reserve and the US government's lack of oversight thereof. I know you guys definitely don't like Banks after what happened in the 2008 financial crisis. I have friends abroad that this actually affected directly. Many people lost their Investments but kept their income  from their day jobs. However we still trust the government to provide our schools hospitals justice system and law enforcement as well as elections. If you feel as though we can't trust them then sell everything that you have through your FIAT in the crypto and then see what it will get you without any of those things. Excuse me for posting a long paragraph of rhetoric let's proceed with the topic at hand.

However I strongly feel as though this has to be discussed.  I don't shut up about crypto. I show all my friends my favorite Investments. But until we are able to use them for real-world transactions they are nothing more than just that - Investments.

We've never lived in a society with absolutely zero government, just as I'm sure everyone here has seen both the light of day and rainy weather. So then can you imagine a world where we don't have government?

Venezuela already put out their own cryptocurrency and it's failed miserably, instead of learning from the mistakes that Venezuela made, Iran is now choosing to push out their own cryptocurrency as well. 

For this example we will be using Nano since the currency has no fees. When I was working for minimum wage around 2010 I was paying somewhere in the range of 26% on my state taxes and my federal taxes. If I made $1,000 I would get paid 740 basically not perfect math but let's just leave it the way it is,  for simplicity's sake. Let's go out on a whim and say that my employer pays me five Nano each month from minimum wage. 26% taxes kick in and so 1.3 nano is taken from my pay, and it goes to both the state and feds. Where I come from we also have sales tax. So every time I buy something I have to pay 5% of the total amount. Let's say I I'm at Walmart buying groceries and my total is one Nano. Is there anything wrong with paying 1.05 Nano to check out?

Or are we just going to sit here and pretend that cryptocurrency  is useful for situations besides  what is happening in Venezuela?

Recently though I've looked into unsecured personal loans and I've been pre-approved for a loan of $5000 at 36 months with a 12.99% interest rate. The company offering the loan has no prepayment penalties. My current monthly income is around $3000 gross. My bills at the moment include a $900 mortgage and a $400 truck payment. The truck will be payed off this coming November. That's $400 extra per month once November rolls around. Now with these two bills I've managed to continue to save $1000 a month be being very tight.

Here's my problem. I know the answer 99% of this board will give me. Continue to save and buy the things when you've got the money. Consider this however. I personally would rather take out the loan, pay extra on it/get it payed off early, while continuing to save money as well. I had about 13k saved up before I bought my house and the peace of mind I had was priceless.

For reference the loan payment would be 168 dollars a month for 36 months and overall it would equal roughy $850 in interest. That's if I pay no extra.

I've also considered what happens if I take out the loan and an emergency comes up, however if I didn't take out the loan and used my savings to make the purchase, I'd have nothing and I'd be in deeper trouble.

As a last note im not the type of person who thinks interest is a complete waste of money, I think you're paying a price to borrow the money you want now. Also before you say wait til November once the trucks done being payed, I've been dreaming/obsessing about this purchase. I don't see much difference in then and now.

I’ve heard in the PF sub that making additional principle payments on a home mortgage is essentially a guaranteed return equal to the interest rate of your loan since you are buying more equity in an asset (the asset being your house). Makes sense I guess. 




So if you have an interest rate on your mortgage between 3-4%, does it make sense to treat additional principle payments as part of your overall portfolio? Why carry bonds that yield about the same rate of 3-4% when you can put that into your home instead?

Summer 2019 - 3000 (Federal Pell Grant)

Fall 2019 - 4100 (Federal + state Grant)

Spring 2020 - 4100 (Federal + state Grant)

Which was perfect because thats enough to pay for each semester. Except when I went to my college they told me the amount I receive or the amount I will be given depends on my credit hours.

So if its under 5 credit hours I'll receive 750 for that semester, if its between 6 and 8 credit hours I'll receive 1500, and if its 9 credit hours I'll receive 2200. 

And I'm a bit confused because It says I was awarded more than that? Of course, not knowing anything about grants this could be a misunderstanding on my part. Due to the nature of my programs and future semesters, I won't meet the criteria for full time (12 credit hours) so does that just mean I won't receive the entirety of the award?

personalfinance,"Tax-advantage savings (e.g., 401k) vs loan payments","I've seen strong advice on this subreddit to aggressively pay off medium- to high-interest loans, including in the [flowchart](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4gdlu9/how_to_prioritize_spending_your_money_a_flowchart/). This makes total sense for high-interest loans (e.g., credit cards), but I want to talk about moderate-interest loans &gt;4%, most notably student loans, especially among graduates with a few decades of earning potential ahead of themselves.

On one hand, by paying off loans early, you are effectively guaranteeing a return equal to the loan interest rate. This is nothing to scoff at, guaranteed 4+% interest seems like a pretty solid investment.

On the other hand, savings in tax-advantaged accounts, most notably 401(k)s and IRAs, allow you to save money without paying taxes on those savings, effectively allowing you to save more for less. However, while the market returns 6-10% on average in the long term, it is also subject to potential losses. I always assumed the loss potential was the reasoning for recommending early loan payoff.

To investigate this, I've run some numbers for my situation, and I was surprise to find that retirement savings first was far more advantageous with respect to net worth, even just 5 years down the road under very modest expected market returns. In the long run, the tax-advantaged approach is far far superior.

Our situation: My wife and I are \~30yrs old. We have over six figures of student-loan debt from medical school (the national average is 190k at graduation for an M.D.) at an average of 5.5%. After budgeting, we have approximately $6k/mo pre-tax (or $4.5k after tax) that we can use to pay off loans and/or save for retirement. If we pay off the loans aggressively, we can get them paid off in several years. However, if we max out our 401(k)s, and put the rest to student loans (still over required monthly payment), it will take a bit longer to pay off the loans, but we'll have more in retirement. By my calculations (I've run the numbers in excel under many different scenarios), after 35 years, the difference is over $1M in some cases in favor of retirement savings first! This appears to be mostly a function of being able to contribute nearly $100k more to tax-advantaged accounts over our lifetimes, which over 35 years compounds substantially.

Assuming my analysis is valid and there is nothing I'm missing, why is aggressive loan payoff favored so highly here? Is it generally sound advice, but not for higher-income earners? If so, at what point(s) should folks be starting to consider deviating from the flowchart?

tl;dr: What is the reasoning behind advocating aggressive loan payoff vs. retirement savings?",finance

The tl;dr version is that we got a crazy good rate from a different bank than we had been working with after being stiff armed by the first one about  locking in a rate. Now the first company is clamoring to keep our business and I am not going back to them. Was this the right move?

&amp;#x200B;

\---

&amp;#x200B;

My wife (29F) and I (29M) are getting ready to purchase what we are planning to be our forever home at the end of next month. We are blessed to both have good jobs (household income is close to 200K/year), great credit (790s) and decent cash on hand/savings (north of 100K in our checking &amp; savings account). The house we are buying is a new construction home for 800,000.

&amp;#x200B;

When we started the process our realtor referred us to a mortgage originator who has been absolutely wonderful to work with. It was a bit of a pain in the ass to have to furnish statements for all of our 401Ks, stocks, bonds, IRAs, mutual funds, etc since we were confident our salaries alone would qualify us for the loan. We are using the VA loan, so we only needed to put down the 10% of the purchase price for the builder to get started to avoid PMI (this comes in to play later).

&amp;#x200B;

Back in October when we started the process, the mortgage officer sent us two estimates -- 30 year fixed rate at 4.875% with 2.0 points &amp; 30 year fixed rate at 5.000% at 1.75 points . Rates were higher back then and I have been watching them steadily drop.

&amp;#x200B;

For the past few months, every couple weeks I have been asking our mortgage officer about when we should lock in rates, because the calculators I was looking at had rates down around 4.000% and her reply was always along the lines of ""When is the house going to be 100% complete? We can lock in the best rate 30 days prior to closing."" I emailed her on Monday and told her that if we could lock in close to 4.125% with no points, I would be happy to do so. Same song and dance in response.

&amp;#x200B;

I decided that I wanted to see what else was available, so on a friend's suggestion I called Navy Federal (NFCU) and inquired about getting a 30 year fixed rate VA loan. They took our information, checked our credit, and were happy to inform us we qualified to lock for 60 days in at 3.625% with no points and no origination fee. We also just needed W2s, bank statements, and pay stubs; not our entire portfolio like with the other company. I was stunned and decided we were going to get our loan through NFCU and to hell with the original company and mortgage officer.

&amp;#x200B;

We met with our realtor this morning and told her what NFCU locked us in at and we would no longer be using the mortgage officer she referred us to. She said that she was shocked that the MO couldn't match it and suggested we give her a shot to do so. Reluctantly I sent the MO a ""thanks but we've gone in a different direction,"" email. Within the hour, we both received numerous calls/texts/emails stating she would try to match it, that she'd talk to her boss on Monday, that she got a hold of her boss just now, that her mortgage company could match NFCU's terms.

&amp;#x200B;

I emailed her and told her that if the company could substantially beat our other offer, we would be happy to keep our business with her. The response was still the same, they could match NFCU's terms -- 3.625%, no points, no origination fee, and of course, we're so close to closing and they've done all this leg work already. I told her that we would be proceeding with NFCU because she only got to this point when I put here feet to the fire and I was more comfortable doing business with a company who was looking out for us the entire time.",finance
personalfinance,"My parents ""gifted"" me a car a couple years back that I have been making payments on. They have been offered a HELOC and are considering using that to pay off my car for me. Is this a good idea?","Hi /r/personalfinance. I don't want to delve into specifics with my family dynamic, but essentially my parents got me a new car in my mother's name in 2017, and I'm expected to make the payments on it.

I recently spoke to them about it being expensive for me, and they've thought about their options to reduce the financial burden on me, the most appealing to them being a HELOC. Thing is, they aren't very financially literate so I'd like some insight as to whether it's a good decision or not.

I'm not certain of every detail, but from what I understand, they have 20 years left of payments on the house from a 35-year loan, and can refinance their payments into a 20-year HELOC. They have about $90k of equity in the house ($270k total home cost), $21.5k of which they can use to pay off the remainder of my car loan. From what they also tell me, it would reduce their interest rate so it would be a win-win for both parties.

solar,How does the 30% federal tax credit work?,"Hello there, new homeowner here and solar advocate. I recently went to home show and they had a few solar installers, I decided make a couple of appointments for quotes for my home.

So far I've had one quote and it was explained that there was a state rebate that the installer would be pursuing and that I would be able to go for the (larger) federal tax credit. The installer subtracted the state return he'd be going for then showed me what I'd need to pay and the amount I'd be 'given'for the federal tax rebate.

But how does it work? I never owe money when tax season comes around, I've always overpaid and get a bit of a return.
If my understanding is correct, the credit is not redeemable for a refund and can only be used towards taxes that I owe. So does this mean that since I never actually owe taxes at the end of the year, I'll never actually see the savings?

For example, let's say last year I paid $6,000 in federal taxes and I actually only needed to pay $5,800, I received $200 back at refund time. This next year I buy the solar system and get a credit of $5,000. I pay my $6,000 again, owed $5,800 and since I got the solar credit of $5,000 I've ""paid"" a total of $11,000 and owe $5,800. But since that credit isn't refundable I dont get it back, but now on the record I've overpaid by $5,200. So would I get a refund check for $5,200 (with the refund money coming from the taxes I did pay)? Or would it still only be $200...and repeat this next year and so on so I never get the credit in cash.",energy
personalfinance,What is the reason why you would take a stable federal job over private?,"I need some serious career mentorship with this question and I would appreciate any help.

I am young who has started out his career not too long ago. I've been working as a federal contractor and have landed an opportunity with the feds. The problem is that they're way to technologically behind and it will make me unemployable after some time. The work that I am doing is not even adding too much value or making me marketable for my next job.

However, my family is under the assumption that I should go to feds and leave the private world altogether. I have taken the time to discuss this with several other employees and managers and they all have warned me not to go to feds for the sake of my career. My family is standing strong in the decision and wanting me to choose the federal world over private.

This entire issue results in heated arguments and nothing gets accomplished.

One of the reasons is that they believe I am not fast enough for private world and I could end up losing my job at any time. As a high-functioning autism, I may not be able to hold down a job or be a team player and these are the big fears. I am not really that confident in my programming abilities either as I don't have a good computer science foundation. In the fed world, its job security with good benefits (I think). In my current job, I have been performing well and I know I'll continue to do so. My fed manager already likes me so they believe I should choose them over my private company and leave.

Ultimately, the decision is mine to make. I am still not too sure why it makes sense to go to feds over staying in private? At this point, I am young and completely confused.

I know I am an adult and this is a very immature question to ask but I don't have a good support group to seek advice with. **If you were in my shoes, can anyone please help me what and how would you have made this decision? Would you have gone to the fed world or stayed in private?**

Without cash, depositors would have to pay the negative interest rate to keep their money with the bank, making consumption and investment more attractive. This would jolt lending, boost demand, and stimulate the economy.""

personalfinance,Paying down debt again,"Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

So I recently (about 5-6 months ago) finally got ""debt free"".  Or rather it was well under control. I had spent about a year and a half paying down all of my debt (from about $15,000 total over cards and such). 

&amp;#x200B;

So recently, I just had a wedding which I didn't put on credit (paid it down with gifts and from pooling money over the engagement) and paid for the honeymoon mostly the same way.  Everything was looking good but then life kicked in.

&amp;#x200B;

My dog recently had some issues that cost me about $600 which I put on my card, then my car needed repairs which cost about $1K in repairs, and I had another incident where my HSA card didn't work at the dentist and had to put that on my card too.   Overall I got back up to about $4K in credit card debt after everything.

&amp;#x200B;

My savings is about $5K in an ally account, and I have about $1500 in betterment.   So im trying to weigh my options here. I also have a credit score of about 800 with my current DTI at 5%.  My credit card is at 22% (chase card) interest rate.

&amp;#x200B;

So im trying to weigh my options and see what might be the best bang for my buck and to get out of debt the fastest but also the most painless. 

&amp;#x200B;

I could strip my savings and pay it off but then i'd have nothing in savings and would have to start that back up (I was trying to put $500 a month into ally until I got to about 6 months of my salary). 

&amp;#x200B;

I could just pay it off over the next few months paying the interest and hope nothing else comes up.

&amp;#x200B;

Or I could try for a small loan from somewhere with a low interest rate.. I've seen some advertised at about 6-10%.  Then just pay off with large amounts that I would have used for option 2 above at just paying off the cards.

&amp;#x200B;

We do plan to start looking for a home in about 1 year, summer 2020.  And we were trying to put money away for the down payment.  I may just be over thinking everything since it's ""only"" $5K but having just got it all paid off I don't want to risk getting back to where I was and want to get rid of my debt ASAP so my money can work for me towards a house / retirement instead of just paying off cards.

business,4 Growth Strategies Used By The Most Successful Companies follow 4 Growth Strategies,"[source of](https://www.reddit.com/r/onlinebusiness4u/comments/bfsig7/4_growth_strategies_used_by_the_most_successful/)

 

Whether it's customers, revenue, locations, leads, mentions, or profits, you've got to play the growth game if you want to be successful in business.

Growth is fundamental to a business' survival. Roughly 66% of businesses survive their first two years in operation, **50% make it to the five-year mark**, and just 33% will celebrate their tenth anniversary. Those numbers are remarkably consistent across most industries -- but they also highlight how important it is to plan for growth from day one.

In 2018, **53% of American SMBs planned to grow**, and 22% planned to hire additional staff. That marked an impressive uplift from the 2017 figures of 46% and 9%, respectively. A concrete **growth strategy** is more than a marketing strategy, it's a crucial cog in your business machine. Without one, you're at the mercy of a fickle consumer base and market fluctuations.

So, how do you plan to grow?

## Growth Strategy (Business)

Growth strategy allows companies to expand their business. Growth can be achieved by adding new locations, investing in customer acquisition, expanding a product line, etc. A company's industry and target market influences which growth strategies it will choose.

Strategize, consider the available options, and build it into your business plan. Depending on the kind of company you're building, your **growth strategy**might include, among others:

* Adding new locations
* Investing in **customer acquisition**
* Franchising opportunities
* Product line expansions
* **Selling products online** across multiple platforms

Your particular industry and target market will influence your decisions, but it's almost universally true that **new customer acquisition** will play a sizable role.

Not sure what that looks like for your business?

Start by learning from the most successful companies. Identify their strategies, test them in *your* niche, and see what works best. Here are four companies and their primary growth strategies to get you started.

## Growth Strategy Examples

## 1. Dropbox

## Growth Strategy: Viral Loops

As a trailblazer in the cloud storage software arena, Dropbox launched in 2008 and introduced the world to the ease of keeping files in the cloud, rather than on a physical device.

We take that convenience for granted today, but it wasn't always the case. In fact, Dropbox faced an uphill battle to convince users to abandon their trusty USBs and external drives in favor of the ""cloud,"" itself a new and unknown idea.

Dropbox knew it had a premium product that everyone from students to executives would find invaluable. They just had to get the word out.

But they succeeded. The service hit its **million users milestone by April 2009**, doubled to two million only five months later, and to three million just two months after that. Currently, Dropbox boasts 500+ million users worldwide.

How did they do it? **Viral loops**.

The basic premise of a viral loop is straightforward:

1. Someone tries your product
2. They're offered a valuable incentive to share it with others
3. They accept and share with their network
4. New users sign up, see the incentive for themselves, and share with *their*networks
5. Repeat

As its best, a viral loop is a self-perpetuating acquisition machine that operates 24/7/365.

Dropbox works on a freemium to premium model, offering all users 2GB of storage with the free account. But their incentive? An additional 500MB for every friend they refer who signs up, allowing users to get up to 16GB for free.

The result? The **service grew by 3,900% over a 15-month span**.

Viral loops are not guaranteed to go viral, of course, and they're less effective than in Dropbox's era since they've become more commonplace, but the potential is still there. Part of the appeal is that the viral loop flips the traditional funnel upside-down:

Instead of needing as many leads as possible at the top, a viral loop funnel requires just *one* satisfied user to share with others. As long as every referral results in **at least 1.1 new users**, the system continues growing.

## 2. Harry's

## Growth Strategy: Milestone Referrals

You might remember when **Dollar Shave Club** burst on the scene in 2012 with the promise of high quality, but affordable blades delivered right to your door. Harry's followed suit the next year, launching not with a viral video, but with through the savvy use of milestone referrals.

It worked like this: visitors to a **pre-launch landing page** signed up to receive email updates. They also received a referral link to share via email, Facebook, and Twitter. The more they referred, the more they could earn in rewards.

In this case, the ""milestones"" were X number of referred friends. It was easy to share, easy to hit the milestones, and delivered a tangible product as a reward.

The result? Harry's **collected 100,000+ emails before it ever officially opened for business**.

## 3. Slack

## Growth Strategy: Word-of-Mouth

In less than six years, Slack has become the go-to platform for online collaboration and communication for both professional and personal users.

From just 8,000 users at launch in 2013, Slack hit one million daily active users in late 2015. Today, the service boasts **10+ million DAUs**. That's a pretty stellar **growth metric**. How'd they do it?

In the beginning, Slack made itself available to large, established companies like Rdio and Flickr, generating plenty of early **press coverage**. The company focused on user satisfaction above all, answering thousands of help tickets and tweets each month, and leading directly to positive word-of-mouth amongst its early adopters.

Even Slack's leadership team was blown away by the success of its word-of-mouth approach. In 2014, co-founder **Steward Butterfield** stated, ""The growth has been completely insane and almost entirely on word of mouth. In fact, we just hired our first marketing person, but he doesn't begin until next week.""

Word-of-mouth is organic - and, as seen in Slack's case, it's effective. **83% of Americans** say a recommendation from a friend or family member makes them more likely to purchase or try a product, and 50% would go with word-of-mouth if they could only choose one source of information.

The secret of such effectiveness lies in a deeply rooted psychological bias all people have: *we subconsciously believe that the majority knows better*. That's why social proof remains the #1 instrument in sales copywriting and **overall marketing content**, and that's why most brands draw focus toward their online reputation.

They know in today's customer-driven world, when communication methods change and the information is available to all, a single negative blog post or tweet can send all marketing efforts to the bottom. As the father of digital word-of-mouth growth, Pete Blackshaw says, ""satisfied customers tell three friends, angry customers tell 3,000."" That's why Slack focused on user positive experience to grow that number of satisfied customers and do that wave of loyal feedback.

Focus on delivering a spectacular user experience, and users will spread the word for you.

## 4. WhatsApp

## Growth Strategy: The ""When They Zig, We Zag"" Approach

When entering a crowded marketplace, you've got to stand out. Your **value proposition** needs to clearly demonstrate your competitive advantage over others. Why should users go with your product or service instead of someone else?

WhatsApp wasn't the first cross-platform messaging app when it launched in 2009, but it has gone on to become one of the most successful, with **1.2+ billion monthly active users**.

Its founders, Brian Acton and Jan Koum, wanted to create a product that eschewed the crap plaguing other apps at the time. They intentionally opted for no ads, no marketing, and a free first year to attract users fed up with other providers.

And it worked. They stood out by being dramatically different from every other option at the time.

In short, they zigged when everyone else zagged. They created a product that was brilliantly simple for sending and receiving instant messages. People started to use and share it as a result - so much so, in fact, that WhatsApp's growth far outpaced the likes of Facebook, Skype, and Gmail in its first four years.

Leverage this effect by asking what's wrong with the current options in your niche? Can you improve or eliminate it entirely? Highlight that, and get users talking.

The competition zigs. You zag.

Most of the resources I used and talked about in this post can be found in this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jaYoQBoFq2KIc0u55eKuo8ZKi3cwtLXeeBWCxoHFUg4/edit?usp=sharing), I am not linking many directly because I think my posts were getting auto classified as spam for having too many links

I spent a few hours researching just what the heck is going on with RL. I debriefed the most starred GitHub projects, the SOTA (state of the art) algorithms, and the open source platforms. Generally speaking, RL should be used whenever a problem can be modeled with an agent, environment, and reward setup. Technically speaking we can train a lot of models with an RL mindset. For example, a traditional GAN has a generator and a discriminator, the generator is trained by how much it **fooled** the discriminator. With an RL mindset, we can define the generator as the agent, its state being the random strokes it painted, and the rewards being the degree it fooled the discriminator. Still the same workflow, but now we introduce more possibilities, we can tune the reward algorithms &amp; RL training mechanisms, etc.

My general plan for learning RL is to implement gym games first, then playing around with complex environments like Project Malmo and ViZDoom, and at last, I will get onto the Unity RL env and making my own game and training my own RL agent to beat it!

So right now, let me implement a few gym games first, for this time, I am trying to beat Cartpole &amp; Acrobot.

https://i.redd.it/sqjzj2cgnpt21.gif

&amp;#x200B;

Cartpole, objective is to balance the stick so it doesn't tilt over 15 degrees

Since I copied and understood the atari breakout code, I thought this was a piece of cake! Interestingly, the observations of the environment turned out to be an array with 4 floats while I thought it was going to be a picture (like in Atari). That changes my game plan, I can't just use the Atari code for this, because in Atari, we predict an action by feeding in a 210 \* 180 \* 3 image, which is the state, that image goes through a few Conv layers, connects to a Dense layer with 4 outputs, which represents the actions we can choose (we will choose the output that had the highest value because that represents the one that will yield the highest reward). But a cartpole state is a 4 \* 1 array, so I decided to feed it through a random neural network and connected it to a dense layer with 2 outputs at the end.

But I still ended up using a great portion of gsurma's code. The reason being that the original Atari code wasn't the best, it is intuitive to do this:

    class AtariSolver:     
        def __init__(...):          
            define the model structure     
        def saveMemory(...):          
            self.memory.append the current state, reward, etc so we can train the model with the memory              variable later     
        def getAction(...):           
            ... 

But the Atari code scattered all of these across places, they weren't contained inside of a single class, which would make **a lot of sense.** Here's [my GitHub repository](https://github.com/BlastWind/cartpole) that beat Cartpole, again, huge credits to gsurma.

Now onto my **nemesis: the Acrobot.**

https://i.redd.it/1z6fixzenpt21.gif

The observation of an acrobot is an array with 6 floats, so I thought I could've beat it with the same approach with Cartpole and use the Deep Q-Learning algorithm to train the RL agent.

I was wrong! I am still trying to motivate this skinny blue dude to cross the black line (the objective of the game)! The agent gets rewarded with negative points each frame the RL agent cannot reach the black line. **The problem is, a lot of negative points won't help on making the best choice if the agent never experienced a positive reward.** **And since the default Deep Q-Learning algorithm decreases the exploration rate over time, the agent will try random stuff less and less.** That is at least what I am feeling. I ran this model for 100 iterations and all of it terminated because it reached the maximum 500 timeframes.

It's okay, the next time I will be reporting back to you, I will have defeated this skinny blue dude. I looked into something that might help me, on the [openAI Gym Leaderboard](https://github.com/openai/gym/wiki/Leaderboard), someone beat acrobot with an algorithm called PPO (proximal policy optimization). It seems really hard to understand mathematically, but I will understand it, beat acrobot, and share it with you next time!",technology

personalfinance,Student Loan Delinquency - Options?,"So I have about 24k owed in student loans, the last of which was taken out a few years ago before I had to drop out due to personal issues. Long story short I was never sure what I wanted to do with my career so my effort and grades suffered as a result. It's a bummer but it is what it is, I make decent money now so some extra monthly payments wasn't the end of the world.

However in at the end of 2017 I requested and got approved for a deferment, as I was making significantly less and I wasn't going to be able to easily make my payments.

I swear I they had given me a 24 month deferment, but I was very clearly mistaken, it was only a 12 month deferment. The issue though was my FedLoan email I had been using was my university email address. I haven't used it in forever, and with multiple new phones since then, haven't even logged in to it for notifications and such.

So end result, I haven't been getting any emails from FedLoan about making payments for the last 5 months, since December. Last week I have been organizing my emails and have logged into my old accounts, and about the first thing I see is a notice of severe delinquency on 5 accounts (the individual loans that made up the 24k).

This is killing me, I've never missed any sort of payment before. My credit wasn't *amazing* as I used to have a little high credit card utilization, but it was jusy fine and my utilization has been much lower as of late. But man, I this has tanked my credit to below 520 from estimates. :( With credit report reasons of 'severe delinquency / time since delinquency too recent / number of delinquent accounts.' 

Am I just screwed for awhile? Or is there anything I can do besides just keep making payments? I immediately paid the 1500 ish that was past due. Just sucks how easy the credit got slashed. Never missed a payment before for anything, but made a big dumbass mistake with how long my loans were deferred for and now I don't know how to fix it.

Any help or advice is greatly appreciated. I feel awful :(",finance
personalfinance,(JP) Student Loan Repayment Plan,"Hello PF, first time poster here, but I have been reading a lot and I am always learning something new about personal finance here.

I would like to ask your input regarding the repayment schedule of a couple of (student) loans. I will do my best to express everything in US equivalents. For the record, I am single, employed full-time with a stable source of income. 

As it stands, I have the following:

1. $13,000 @ 0.16% over 15 years → $165 in interest
2. $13,500 @ 2.35% over 12 years → $2,134 in interest

I am currently paying around $90 per month for loan #1 and $105 per month for loan #2. I do have the capacity to pay down these loans more aggressively, but I am deciding against it for the following reasons:

A checking account here has practically 0% interest, while a fixed-term savings account is around 0.10% at best. However, any other investment I can think of will most likely beat the 0.16% of loan #1. Meanwhile, for loan #2, any low-moderate risk investment, like government securities and dividend funds, will likely match its interest rate.

Given the above info, the course of action I decided on is: pay the minimum scheduled amount on the loans, and put the extra money into investments with higher potential yield. What are your thoughts?",finance
personalfinance,Taxes were much higher on my most recent pay check and I'm not sure why,"On my most recent paycheck, the amount taken out for Social Security, Medicare, WA paid family leave, and WA paid medical leave were significantly higher than in past weeks. Two paychecks ago, I paid $216 for social security, which is 6.2% of my income. This paycheck I paid $375, which is 11.3% of my income. My federal income taxes do not appear that they were affected. 

&amp;#x200B;

I emailed HR and plan to talk to them tomorrow, but I was wondering if anyone has any idea why this might have happened. Any help would be appreciated and if anyone has had this happen to them before, I would be interested in hearing about it. I plan to call social security tomorrow if HR can't help.",finance
personalfinance,Mistake in IRS Withholding Calculator?,"I'm playing around with different withholding scenarios using the IRS' 2019 Withholding Calculator ([https://apps.irs.gov/app/withholdingcalculator/index.jsp](https://apps.irs.gov/app/withholdingcalculator/index.jsp)), and something just doesn't make sense. I am either completely misunderstanding how withholding taxes are calculated, or I've discovered a bug in their calculator.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to try and keep it as simple as I can by using round numbers and the simplest settings I can enter, yet still see the 'weird' results that brought me here to ask my question. The choices/values used have no relationship to my actual income and/or contributions.

&amp;#x200B;

Here goes...

I tell the system I am single with no dependents (and nobody lists me as their dependent). And let's say the ""non-wage"" income listed below is interest from a bank account.

**Scenario #1:**

My gross wages are $27,000, I contribute $20,000 to a 401K, and I earn $15,000 in non-wage income. I have $0 withheld so far for federal taxes. When I enter these numbers, the results say I will owe **$985**.

&amp;#x200B;

**Scenario #2:**

My gross wages are $7,000, I contribute $0 to a 401K, and I earn $15,000 in non-wage income. I have $0 withheld so far for federal taxes. When I enter these numbers, the results say I will owe **$456** ($529 less than scenario #1).

&amp;#x200B;

NOTE: Other than the numbers mentioned above, all the other entries are left as their default (mainly empty or 0).

&amp;#x200B;

I don't understand why the estimated taxes are different, since  the net wages and total income are identical.

&amp;#x200B;

If my gross wages are $27,000 and I contribute $20,000 to a 401K (a tax-deferred one), then my net wages are $7000, then add the $15,000, this results in a total income of $22,000.

&amp;#x200B;

If my gross wages are $7,000 and I  contribute $0 to a 401K (a tax-deferred one), then my net wages are $7000, then add the $15,000, this results in a net income of $22,000.

&amp;#x200B;

Interestingly if I eliminate the non-wage income, then the two scenarios result in identical amounts owed. For example:

**Scenario #3:**

My wages to  $42,000 and I contribute $20,000 to a 401K and have $0 non-wage income (so my total income is $22,000). My calculated taxes are $985.

&amp;#x200B;

**Scenario #4:**

My wages to  $22,000 and I contribute $0 to a 401K and have $0 non-wage income (so my total income is $22,000). My calculated taxes are  **ALSO** $985.

&amp;#x200B;

In these two cases, the same net income results in the same taxes - this DOES make sense.

&amp;#x200B;

Somehow, whatever calculations they use, having $15,000 of non-wage income causes a different calculation depending on the combination of my gross wages and 401K contribution (even when the net amounts don't change).

&amp;#x200B;

Remember, that the non-wage income is the same amount  for both Scenario #1 and #2, so I'm not asking why a different non-wage income could result in a different amount owed.

&amp;#x200B;

Can anyone explain this discrepancy  between the estimated amounts owed in Scenarios #1 &amp; #2, or is there a bug in their calculations?",finance

personalfinance,College Grad Seeking Financial Guidance,"**TL;DR:** I'm a fresh college grad (English Major - Creative Writing Focus) as of last May, 2018, now **making $39,000 a year** with extensive additional income potential working from home for a great company and a wonderful boss. I **am renting a 2BR,1B apartment** but don't have a driver's license or car. **I'm looking at $66,000 in debt ($60k in student loans \[no private, all federal\] and $6k in credit card debt)**. I've been listening to Dave Ramsey's podcast and **have an emergency fund of $1k with another $1k in checking**. Trying to figure out what my next steps should be.

&amp;#x200B;

**Current monthly income is \~$2,600 a month after taxes and insurance**, and **current expenses are roughly $1,700 a month**; though that can vary vastly if I have to take Lyft/Uber to get around depending on where I need to be.

&amp;#x200B;

My immediate goals are as follows:

* *Rent a home (I want a place that's mine, something more than an apartment that I can move into with my partner but not rely on him to afford for myself).*
* *Pay off my debt, starting with credit card.*
* *Create a safety net that I (or we) can live on long enough should I lose my job and have to get back out into the job market.*
* *Get my driver's license and a used car (I want to buy and not rent a car so I only have to pay on insurance).*

&amp;#x200B;

What should I focus on and in what order? According to Dave Ramsey, I should tackle the debt with every penny I have, but I feel like not being able to drive around when I need to is a huge setback and even a potential income threat. Also, I'm scared that, should I be fired or at a loss for a job, I won't be able to sustain myself while getting back into the old job search. Finally, my apartment contract finishes in January of 2020, and I'd like to be ready to transition to a house by then. Is this a reasonable goal?

CryptoCurrency,"IMF: ""How to Make Deeply Negative Interest Rates Work"" - This Article Should Scare You... http://bit.ly/2BCpxsI http://bit.ly/2BCpxsI http://bit.ly/2ILOwOF",,cryptocurrency
Bitcoin,More companies that are adding surcharges for using credit/debit cards.,"For context, US retailers won a federal case in the Supreme Court a few years ago (2017) that let _individual_ states permit retailers to charge a surcharge on top of the product cost and sales tax to offset the charges they receive from credit card/bank processors.

My state is one of the many (and more pending) states who have in turn been pressured by retailers to allow this practice.  They overturn state laws prohibiting surcharges on a free speech basis.

Previously, retailers were only permitted to give a cash _discount_.  But now retailers are permitted to charge an _additional_ amount.  The difference is not semantic.  Cash discounts are rare, because it required retailers to either list two different prices (as commonly happened at gas stations) or actually give a discount off the shelf price.  Now retailers can tack on an additional charge with little notice (typically a posting of a sign at the entrance or similar)

Anyhow, I have been watching for signs of retailers changing their policy, and I am starting to see some creep.

Many retailers are posting higher minimums for credit card use, or are implementing them for the first time.

My state government charges a surcharge for credit card use now at most (all?) government services:  courthouse, department of motor vehicles, secretary of state, and child support collections.  (Government agencies have long held the ability to do this...now retailers have similar power)

Several of my local (non-chain) businesses are now starting to charge extra for credit card use, including my local ice cream shop, and multiple mall retailers, and most recently, my doctor began charging for credit card use.  (My doctor charged an additional 3% to use a credit card, to give an example.

As other merchants see their peers start doing this, I fully expect this to continue and expand to larger chains and more states.

Processors in the US charge a flat fee plus a percentage of the order for every swipe. (between 2-3%)

As benefits increase for the users of credit cards, (cash back, mileage), the processors pass those fees on to the merchants.  The merchants are fighting back.

All together, this would tend to favor bitcoin for any business savvy enough to accept bitcoin as payment themselves.  Small businesses in particular would be well placed to accept payment in BTC without relying on a BTC back to fiat conversion.  Larger businesses could also benefit as cryptocurrency processing services would offer competition to the traditional card processing services.

This has played out in my own personal experience, as my mom-and pop local sub shop accepts BTC as payment, and the owner of the shop uses that as his own means of accumulating BTC.

Watch for changing policies regarding credit/debit cards in your area.

Recently, the Kroger chain of stores has announced plans to stop accepting Visa and MC _credit_ cards in many more stores.  Originally the change in policy only affected 21 stores in California.  They have since expanded the ban to an additional 142 stores and 108 gas stations in Utah, Nevada, New Mexico, Wyoming, Idaho, Montana and Arizona.

As credit card usage faces conflict between retailer and processor, alternativessuch as a peer to peer, decentralized cryptocurrency becomes more appealing.

TL, DR:  Retailers are fighting the high processing fees associated with credit/debit cards and implementing newly legal surcharges and restrictions on card use.  This is good for Bitcoin.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Federal vs Private Engineering Defense Job Opinion,"Sorry for the long post but would like your opinion on the conundrum i got myself into

&amp;#x200B;

First job out of school was for a government engineering agency (NAVSEA).  Really liked my job since it was a good/slower pace and I was working under a really smart electrical engineering who spent his career in the private sector.  Had an amazing work life balance as i only work 730-4pm and worked from home on Fridays.  Starting pay was 68k and after 2 years I was at 72k. (Yearly raises were about 4% until you cap out on the ND/GS scale etc).  Problem was, most of my role was approving engineering changes - I wasnt actually making the changes I was just simply approving the paperwork.   
 I was also starting to get fed up with my job because of the travel - had to do underways and international travel for long periods of time which I really didn't like but i was able to make excuses/ avoid traveling most of the time.  Manager and most employees were actually really competent.  I was scared that maybe staying in the govt too long would erode my engineering skills and my engineering friends in the private sector were making 20k+ more than me at the time.  

Anyways, scrolling thru linkedin and was contacted by a recruiter to interview at a major defense company in my area (same distance from my current except in the opposite direction).  Was eventually offered a job for 95k + 5k bonus and less/no travel and after much thought decided to leave the cozy fed job i had. 

Major reason was for the money since I am (26M) trying to buy a house (in north jersey!) and marry gf soon and money was a lot more than the feds.

Fast forward to 6 months in the private sector job and I absolutely hate it.  Company is very disorganized as they are going thru a merger(which was announced after I started), some days there is a ton of work, some days i sit around and browse the web.  Also, all the areas are classified so i cant even have my phone on my to contact the outer world.  I kept a very good relationship with managers from my old job  so I reached out to them and I can easily get my old job back and would take me back with a 4% pay bump - i would be around 76k.  In the mean time i did apply around for other jobs in case they wouldn't take me back I got a offer from yet another defense company in the area for a whopping 145k salary and they work a 9/80 schedule but only 17PTO days per year which carry over if they are not used.  Would also be no travel however would mostly be working in classified areas so no phone as well.  During and after the interview i really grilled the mangers on the work-life balance and not working OT etc and they really seemed like no one really works OT and theres a good work/life balance but who really know until you start right? They also work a 9/80 schedule so every Friday off and offer 17PTO days per year and carry over any unused days etc.. 

I definitely want to leave the current firm but should i take the new job for 145k (which from the outside seems like there good work life balance) or go back to cozy gov job for half salary?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR 26m

Was working for the federal govt as Electrical Engineer \~2 years; making 72k; all the benefits/ PTO/ sick/ easy work pace/ WFH fridays/ but a lot of work travel which i didn't like

Switched to private sector defense company for 95k/ ""unlimited"" PTO and sick/ very unorganized company and can't use phones - hate it

Have the option for going back to fed job for \~76k but just got an offer from anther defense firm for 145k..should i just take that if i might hate it also?",finance

personalfinance,Suggestion for high interest rate credit card debt paying,"I have a Chase Freedom Unlimited card, in just my name, with about $6,600 balance.  The card had a introductory rate of 0% which was under a time limit of about a year. Long story short, helping with bills and taking care of last wishes for a close friend made me slack a lot on my aggressive paying of the debt. The card is currently in good standing with no late payments and at a minimum of double payments. However, the rate has jumped to 26.99%. I have nothing setup to use the card anymore; it stays in my room on a shelf and I refuse to use it and have not used it in months. While I am making progress to pay the debt off, the added interest on top of the debt is basically making anything less than 3 times the minimum payment  futile. Some advice from a friend was to contact Chase directly and explain the situation to which the reply was I was offered the lowest APR and unless I setup a payment plan they were unable to assist me. In fact, the rep was so quick to dismiss my questions and conversation that it was portrayed as I was about to start missing payments or unable to. My question is what options do I have? I have a relatively low credit score currently (was 741 last year and 648 currently) and I'm not looking to find another way to spend more than I can afford.

""A candidate just got elected in office and they will make the markets rally/crash""

This is another bad common opinion. The market does not care who is in control of congress or the white house. Political offices have smaller influences on the stock market, with the exception of policies that would explicitly effect companies. Such as Warren calling for the break up of Google and Facebook. Better indicators before political office would be the federal reserve lowering/raising rates, US dollar strength, consumer index, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously, the thoughtful folks on this sub are building the life they want to live. I consistently see articles like this in the popular media which is frustrating given that the FIRE philosophy is designed to avoid some of the traps detailed below.

&amp;#x200B;

\-----------------------

Most people look forward to retirement, a reward for decades of hard work. But like many other pleasures, it may be bad for your health. It may even kill you.

How can that be? How can working longer be good for your health? After all, many people dream of—and plan for—retiring early. Strenuous, stressful work can wear people down and damage their health. On the other hand, retirees can relax and reinvigorate themselves. They have time to follow their passions and pursue activities that enrich their lives.

But in our rush to leave the office, we don’t realize that retirement also has a downside, especially over the long term. Many retirees indulge in unhealthy behaviors. They become sedentary and watch too much television. They eat too much. They drink too much. They smoke too much. Without the purpose of fulfilling work, retirees can feel adrift and become depressed. Without the camaraderie of their co-workers, retirees risk becoming socially isolated. Without the intellectual stimulation that work can provide, retirement can accelerate cognitive decline.

The problem for researchers is measuring which is the more powerful force—the joys of a more leisurely life or the downsides. An experimental study, in which researchers randomly force some workers to retire and others to remain in the labor force, would provide the best evidence, but that kind of experiment is impossible.

Instead, researchers have turned to statistical models that rely on factors that affect work but are unrelated to health—like Social Security eligibility ages, tax breaks for older workers or mandatory retirement rules. Researchers then can determine how health changes when these milestones are reached.

The result: Many of these studies clearly show that health problems intensify after workers qualify for retirement benefits and abate after policies encouraging work are introduced.

**MORE IN ENCORE**

## When you’re 62

Consider a 2018 [study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047272717302037?via=ihub&amp;mod=article_inline) by Maria Fitzpatrick at Cornell University and Timothy Moore at the University of Melbourne, which used administrative data covering the entire U.S. adult population to examine how mortality rates change at age 62, when people can first begin collecting Social Security retirement benefits. After all, death is the definitive indicator of poor physical health, which itself is difficult to measure.

Dr. Fitzpatrick and Dr. Moore found that men are 2% more likely to die in the month they turn 62 than in the previous month. This mortality surge is driven largely by increases in deaths from lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and risk factors for these conditions include smoking and lack of physical activity—both of which become more common when people retire. Mortality rates at age 62 increase less for women than men, and the relationship is not as clear-cut, perhaps because age-62 mortality is much lower for women.

## More evidence comes from looking at a Dutch policy change in 2009, which introduced a tax break for older workers. It provided workers a 5% bonus at age 62, a 7% bonus at 63, and a 10% bonus at 64. These incentives, which were eliminated in 2013, spurred work by men ages 62 to 64, and had smaller effects on women. Using this temporary policy innovation as a type of social experiment, Alice Zulkarnain and Matthew Rutledge at the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College [concluded](https://crr.bc.edu/working-papers/how-does-delayed-retirement-affect-mortality-and-health/?mod=article_inline) that delaying retirement reduced the five-year mortality risk for men in their early 60s by 32%. As in the U.S. study, the impact was smaller for women.

The evidence also suggests that retirement can accelerate cognitive decline. The mental exercise that work provides seems to keep people sharp. Learning new skills seems particularly important. By establishing “cognitive reserves,” such activities may help the brain become more adaptable and better compensate for age-related erosion in cognitive ability.

Economists Susann Rohwedder and Robert Willis used data spanning the U.S., England and 11 European countries to [show](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.24.1.119&amp;mod=article_inline) that retirement significantly reduces cognitive function. When people retire, they typically get less mental exercise, because work activities are generally more cognitively stimulating than home activities. Retirees may routinely play bridge or do crossword puzzles, but that isn’t as intellectually challenging as many jobs. A 2014 [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24791704?mod=article_inline) of half a million retired self-employed workers in France found that dementia was significantly less common among those who retired later than those who retired earlier.

## The social network

Another risk for retirees is that leaving the workforce can cause them to be socially isolated. Most workers interact extensively with their colleagues, providing camaraderie and often social support. Although you would think that retirement provides people with additional time to nurture social ties, Eleonora Patacchini at Cornell University and Gary Engelhardt at Syracuse University [found](https://crr.bc.edu/working-papers/work-retirement-and-social-networks-at-older-ages/?mod=article_inline) that retirement *shrinks* social networks and the frequency of social interactions. The impact is especially large for women and college graduates. Smaller social networks and social isolation tend to reduce life satisfaction and impair physical and mental health.

It’s important to point out that a paying job isn’t always necessary to reap the health benefits of work. About one-third of Americans age 55 and older regularly volunteer for community groups and other organizations. Such unpaid activities can involve levels of physical, cognitive and social engagement similar to those in paid employment. Many studies, including a 2019 [evaluation](https://www.nationalservice.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2019/volunteering-helps-keep-seniors-healthy-new-study-suggests?mod=article_inline) of the Foster Grandparent and Senior Companion programs, find that unpaid work, like paid work, reduces depression and loneliness and improves life satisfaction for older adults.

## These studies aren’t definitive. More research is needed to establish the pathways through which retirement affects health, and to identify which types of workers are most affected. For example, the health benefits of work aren’t generally shared by people with especially stressful, boring or physically demanding jobs. Workers in blue-collar jobs, for instance, accumulate health problems more rapidly as they age than workers in less physical jobs and usually experience health gains when they retire.

## Financial fitness

Retirement, meanwhile, doesn’t just threaten the physical and emotional well-being of people. In fact, perhaps the biggest downside of retirement is financial. Social Security replaces only about 40% of a typical paycheck. Employer pensions are much less common today than in the past, and relatively few people have saved enough in 401(k)s or elsewhere to guarantee a financially secure old age.

By staying on the job, workers can redeem their retirement prospects. Workers who extend their careers can save part of their additional earnings for retirement, and they can accumulate more Social Security credits. What’s more, retirement savings don’t have to last as long when workers delay retirement.

My Urban Institute colleagues Barbara Butrica, Karen Smith and Eugene Steuerle have [estimated](https://www.urban.org/research/publication/working-good-retirement-0?mod=article_inline) that an additional year of work raises future annual retirement income by 9%, on average. The financial benefits from continued work are even greater for low-income workers because Social Security’s progressive benefit formula replaces a higher share of earnings for low-wage workers than high-wage workers. The bottom fifth of earners gain, on average, 16% by working an additional year.

The good news is that many older Americans are working longer. For much of the second half of the 20th century, the average retirement age for men declined steadily, as expanded employer pensions and the introduction of Medicare and early Social Security benefits made early retirement increasingly affordable. Between 1950 and 1993, the share of 65-year-old men participating in the labor force plunged from 69% to 28%. But the trend then reversed, in response to declines in employer pensions and employer-provided retiree health insurance, increases in older adults’ educational attainment and changes in Social Security rules. By last year, the participation rate for 65-year-old men had rebounded to 46%.

The trends differ somewhat for women, reflecting changing norms about women’s work. Between 1950 and 1993, the participation rate for 65-year-old women edged up 5 percentage points, to 21%, as women of all ages moved into the labor force. The participation rate then surged to 35% in 2018.

Despite these gains, obstacles to work at older ages remain. One is psychological: Many people feel they *should* retire by a certain age (or earlier), because that is the way it has always been. We should be encouraging older workers to stay on the job for their own health.

What’s more, for many older workers the decision to leave a job is not their own. Instead, too many are [pushed out of their jobs](https://www.urban.org/research/publication/how-secure-employment-older-ages?mod=article_inline) before they are ready to retire, and end up struggling to find new work with comparable pay. Employers often seem reluctant to hire older workers, because of fears that they are too expensive, lack up-to-date skills, or will retire before employers can recoup the cost of hiring and training them.

Various policy changes could increase older workers’ employment. Federal law prohibiting age discrimination in the workplace could be strengthened after a 2009 Supreme Court decision made discrimination more difficult to prove. We could revamp our approach to education and training to prioritize lifelong learning so older workers can keep their skills up to date. And we could invest more in programs and benefits for older unemployed workers, who generally have trouble finding jobs and often stop looking.

By enabling more older workers to stay on the job, these reforms could benefit companies facing shortages of skilled workers. But it could do more than that. It could also save lives.",finance

&amp;#x200B;

Im 33, married and no kids. 3 years ago I took out a loan at a 27% fixed anual interest rate fully knowing that we were about to go on a high inflation spiral. Last month's inflation was 4% and my bank is calling me every day to refinance (lol). I used my yearly bonus to close one of my Credit Card accounts and this year's bonus will be dedicated towards the same end on my other CC.

With a projected 40% yearly inflation, all my extra money goes to USD (which sadly I can only count in the hundreds) and durable goods (new more efficient fridge).

My plan is to wait the storm out and hope inflation liquifies my debt (not a mortage but a personal loan so no collateral) and hoard as much foreign currency I can, or buy durable goods, like the brand new Workstation I bought for my wife (She's a developer). Does this seem to be a good plan? Does investing in little things like 7watt LED work? I cannot have a big bank account but I can cut costs by buying more efficient things. Any takers?",finance

2. Peer-review process (having their research checked at well respected conferences by true and well qualified cryptographers)

3. Formal methods (ensuring that the code written can be mathematically proven to do what is intended to)

4. Having their code audited

I’m not saying that you are not allowed to be disappointed. Sure you are allowed to! But if you cared anything about this project, shared its vision and understand the scope and complexity of what they are working to achieve then you would not have come here (or elsewhere for what that concern) to spread this FUD

personalfinance,Private Student Loans,"I am currently a freshman finishing up my first year of university. I am fortunate enough that both of my parents are willing to help pay for my education, with each of them taking out personal loans/paying for a year each (About 20k a year). I have to pay for two years myself and pay off federal loans which will end up being about an additional 23k. I have about 18k saved in college funds and 1.5k in checking/savings. For my junior and senior years, I hope to become an RA in order to reduce my yearly cost from 20k a year to 5k a year for those final two years.

That being said, my mom is unable to help until my junior year, so next year I am essentially responsible for paying. My mom is encouraging me to take out a private loan for the full 20k, which she promised to help pay off if I become an RA. She feels like there is a chance that my current investments will outpace the private loan interest while simultaneously providing me a security net of cash. I am terrified of loans, and there is no guarantee that I will get the job as an RA. I feel like taking out a partial loan might be the best option.

Essentially, I have three options: pay virtually everything off in cash upfront, take out a partial private loan and pay off the rest in cashier take out a full private loan. What do you think would be the best option?",finance

I have never invested though, and have some obvious trepidation about it. So I was hoping that I could get some validation or advice about my investment plan here.

&amp;#x200B;

1). Keep roughly $10,000 in my savings account. It makes next to nothing on interest, but it is immediately accessible in case I need to make a large purchase.

&amp;#x200B;

2). Put $5,000 in a one year Ally CD. I figure 1 year is a good time period in case I need to replenish my emergency fund or something worth purchasing comes along.

&amp;#x200B;

3). Put $5,000 in a 5 year Ally or Capital One CD. I mostly like this idea for the safety of it, but am not sure its also the move I have the most uncertainty about.

&amp;#x200B;

4). Open a Roth IRA and invest the full $6,000 dollar amount. I am currently in graduate school, so the tax advantages of a regular IRA won't really benefit me at this time.

5). Invest at least another $5,000 across three or so index and mutual funds for purchasing a home or another large expense, or just more retirement later on down the road.

personalfinance,"35 and clueless: student loans, house or retirement?","\*\* Burner account to hide my shame \*\* 

I am almost 35, not married, no kids,  and not a home-owner (short list of failures, right there at the start).  I'm also totally new to personal finance management, because I grew up in a well-off home where money and budgets weren't really discussed. 

I am outwardly successful, but I'm flailing financially. 

* I just got a new job where I make 100K/year.... but I have $120K in debt from graduate school.   The loans have a high interest rate (around 7%), **but** they are PAYE so capped at 10%  AGI with the possibility of forgiveness at the end of 25 years and they have deferment options in case of a lay-off or whatever. 
* My only other debt is my car loan, which is almost paid off.  My credit score is currently upwards of 810, so at least I have that going for me.
* I have about 5K in checking, 10K in an emergency fund and 17K in savings that I had hoped to put towards a house. 
* I have only about 10K in my 401K, and that’s from two jobs pre grad-school (and it is in two funds---- I need to figure out how to consolidate it into a single fund).   I am not contributing to my 401K at my current job while I'm figuring out what to do. 

I have reasonable baseline expenses right now, except my student loan. My PAYE was 600 but will probably jump to 800 or more now.   

My discretionary spending is an issue I'm working on, but I'm afraid that dramatic changes in lifestyle will strain my relationship with my partner. He has no debt other than his car, and he is accustomed to a certain lifestyle.    We have a plan that would allow us to live as we live now *and* buy a house in the next few years, but that's assuming I don't make   
 any payments on my student loan beyond the PAYE 10%.  Buying a house is stage one to having a family, which is something I *really* want (though it's not a given due to health issues).... but I also feel like the debt is a monkey on my back. Plus, I feel like a failure for not saving for retirement. 

I have *no clue* what to do. Should  I consolidate my student loans with a refinancing company (losing the PAYE program benefits like hardship deferment and foreignness) and focus on that rather than buying a house? Should I keep the PAYE  program and try to buy a house to start a family?   Where does retirement fall in the priority list between those two items? 

I'm working 60 hours a week, commuting 1.5 hours a day, and spending most of my remaining waking hours on domestic duties (cleaning, cooking and pet care) and studying for additional certifications for my job.

CryptoCurrency,Unpopular Opinion: Cryptocurrency must be taxable if it is going to replace FIAT.,"**Without mentioning any particular cryptocurrency...**       

Everyone in this sub talks about how FIAT is the devil and the federal reserve is going to ruin your life, right? But I have to pose the question, **""How many of these people who say and think these things have also had to go through bank loans, call emergency services, and contact law enforcement personnel on occasion?""** These things are **not free,** and in order to fund them, taxes are necessary.

So the question then becomes, ""If there is a cryptocurrency that replaces FIAT in our day to day lives, how can it be used to benefit society?"" There are politicians who are pro-cryptocurrency and think creating open-doors on consumer practices with cryptocurrency is the way to go.  But without taxing this at all, how is the society you are in supposed to survive?


The people who work at your city hall, that stamped your marriage certificate, that keep your neighborhood safe, that send ambulances to your neighborhood, that have a spouse and children, and that are not so different from you - They need income. **Let us also not forget that in an economy where we determine the price of the dominant currency, we also over power the government and this truly becomes a mechanism where the government ultimately serves us.**


So, final two questions: 1) How could we implement systems of taxation in cryptocurrency if we live in a full crypto society that you find comfortable and 2) If you don't want to answer question number 1, then please tell us what kind of society you would be comfortable with where there is no government but instead 100% open free trade and no laws (thus the potential of you being tortured to release your cryptocurrency wallets' private keys, this has already happened to [One poor chap](https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/12/04/south-african-tortured-bitcoin/) in South Africa).",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,My father and I purchased a condo with the intent of me fully taking it over once he retires. Need guidance and what to do with the property.,"Hi Reddit, this may get long since I want to try and explain the entire situation, I apologize for any mistakes or missing information in advanced and will answer any questions in the comments. 
In November of 2018, my father and I purchased a 2 bedroom condo. I say my father and I because we are both owners but he is the one who put $100k down from the equity he made from a previous home he owned. He also purchased a home in another city near by where he plans on retiring in Jan 2020. Him and I are currently living in this condo and I am saving as much as possible before January comes so I have a good amount of money in the bank incase I run into any financial problems. We decided on a 2 bedroom so I could have the option on getting a roommate for the first year or two, or until I am able to afford it on my own.  

The mortgage is $1800 which includes the HOA, insurance and taxes. My dad is currently in the process and refinancing since the interest rates were high when we bought and it could drop this payment around $100 making it $1700 total. The problem is I am already starting to stress about taking the mortgage over as I know I cannot do it all on my own and would be dependent on a roommate, most likely a random person I would have to find online. I currently take home around $2450 a month after taxes and insurance. Although I know it’s not much, they treat me very well there. I am positive I will continue to grow financially and I am very happy and can see myself working there for a long time.

My boyfriend and I recently discussed moving in together once my dad leaves but the location of the condo would be a terrible commute for him with traffic both ways. So, if we make this commitment to live together it would not be at the condo and we would rent in a location that is suitable for both him and I. I would like to move in with my boyfriend but my problem now is what I should do with the condo. The options I have thought on were either renting it out or selling it to purchase later down the road. So starting with the option to rent it out, I have ZERO experience or knowledge of renting a property and it would be little to no profit. The highest I think I could ask for it may be around $1900-1950. I know this comes with a lot of responsibility and I don’t know if it’s worth it? But this way I could keep the condo and possibly build equity. The other option is selling and putting the money in the bank until I am ready to purchase again, this of course would mean losing the condo and not building equity but I would not have the stress of owning a rental property with hardly any profit. As you can probably see I am in over my head with being an owner of this condo and have little knowledge of what the best thing to do is. Any recommendation would be greatly appreciated!",finance

personalfinance,What is your emergency fund strategy?,"I was wondering what your emergency fund strategy is, and if my personal strategy makes any sense. It took me several years of living frugally to pay off my debt and save up my emergency fund. So now that I've done that, I thought I'd share my approach.

I'm going with a multi-stage approach:

First, I have $2000 in cash, which is just barely enough for basic rent, food, and most of my utilities in an envelope hidden in my apartment. This is only to be used if I have some sort of problem that prevents me from accessing my bank accounts.

Second, I always keep $500 in my Chase savings account (which pays basically nothing in interest), and anywhere from $500 to $1500 in my Chase checking account, depending on the timing of my paycheck.

Third, I have a credit card with a $7,000 limit that can cover just about any car-related, or last minute travel emergency that comes up. I always pay off this card completely every month.

Forth, I have the bulk of my savings, $25,000, in several 4-week treasury bills at treasurydirect.gov. They're staggered 2 weeks apart and set to continuously re-invest. I should be able to live anywhere from 6 to 8 months on that money if I lost my job.

If an expensive emergency comes up, I'm planning on putting it all on my credit card. Then, I'll cash in some of my treasury bills to pay the CC bill. I like using treasury bills because the interest rate right now is slightly higher than most online bank accounts, and I can't think of any reasonable emergency that would require 100% of my savings to be immediately liquid.

All of my surplus cashflow is going into Vanguard ETFs and my employer's 401k plan. However, I hope I never get desperate enough to cash those in!

I know a lot of people don't like keeping their emergency fund in treasury bills because they aren't as liquid as an online savings account. But I feel it's pretty safe considering half of my money is only ever two weeks away, and I can use my credit card to buffer me until it comes in. Plus, it adds some friction between you and your emergency fund, which reduces the temptation to use it frivolously. 

What do you all think? Is there anything I could be doing better?",finance

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

financialindependence,State taxes for FIRE (updated for 2018),"I did this a [couple years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/68t6ey/update_state_taxes_for_fire/) and figured it was time for an update, particularly with the new federal tax law. Briefly, I used TurboTax 2018 to simulate the income tax situation for a typical FIRE couple, married filing jointly with no children. They realized $24,000 of Roth conversions plus $77,200 of long-term capital gains for an adjusted gross income of $101,200, but a federal tax liability of $0. I went through all 50 states plus D.C. and determined the state and local income tax liability. I also got property and general sales tax data from the Tax Foundation [here](https://taxfoundation.org/facts-figures-2019/). For property tax I multiplied the per capita amount by the average number of people per household in that state, so it should roughly give the average property tax paid per home. For sales tax I multiplied the per capita amount by 2 for a couple.

(a) no state income tax

(b) $3,204 state income tax + $1,488 county income tax (using county rate of 1.5%, roughly population-weighted average)

(c) $4,238 state income tax + $2,709 local income tax (using local rate of 3.0%, roughly population-weighted average)

(d) would be $3,985, but Nebraska state income tax cannot exceed federal income tax ($0)

(e) state income tax on interest and dividends only

Keep in mind with the Affordable Care Act, realizing this amount of capital gains would put you well over 400% of the federal poverty line, and thus ineligible for health insurance premium subsidies. So for many this strategy won't make as much sense as it once did, but I think the results are still informative.

personalfinance,(CAN) Co-signed student line of credit gone wrong,"Hello PF!

I have a bit of a stressful situation on my hands which I know was absolutely my fault and is a result of my incessant need to help people even when it's a bad idea. I'm just trying to mitigate any fallout for myself since I've worked hard at creating a good credit score for myself, and keeping myself set up well.

I co-signed on a student line of credit for a family member who was from out of town and in school, to the tune of $10k. She was good with it for quite some time but is now out of school (the interest rate is back up to normal, as she is no longer registered in school) and has maxed it. We're talking paying down the minimum, and then taking 18 bucks out the next day.

My questions are:
What is this doing to my credit?
How do I get my name off this account, or decrease the impact to my credit?
Is this a $10k life lesson and I pay it off, close it out, and keep harassing my relative for the money forever and ever all the while paying it down myself?

I'm at a loss because of a lack of knowledge, stress induced lack of sleep, and feeling like a general idiot. I don't tend to fall for stuff like this, but I got taken hard :(

Any help you could provide would be great.",finance

personalfinance,Should I wait to buy a house?,"This is more in regards to the state of the market than it is about my finances. 

I keep seeing people talking about how the economy is due to have a correction or recession soon but that’s all way over my head. I’ve been looking at houses for almost a year now but I live in a pretty affluent area where there isn’t much for sale in my price range (I’ve budgeted relatively conservatively). 

It seems to be that when a recession happens, housing prices and interest rates drop (again, this is over my head so please excuse my lack of knowledge on the subject). 

Can anyone well versed in this area give me their two-cents on whether it’s better to wait or am I just being hesitant over nothing?",finance
personalfinance,Paying Off Loans... With Loans?,"I am currently $38,755.39 in debt to both federal and private lenders.

&amp;#x200B;

I have an $8,813.01 loan with SallieMae (12.125% interest) and am making $206/month payments on it - throwing in more when I have the ability to.

&amp;#x200B;

The remaining $29,942.38 is with FedLoan. I have 10 individual loans that range from 3.76% - 4.66% interest (5 are subsidized, 5 are unsubsidized) and pay $0/month on this debt.

&amp;#x200B;

My graduate school is currently offering me $18,049 of unsubsidized loans (4.5% int) for the coming year. I'm not the most financially savvy, so I would great appreciate it if someone could look over this game plan for financial soundness:

&amp;#x200B;

Take out the 18k, pay off the entirety of my debt SallieMae because their interest is predatory as hell, then pay off some of the smaller unsubsidized loans that I currently owe. My rationale is that my interest rate through FedLoan will inevitably be much lower than my rate through SallieMae. That, and by closing some of my currently open accounts that accrue interest even while I'm in school, my credit score will slowly improve.",finance
Bitcoin,I traveled the world on 1 BTC -- and finally finished writing the book!,"afternoon all,

6 months ago I wrote a post: ""Finished Traveling the World ... on 1 Bitcoin.""

Well, the comments and questions motivated me to write a book about the journey.

I tried to get it up by today -- in honor of World Book Day.

The title is a bit cheeky: 

**Stolen Wallets: And Where to Buy Them.**

I've always been a fan of Harry Potter, right. The titles J.K. Rowling would give. Especially ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them."" That's the title's inspiration -- though the content is much less P.G. haha. 

I experienced far too many R-rated scenarios for ""Stolen Wallets"" to be anything but HBO material. 

If you enjoy Breaking Bad, it's like that -- with a bit of Terry Pratchett's humor mixed in. 

Here's the back cover blurb:

\---------------------------------------------------

 What's in your wallet? You okay with a stranger poking through it? I'm not. Never in a million. My wallet is my private little hell. Receipts for things I can't afford and a picture of an ex I still miss. But there I was, standing in a grubby back alley in Bangkok. Wallets scattered on a table in front of me. Crocodile skin Gucci, scuffed generic brown leather, even a DIY duct-tape wallet. Each and every one of them hot. The product of sneaky little fingers. The karma of drunk tourists distracted by scorpions on sticks. Curiosity killed my ethics. I picked one up. It was full. Not with money, of course, but with ...   


These are the stories of my travels.  
20 countries, 12 months, 1 Bitcoin.   
From China to Europe. From late 2017 to late 2018. A historic year. The year of The Crypto Bubble. The big ride up.   


At the start of the year I was just another desk jockey. Putting in my 9-to-5. Binge-watching Netflix alone. Then I bought that bitcoin for $4,700. Little did I know it would soon skyrocket to $20,000. Little did I know it was my golden ticket. My red carpet to a world of fast money, greed, hype, hope and corruption. Suddenly I was cruising with the crypto rich. Counting stacks of counterfeit money. Buying stolen wallets...  


Until the bubble popped -- and the world of the newly rich began burning down around me. 

\-------------------------------------------------------

That's back cover. I've ran it by a few people. One said it was too edgy. Another said it was too much. A third didn't say anything because he's too busy. 

If you have suggestions, lay em down. 

The book is an unvarnished, uncensored log of my travels. It's intense and raw. I don't sugarcoat the scams and shilling I saw. But at the same time -- the crypto communities I met around the world -- they changed my perspective and opened my mind so much that, well, all I can say is bitcoin and blockchain are freedom, truth, and our future. It's just a fact. 

I'll try my damnedest to get on Youtube once a week and read a bit from the book. I'll ready up until 80% of it, I think. After that I'll stop so I don't spoil the end for the readers.

Here's my previous reddit post:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9j2pq7/finished\_traveling\_around\_the\_world\_on\_1\_bitcoin/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9j2pq7/finished_traveling_around_the_world_on_1_bitcoin/)

Also, since I'm trying to become a writer and all that jazz, I'm trying a promotion tactic. You ever hear about  Marguerite deCourcelle? The lady who painted a BTC prize into one of her paintings? There's also Pascal Boyart who hid a BTC prize in his mural of a modern French Revolution.

 [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-12-28/your-bitcoins-are-waiting-in-the-painting-if-you-can-find-them](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-12-28/your-bitcoins-are-waiting-in-the-painting-if-you-can-find-them)

&amp;#x200B;

Well, I'd like to continue their tradition. It's a fun one. Hide a BTC prize and challenge people of intellect. To that effect I've loaded up a wallet with a bit of BTC. It's a standard wallet. The seed phrase is composed of 12 random words. I've hidden the 12 random words in my book. But since hiding them in a whole book would make finding them impossible -- I'll give out clues. 12 months, 12 clues.

And since I didn't have enough money to put a whole bitcoin in the wallet as a prize (I just put in 0.1 BTC) -- I'll instead dedicate 30% of my monthly sales to the wallet until it's swept. Who knows, with BTC's fresh bull run  -- I hope whoever wins will have enough BTC to go travel around the world on it -- just like I did.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Spouse contribution to IRA,"Long time Lurker here.  Looked around didn't find a good fit in the Common topics. So here it is. 

I work for a major  University, have good retirement plans with fully funded 403B with matching funds, and have been contributing to a fully funded Roth IRA in my name for a few years. 

Wife is self employed, No retirement funding to date. We are in the process of getting her setup and fully funding an IRA when it occurred to me, for Tax considerations, Should we stop fully funding my Roth, to get hers fully funded, and then work towards funding mine. 

We intend to have considerable less income post retirement, so the Roth (Post tax money in, tax fee out)  isn't ideal.  So I'm looking into options on a Traditional IRA as well for her.

Barring that though, is there Fed. Tax incentives to funding a Roth IRA  for her now, considering she is self employed?
Dont know that it matters but she owns a State Licensed Home Day Care.
 
I understand if we do a pretax retirement fund for her it helps with our Fed Income taxes now, but I also dont want to mess with her future SS benefits, so I don't want to drastically lower her reported income.  Would a pretax  solution lower her SS reported income?

Another consideration is that I'm 8 years older than her, and so any money we divert from my Roth to hers(Roth or  Traditional), means we cant access it that much longer. 

I'm mostly concentrating on Roths simply because it doesn't matter that I make more than her, the max contribution is the same per year. Where as the Traditional contribution is income % based.  Also fully contributing to my 403B is a no brainer due to matching funds. 

What do you think?",finance
personalfinance,High interest savings accounts,"Hi, so i've had my emergency account in my credit union savings account for about a year now.  I haven't given it much thought because i had planned on using some of it for some home stuff and potential down payment on something that never showed up.  Point is, i now don't need it unless there is an emergency or next year (looking at you kitchen), so i want a better savings account.  I've heard of a couple and i've gone to their websites, but their websites are all, ""come bank with us!"" and don't really tell me anything.

If you have experience with the savings accounts that actually have a decent interest rate (&gt;2%), what has been your experience?  Is it easy to transfer $ over? What would you do differently if you did it all over again?",finance
personalfinance,Borrowing vs investing,"Please forgive me if this may be a dumb question but I'm a bit confused at the moment. Last year I took out a personal loan, which I've regularly been paying without much of an impact on my finances. Since then I also started saving a little money. As I thought it'd be helpful to have some (semi) liquid assets I thought I'd invest it rather than use that money to pay down the loan.  So I opened an account with an online p2p lending platform and started lending out my monthly savings (while this may sound risky bear in mind that the service offers a payback guarantee so I won't be losing any money unless they go out of business).

&amp;#x200B;

The thing that really confuses me now is that apparently my debt only has an annual interest rate of 6.5%, yet I am supposedly getting over 10% from my investments.  Wouldn't that mean that it'd be less convenient for me to pay my loan back early than it is to just invest that money? And wouldn't it also mean that I would actually be running a profit if I borrowed more from the bank and lent it out on the platform? I mean, numbers aren't supposed to lie but that would sound too good/easy to be true. Am I missing something here?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT for the people who commented so far. No, they're not ""guaranteeing"" 10% yearly. That's just the projection from the loans I invested in so far. Borrowers do pay some pretty high interest rates at the moment, so that's how that number happens. Also the platform is [https://mintos.com](https://www.mintos.com/) which apparently does not issue loans itself but instead funnels the funds to establish lenders, which then issue the loans. I'm not sure that can tell me whether this is a ponzi scheme or not.",finance
personalfinance,"Help me make sure I Understand ""tax credits""","Currently looking at buying some sort of EV, probably next year sometime.  As I understand it, EV tax credit isn't a refund, but just a lowering of my liability, correct?

Making a lot of assumptions based on *this years* taxes, if I do the math and *absolutely nothing changes* financially next year:

Wife and I had Gross Income of (round figures) 107,000, with a taxable income of 83,000.

Our tax liability was 10,156 but our daughter gives us a credit of 2,000, making our total liability 8,156.  7,819 total was withheld from our respective paychecks meaning we owed the feds 337 dollars.

Now, if I understand correctly, if we purchased an EV and got the full 7500 tax credit using the above numbers, our liability would drop to 656 dollars, correct?  Meaning we would be getting a refund of 7163.

Is this all correct or am I terribly misunderstanding something?",finance
personalfinance,LIFECHECK: Going to med school on a full ride (YAY!)- but have a lot of outstanding debt that can't be deferred (NAY). How do I get by until after med school?,"&amp;#x200B;

My goal is not immediate debt payoff, as I start med school in late June. My goal is to accrue as little as possible NEW debt, and to find a way to get all of my outstanding debt somehow controlled while I have no income for 4 years.

&amp;#x200B;

My ""income"" will be in the form of student loans as I do not have to pay tuition or fees, and I find out my financial aid package in about a week. Ideally, I will get approved for as much federal loans as I can through financial aid. Supposedly they don't cap grad school as much but I have no idea.

&amp;#x200B;

I have about $112K in undergrad/postbacc loans, and roughly $28K in CC debt from having to work less while in school to keep GPA up.

Breakdown----

Federal, deferred: $43K

Private, deferrable: $8K, 7.6% (through Discover)

Private, deferrable: $19K, 10.8% (through Discover)

&amp;#x200B;

Private, not deferrable: $42K (monthly payments of approx $580 required, are refinanced through Lendkey)

CC 1: $2K, 23.5% APR

CC 2:  $10K, 22% APR

CC 3: $4K, 24.5% APR

CC 4: $12K, 17% APR

&amp;#x200B;

My lifestyle: I should also mention my car that I owned outright was totaled yesterday, so getting a new one will have to happen in the next year. I will bike commute in the meantime as best as I can. I mealprep and almost never go out to eat, won't need subscription services or anything other than my room, my desk, and my computer. I don't spend money on basically anything except my debt. We get amazing health insurance through the school so that's covered. No pets or kids or responsibilities.

&amp;#x200B;

My current income/money

I have been working 70-80 hour weeks the past year (mainly as a teacher) for on average $23 an hour. I will make as much money as I can between now and school starting in June, which will be around +$8500.  I do not have savings, and am living with family rent-free until school starts.

No late payments or derrogatory marks. My credit score is lower only from high balances. I monitor weekly on Creditkarma.

&amp;#x200B;

All advice welcome- but know if you suggest I drop out of my full ride to med school to work full time until my debt is paid off, I will tell ya right now that's not happening.

So long story short, I've had an account at Chase for decades - they've been wonderful, save for their absolutely abysmal interest rates that I've foolishly held decades of savings in.  I also have a Chase credit card that I pay off through my checking account on the same page.

Just got off the phone with them hoping to negotiate waiving the fee due to my many years of patronage and excellent credit history - nada (which rubbed me the wrong way...)  

I had originally intended to keep my 3-6 months expenses in my Chase savings account, as it has instant transfer to checking aka debit card usage, and I believe Ally takes 3 business days to transfer funds (am I correct here?)  But I'd rather not pay $300 a year just for that access.

Is there any point to me keeping the accounts open as is?  Does it matter that my credit card/history is through Chase?  Can/should I be holding my emergency fund/expenses in an Ally checking account for easy(er) access?  Anything else I'm not thinking of?

I'd love to keep my Chase credit card (good rewards, A+ credit score) but just want the most bang for my buck in terms of where I keep emergency expenses (also keeping them as liquid as possible for, you know, *emergencies*).

Again, really appreciate any thoughts on this.  I'm certainly no expert on any of this, and would love to sort out the best place to hold my savings/liquid emergency fund.

*Edit*

Quick update, as helpful comments have pointed in some useful directions - in case anyone else may find the information useful.

I can (and will) downgrade from Premiere Checking to basic (Total Checking) which has a $1,500 minimum balance (directly in the checking account itself) *or* a $5k balance between the account and any investments/deposits (not interested through Chase) - for the sole purpose of paying of Chase CC monthly bills (as well as having an *extra* emergency backup liquid account with $1.5k in it)

I'll also transfer the rest (and keep all direct deposits feeding into) Ally savings account (which has instant transfer to Ally checking if needed) as my ""main"" account - only pulling over to Chase to buffer for CC payments.

Again, you all are always incredibly helpful and that all really helped wrap my mind around the best next steps forwards - thanks again for the insight and information.",finance
personalfinance,IBR for Student Loans or Pay As Is?,"Hello everyone! 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been considering switching my student loan payment method to Income Based Repayment in order to pay off my student loans faster. What I was thinking is that I could use the money that I currently pay on all my loans to focus on paying loans off quicker. My biggest problem is that my student loans are in USD and I now live and work in Canada...so I pay a large amount to convert my loan payment into USD every month. I'm not quite sure how much I would be asked to pay if i did IBR, but I don't believe it would be much, considering what I make in Canadian Dollars is far less than USD.

&amp;#x200B;

My loans are as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

\-$3,800.69 @ 6%

\-$2,561.81 @ 6.8%

\-$4,465.81 @ 4.5%

\-$2,276.61 @ 6.8%

\-$2,423.00 @ 6.8%

\-$4,597.12 @ 5.6%

\-$1,965.71 @ 11.5% (I know!)

\-$6,769.23 @ 8%

&amp;#x200B;

The last two are private loans, the rest are government. The monthly payment totals $450.19, but in Canadian dollars it comes to about $615 a month...which is brutal. The one loan (the one with the interest rate at 11.5%) will be paid off October 2020. 4 more will be paid off in 2027, with the remaining 3 paid off in 2030. I'm wondering if it might be best to take that same amount and ""snowball"" pay the loans off rather than paying a little bit on each loan. Or maybe this is a terrible idea! Who knows. Just wanted to see what you all thought and if you had any advice.

personalfinance,I Made A Concise Guide to Cars/Houses/Investing/Saving,"&amp;#x200B;

**The Concise Guide to Future Financial Planning**

**Preface**: I am in no way qualified to be giving financial advice, this is just research I've done and compiled into a useful guide that I thought I'd share with other's who might benefit from it.

**Introduction**

Before delving into specifics, there are some basic personal finance boxes that every person should try to check off as soon as possible. The most important of which is debt management. PAY OFF DEBT FIRST. Compounding debt will only add to your expenses.

**Basic Personal Finance**

Firstly, It’s important to measure up your approximate net worth. This includes all assets, debts, and currency to your name. Your net worth can provide you insight into your current financial situation and stands to help guide you with future purchasing decisions. Second, the importance of a budget is immeasurable. By counting every expenditure, you can limit yourself from unnecessary purchases. Also, keep track of all accounts, debts, and bills. This way, you can keep a good credit score which is used when finding rates on loans.

**Basic Saving**

Start saving as early as possible, many Americans retire with less than adequate savings and are either forced back into the workforce at an old age, or are forced to live extremely poorly. When saving for retirement, try to take advantage of your company’s 401(k) options, Roth IRA’s, etc. Your company will usually match your contributions up to a certain percentage of your income which is a great way to find free money to put towards retirement. Especially if you have a very demanding job/lifestyle and you don’t have all the extra time in the world to put words investing your money, there are a plethora of passive investing strategies available to you in the meantime. Second, you want to have an emergency fund, a pool of liquid assets that are set aside for emergencies and unexpected expenditures, that way you have a fall back when confronted with scary emergencies such as hospital visits.

**Cars**

*Getting Started*

First off, and probably most important, figure out what kind of car you can realistically afford. Prequalify for a car loan at a credit union, which will usually give lower interest rates compared to regular banks and car dealerships (One place to do this is at [http://www.cuna.org/](http://www.cuna.org/)).  When deciding between vehicles, It’s important to check the repair data on the car, and find out how soon you can expect to make repairs, and how much you might have to shell out for them. (Look at Consumer Reports magazine for repair data). Second, check the insurance costs on your top three choices, the amounts will vary depending on a variety of factors, and can make or break a decision. If you are planning on financing a car, try to make it for a maximum of 48 months. A car that will take more than 48 months to finance, may not be the most affordable car choice for you. 

*Dealership tricks*

Do not let them run your credit, running lots of credit checks can lower your credit score, so make the dealership representative sign a release to not check your credit when giving them your driver’s license. Test driving at a dealership is pointless, there isn’t enough time for you to get to know whether you like the car or not, the option is mainly only there to prolong your stay and to pressure you to buy, while also providing time for them to run your credit while you’re away. If you want to try out a car before buying, just rent one for a weekend if you’re serious about buying it. Another tip, to avoid pesky salesman hovering next to you as you are trying to look at the exterior of a car, just visit the dealership after they’ve closed. Don’t buy third-party extended warranties, and only buy a warranty once you’ve compared prices and thought about it. [www.edmunds.com](https://www.edmunds.com) [www.kkb.com](https://www.kkb.com) are great places to visit to look up the actual dealer cost for the base model of the car. Then, add the cost for things like air conditioning, etc. to find the appropriate price of the car. Don’t rely on the dealership’s advertised MSRP for a car. If you aren’t settled on a particular car, try to get a deal for an unpopular car just a couple hundred above the dealership cost. Call the dealerships to see if they will match the best online price if you find a better deal online. Run a carfax report on any used car you plan on buying, and have it inspected before sealing the deal to make sure there are no defects.

*Ownership*

Take the car to a mechanic every year or every 15,000 miles for periodic maintenance. Beware of specialty shops, and if you have your oil changed at an oil-change shop, don’t authorize any other work. Don’t let a tow truck driver decide which repair place to take your car, they will sometimes have deals arranged with specific repair shops and are pocketing a profit behind your back. When taking your car into the shop, make sure the work ticket lists symptoms, not recommended repairs. If an estimate is large, get a second opinion. Don’t buy premium gas if your car doesn’t need it. For accidents, call the police, don’t drive away, then exchange insurance information. Next, report it to your insurance company, if it was the other person’s fault, contact their insurance company as well.

**Money**

**Saving &amp; Passive investment**

Try to save around 10% (or more!) of your income every month. Try to max out for 401(k) contributions up to what your employer will match, and put in the max 3,000 into Roth IRA’s. These are private/state subsidized investing strategies that everyone should try to take advantage of if able. For those unable to actively participate in active investing, Index funds are the way to go. Proven to be better on average versus most mutual funds, and are far safer than investing in specific stocks. For index funds, you can expect a return of about 10% every year, beating the inflation rate of around 3.15% every year. Compared to setting aside all your money in a savings account at a bank, you will probably only make around 1% off interest, effectively netting you a loss every year once you factor in inflation. However, you should not have all of your savings in the stock market, diversification of your portfolio is important, which can reduce overall risk by allocating difference investments amount various financial industries to maximize your net return every year. Along with diversification comes the idea of Liquidity, referring to how fast you can turn an asset into actual cash. The importance of having some easily liquefiable assets would be to cover large unexpected expenditures and cover for disasters. Under this reasoning, it would be justifiable to keep money in a checking/savings account at a bank, where it stays completely liquid while netting a small percentage of interest every year. The idea is that if say the stock market crashes, you would still net returns on property, or through other low-risk market securities. There is also the importance of starting early. Savings and starting to invest early will net you more money in the long run versus waiting until later in life to make bigger contributions. The earlier you start saving, the more you are making that is compounding every year. 

*Investing in Property.*

Assuming you are just starting to get into property, avoid fixer uppers and stick to houses that are already in good condition but are selling at below market value. Instead, when looking for a house to buy, look at things like neighborhood/schools/crime rating and see that that type of location/house would attract the demographic of tenant you want. Avoid buying houses that need core repairs like piping or electrical. Stick to houses that only need cosmetic repairs like hardwood floors, painting, and tiling. Check big expenses like the  HVAC system, roof, and foundation before finalizing a deal. Additionally, Buying a duplex and also living in it, or a house with roommates, will get you a lower financing loan rate while also letting you check on your tenants. When looking at how much rent to charge, look at the rental history if possible of the piece of real estate and compare it to similar properties in the same area. One tip when looking for houses: If there are other rental houses in the area offering deals such as “first month free”, or “no credit check required”, that means they other landlords are having a hard time finding tenants. Another thing to consider is vacancy, periods where you aren’t making. Estimate one month per year of vacancy, look at vacancy rates in your city. It’s also good to look for properties close by, so it becomes easier to do routine check-ups on the property and your tenant(s). Next, try to determine how much money you get earn every year from the property. Assuming you charge 2,000 per month in rent, half (or 1,000) will go to expenses like utilities, repairs, fees, etc. then minus off the loan/mortgage payment (ex. 800), then whatever is left is your profit (ex. 200). If investing 100,000 in a property nets you 12,000 a year (after expenses/loan), that’s 12% cash return. Analyze at least 30-50 rental deals to get a range. Factor in repairs as well when determining which one to actually purchase. Ignore the best, “too good to be true” type of deals because likely, It’s actually too good to be true. Instead, look at the top 25th percentile of good deals as more worthwhile investments. When investing in property it’s important to remember that property is almost always not a passive investment, and to avoid shelling out for huge repairs/costs it helps to do most smaller repairs yourself, so home ownership knowledge is crucial in holding an effective rental property.

**Renting**

*Being a Landlord*

If you rent a property, manage it as if it were a business. You have to treat your business like a business. Set a rent that’s fair for your market, not one that’s based on your mortgage payment. Avoid renting to family, and friends that might take advantage of you. Require prospective tenants to fill out an application, pay an application fee, and give you permission to pull a copy of their credit report. Make the security deposit a little higher or lower than, but not the same as the rent as to not confuse tenants when going over payments. For landlords with just 1-2 properties, include a repair clause that makes the tenant responsible for the first $50 cost of any repair. Then just charge a little less in rent This is to limit the number of times your tenants will call you whining about smaller repairs that require expensive contractors. You could just do the repairs yourself, but the repair clause is still nice to avoid needless complaints. Provide a $25 or $50 discount for early rent payment, and a $50 late fee on overdue payments. Do a move-in inspection and move-out inspection of the property to protect yourself in case you have to keep part or all of the security deposit to cover damage. (try to find move out/in inspection report forms online) If your tenants do not pay the rent, be prepared to evict them. If you’re relocating far away from your property, ask a friend or relative to handle the rental, in return for some compensation, or consider professional management. Remember that there are agencies that will help you find properties to invest in if you are too busy to engage in that process on your own.

*Being a Tenant*

Before agreeing to an application fee or deposit, ask about the length of the lease, the amount of rent, and the deposit amount. Second, Make sure the lease specifies that water service is included or billed a reasonable rate. Same to all other utilities that may or may not be covered. Remember to never sign an apartment lease on the spot. Take it home with you and read it. Additionally, be mindful that many leases renew automatically unless you notify the landlord that you are leaving. Make sure you are present for the move-in and move out inspection to make sure the landlord is honest. Point out possible flaws as to either take note of them to not be billed afterward for potential damages, or have your landlord fix something. If a landlord doesn’t give you back a security deposit, you have the right to sue in small claims court.

**Jobs**

*Earn What You’re Worth*

The sad reality is that most people have to change jobs to get paid what they’re worth. The rule of thumb is to switch jobs every two to five years to achieve a maximum income. Additionally, only expect a pay bump of around $5,000 to $10,000 in overall salary every time you switch jobs. This is important to keep in mind when weighing the pros and cons of leaving your current job. Using sites like [Payscale.com](https://Payscale.com) and [Salary.com](https://Salary.com) to find what other people in your position are getting paid, and use that knowledge when negotiating salary, and deciding when It’s time to jump ship. One method to achieve a higher pay would be to land a promotion at your current job, and leverage that new title into getting a better job offer. Just be prepared to have an excuse as to why you are leaving as to not make future employers question your loyalty.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Car dealerships suck, do it yourself. Index funds are cool, save lots of money, make lots of money, don't be stupid.

personalfinance,Formula for calculating mortage vs investment strategy,"I am looking for a formula(s) that I could plug into excel to accomplish the following:

Fixed values: $250,000 house, pay $50,000 down payment so my mortgage will be $200,000

I am looking to see what would be more beneficial with a 30 year fixed vs a 15 year fixed mortgage vs putting that money into the market and earning a certain rate, we will say 7% stock market return and a 4% mortgage rate for 15 year &amp; 4.5% mortgage rate for 30 year

First scenario: If I choose a 15 year fixed I will have higher monthly payments and will get the loan payed off quicker and pay less overall interest but will not invest the difference (between the 30 vs 15)  money into the stock market until after the loan is payed

Second scenario: If I choose a 30 year, I will have smaller monthly payments and would put the difference (if the 15 year was a monthly 2000 and the 30 was a monthly 12 I would put 800 into stock market) into the market, but I would pay more interest overall

Could someone link some formulas or calculators to help decide which would be more beneficial? Preferably one where I could change the loan term for the house, change the down payment, change the interest rate on both stock and mortgage rate etc.",finance
personalfinance,Advise on my refinance!,"Hey guys I’m know you guys have seen this a million times but im just looking for some quick advice and guidance on refinancing my car as I am young and don’t want to fuck over my future self (again). Two years ago I bought a car and didn’t know anything about loans or interest rates and I had no credit history and had to co-sign w my mom and her credit isn’t great so I obviously got a horrible rate, etc. and didn’t think much of it. I’ve been educating myself for the past couple months on finance and car loans since I am intending on paying off my car as fast as possible now that I have realized how bad I’m getting fucked. So down to business:

The numbers:
-Current car loan: 15,300
-Rate: 13.75
-Payments: 441 (have been paying additional 500-600)
-upside down ~2000 :’(

My credit has been building the past two years and my most recent FICO score is 704 meanwhile according to CK, I have 663 w TransUnion and 660 w Equifax. I am aware these aren’t supposed to be 100% accurate. 

My income has increased so I have been pouring as much money as I can into my car loan trying to lower bc it is about 2,000 dollars upside down. So I would like to refinance w a 24 month term so the interest will be as low as possible and I am pretty certain I can afford the high payments and add additional for the principal. 

So with all that said what I’m truly wondering is if I should refinance now or wait until my loan matches the value of my car? Also if there is something I clearly don’t understand please correct! I am looking to learn as much as possible to save myself that cash mula. Thanks in advance finance gang",finance

Banking,My bank keeps blocking my account through no fault of our own.,"Three weeks ago our bank Santander blocked our account. I had taken a deposit from a man to rent our holiday home this August. He was given my address name and email address but I accidently typed in my phone number one digit wrong. He went to his bank and reported me for fraud in March. I called him up, he apologised and said he got nervous as he'd been scammed before, and I pointed out I'd hardly give him my name, address and email address if I wanted to scam him! He said he still wanted to rent the holiday home and would sort it out immediately with his bank Lloyds. I expected it to be sorted out quickly but it wasn't. Despite him calling and calling into his bank my bank insisted they'd not heard from him. Eventually, 8 days later, Santander called me to say the block had been lifted as they realised it had been a miscommunication after calling his bank. They then sent me a letter to say the same thing, and have me £100 for inconvenience. Happy days. Except that a week later they blocked it again. The phonecall to the bank, a bundle of confused excuses and my account gets unlocked again that night. Now I'm really fed up though. The next day at 4pm it gets blocked again. That was just under a week ago. I've rung, emailed and threatened but still it remains locked. They keep telling me to go back to the original complainer. I have dozens of times. He's furious and more than embarrassed. His bank have closed the complaint long since. There's nothing left for me to do. The gentleman concerned is now offering to make the 4 hour drive to go with me into Santander. I'm not sure even this would work, I've written to the ombudsman, I've made complaints and I've written to newspapers. Up till now no one has responded. Surely this isn't legal?

personalfinance,Failed IRA Wiretransfer,"I wanted to take $1200 out of my IRA. Because I had a name change recently, and my IRA is in my old name and my current bank account in my new, I had to contact Vanguard directly to do the transaction in a way that would allow me to access the funds. They offered a check or a wire in my new name. I chose wire. I gave them the routing and acct number for my Fidelity account. I asked for state and federal witholding for the taxes and penalty. As it turns out, the routing and account number can’t be used for wire transfers, only ACH, but there was no way to know that. So, the money was sent back to Vanguard, and they reinvested the funds, less the tax withheld. So, I now have two transactions: a sale of $1200 and a rollover back of ~$750.

I have around close to $30,000 in credit card debt. Minimum payments amount to about around $700 to $800 a month total. Have a house with about $70,000 or so in equity.  


The credit card payments currently zero me out every month and sometimes worse if I try to do anything outside of just paying bills. I was wondering what my options are here?  


My credit score is suffering now and tanking and I cannot get another line of credit cards to attempt a debt transfer.  


I also looked at debt consolidation and from what I can tell they just pretty much tell you to stop making payments and they will attempt to negotiate down what you owe so you pay something to the credit card companies. This seems like a dick move, the debts are fair and I knew what I was getting into, just my financial situation drastically changed. It would also tank my credit score I imagine and ideally I'd like to fix it not ruin it further. This seems like a last resort and I don't want to cheat my debt. But if I drown, no one's getting anything anyway.  


I'm looking at taking out a loan on the equity of my house to pay just the credit cards off. The interest rates seem to be between 5% and 11% or so for these which is still better than the 20% on the credit cards. However this is a bit confusing because a lot of them are talking about refinancing my home and what not as well, which is not something I want to do. It seems foolish to borrow money to pay off other money, but in this case I'm paying less interest and from what the calculators tell me, less monthly payments as well. Just wondering what some pitfalls on this path are (other than losing your house if you don't pay) and that is assuming I qualify for that now, starting a new job with much less income.  


Bankruptcy seems like a dick and drastic move for the amount of debt I have, but right now I'm barely treading water and slipping a little. Again I'd rather not screw over the credit card companies and I'd like to use debt more responsibly in the future. However I also don't know what other pitfalls await. Will I lose my car (which is paid off) will they come in take my Computer, electronics etc towards the bankruptcy? I just don't know and googling brings up a ton of conflicting information and straight up advertisements about all of this.",finance

I'm a US Citizen living abroad (Bone Fide Residency Test). I live with my wife - She's not an American citizen and has no US earnings. My child is a US Citizen living with us overseas - a qualified dependent.

This year, TurboTax suggested that I file as ""Head of Household""

* If I file as I normally do (""Married Filing Separately""), the lower deduction has me ending up paying a small amount of taxes. Not the end of the world, and it's small enough that I may be able to offset it somehow.
* Do I support my daughter more than half? My wife and I slush our money together and pay for whatever she needs. Does that count?

# Some housing options to consider

Read through all of these before you settle on which options to try first. If it starts to be too overwhelming or you need help, please reach out to one or more of the resources listed above for advice and support.

1. **If your home living situation was not abusive** and there is an option to make up with your parent(s) or caregiver, please consider it (even if it means a curfew, chores and hard work, or following rules you don't like). You can use this time to save up more money, find work, finish high school, and generally prepare for living on your own.

   If things are uncomfortable at home and you're allowed to simply spend more time elsewhere, that's often a good option to reduce tension at home. Some ideas: get a cheap gym membership, do your studying at the library, get a part-time job, join an after-school group, or volunteer.

   If you have fundamental disagreements with your family or caregivers and this would be a possible reason for you to be kicked out, it's probably best to delay announcing these until you're on your own and doing well independently. Maybe they are not great people. Maybe you don't believe in the same things. As long as you are safe, it can wait until you are in a better position to be independent. As they say, the best revenge is living a good life.

2. It's generally illegal for your parent(s) or guardian to actually kick you out. **If your home living situation was not abusive**, one option to consider is contacting the police to get back into your home.
    - If you're an underage child (under 18 in most of the United States) and not legally emancipated, it's almost always illegal for parent(s) or a guardian to kick you out.
    - Even if you're an adult or legally emancipated, but living at home, it's generally illegal to kick you out without following the relevant laws including sufficient notice. The specifics depend on the circumstances and your location (you may consider posting to /r/legaladvice as well).

  Contacting the police may be unpleasant and you will need to listen to the police officer, but your parent(s) or guardian will also need to listen and allow you back into their home. You shouldn't be carrying anything illegal (drugs, alcohol if you're underage, or illegal weapons) in general regardless, but absolutely do not have any of those items on you if you contact the police.

3. If you have any relatives that you can reach that would let you stay with them for any period of time, this is one of the best available options if you've been kicked out. Aunt or uncle lives in the next state? Call them and find a way to get there. Any non-abusive relative that you know is probably a better option than heading to a shelter. Grandparents, cousins, aunts, uncles, step-siblings, you name it.

4. Failing that, your next best bet is to contact friends, crash on a couch, and ask anyone you know that might put up with you. Try to consider *any* workable and safe options. For example, your ex's parents liked you and you're on good terms? Call them and ask if you can sleep on their couch for a few days until you figure something out.

5. While you're living on someone else's dime, in a place that isn't yours, friends, family, shelter, whatever it is, try you best to be on your best behavior.  That means:
 - Try to avoid drugs and alcohol. If you need help with substance abuse, please reach out to some of the resources linked above.
 - Try to respect any rules of the household or establishment and stay out of trouble.
 - Keep your space clean and maintain your personal hygiene.
 - Try to avoid being a negative presence.

6. It may be very difficult to find a better option, especially on short notice, but living and sleeping on the street is very dangerous, especially as a teenager. **Contact one of the above help lines and they will help you find a safe place to sleep.**

# Preparing if you think you might be kicked out or may need to leave soon

1. Try to avoid accelerating the process and use any time you have to save up money and prepare. Your own safety comes first, though.

2. Try to make sure you will have a place to stay. If you can sleep on a couch for a month and save up more money before renting a room, do it. You want to save up money as much as reasonably possible.

3. Try to have your birth certificate, identification, passport, diplomas and anything else you will need. Store important documents at the home of a trusted friend or family member if possible. Note that your parent(s) or guardian aren't obligated to give you their copy of certain documents and you should not put yourself at risk to retrieve these because you can order a copy later ([link for United States](https://www.usa.gov/replace-vital-documents)).

4. Plan for the worst case even though it might not happen. Your parents may not support you going to school, fill out financial aid paperwork for you, etc. If you can't afford to pay for school on your own, you may need a different plan for continuing your education such as going to community college while working.

5. If and when you need to spend money for a place to stay, try to spend as little money as possible on rent. That usually means renting a room instead of an apartment, having some roommates, etc.

# Financial Accounts

- Joint bank accounts can be emptied by either account holder at any time so if you're old enough to open your own bank account (18 or 19 in the United States), open a new bank account *at a different bank* from the one used by your family. [Local credit unions, online banks, and online credit unions are popular recommendations here. Use a local credit union if you will need to deposit cash.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/banks_and_credit_unions)

- If you're not old enough to open an account where you live, see if an adult that you trust will help open a joint bank account with you. When you are old enough to open your own account, open one as soon as possible and transfer your money over.

- Sign up for electronic statements and consider using a different postal address (e.g., the address of a friend or trusted adult) so statements don't get delivered to your home.

- If you're having trouble finding an bank or credit union that will allow an adult that isn't a parent or guardian to open an account with you, the [Money account](https://www.capitalone.com/bank/checking-accounts/teen-checking-account/) offered by Capital One 360 is one option in the United States.

- [Check your credit report](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/ad5f5h/30day_challenge_1_get_on_top_of_your_credit/) and [freeze your credit](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/identity_theft) (sign up for credit monitoring before freezing your credit).

# School

## United States

If you're still in high school, ask a guidance counselor or principal at your school about continuing your education. The McKinney-Vento Act is a federal law that mandates the right of students regardless of their housing status. The law provides resources and support including provide transportation, free meals, and other services.

If you have questions about Federal student aid, and are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless read [this guide from the Department of Education](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/sites/default/files/homeless-youth.pdf).

CryptoCurrency,I traveled 1 year around the world on 1 BTC (and alts) -- and wrote a book about it.,"Afternoon all,

I posted a similar thing in r/ Bitcoin yesterday but also wanted to post here. You see, I didn't just use BTC to travel around the world -- I used alts too. I wanted to share that fact and get feedback on this subreddit too. Not sure how much this subreddit crosses with r/ bitcoin. I didn't want to leave anyone out. Right then, moving on:

&amp;#x200B;

6 months ago I wrote a post: ""Finished Traveling the World ... on 1 Bitcoin.""

Well, the comments and questions motivated me to write a book about the journey.

I put the book up on Amazon yesterday -- in honor of World Book Day.

**Stolen Wallets: And Where to Buy Them.**

If you enjoy Breaking Bad, it's like that -- with a bit of Terry Pratchett's humor mixed in.

Here's the back cover blurb:

\---------------------------------------------------

What's in your wallet? You okay with a stranger poking through it? I'm not. Never in a million. My wallet is my private little hell. Receipts for things I can't afford and a picture of an ex I still miss. But there I was, standing in a grubby back alley in Bangkok. Wallets scattered on a table in front of me. Crocodile skin Gucci, scuffed generic brown leather, even a DIY duct-tape wallet. Each and every one of them hot. The product of sneaky little fingers. The karma of drunk tourists distracted by scorpions on sticks. Curiosity killed my ethics. I picked one up. It was full. Not with money, of course, but with ...

These are the stories of my travels.20 countries, 12 months, 1 Bitcoin.From China to Europe. From late 2017 to late 2018. A historic year. The year of The Crypto Bubble. The big ride up.

At the start of the year I was just another desk jockey. Putting in my 9-to-5. Binge-watching Netflix alone. Then I bought that bitcoin for $4,700. Little did I know it would soon skyrocket to $20,000. Little did I know it was my golden ticket. My red carpet to a world of fast money, greed, hype, hope and corruption.

Until the bubble popped -- and the world of the newly rich began burning down.

\-------------------------------------------------------

That's the back cover. I've ran it by a few people. One said it was too edgy. Another said it was too much. A third didn't say anything because he's too busy.

If you have suggestions, lay em down.

The book is an unvarnished, uncensored log of my travels. It's intense and raw. I don't sugarcoat the scams and shilling I saw. But at the same time -- the crypto communities I met around the world -- they changed my perspective and opened my mind so much that, well, all I can say is bitcoin and blockchain are freedom, truth, and our future. It's just a fact.

Another fact I cover is how I had to convert some of my BTC to alts -- mostly LTC and ETH. In December 2017 and a few months before/after -- the price of transferring BTC skyrocketed. Once, I went to pay a hostel $12 for a night -- and the mining fee bumped $30. Times like that I had to sit on my laptop and sell BTC for LTC/ETH and pay using those.

Do you think Bitcoin maximalists will be offended by that? It couldn't be helped. I was on a tight budget -- even if my single BTC had hit $17k

&amp;#x200B;

Also, since I'm trying to become a writer and all that jazz, I'm trying a promotion tactic. You ever hear about Marguerite deCourcelle? The lady who painted a BTC prize into one of her paintings? There's also Pascal Boyart who hid a BTC prize in his mural of a modern French Revolution. Plus the whole $1 million crypto Satoshi's Treasure.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-12-28/your-bitcoins-are-waiting-in-the-painting-if-you-can-find-them](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-12-28/your-bitcoins-are-waiting-in-the-painting-if-you-can-find-them)

&amp;#x200B;

Well, I'd like to continue their tradition. It's a fun one. Hide a BTC prize and challenge people of intellect. To that effect I've loaded up a wallet with a bit of BTC. It's a standard wallet. The seed phrase is composed of 12 random words. I've hidden the 12 random words in my book. But since hiding them in a whole book would make finding them impossible -- I'll give out clues. 12 months, 12 clues.

And since I didn't have enough money to put a whole bitcoin in the wallet as a prize (I just put in 0.1 BTC) -- I'll instead dedicate 30% of my monthly sales to the wallet until it's swept. Who knows, with BTC's fresh bull run -- I hope whoever wins will have enough BTC to go travel around the world on it -- just like I did.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. From my post in r/ Bitcoin I learned that my 'word puzzle wallet' could be easily cracked. An intelligent chap said that as soon as I release the book the coding and cracking community would tear it apart. They'd use Johntheripper or custom code. I'm trying to avoid that. Nothing against such a solution -- but I'm hoping to make the prize entertaining for non-coders. People who enjoy word puzzles, crosswords, and playing Scrabble :P

Perhaps if anyone has ideas about how to hide the 12 word seed phrase?

personalfinance,Capital One venture CC reward changes,"So recently capital one changed the amount of miles required for gift cards.

personalfinance,How likely is it to be approved for a Car Loan with Student Debt?,"I am a senior graduating college this May. My current car is on it’s very last leg and needs some repairs that could exceed the value of the vehicle. 

I am curious how student loan debt factors in when trying to attempt for an auto loan, and if it were better to try to get financing directly from a dealer or my credit union? (I have preference towards option B, so I can shop around to more places). 

But my bigger question is if I should even bother  attempting if I have roughly 65k of student loans (mostly federal)? 

I have a job lined up and I have an offer letter signed by myself and the HR representative from the company confirming start date and salary. Could this suffice to prove I am able to pay back the loan?

personalfinance,"How much does a house REALLY cost? And how do you compare ""where you want to live"" against ""what's a good investment""?","Let's say you're looking to buy a house for 300k. How much will that *ACTUALLY* wind up costing, based on varying factors?

For example, when I bought my car for $12k, it's *actually* going to wind up costing me a whopping $17k if I continue making minimum payments. That is a significant difference, and I had no idea because I'd never taken out a loan before. Even now, I'm still not totally sure how it all ""math's out"".

personalfinance,Seeking advice to get ahead on student loan that is killing me,"**TL;DR - Stuck in a cycle of high-interest payments on a student loan that is tanking my credit score and having the domino effect of preventing me from getting ahead on my debts. Looking for consolidation options on a private loan from Navient that is currently at a high variable interest rate.**

Background: In 2006, took out a $12k private loan at variable interest and it seems to always be between 16-20%. Still don't get that. --&gt; Actually, it appears that I am now paying about 38% interest. See Edit 3 below. 

Paid interest-only for years because I was super broke. This hurt me. Have struggled to pay the principle for the past few years. Have missed a few payments and paid late, but have mostly paid it on time and have been in automatic payments since August 2018. Despite this, it still dings my credit score (because it retains the bad and ignores the good for 7 years). Because of that, things like auto loans come at really high interest rates. So I struggle to get ahead on anything. And I'm in a cycle. I owe $14K on it today even though I've paid on it for 12 years. Unsure how this is possible. Penalties and high interest and those interest-only years, I guess.

I would welcome some advice on how to get this thing under control and out of my life (paid off before I'm 90).

Had another plea with them today to lower the monthly payments and they won't. So I'm stuck paying an uncomfortable amount with an interest rate that effing fluctuates with the market. I cannot consolidate it with my other consolidated loans - it's private. I've tried. My other loans are handled just fine FWIW because that company works with me. Navient does not budge.

I have managed to rid myself of a lot of other debts over the years. This one is the only one I can't get my hands around to control. Any thoughts are welcome. Please and thanks!

**Edit 1:** I have already assessed my monthly income and expenses with this student loan company time and time again. The bottom line is, they won't budge on the amount they want me to pay every month. 1. It's uncomfortable 2. It will continue ad infinitum and I just want a lower interest rate to pay it down myself, in hopefully 3-5 years' time. What I have going with this company, isn't working. I'm seeking refinancing options for a private student loan.

**Edit 2:** Respectfully, I am not seeking the answers ""pay more,"" ""figure out your monthly expenses"" or the like. I am seeking someone who is financially savvy enough to be able to offer solid advice to a laymen about why this loan might be so problematic and what constructive things I can do to get it managed. I have advised myself to ""pay more"" over the years and obviously it isn't working.

**Edit 3:** I just checked my payment history over the past year and the ""interest"" amount per month is fucking THIRTY EIGHT PERCENT of the total payment.

For everyone advising me to ""just learn how loans work,"" I know how loans work.  Obviously, this loan has some pretty insane baggage attached to it.",finance

energy,RPS paper by U Chicago (was Shellenberger),"Here is the University of Chicago paper referenced in the other post:

&amp;#x200B;

[https://bfi.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/BFIEPIC\_WP\_201962\_v3.pdf](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/BFIEPIC_WP_201962_v3.pdf)

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the problem with the paper. It attempts to correlate state RPS adoption with customer electricity prices. This is not valid because of the many uncontrolled variables.

&amp;#x200B;

They have theorized a model of the IRP process and correlated it to a brief number of years while omitting the uncontrolled variables. They could have done much better by doing the work to talk to generators, balancing authorities and utilities. They would have done much better using wholesale price and self dispatch (distribution utility owned captive generation) costs. There is a strong argument that self dispatch is more expensive than buying in the wholesale market. DER is not even on their radar.

&amp;#x200B;

It's worth a read for the references and some of the high level descriptions, not exactly right, but good enough, of utility processes.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Here are the problems:

Retail prices include distribution maintenance, upgrades and non-energy operations costs. Utilities are also very sensitive to interest rates, it's not unusual to have long term debt about equal to gross revenue.

&amp;#x200B;

Vertically integrated utilities operating in a single state as their own balancing authority will have captive self-dispatched generation and buy energy on the market. Therefore any distribution utility's energy cost will be a weighted sum of all the hourly or sub-hourly energy buys over the year.

&amp;#x200B;

You can't separate out the cost of renewables impact on retail rates without going into every wholesale energy transaction and the detailed financials of the distribution utility.

&amp;#x200B;

Wide area RTO/ISOs like MISO, PJM, ISONE and SPP operate across multiple states. In that case you would have to go into the RTO/ISO wholesale energy purchase records - many are on 15 minute scheduling, each block with on the order of 100 generators. Then you would have to look at the stack and see what cleared. Finally you would have to see if the take by each distribution utility was constrained by the RPS of the state of the end customer.

&amp;#x200B;

The purest examples would be Texas and New York. Texas, the purest free market state, and with abundant fossil generation, has had very successful wind penetration. New York is different, they have a mature generation fleet and import Canadian hydro. New York had a large utility physical plant and revenue loss from Hurricane Sandy.  So state policy has been to spend more to get more resiliency and the customers are willing to pay for it.

&amp;#x200B;

The other problem with the paper are rehashing 3 common theories of why renewables are more expensive in the introduction section and throughout the paper. What the authors do not understand because they have never worked in the industry is that distribution utilities (retail) and balancing authorities (wholesale) are very aggressive at analyzing the cost of any decision, and minimizing it.

&amp;#x200B;

RPS essentially creates a predictable long term business environment to build generation in to. But that new generation is very critically analyzed before build by the utilities and it is often subject to very competitive markets at buy time.

&amp;#x200B;

Their methodology does not include the natural retirement of old generators, or requirements that existing generators may face requirements to bring economic externalities, costs they impose on neighbors, into their production costs. Examples would be the cost of complying with the Mercury Air Toxics Rule, other air pollution rules that may become stricter, ash disposal, and post-Fukushima containment gas release filtering.

&amp;#x200B;

They seem to hold up combined cycle natural gas turbines as the least cost source. But our natural gas pipeline network lacks the redundancy of the grid. Pipeline outages, though rare, can take out that generation, while the grid itself is continually analyzed for N+1, N+2, etc. transmission and generation unit outages. Pipeline redundancy is a known problem at NERC and FERC, but the new natural gas generators rarely are connected to a redundant gas grid, thus are externalizing their resilience costs to be paid in outages.",energy

Roughly $130k take home between the wife and I. 

$40k liquid between emergency funds and short term checking. 

$250k+ between long term savings/retirement accounts. (Roth and retirement maxed out)

$3100 Mortage per month (high, I know, but the property has done extremely well and has been an awesome investment and I’m in a very high COL area). 

Between the mortgage, utilities, pets, food we are saving about $3k a month direct into accessible savings accounts. 

Crux of the issue: I drive the same car I have since I was 16 which has been a huge boon since I haven’t had payments on it since high school. Lately it’s become less reliable (multiple costly one time repairs) and the gas mileage has become prohibitive since I drive about 250 miles per week (around $100 a week in gas in my area). 

I have access to a 0% loan, term length very negotiable. 

SO, can I/should I be looking at a Tesla Model 3 (primarily looking to save on gas and have some convenience features for my commute).  At the options I would want it would be about $60k total, less the immediate rebate of $2500 and federal tax credits of $3750, so if I manage my taxes I could bring the cost down to $54k-ish within a year.

personalfinance,Cash Out Refinance in Texas,"I currently own a home with a mortgage.  I'm only four years into the mortgage with $169k left to go.  Home is valued at approximately ~~$300k~~  $320k (see edit).  We have an FHA loan at 4% and are getting hit with mortgage insurance.  I was researching refinancing into a conventional loan and got the idea to maybe do a cash out refinance to do several major projects we have in mind - remodeling our kitchen, expanding our backyard (we're on a hill and the side/front yard is useless), plus use some of that to pay off a higher interest loan we took out to build a front porch, and use a small amount to cover the deductible on installing a new roof on our house.  All in all we'd take out approximately $80,000, new loan amount would be roughly $256,000 over 30 years at 4.625% APR.  I know it's a bit of a higher interest rate, but since we're so early in the mortgage the numbers seem to be OK.  We turn our home into our dream house with those two remodels.  I'm hoping someone can talk some sense into me and tell me this is a bad idea, because I'm seeing way more upside than downside and that makes me nervous!

personalfinance,Why shouldn't I take a longer auto loan if it allows me to pay off all my debts faster and save money?,"Internet wisdom tells me that taking auto loan over 60 months is a terrible, terrible idea. But the reasons given are always about going underwater or paying too much interest -- they never assume that you pay off the loan early.

We know the debt avalanche is the most efficient way to pay off debt by tackling the highest interest accounts first.  Including an auto loan I estimate that my monthly minimum payments will be  $800 (7 Student loans, 1 auto loan, 0 credit card debt), though I am able to contribute $1400 monthly to all my debts.

With this contribution (and a 48 month car loan), I am set to pay  off all my debts including the car, in 44 months and pay $7000 in interest across all accounts.

But, if I extend the loan out to 96 months at the same interest rate, I am able to pay off my debts in 43 months and pay only $5900 in interest.  This is a total savings of $2000 ($1100 in interest + $900 for the final payment).

Increasing the car loan slashes the monthly minimum payment and I am able to put more toward my highest interest accounts sooner. The car would be paid off in 32 months on a 96 month loan and 33 months on 48 month loan; it will at no point be underwater (I'll never owe more than the car is worth).

So as long as I am able to keep my $1400/mo contribution to my debts, why is it poor financial sense to take a long-term auto loan?",finance

I currently pay off $200 in just interest each month, but my loans will become due next year. Those payments are estimated to be $350 per month.


I was planning on keeping the savings I have as an emergency fund and putting them into a high-interest savings account. You need a US address to do that, and I have a friend who is willing to let me use his. The options I'm considering:


1. Throw €5500 or so into a high-interest savings and keep the €2k in my foreign account for small emergencies/entertainment.


2. Throw €5500 or so at my student loans and keep the €2k in my foreign account.


3. Throw €5500 at my student loans then keep €2k in a US-based high-savings account. I wouldn't really be able to touch this as I think the fees associated with moving that money would be higher than the interest gained.

Called credit card company multiple times and they just couldn't block FedEx from charging me, and called FedEx they said there's nothing they could do. They are still charging me that amount as of today.

Ok so obligatory alt account because of privacy reasons. I cannot describe how frustrated I am but I don't really know what the next steps would be. Long time lurker too, so sorry if this is terrible formatting and English is not my first language so forgive me.

&amp;#x200B;

In mid March I decided to move to another city because of a new job offer, and I decided to ship some boxes to my new apartment (worst decision I've made in my life probably). Long story short, I dropped off 8 boxes at my local FedEx location using FedEx Ground, which had a nice delivery guarantee of two business days.  I couldn't fit all 8 into my car so I had to create two shipments and drop them off twice. I was billed around $500 for these 8 boxes (one $300 and one $200) on the day I shipped them.

&amp;#x200B;

Then I moved, and was busy doing moving stuff. A week and a half later after settling in I found out on my credit card (Amex) statement that FedEx had been billing me the same $300 and $200 EVERY DAY since I made the transaction in person. Imagine having $500 billed to you every day for services you did not purchase. So I called FedEx, and they said because it hasn't been 7 business days so they couldn't see an invoice, and told me to wait.

&amp;#x200B;

Ok so I thought it was just some weird billing methodology it's no big deal, and I kinda forgot about it. Which I know is stupid because after all I was getting charged $500 every day, but I believed in corporations and their ability to fix these little things you know, and I don't know which one is more stupid I guess.

I later thought ok cool so I'll let Amex handle this and I already disputed all these charges and froze my card - what could go wrong?

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward last Thursday, I discovered that despite the freeze and merchant block that Amex did for me, FedEx was still able to continue charging me EVERY DAY for $500. By that time my credit card balance was around $8,000 already and I freaked out. I called Amex, was told that FedEx was able to charge me because first it was recognized as a recurring bill, and secondly they first charged me as FedEx Ground, and later after the block they charged me as FedEx. The agent said he placed a new block and I should not see any more charges coming through. They did, in the same manner, EVERY DAY for $500.

&amp;#x200B;

I called FedEx again, was told because I wasn't the ""bill to"" party (they said they bill to the location so the bill to party is the location I went to), so they couldn't tell me anything, and I needed to write to their remittance research department, which has no phone number. I wrote them an email with all the information, and got the response as ""you need to dispute these charges with your credit card company and you may want to cancel this card."" Simple as that, no solutions, will not stop charging me, no apologies and no nothing. Called again, and the agent went ""sorry but there is nothing I personally can do, you will have to contact your credit card company"". I know this is probably something above their pay grade, and there was nothing this agent could personally do. But they still keep charging me.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought about cancelling my card, but I heard that they could still charge you even after the card is cancelled. I called Amex again, asked multiple times about why and how this could happen, and despite all the agents telling me there would be no more charges coming through, the next day FedEx charges me for $500.

worldpolitics,Trainings of the Eastern Military District make Tokyo nervous,"Recent events show that Japan’s interest in Russian territory, in particular, the Kuril Islands, is not waning. In this regard, the implementation of the plan «Great Japan to the Urals» could be the first priority of the Land of the Rising Sun. Not having received the expected territorial dispute with Russia, Tokyo may well strike at Sakhalin and the South Kuril Islands, after which it will deploy the United States military bases on the Kuril Islands.

If we consider the armed forces of the two countries, at first glance, the Japanese side has a clear advantage. So, Russia in the Far Eastern Military Theatre has 25 submarines, 10 warships of the ocean sea zone and 32 coastal. While from the Japanese side - 66 ships, including five destroyer-helicopter carriers, 18 submarines, and a third of them are new. There are 7 missile, 8 landing, 25 mine-sweeping boats, 5 sea tankers, 2 control ships, 2 search and rescue vessels, 1 mine-layer, 3 large landing ships and 2 small landing ships, and about 180 aircraft and 140 helicopters.

However, the means of fire and nuclear destruction that are in service with the Eastern Military District will not give Japan the slightest chance. It is no coincidence that the Eastern Military District exercises in the Kuril Islands cause Tokyo to become more and more nervous. And this is despite the fact that Russia officially informed Tokyo about shooting practice from 4 to 5 and from 8 to 12 April in the area of ​​the Russian island of Iturup. The Japanese government expressed another protest to Russia: «This is unacceptable, since it concerns the strengthening of the Russian military presence on the four northern islands and contradicts our position regarding these islands».

In total, about 500 soldiers and officers and about 70 pieces of equipment took part in the exercises. According to legend, the Russian motorized infantry broke through the defenses of the enemy on the shore. The actions of the infantry covered T-72B tanks and BMP-2 armored vehicles. Moreover, the fire support of the riflemen was provided by the grenade throwers and the calculations of the 120-mm mortars «Sani».

In the armament of the Eastern Military District is quite a large number of different military equipment: nuclear and diesel submarines, cruisers, aircrafts, armored vehicles. Including «Grad», «Tornado-G» and «Uragan» multiple rocket launchers, «Konkurs», «Shturm-S» and «Kornet» anti-tank missile systems, «Iskander» tactical complexes, unmanned aerial vehicles «Orlan-10», artillery guns of different caliber, in particular, self-propelled installations «Acacia», «Gvozdika», «Hyacinth», «Msta-S», «Malka», mortar complexes «Sani», 240-mm self-propelled mortars «Tulip».

Every year, up to one and a half thousand new and modernized models of weapons, military and special equipment arrive in the troops of the Eastern Military District. Thus, only from the beginning of 2019, 120 new modern T-80 tanks were received by the troops of the Eastern Military District. Combat vehicles strengthened the combined-arms units of the district, stationed in the Amur and Sakhalin regions, as well as in the Primorsky Territory. The received equipment due to the installed modern equipment, including multichannel gunner sights, weapon stabilizers, TBH-5 surveillance devices, radio stations, and modular dynamic protection will significantly increase the effectiveness of the use of tank units in solving combat training tasks, are confident in the command of the Eastern Military. 

The 18th machine-gun and artillery division has been deployed on the Kuril Islands, which is estimated at 3.5 thousand people. The compound is equipped with tanks, armored vehicles, multiple rocket launchers, towed and mortar guns. Since 2015, air defense units with several Tor-M2U anti-aircraft systems have been on combat duty of the division.

In 2016, the «Bastion» anti-ship missile system was stationed on Iturup Island, and the «Bal» complex was located on Kunashir Island. The range of Kh-35U missiles used by the «Bal» missile complex is 260 km, the «Bastion» can fire with the winged «Onyxes» with a range of up to 600 km, and according to some sources, even more. The measures taken should ensure, if necessary, the defeat of aircraft carrier and ship strike groups in the Pacific Ocean, if they make an attempt to get to the coast.

Moreover, Russia has deployed coastal radar «Mys-1» and hydro-acoustic complexes on the Kuril Islands, thereby creating a continuous zone for detecting and tracking any targets near the archipelago - surface, submarine and air. This station is capable of detecting ships and boats at a distance of up to 200 kilometers. And at a range of up to 60 km, the radar automatically takes on tracking up to 89 targets. The radar can be easily moved as it is placed on a car trailer.

It is planned that the share of the latest weapons of various military districts of the Russian Federation will be 70% by 2020. Given the degree of equipment of the Eastern Military District with reliable and modern weapons, the Japanese side can only express numerous protests on this issue, glancing cautiously towards Russia.",energy

gaming,The Harry Potter TCG,"I've been collecting the TCG for a little while and getting 2 decks in the mail sometime this next week. I've been trying to find the main reason behind it but I've not really found anything other than a lawsuit 

### Lawsuit

In 2002, Wizards of the Coast filed a lawsuit against former vice president of operations Charles Federline, alleging that he cost the company more than $93,000 by undermining the bidding process for the print work for the cards.  [\[Source\]](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Harry_Potter_Trading_Card_Game)

&amp;#x200B;

I can't remember where but I read that the artist behind the cards wasn't getting paid what he wanted to get paid, thus, he sued and it cost WOtC money, enough to make him quit and the game to stall and then never come back. 

&amp;#x200B;

 Maybe this will help?

CryptoCurrency,Why lightning? Answering all questions as I see it evolve.,"I am aware of some limitations of lightning at the moment. If you run your own node majority of issues are easy to solve. Once bitcoin is global currency you don’t or rarely have to close channels. You can open direct channels with your family or friends which you use most common and for all your life making payments transfer easy.  No other blockchain can scale as much as lightning if we are looking at global adoption it’s million tps. If you are talking about onboarding channels we all know we are still 10 or 15 years away from any crypto mass adoption so it’s plenty of time to onboard majority. By that time the hardware tech should have also evolved to an extent that you should be able to run full nodes on raspi 100 with 25-50 mb blocks.. costing still as of today.. that would be time to increase block size to 25-50 mb range ...boosting further onvoarding...static lnd channel back up is here with lnd 0.6 so recovering lost funds has gotten a lot easier. From here on lightning is only going to advance further not backwards if you understand any budding technology. I am running a full lightning node for last 4 months on raspi can access anywhere from world without any flaw doing micro transactions between WOS and my node wallet  with my mobile. It is flawless. Using hubs third party if you can’t be online 24x7 is again optional but I foresee lnd nodes built in your routers modems or TVs in future running in background solving this further. Third party trust, hubs is again optional if you run your node. Routing is not a problem if you connect to good one or two nodes at the moment. If they go offline close your channels find other ones. Same can’t hold true if your money gets stuck in a bank account. As lightning is growing it’s becoming a no issue. It would be very exciting to see coming 5 years to see this tech grow from a baby to a full blown adult.

Finally, I would say why such a complicated appearing solution or tech when we have simpler more scalable appearing solutions already available? The simple answer to this is when technology entangles with economics and censorship resistance there is never going to be a better answer than bitcoin due to its time tested tech, monetary policy, incentives and most important the community.

Also, imagine if 1 btc goes 1 or 5 mill today’s lightning transaction would go 1000% times in terms of dollar so do not need much for day today transaction even today with current state of lightning .",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Need Advice on Student Loans + PSLF,"Hey all,

I need some consultation regarding my student loans. I currently have 15k in student loans from my undergraduate career at UC San Diego and am going to take on more loans now that I am enrolled for a masters at CSU Global (\~15k in tuition).

Here is a list of my current loans from undergraduate degree:

Total  DIRECT STAFFORD SUBSIDIZED $4,195 Interest: $118

Total  FFEL STAFFORD UNSUBSIDIZED $1,825 Interest: $357

Total  FFEL STAFFORD SUBSIDIZED $7,800 / Interest: $284

**Total All Loans: $15,532 / Total Interest: $1,094**

&amp;#x200B;

And I accepted loans for my first four classes at grad school. (3 credits each and 12 units total of 36 needed).

## Federal Direct Unsubsidized (Grad) Loan (04/15/2019-12/01/2019)

Amount(USD):Estimated Disbursement Date Term

$4,296.0006/19/2019/ 19SD

$4,296.0008/21/2019/ 19FB

$4,294.0010/16/2019/ 19FD

**Total Disbursement(USD) $12,886.00 Awarded**

&amp;#x200B;

At this rate, I would take on an additional **$38,658** in student debt for just \~$15,000 in tuition on top of my undergraduate student loans of $15,000.

&amp;#x200B;

I am taking too much on I know, but I could use the extra money as of now as I am preparing for a move to Alaska in an initially low paying job as an Americorps VISTA, which I currently am working as and am making it work. So aside from tuition costs, I will have an extra $2,901 totalling $8,703. I am currently taking too much money, but this extra cash may ease the burden of moving to a new state, so I am planning on readjusting my loans so that it only covers tuition.

But here is the thing. I am a returned Peace Corps Volunteer and now an Americorps VISTA most likely extending an extra year. I have been in forbearance for about 3 years now. Now that I have taken on more loans for a masters, I am planning on consolidating all qualifying loans and getting on Public Service Loan Forgiveness. (I kicked myself for not doing this sooner, but am happy considering you restart at 0 payments every time you consolidate, so maybe waiting until now will pay off. Does anyone know if I could possibly qualify my time in the Peace Corps toward payments even though I was in forbearance? Maybe count previous payments toward PSLF? Or would I have had to be in the public sector while paying?

I am planning on applying the education award of $6,000 from VISTA to my consolidated loans, which I believe will qualify for 12 payments. So my biggest question regarding loans for grad school is this: Should I take on as much loans as possible if I plan on staying true to PSLF on an income based repayment plan, or should I take on the minimum just in case I don't end up working in the public sector for 10 years and make those 120 payments? I have credit card debt that I could potentially pay off with excess loans since the loan interest rate would be significantly lower than the credit cards one their 0 % APR rates expire.

Any advice on here is greatly appreciated. Cheers!",finance

personalfinance,Student loan questions,"I was looking for advice regarding repayment of my Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loans. 1. My loans are currently in grace period until June 2019 2. I am in the PSLF program (120 payments beginning in June 2019) 3. I owe a total of $140,000 4. My current fixed rates vary from a high of 6.8 to a low of 5.31%

I am wondering if it would be worth looking into loan consolidation for my federal loans. It would not affect my repayment eligibility period for PSLF, because I have not started making payments.

My monthly repayment options as current are more than I realistically can afford - without major adjustments to living arrangements/transportation. I have a good job with a Masters degree, but work in nonprofit, so my income is not super impressive.

I appreciate any feedback.",finance
personalfinance,Student loans: Should I prioritize paying down my federal loan w/ graduated repayment plan or private consolidation loan?,"I have about $49k in student loans outstanding with three different providers, and I want advice as to how I should prioritize paying them down now that I have paid off my credit card. Here are my loans listed oldest (2010) to newest.

Nelnet | balance: 1,145 | monthly payment: 49

1 - 1,145 @ 5.75%

FedLoan | balance: 27,000 | monthly payment: 225 (for now)

1 - 1,843 @ 4.25%2 - 2,027 @ 4.25%3 - 1,613 @ 4.25%4 - 4,895 @ 3.15%5 - 4,977 @ 3.15%6 - 1,879 @ 3.61%7 - 9,535 @ 3.61%8 - 223 @ 3.61%

Lendkey | balance: 20,746 @ 4.99% | monthly payment: 434

1 - 20,746

Total right now I am paying about $700 per month towards minimum payments, but I should have about $400-500 to put towards debt paydown after I account for bills and savings moving forward.

The Lendkey loan was a consolidation from Fedloan loans that were above 5%. That is a five year, fixed rate, and I just opened it a few months ago, so I basically have 5 years left on it.

I have been paying on the FedLoan loans since Dec 2014. I \_think\_ I signed up for a ten year graduated repayment plan, but I don't see the details for that on the FedLoan servicing site, so I can't confirm. If that is the case, I am expecting another 5.5 years to pay for this one, and considering my payments now, I expect the minimum here to jump quite a bit.

Over the past three months, I have put an extra $500 each month towards the Nelnet loan, both to get it off the books and because it is the highest interest.

My question is, after that guy is paid off, where should I prioritize the debt paydown? The private loan is higher interest (4.99%), but the payment will be predictable. The Federal loans have lower interest  (4.25%), but I have no idea when the minimum payment will increase and by how much, so I don't know if I should consider that uncertainty along with interest rates.

personalfinance,Should I take a personal loan to pay off credit card debt if the interest rate is roughly the same?,"First time poster, so I apologize if this is redundant or the format is off, etc.

I have pretty shitty credit (score around 600). I have three credit cards and was handling them responsibly until I got in dire straits and had to put some expenses on them.  While I’m never late or miss a payment, they are all hovering at their limits and I’m usually only able to pay a little over the minimum payment. The interest rate varies from 22-26% on my cards. I have been approved for a personal loan to pay off my credit card debt, but the loan interest rate is 25%. The loan payment would be less than my minimum credit card payments, but I’d also end up paying nearly double what I borrowed over the term of the loan if I’m understanding it correctly. Just wondering if anyone has any advice on which is my better option?",finance
personalfinance,Paying off student loans early with money currently invested/saved vs monthly payments,"This may be a dumb question and I think I know the answer but here it goes. I have 5 Federal Stafford loans with relatively low interest rates all managed by the same company. They are rounded as follows:

$2,400 at 4.2%
$3,100 at 4%
$4,000 at 3.5%
$5,500 at 3.5%
$900 at 3.5%

The loans are the only debt my wife and I currently have. The minimum monthly payment is $180 and we're currently paying $250 due to our current budget. The payment is applied somewhat evenly to all of the loans. 
We're both 25yo and a year out of school. We are working on our savings account, currently has around 4k, and contribute to individual 401ks. 

We also have about 23k invested in mutual funds. My question is does it make any sense to pay off some or all the loans over 4% with the money currently invested or saved? Or is it better to continue to make over payments each month for the life of the loans or until the principal balance is low enough to pay off completely without destroying our savings?",finance
personalfinance,Follow up to impossible balance from yesterday.,"So I found my contract and the terms are: 

$8400 principal (rounded up to nearest hundred)

$74 monthly payment (rounded down to nearest dollar)

Interest Rate: 9.95% fixed

Amortization: 180 months


So as I stated before I got a new job 10 months into my contract and on my 12th payment increased the payment to $132 a month even.

As it stands I made 11 payments of $74 at the start of the loan and have made 53 payments of $132. I had originally thought it was 7 years but it was 6.

So what I found out from the lender is they charge the interest right up front for the entire loan. Meaning if you paid it off the day after the loan you still pay for 15 years of interest.

Is this even legal?

personalfinance,Which financing option is better for law school?,"\*For context this is in Canada\* 

So I recently got accepted to law school (Hooray!) and I'm trying to figure out financing. 

\- Tuition &amp; other school costs are \~$23,000/ year (law school is three years with 10 months of articling afterward)

\- Rent is \~$1,200 month

\- I will likely not be working during school, perhaps only the summers after second and third year

I was offered a $125,000 loan from one bank at prime rate (currently 3.95%) with interest-only payments until 2 years after graduation. The interest rate remains at prime and does not change (unless prime rate changes).  


Another bank offered me $135,000 at prime +0.5, no payments at all (with interest still compounding) until 2 years after graduation, and The interest rate remains at prime +0.5 and does not change (unless prime rate changes).

&amp;#x200B;

I have asked the second bank to match the interest rate of the first bank, but in case they won't, is it better for me to have:

a) a - slightly- larger loan amount, higher interest rate, and *no* payments while in school

&amp;#x200B;

OR

b) a -slightly- lower loan amount, lower interest *with* interest-only payments throughout my schooling.

personalfinance,What should I do with profit from selling a house in one country but living in another?,"I'm about to earn profit from the sale of a house in Australia. The reason for the sale was mostly to divide the profits from a long term investment that my brother and I shared. Basically he's starting a life with his wife and they want to buy elsewhere. I live in Europe and will probably live there for another 3-4 years. I earn in GBP and EURO. I don't earn anything in AUD at the moment and my Aussie bank account is purely for house payments. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was thinking of doing one of the following options and would appreciate some advice:

&amp;#x200B;

1) Put AUD in an Aussie high interest account. Simple and relatively low risk but crap returns at current rates. 

2) Put AUD in the Australian Stock Exchange for 5+ years - I've never bought ASX shares. This seems a lot more risky but possible good returns. 

3) Buy another investment property in Australia - Might be another gamble if the market falls some more but it'd be nice to be in the property market still. 

4) My wife has dual citizenship in India and we can invest in high interest banks over there. Indias economy is growing, the interest rates are better too. Plus we already know the ropes from friends and family who have benefited over the years from this kind of investing. But a little risky still? Perhaps.

5) Move the money into EURO or GBP and just consolidate it all together one account so that it's more liquid.

I guess it doesn't hurt to diversify with currencies, right? What are your thoughts on these options, and is there anything else we could do? Thank you!",finance

I recently got some coinage (20k roughly) and want to put it towards debt. I need advice on which is the better move. 

Side note - I'll come into another 35k in about 3-4 months that I'll use to take care of whatever is not chosen now. 

A personal loan I have - balance 28k with a 15% interest rate.

CCs with about 20k in balance. Varying APR from about 18 to 25%.

My gut tells me the personal loan, as if I pay off a large amount of the principal.. I'll save myself 1.5-2k while I wait for my other coinage to come through. 

If I pay off the CCs, that'll free up about 600/month I can use to put towards the loan.

personalfinance,Defaulted Student Loan / Collection agency issue,"Hi dealing with a defaulted student debt issue. Long story, but was able to pay off all my debt (or so I thought) a year back, and recently updated my ID and was contacted by a company informing me I was in default on an old loan and they were unable to find me (several moves in the last 10 year), a few facts below for context:

&amp;#x200B;

\- \~30K in debt originally federally held, not held by a private debt collector original loan was \~21K

\- Have confirmed via the federal loan authority that they did sell this loan to this collector (waiting on promissory note)

\- Have been receiving harassing calls telling me i'd be charged 19% interest on the principal daily

\- Debt collector at one point said if I gave them 20K today they would ""forgive the debt""

\- It is such an old loan that it has actually entirely fallen off of my credit report (my credit score is better than it has ever been)

&amp;#x200B;

A few questions:

\- What should my next steps be?

\- Given they have already negotiated against themselves, should I be attempting to do that further?

\- Should I find a lawyer to help and if so how do I go about doing that?

personalfinance,Need a solid federal and state tax estimator web site.,"I have been using http://www.tax-rates.org but it's buggy (""mySQL runtime error""), and says it only *2015* (!) state tax brackets information. Not good enough.

personalfinance,House or student loans?,"Hi All,

So I've been out of college for about 6 years now, and currently still live with my parents to try and save money to help manage my student loans (current balance of about $60k).  In a few months, I'll have enough saved up to completely pay off that loan balance.  However, I am also 28 y.o. and DESPERATELY want to finally be able to put down a decent sized (20%) down payment on a condo, with any money left over for renovations/upkeep/emergency etc. 

So my question is:  Would you, people of Reddit, exhaust your life savings to pay off those pesky student loans for good?  Or would you put the house first, and be on the hook for the mortgage &amp; students loans for at least the next 15+ years?

EDIT:  Some additional details that may also help:  I put about $35k in various investments and left about $20k in my savings in case of emergency/not to do something stupid with it.  Student loans are a mix of government &amp; private equity.  Government loan (15k outstanding) interest rates vary from like 3.4 - 6.8%.  Private loan (45k outstanding) has interest rate of 6.75% (ouch).",finance
investing,Question about converting Traditional IRA to Roth,"I want to switch some, and eventually all of my Trad IRA (Only about $5600) over to my Roth. I am thinking about doing it first with a stock that I'm down big on, but plan on holding on to. The idea being that whatever I gain when the stock rebounds will be tax free. I have read up a bit on it but I wanted to avoid any unexpected consequences. I know that I'll have to pay taxes on whatever I convert. Here is a statement from my Schwab account:

&gt;   If you choose to have taxes withheld, the amount withheld will be sent to the IRS. This may result in the withholding amount being treated as a distribution from your Traditional IRA and not considered part of your conversion. As a result, if you are under age 59½, you may be subject to a 10% federal early withdrawal penalty tax (and possibly state) on the tax withholding amount.  

So it seems like I will be hit with a 10% penalty, in addition to any taxes owed. Is there any way around the early withdrawal fee?  I am wondering if there are any more important details/consequences that I may not know about? Any advice is appreciated, thanks.",finance

investing,Low-Interest Rate Induced Growth,"I am concerned with the rate of growth in the equities market. One of the main driving forces behind the equities market is the tech industry. It is no surprise that growth rates are slowing. Mark Zuckerberg said in a speech last summer that the developed world was ""saturated"" with technology and that the growth rates of the industry of the last decade are simply unsustainable. 

&amp;#x200B;

In Q4 of 2018, we saw market panic when Fed Chair Jerome Powell announced a 0.25% interest rate hike. The Dow shed several thousand points. 

&amp;#x200B;

My concern is that all this growth has been induced by borrowed money. This is because money has been so cheap for so long that there is an expectation amongst business owners that money will always be this cheap. How much borrowing is too much? I'm not sure. But what I do know is that the this cannot be good for long term innovation because eventually, we will reach a point of complacency and stagnation. I also am concerned that eventually there eventually won't be enough skilled labor to sustain this insane growth rate and no matter how cheap money is to borrow the labor just simply isn't there to fill those jobs.

personalfinance,New Fed employee with a second stream of income for a short period (ie not permanent) Trying to decide between adding to my TSP or into investments. Advice appreciated,"Hi everybody,

I just started working as a GS-4 with the VA, including locality pay I'm making just under 30k a year. I have SSDI paying $1495/month - but the new job puts me in a 10 month trial work period My april SSDI check comes May 15,  so just to make things easy- I'll have this 2nd stream of income from May 2019-Feb 2020. 

At orientation I filled out a form to increase my TSP to 5% - as he VA will match up to 5% (My first check had a 3% deduction and when I called HR they said they dont have the form, even though it was filled out 3 weeks ago) I have to send them another to bump it up to the 5% match. 

I have about 35k in savings, and the $1495/month from SSDI- I was thinking about setting up my TSP to put like $400-$500/paycheck into TSP for 6-9 months then dropping down to the 5% about the time my SSDI goes away. (I also have a small 401a plan, with like $3000 I can roll into my TSP.)

Talked it over with dad- he's a financial advisor for I believe Edward Jones (the company is a persons name- and it's a big national group). He seemed skittish about putting it into TSP because that messes with my actual paycheck and he wasnt certain about the tax implications either. So he was telling me just bump TSP to 5% and put your cash to work in my Roth IRA and Brokerage accounts....

Considering they've lost my TSP election and my HR rep had to come to my office to get a voided check because the copy made by the hospital disappeared and never got to her- I'm half tempted to just add money to VTSAX every 2 weeks for the foreseeable future

I kind of like the idea of starting 2020 with 10-12k in my TSP but dad does have a point about things getting lost in the shuffle and unintended consequences.

In my shoes what would you do, invest in TSP, or invest in RothIRA and Taxable account instead.

**Update:** Roommates checked the mail: I can now long into MyPay and can alter my TSP allocation with a click. Bumped my contribution to $500/paycheck. Will keep it that way for a few months then drop it to 5% near the end of the calendar year before my SSDI checks go away in early 2020.",finance
personalfinance,Did not have state/federal taxes withdrew from my paycheck. What should I do? (New York),"Title is self-explanatory. I work at a startup in NYC, and just got my first paycheck. My stub only had deductions for Social Security, Medicare, and my Roth 401(k). No other federal or any state taxes were withheld from my check. I am a salaried employee, not a 1099 contractor. Should I be concerned, and is there something I should do?",finance
personalfinance,Withdrawing from Roth IRA Temporarily,"First time posting, hoping to bounce this idea off the smart folks here!  TL;DR: I want to use my Roth IRA contributions as down payment on a new construction loan since all my savings are tied up in equity in current home.  Can I repopulate my Roth IRA using the Backdoor method tax free using proceeds gained from selling my current home?

I currently own my own home, owe \~$75k of an original $150k mortgage originated in 2008.  House value is currently between $170k and $180k, so have \~$100k in equity.

Been following the Dave Ramsey baby steps for about 10 years, so I put 15% of my total income into retirement accounts monthly (first 6% into company-matched Roth 401k, then fully fund Roth IRA, then put remaining into same Roth 401k), and for the last few years have been paying down the mortgage early.  Only savings is my 6 month emergency fund \~18k.  No debts except my current mortgage.

Fast forward to now, I have some family farm land and want to build a house while I'm relatively young (35).  Because of the aforementioned baby steps, however, all extra cash has gone to paying down the current mortgage... this leaves me with not a lot of liquidity for a construction loan down payment.  My goal is to build a \~$350k home (total loan amount, includes house and all construction/utilities), so a 20% down payment to avoid PMI would be somewhere in the $70k range.

Checking with local lending institutions (banks, credit unions, etc) leads me to believe that a Home Equity Loan or Home Equity Line of Credit would not be approved since the house is soon to be on the market (banks frown on so-called ""bridge loans"" these days because of housing market crash, smh).  I could do a Cash-Out Refinance, but that involves a lot of throw-away money (loan origination fees, closing costs, etc) and would only be short term until the house sells.  Current interest rate is 2.875% (I refinanced in 2012 when the bubble burst), and current rates are higher, so not too willing to modify current loan at this point.

My Roth IRA has been fully funded annually ($5k-$6k as increased each year) since 2009.  Given the current rules governing Roth IRAs, seems I can pull out my contributions (estimated at $49.5k through this month) tax and penalty free.  This would give me that money now to use as part of my down payment, and my plan would be to immediately return that money back to the Roth IRA once I receive the funds from selling my current house.

My primary concern is the best route to get that money reloaded back into that Roth IRA once my house sells.  I understand using a Backdoor Roth IRA (throwing funds into a Traditional IRA and then converting them into my Roth IRA) to bypass the yearly contribution limits, and understand that these newly repopulated funds would be locked for 5 years.  Am I correct in understanding there would be no taxes due, since the conversion from Traditional IRA to Roth IRA would be made using post-tax dollars?

I have always had a sense of financial insecurity growing up, and while things have been generally working out better these last few years, for the first time in my life I'm about to have full control of my financial life and thought I'd turn to this group for advice. I've read through the wikis and have been trying to better understand them.

The spending flowchart has been useful.

I have no finance background and so I'm pretty new to the language and was hoping people would help me understand how to better take control of my finances. I am 22, a senior in college and am about to graduate in a few weeks. I'm fortunate to have a job waiting for me when I graduate.

I will be making $109,000 pre tax income in WA state. According to smart asset, this works out to $83,092 in post tax income. The company has a 50% 401k match, and so I plan on signing up for the 401k through HR and having them max out my contribution. I understand that a 401k is a retirement savings account, and is opened through Vanguard? (I'm not sure about that second part, I just hear that pretty often. Tbh I don't really know what Vanguard is, but if its a bank account that I have access to for saving money, that sounds pretty good.) Now after my 401k max ($19,000), my take home monthly income works out to $5713.50 (bi-weekly, which is 2856.5 every two weeks).

My living situation which doesn't have much flexibility is $2200 a month, and I have a $30,000 student loan that I will be repaying at approximately $200 a month. I will also have roughly $500 in car payments. This is just to lay a little ground work. I have 2 credit cards with a combined credit limit of $21,000 a month, and have never been late to a payment. I have 0 credit card debt and use them like I would a debit card, its really just for the points and to keep a good credit score. I have other expenses every month, but generally have some cash lying around, and I'm wondering what other measures I should be taking for long-term financial growth. I hear a lot about a Roth IRA, which I believe is another savings situation? Is this something that is added onto a 401k? I also don't understand what a backdoor Roth IRA contribution is. Is this something that I should be looking at? Are they the same thing? Its just really confusing and I'm just lost for what to do. My company offers something called an HSA, which I honestly have no idea what that is, but I hear this a lot whenever I'm looking for advice online.

Oh, I also have a savings account with Goldman Sachs at 2.25% (which is pretty high for an interest rate, so it seemed like a pretty good deal) with about $30,000 in savings in it. I'd really appreciate any help/advice/direction for what to do, what I should be thinking about to maintain both a system of automated savings/money growth, as well as tips/advice for having money available quickly in case of emergencies etc.

I'm a design student and really haven't ever had any exposure to this stuff. I'm also an immigrant so my parents didn't grow up in this country and are only just moving over now so they don't have the first idea what any of this even means (I feel almost equally as lost). Any help would be appreciated. Thank you! :)

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

personalfinance,Would moving make sense?,"Hey guys, I'm trying to decide whether or not moving would make the best sense financially. I live in LA and make about 35k/yr. I have been considering moving to TX because the pay for what I do is about 50k/yr. The companies both have equal benefits.

I have looked at the cost of living for where I am and for what Houston is. From what I can tell, Houston is slightly cheaper cost of living aside from rent. 

I guess what I'm trying to figure out is if the raise is just a raise on paper, or if it would be a legitimate raise. I'm not sure of all the tax differences between each state and if whether or not I would be paying a significant amount more in federal taxes. 

Currently the only expenses I have that would change would be rent, utilities and internet. I have a roommate and everything is split between us.

Rent is 1k, electricity averages $80, and internet is $70. So in total I pay about $600 for all of this. I would not have a roommate if I moved. 

Can anyone offer any insight on this? Cost of living in Houston, TX? Would a move be worth it?",finance

Sorry if this reads like me vomiting all my money problems here at once, I'm pretty bad at this.

My finances have been in rough shape since I was divorced in Sept. 2017. I got stuck with several debts (she took the car we just paid off. :| ) I have a car that I pay $280/month for. There's about $3700 left on the loan, but the interest rate is exorbitant (27.99%). I have roughly $2500 from various collections, and $500 of credit card debt. The remaining $52,000 of my total debt is student loans. My credit score(s) are: 453 (Equifax - Credit Karma), 552 (TransUnion - Credit Karma), 553 (CreditWise from CapitalOne), and 592 (Experian.com).
 
I made just under $40K last year, but I constantly feel broke and stuck in a vicious cycle. I have so many monthly expenses that I have little left over after bills and nothing to save. My rent's cheap ($570/month), but my other bills eat up my checks. I also need to buy a new car. This one is running north of 140k miles, and it's starting to show. 

I was thinking about taking out a 401K loan to pay off my car loan and a few collections to save some money and improve my credit. I would also use part of the loan and my current car as a trade-in to put down on a new car. The interest is much, much less expensive on this loan (~4%). My job is also pretty stable. 

Would this be wise? Is the amount of compound interest I would lose more than what I would save by paying off this shitty auto loan? 

In case greater context is needed, here are my monthly recurring expenses:
-Rent ($570)
-Car Payment ($280)
-Insurance - 1 car ($170*)
-Cell Phone ($60)
-Internet ($65)

-Natural Gas ($60)

Since then we moved and where we live the closest bank is Umpqua who I have no opinion of, and a Bank of America atm that we use for basic services like cash withdrawal.  I haven't been in a branch in years, last time I did was to get a cashier's check when buying my house and this could happen anywhere.

&amp;#x200B;

Background: 25 year old, Good credit (&gt;730), 1 checking account through a regional bank (mBank), 2 credit cards (1 long-term but rarely used, and a recently opened one used for nearly everything), Student loans of about 30k from undergrad, completed funded MS degree, and moving on to a funded PhD program, so student loans are a ways away still.

Since my current checking account is through a bank which is only in MI, I am thinking to switch over to a new bank or credit union once I move to Pittsburgh.

&amp;#x200B;

Goals: I would like to set up a savings account (to begin putting away money) and a checking which will be my primary bank account for my direct deposits and such.

&amp;#x200B;

I rarely use cash so I am not opposed to using a credit union or regional bank, unless people have good reasons to think otherwise. I am curious about opening a savings account through a credit union and then a checking account through a national bank, to capitalize on the availability of national banks and the high interest rate of a credit union. But not entirely confident on this plan. I'm thinking of using 'alliant credit union' for my savings or maybe both.

&amp;#x200B;

Questions: 1) Is this a good idea to open a saving and checking account through different companies? 2) If I do open a savings account in a regional credit union and then, after my PhD program, move away will I run into any major issues? 3) Other than availability of national bank branches are there really any benefits to using a large national bank? 4) Any other recommendations for my situation, as far as general banking plans or specific banking companies?

\*She had to merge her first car loan into a new one after being in a car wreck, the previous loan had an outstanding balance of roughly $4,000. The bank explained that she needed to take out a loan on a newer car due to the negative equity tied up in the previous loan. She isn't happy about that. Like at all. But it's what we believed needed to be done in order to secure a decent commuter car that wasn't going to be a money pit, and she had no money put away to buy with cash.\*



&amp;#x200B;

Despite all of this, she almost never misses payments and maintains an average credit score between 630-650. She would like to start putting money away into savings after knocking down these monthly payments.

worldpolitics,Prison Reform Ideas,"Whether it is the United States or any other country that does not have these ideas implemented, some ideas regarding prison reform include the following.

* Do not strip anyone indicted, tried, convicted, sentenced, incarcerated, or on probation/parole of the right to vote. To do so would allow legislators to write laws that guarantee their reelection without fear of opposition by those involved in the defense side of the criminal justice system. This would be a potential abuse of power, otherwise.
* Provide courts that accommodate those with drug problems or mental illness or both.
* Put non-violent offenders on ankle GPS monitoring with strict conditions tailored to the specific crimes an offender has been convicted of. This will allow the offender to associate with the community and be rehabilitated in the area for which he or she is convicted.
   * Housing and feeding a federal prisoner costs at least $31,000 per year. Installing and maintaining an ankle monitor costs less than $5,600 per year. The objective of correctional officers is to reduce violence and maintain safety. Non-violent offenders do not need such officers especially given the cost difference.
* Regularly drug-test offenders in prison as drug abuse is rampant in prisons. Provide appropriate treatment.
* Provide incarcerated offenders access to all classic literature to enhance skills in reading and writing.
* Provide time off sentences in exchange for participation in good behavior programs.
* Provide quick jail stays and psychiatric assessment in lieu of simply returning to prison in cases of parole being violated. This would probably pertain mostly to drug offenders with other offenses.",cryptocurrency

I am an international student, who currently holds a BSc in Biology from a small college. I work as a Research Technician, and will work in my current position until the end of June. I will be attending a Masters program in Public Health (Epidemiology focus) at an Ivy League school starting this fall. The program lasts 2 years, and I'm going to take out a loan for those two years (around 120K in total). My reasoning here is that I need to make this investment so that I can afford a better life than the one I have right now. However I fear this logic may be flawed, and that I may indeed end up in a worse financial situation than I'm in right now. But I also recognize that there is no telling how it will roll out, that, by and large, this I a roll of a dice I'm making. I should also note that not going to school in fall will not be an option (for personal reasons I can not reconsider.)

I anticipate that most of you will suggest that I take up side jobs, such as driving for Uber/Lyft, delivery, etc. But I cannot legally do any of that because my working status as an international student limits me to one job at a time (a job that must be related to my major.)

personalfinance,Looking to buy a home in 8 months. Will I be ready?,"I currently have a decent amount of disposable income compared to what I make in a month. My total living expenses presently are about $1100 a month off a monthly income of about $3000 after taxes. That's everything I spend in a month including food, rent, utilities, subscriptions, gas.  I have no major debt debt to speak of ($3000 on a credit card with a 0% APR until July 2020) and about $40,000 in liquid assets including $29,000 in taxable account investments and about $11,000 in cash. Of my stock holdings I'd be willing to sell about $10,000 all of which are ETFs I don't really care about. It was just a way to pool money together and try to get a better rate than a high yield savings account.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently saving towards improving my cash for a down payment and closing cost. My apartment lease is up in Jan 2020 but I could break it early at a $750 premium for the right opportunity.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking for a house in the $120K range (in my area that's a middle class home probably on the low end of middle class but whatever I don't wanna go up to $200K). If I currently bought it today I'd be looking at a 10% down payment on the high end of my price. I'd have 5% of the purchase price for closing cost and I'd be left with about $3000 cash and the $19,000 in stock holdings.

&amp;#x200B;

Friends say I should dump my apartment now or ASAP with my current finances and look to get into a home. They say PMI isn't that bad and inside of 2 years I could be rid of it especially with my level of free money if I threw more at the house and with the appreciation of the home.

&amp;#x200B;

Getting a house in my range I'd be looking at going from $523 a month rent to $860 roughly in a house payment (per Zillow for what that's worth).  Guesstimating for utilities at the home I'd factor in an additional $200 a month from what I'm paying now (so $300 a month total) so that leaves me with $1400 in disposable income a month down from $1900. let's say I blow $400 a month on BS. I'm still able to save $1000 a month. In a year I'm back to $15,000 in cash and $19,000 in stocks.

&amp;#x200B;

If I wait at least 8 months before getting a home (of which I estimate I can save at least $11,000 more) I could get a home without PMI in that range and I'd be better off financially after closing on it. Maybe I get lucky and the fed cuts rates once in that 8 months and more importantly I don't have to pay to break my lease. The downside is I've payed my landlords another $3500 that could have gone into the home I'd be buying. I say $3500 because I'm taking off the $750 from the future rent payments.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 29th, 2019.

# **Investors brace for a roller-coaster week ahead with Fed decision and Apple, Alphabet earnings - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/26/investors-brace-for-a-roller-coaster-week-ahead-with-fed-decision-and-apple-alphabet-earnings.html)**
*****
&gt; Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to emphasize the Fed will continue to be patient and hold back from raising interest rates, but there is a risk the Fed could inject some volatility into markets in the week ahead.
*****
&gt; The Fed meets Tuesday and Wednesday, in a week heavy with earnings news and some key economic reports. Friday’s employment report tops the list of data releases, but there is also PCE inflation Monday and monthly vehicle sales Wednesday. There are more than 150 S&amp;P 500 companies reporting earnings, including Apple, Alphabet and drug majors Merck and Pfizer.
*****
&gt; “I don’t think the Fed is going to signal any big change in its policy stance next week. If anything, they will talk about how the economy is showing signs of improvement and therefore, it is appropriate to remain patient and see how things evolve,” said Mark Cabana, head of short U.S. rate strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
*****
&gt; Fed officials are sure to discuss Friday’s surprisingly strong report of 3.2% economic growth in the first quarter, much better than the 2.5% pace expected by economists. It is also far better than the flattish growth forecasts and recession fears that cropped up during the first quarter when data looked spotty and the government was closed for five weeks.
*****
&gt; “I’m sure it’s going to heat up the internal debate on what the direction of policy should be,” said Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist at Jefferies. Economists expect the Fed to retain its dovish tone even with the better U.S. data because uncertainty remains about global growth, particularly from Europe.
*****
&gt; But some stock traders have been concerned with stocks near record highs, that the Fed may not want to sound quite as dovish, as it did after its January and March meetings when it ‘pivoted’ its policy to remove rate hikes from the forecast this year.
*****
&gt; “There’s some scope for disappointment there,” said Cabana.
*****
&gt; But then the Fed, and markets, have focused on the lack of inflation and the fact that will keep the Fed in an easier policy stance. Some market pros are counting on interest rate cuts, before the Fed ever hikes rates again.
*****
&gt; The Fed has targeted a 2% inflation rate. Core PCE inflation for the first quarter fell to a 1.7% pace, year over year, from 1.9% in the fourth quarter. March inflation data is released on Monday.
*****
&gt; “Our view has been and continues to be that the constant undershooting of core PCE that was again confirmed today is something that has the Fed perplexed, which is central to our theses that the Fed is going to cut rates later this year,” said Julian Emanuel, head of equity and derivatives strategy at BTIG. He expects the Fed to cut interest rates in both September and December.
*****
&gt; Emanuel also pointed out that first quarter GDP contained some transitory factors like a positive impact from trade and inventories that are not recurring, and inventories could even detract from second quarter growth. But some economists expect consumers to become a stronger force in the second quarter and make up for some of that.
*****
&gt; Emanuel said he expects the S&amp;P 500, which surpassed its previous closing high of 2,930, in the past week, to reach a high of 3,000 this year. The S&amp;P is up more than 3% in April so far, and earnings season has been mostly positive for stocks.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 gained 1.2% in the past week, closing Friday at 2,939, just under its all-time intra-day high of 2,940, from Sept. 21. The Nasdaq was up 1.9% for the week at a new closing high of 8,146. But the Dow was down 0.1% for the week, ending at 26,543, still 1.5% below its intra-day high.
*****
&gt; Big earnings week
&gt; The first quarter earnings season was expected to be the first negative quarter for profit growth in three years, but as of Friday, earnings growth looks to be flattish, based on actual numbers for companies that have already reported and estimates for others, according to Refinitiv.
*****
&gt; According to Emanuel, the coming week’s earnings will be important, and now there are reports from big pharma. He said health care has become more attractive to him as it has come under pressure this year.
*****
&gt; “If you look at the rebound, that is only four months old, the easy money has been made and the easy money has been made in technology,” he said. “From our point of view, we like the places investors have had a more difficult time.” He said two of those sectors are health care and financials.
*****
&gt; “With regard to technology there has been an element of performance chase that has crept into the market,” he said.
*****
&gt; Technology, since the start of the year, has been the best performing of the major S&amp;P sectors, with a gain of 26%. Financials are up 18.4%, and health care is the worst performing sector, up just 2.5%
*****
&gt; “If you think about part of the reason the health care sector has been under such intense pressure recently, it is the expectation that legislatively, not only are prices rising less, but you could also have an element of deflation in that sector. Our view point is that is not likely to materialize,” Emanuel said. “We see the weakness in healthcare as much more a function of the majority of the universe is frightened by Medicare for all, and those that aren’t are frightened by the prospect of the Affordable Care Act being repealed. We don’t see either of those happening.”
*****
&gt; Emanuel said he’s currently being selective in buying stocks, especially given risks to the market like unresolved trade talks between the U.S. and China; the slowdown in Chinese stimulus and weaker growth, particularly in Europe.

# Typical May Trading: Just a Couple of Positive Areas

&gt; Once again it is that time of the year where we increasingly see and hear “Sell in May.” But when exactly in May is the “best” time to sell? Based upon the last 21 years of data, the best time could be early in May. The month has opened well, on average, recently with strength on the first trading day and on the second for the most part. Afterwards, DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 all tend to drift sideways to lower until around May’s eighteenth trading day or so. It is on this day the NASDAQ and Russell 2000 begin to rally to finish the month. Beware though, this late-May rally typically fizzles before it can exceed the highs reached earlier in the month.

# Its Official – Happy 10th Birthday Bull Market

&gt; Yesterday’s new all-time closing high by S&amp;P 500 finally made it official. The current bull market is now in its eleventh year and is the second longest since 1949 and second best by performance with a 333.6% gain from its March 9, 2009 low through its closing high. Since 1949, the longest bull market lived over twelves years from December 1987 to March 2000 and gained 582.1%. Thus far the current bull has endured five corrections ranging from 10.2% to 19.8%. Tame inflation, a dovish Fed and the prospects for continued earnings growth suggest this bull is likely to continue.

# End of the Best Six Months. Should You Sell in May?

&gt; It’s hard for us not to be associated with “Sell in May” and we welcome the opportunity it provides to discuss seasonality and share our analysis and our evidence-based, time-tested and historically-proven “Best Six Months Switching Strategy.” First of all we do not simply Sell in May and go away. And we don’t sell anything until we get a technical confirmation from our MACD Seasonal Sell Signal. When we do get that MACD Sell Signal we will sell some positions in our Tactical Seasonal Switching Strategy Portfolio and pick up some bond positions as well as other portfolio maneuvers.

&gt; Because of the elevated level of risk that has been historically observed during the “Worst Six Months” of the year and its historically tepid returns, reducing long exposure and developing a defensive strategy is the approach we take in the Almanac InvestorStock and ETF Portfolios. We do not merely “sell in May and go away.” Instead we take some profits, trim or outright sell underperforming stock and ETF positions, tighten stop losses and limit adding new long exposure to positions from sectors that have a demonstrated record of outperforming during the period.

&gt; For those with a lower risk tolerance or a desire to take a break from trading, the “Worst Months” are a great opportunity to unwind longs and move into the relative safety of cash, Treasury bonds, gold and/or some combination of. Preservation of capital may be more important than growth and with historical averages and frequency of gains reduced; the “Worst Six Months” are a good time to simply step aside if you prefer. August, September and/or October have provided some excellent buying opportunities in recent years and could do the same again this year.

&gt; Sure the market got slammed in the first two months (November-December) of the Best Six Months in 2018, nothing’s perfect. It happens. We stuck it out, did not panic at the December 24 low and road the recovery rally. The history of the Best Six/Worst Six Months is undeniable and it still works. There have been off periods throughout its history. The full history is on our website and in the Almanac. But here are a couple of graphs to illustrate.

# Next Bump in Pre-Election Year Rally Could Arise in May

&gt; As of today’s close, DJIA is up 13.6% year-to-date as of today’s close. S&amp;P 500 is up 16.0% and NASDAQ is at 20.8%. Compared to average pre-election year historical performance since 1950 graphed in the charts below, DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ are all still comfortably above past pre-election year average performance for this point of the year. Aside from a brief excursion on the second trading day of the year, 2019 has largely tracked pre-election year historical performance and then some. Should this trend continue, then the next area of concern is just after mid-May. This is also right around the time Q1 earnings season is beginning to wrap and focus shifts to Q2 estimates. However, should late May weakness materialize, it could prove to be a fair entry point as the market usually rallies through June to mid-July.

# B.I.G. Tips - Early Earnings Season Analysis

&gt; More than 500 stocks have reported their first quarter numbers so far this earnings season, which gives us a pretty large sample size to start analyzing overall trends. Through today, 67% of stocks that have reported this season have beaten bottom-line consensus EPS estimates. That's a strong reading relative to the historical average of roughly 60% going back to 1999 (first chart below).

&gt; While the bottom line beat rate is strong, the top line has so far been lacking. As shown in the second chart below, only 53.6% of companies have managed to report stronger than expected revenues this season. This is definitely a concern now that we're already about a quarter of the way through the reporting period. We would note, though, that last season we saw a similar trend as the top-line beat rate started very low before rebounding by the end of the reporting period and actually showing a sequential increase.

&gt; On another note, we've seen an interesting shift in guidance compared to the last two quarters. We're also seeing some negative signs when it comes to how stock prices are reacting to earnings reports.

# 10 Observations on New Highs

&gt; We wrote about the new record high for the S&amp;P 500 Index Wednesday . This is such a big market event we wanted to share some additional thoughts—10 of them in fact—on this market milestone:

&gt; The new high secured March 9, 2019, as the 10th anniversary of the bull market. If the S&amp;P 500 hadn’t made a new high before the next bear market, this bull would have ended short of the 10-year mark.

&gt; Don’t fear new highs. Historically, buying stocks at all-time highs has been productive over the long term, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day. Going back to 1950, the average 12-month gain from a new high for the S&amp;P 500 has been 9.8%, excluding dividends.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/dont-fear-record-highs.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; When new highs have been more than six months apart, as the last two were, average gains in the S&amp;P 500 historically have been about 12% in the 12 months after the new record.

&gt; For those worried that a new high means sub-par long-term returns, consider that the average 5-year annualized gain in the S&amp;P 500 from all-time highs is 9%. For 10 years, it’s a still solid 7.4% (excluding dividends).

&gt; History has shown stocks’ strong start to the year could mean further gains down the road. The average rest-of-year gain for the S&amp;P 500 after a double-digit first quarter rally has been 6%.

&gt; Global growth is supportive. Owning stocks when economic conditions are improving, as they are in the United States and China in particular, tends to be rewarding.

&gt; We don’t think stocks are overvalued. The S&amp;P 500 price-to-earnings ratio (PE) based on consensus analysts’ estimates for the next 12 months is 16.7, very reasonable considering low interest rates and inflation.

&gt; Not all the possible good news is priced in. Investors may get more than they expect out of the U.S.-China trade deal, which could boost business confidence and capital investment.
Earnings may be a positive catalyst. First-quarter earnings season is off to a good start overall, and we think 2019 expectations are too low.

&gt; Sentiment is not overly bullish. Just 33.5% of individual investors are bullish, according to the American Association of Individual Investors. Other sentiment measures we follow are far from euphoric.

&gt; Looking ahead, we believe there are enough potential positive catalysts to propel the S&amp;P 500 to our year-end fair value target of 3,000 this year. At the same time, we acknowledge the risks, particularly overseas—Europe faces structural challenges, lackluster growth, and upcoming Brexit hurdles. The possibility of a pickup in volatility against a favorable fundamental backdrop supports our recommended market weight equities allocation.

# The Waiting Game for Record Highs

&gt; The wait is over.

&gt; After more than seven months, the S&amp;P 500 Index notched a fresh all-time closing high of 2,933.68 on April 23. To get here, investors have weathered back-and-forth in trade negotiations, a historic government shutdown, unrelenting Brexit headlines, the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) U-turn in policy, and signs of a global slowdown.

&gt; Fortunately, U.S. stocks have powered through record highs after a prolonged dry spell. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 has climbed an average of 12.9% in the 12 months after snapping at least 6-month long record high drought, based on data since 1950.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Climbing-the-wall-of-worry-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “It has been a long time since the S&amp;P 500 scored a new high, yet this could actually hint at future gains,” said LPL Research Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “The waiting game for record highs may be tough, but it has proven the durability of this bull market based on sound fundamentals.”

&gt; Stocks’ rapid rebound this year has been impressive, especially 10 years into the current bull market. The S&amp;P 500 has rallied more than 20% from the December lows amid the Fed’s pause in rate hikes, progress in trade talks, and an uptick in economic data after a soft beginning to 2019.

&gt; Historically, when U.S. stocks have gone six months without a record, investors have had to contend with a significantly longer waiting period (and more market volatility). The benchmark has taken an average of 25 months to post new highs in times it hasn’t hit a record within six months.

&gt; We’ve maintained that the late-2018 sell-off was overdone, and we see a compelling case for equities near these levels based on sound economic fundamentals. However, the recovery has been arguably a bit fast considering some of the reasons for the decline have yet to be resolved. We think the S&amp;P 500 could eventually move higher and make a run at our 3,000 fair value target, but we wouldn’t be surprised to see volatility pick up over the next few months.

personalfinance,Struggle getting decent student loan refinance rate with good credit?,"Trying to refinance some of my graduate school loans. I have good credit (over 800) and I have been getting terrible rates. Over 5% everywhere. I did get quoted at close to 3% with First National, but they are not in my market so they will not refinance my loans. 

What do? Some of my student loan interest rates are extremely high, but in light of refinancing at 5% or more, its not that much difference. 

Any tips/suggestions?",finance

worldpolitics,Do they really use social networks?,"A consideration taking clues from the tragic events that recently took place in Sri Lanka where social networks, following the attacks, were blocked.

We don't want to discuss or criticise the decisions of the local authorities. However, we notice that very often is forced the idea that terrorists use the social networks to plan their criminal activities.

There are many applications online that can be easily found and installed on private servers, that anyone can use to make group encrypted calls, ensuring high levels of privacy and anonymity that are difficult to obtain in social networks. Open source services like Riot (matrix), Jitsi or those based on the TOX protocol, to mention the most famous alternatives.

In particular, Riot has been chosen by French Governments, meanwhile the German Federal Government preferred NextCloud, a cloud productivity platform  that also permit to make crypted calls with many participants.

What do you think about this tendency from the governments and press to paint out social networks as the favourites by the terrostic groups, when the alternatives would be significantly more secure?",technology

personalfinance,Why don't banks let your search online transactions as far back as you want to (a la gmail)?,"With every bank I've ever had (Wells Fargo, USAA, Navy Federal, Credit Unions, etc.) you can only search online transactions going back 90 days and anything further back than that you need to download PDF files for each month. So currently I'm trying to find a transaction for something I'm hoping I bought in the past 3 years (3 yr replacement warranty) b/c then I can get it replaced free. Before you go shaming me for not using budgeting software since the beginning of time or keeping all my receipts and cataloging them like a damn librarian, you have to admit this missing feature-set would satisfy a  HUGE need for many consumers outside of just the use-case I'm describing.

&amp;#x200B;

I just got transferred a bunch talking to USAA and they didn't really have a great answer why they don't have the data available online. It can't be due to space demands anymore, text is the easiest to compress thing (20:1 compression or better) and the amount of text in a 1 month statement is nothing. I have emails from my mom that have more text than monthly statements.

&amp;#x200B;

My guess is it's a shared POS (piece of shit, not Point Of Sale) standard software tool or protocol used by all banks dating back to the TN3270 days when they all used mainframes. And they just haven't bothered to catch up to the times b/c no one has bothered to question the whole system and do it differently.

&amp;#x200B;

I was thinking I might write a tool that would help people by pulling down the PDFs from their account for them and then it could upload it to their Google drive account so it would be searchable there but I don't want to be responsible and have it hooked into their banking info. Maybe Mint does something like that and I just don't know it.",finance

I am thinking that long-term gains and qualified dividends up to $78k will not be taxed at federal. They will get around 5% state-tax. 15% tax above $78k. I'm unsure how the K1 income will get treated. If I assume that K1 is treated similar to long-term gains, then I'm looking at an effective tax (state+federal) of around 10%.

personalfinance,Is ROTH right for me?,"Background: I'm a Federal employee; 22% Tax bracket; Working in STEM; Early 20s with almost 2 years of experience.

I've been following the flowchart on the wiki since I started working and have now found myself on the step where I ""evaluate the merits of a Roth vs Traditional"" retirement. Before I was on traditional but after doing research on both options I'm undecided if I should up my pretax dollars from 5% to 15% or if I should start making Roth contributions.

As I understand it, Roth can be good if you expect to have a higher income later in your career. This factor applies to me since im rapidly growing at my job right now (I'm expecting to move up the next tax bracket within the next 2 years. Possibly the next bracket after that by the time I reach the peak of my career). One reason why I'm hesitant about Roth though is because I'm not sure if the taxes will work in my favor. The way I understand it is that my taxes will probably not be the same as when I am working, so if my income is lower in my retirement days, shouldn't taxes be lower too? If I spend my whole career in the government i could probably receive a good pension but other than that I'll just have my retirement account. So won't it be better to pay those taxes during those golden years?

Also, based on my background, I'm not exactly in a low bracket. I'm also single with no dependents so you I dont qualify for alot of tax breaks. I recently had to pay +$600 after getting my taxes done last month. The tax preper said every year I'll end up paying more in taxes like this each year as my income grows. So coming back to my question, should I stick with the traditional and take the tax break from it now (at least max it out first before starting Roth contributions)? Or should I start going the Roth route now? Or maybe should I just do both, or does it even matter what I choose? 

I hope to learn from those with better finance experience than me on what I should do next. Thanks for reading!",finance
personalfinance,"Job offers: $15,000 difference?","26, graduating with a MS in Speech-Pathology, live in San Francisco Bay Area with my parents rent free, single/no kids, paid off car. 

$0 checking, $0 savings, -$1,000 credit card, -$42,000 student loan debt (6% interest rate), no bills (car insurance, phone bill) until August, also owe parents $7,000. 

Comparing two job offers with basically identical benefits packages. Both local school districts, each for 10 months of work/year with the summer off. 

-School District 1: $88,000. Meanwhile, I've heard many negatives about this district in terms of work-life balance and model, and have really disliked my communication from the team thus far. 

-School District 2: $73,000. I currently am completing my clinical internship in this district, and would be working with my ""dream"" population and a supervisor I know very well. It's a wonderful district, and I could stay at the school I'm at right now.

personalfinance,26 and 17k in debt and a little lost.,"I'm 26 living at home making a barely above minimum wage salary. I had a lot of financial difficultly this year and I'm finally trying get serious and sort my life out.  I live at home so I don't pay rent my only bills are food, transportation, necessities. I don't even have a savings at the moment.  I made a lot of financial mistakes in life. I'm trying to not go into 30 with those same mistakes. 

I'm working with WIOA to get additional training to get a higher income. I do plan on going back to school next spring but I plan to pay out of pocket for it. 

My current issue is my debt. I'm about 17k in debt at the moment and majority is student loans. My credit score is 560 according to creditkarma. 

Student loans:

Nelnet: Current an in deferment 

$16,271 

&amp;#x200B;

Collections: I have two Accounts and they are both mine and are correct.

1)$612. Is a medical bill that is less than a year old.  I plan on contacting them Monday or should I just straight write a letter first?

2)$453. Is a old cell phone bill that will drop off come next year. I contacted the collection agency and said they do not do pay for deletion.

Credit card:

Zero. I recently was made an authorized user on my mom's credit card. She has excellent credit and keeps her utilization at 10% or lower. I also just received a secured card from Navy Federal Credit Union.

I accepted a per diem(only guaranteed 1 day a week and on call) position. Am I totally happy with my job? No I wipe ass and sometimes have violent patients. I think about getting out of the medical field or at least transitioning to a less poop saturated occupation. 

But should I go back and accept a full time position for a dollar less pay at my current place.  Just stick it out for a few months and try to raise my credit score, build a savings, and work off my debt and build other skills to transition out?

personalfinance,Did I screw up future Medicaid benefits by buying my elderly parents a home?,"Two years ago I bought my elderly parents a home; I paid the down payment and make the payments each month. However, it made sense at the time to put my father on the title and mortgage, as it meant that we got a low ""owner-occupied"" interest rate (4%). 

But I've come upon a frightening possibility: The home may count as an asset of my Dad. This means that if he needs a nursing home and his meager savings are exhausted, Medicaid will consider his ownership of the home to be an asset and require that it be sold and half used for his bills.

Their financial planner suggested that it might be enough to file a quitclaim deed to take him off the title.  

But this brings questions: 

- Should we get his name off the title, and if so, how?
- Would a quitclaim count as a taxable event for me? (IRS sees it as me being gifted half a house?)
- Will my dad's payment to remove PMI complicate how much we each own of the home?
- Do I need to also take him off the mortgage? (Which I've heard can be difficult)

Links about quitclaim deeds tend to be about a completely paid-off family house with no mortgage, or about divorces or joint ownership by siblings. 

Details:

- Home price: US$255K, paid 10% down. 4% interest. Current balance 200K.
- We own the house ""jointly"" -- if one of us passes (presumably my dad), the house passes to the other. 
- After my parents sold their previous home in mountains last year, the meager 30K gain went to pay down principle and remove PMI.
- Dad has 13K in IRA, and a health insurance plan that would cover 12K of long-term care at 1200/month. Mom has similar, at 20K. 
- Dad is 91 and Mom is 85, but they are both in great health for their age. Mom is fading faster, if anything.

Bonus question: 

Should they be spending down their IRA's, as it's really not that much money, and they have enough to live on month-to-month via a 2500/month pension?",finance

personalfinance,Having trouble consolidating Sallie Mae loans,"Hey guys,

I have the financial planning skills of a 5 year old (currently 24) and I'm trying my best to turn that around. One of my biggest hold ups right now is that I'm having trouble consolidating my 3 high interest Sallie Mae loans at a total of 12k.

personalfinance,Benefits of a 7/1 ARM loan in my position,"I’m looking to buy a house next year as a starter so I can begin building equity at 24.

Is a 7/1 ARM loan the best option here? I have no intention of staying in this place for more than 7 years max, 5/6 ideally.

personalfinance,Saving vs. student loans,"I'm 24, and make a 60k salary. Each month, I take home a little over $3510 and have been trying to figure out the best way to spend my extra money. Initially, my biggest priority after getting a job a few years ago was to try to pay off my student loans within 4 years instead of 10. But since I've paid off the loans that accrued the most interest (around 6%), I'm concerned that there must be better ways to spend my money right now.

I have around $6.3k left in student loans (at a 3.1-4% interest rate). I've paid off around $4,000 ahead of schedule by contributing $250/month instead of $125/month (10-year plan).

My 401k is around $3910 - unfortunately, my company doesn't match and I haven't been contributing much because of that.

I also have $6.5k in extra funds that are sitting in my savings account. I'm not sure what the wisest thing to do with this money would be - possibly a HYSA?

What would be the wisest way to spend my money? After reading through this subreddit, it seems like paying my loans at a lower rate, contributing more to retirement, and setting aside more for my savings account would be better. Any advice welcome.

personalfinance,"The Cost of a Becoming a Physician, Is It Worth It?","**TLDR; Becoming a doctor costs a lot.  I ran some numbers.**  

&amp;#x200B;

Background: I'm 25. It’s not unlikely that I would be accepted into medical school.

&gt;Top marks: 520 MCAT (98th Percentile), 3.8 GPA, Cornell undergrad (2016)  
&gt;  
&gt;Good research: 5 Publications, 18 Abstracts, 3 years in biomedical engineering lab at UPenn (2016-2019)  
&gt;  
&gt;I’m a snowflake: a disadvantaged applicant, family received welfare, cash assistance via supplemental security income, single parent, 2 siblings, family income of $60,000. Got letters from Harvard and Washington Universty at Saint Louis asking me to apply (with a partial fee waiver, because I’m a snowflake).  
&gt;  
&gt;The twist: I’m going to grad school, a 1 year masters in biomedical engineering, Cornell (2019-2020).

&amp;#x200B;

**Recently, I’ve began to question whether it’s a reasonable decision to become a physician, as opposed to a biomedical engineer.**

&amp;#x200B;

Reasons:

1)  Training takes time:  

&gt;1/3 of medical school graduates complete residency training in 3 years.  The other 2/3 complete residency in 5-7 years.    
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;So in total, I would complete my training in 8-12 years.  If I go MD, I would be 33-37 at the end; (if MD/PhD, I’d be 37-41).  If I go for a job after BME Master’s, I would start working at age 26.

2)  Applying costs money: 

&gt;Applying to medical school costs $150 per application, $300 per interview.  Apply to 30 schools, interview at 20 schools, that’s $11,000.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Fee waiver?  Yeah, not a thing unless the applicant and parent(s) earn less than 400% federal poverty limit.  Parental income, no matter how old the applicant is, must be included.  The cutoff is $38,000.  I live with my mother and grandmother.  Because I make $32,000, and my mother makes more than $6,000 per year, I do not qualify for the AAMC’s Fee Assistance Program.    
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Could I appeal?  No. “The program staff will not consider appeals based on a dispute of Fee Assistance Program policies, such as the use of parental income, to make a decision on your application.”

3)  Medical school costs money: 

&gt;Medical school tuition health insurance and fees is $37,000/yr (public medical school, in state)-$61,000/yr (private medical school). Cost of living is $22,000/yr.  In total, attending medical school costs $236,000-$332,000.   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Add in $11,000 in undergraduate student loans, $77,000 for master’s ($55,000 tuition fees health insurance + $22,000 living expenses)  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Add interest, assume 4%/yr.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Assuming I attend a private medical school, complete a 5-year residency/fellowship, I start my first job $555,000 in debt.

The numbers: 

&gt;Undergraduate:		$11,000\*1.04\^10  
&gt;  
&gt;Masters:			$77,000\*1.04\^9  
&gt;  
&gt;Medical School Yr1:	$83,000\*1.04\^8  
&gt;  
&gt;Medical School Yr2:	$83,000\*1.04\^7  
&gt;  
&gt;Medical School Yr3:	$83,000\*1.04\^6  
&gt;  
&gt;Medical School Yr4:	$83,000\*1.04\^5  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**Total:				$555,000**

&amp;#x200B;

The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports median annual income for physicians at $166,400. Monthly take home pay close to $10,000. 

&amp;#x200B;

Note: other sources report higher salaries, so let’s be generous.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;If I make $200,000/yr, that’s a monthly takehome of $12,000.  
&gt;  
&gt;If I make $250,000/yr, that’s a monthly takehome of $15,000.

So how long will it take to pay that off?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Scenario 1: If I pay $10,000/month for 5 years, I’m debt-free in 15 years, at age 40.  
&gt;  
&gt;Scenario 2: If I pay $7,500/month for 7 years, I’m debt-free in 17 years, at age 42.  
&gt;  
&gt;Scenario 3: If I pay $5,600/month for 10 years, I’m debt-free in 20 years, at age 45.  
&gt;  
&gt;Scenario 4: If I pay $5,000/month for 12 years, I’m debt-free in 22 years, at age 47.

Alternatively, If I get a job after my masters, I’d be $88,000 in debt.  Biomedical engineers from Cornell start making about $75,000/year with a monthly take home of about $5,000.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Scenario A: If I pay $2,000/month for 4 years, I’m debt-free in 5 years, at age 30.  
&gt;  
&gt;Scenario B: If I pay $1,500/month for 5 years, I’m debt-free in 6 years, at age 31.  
&gt;  
&gt;Scenario C: If I pay $1,200/month for 7 years, I’m debt-free in 8 years, at age 33.

&amp;#x200B;

5)  Mental Health:  Physicians have a high rate of burnout, substance misuse, depression, and suicide.  Google it.  Personally, I know several of them, my father included.  

&amp;#x200B;

6)  House: When do I want to start saving up for a down payment?  That’s $1500/month for 4 years plus a $1,700 mortgage thereafter.

&amp;#x200B;

7)  Kids: One kid cost about $1,000 a month in living expenses.  Saving up for College tuition costs another $1,000/month.  Do I want to have one?  Or two?  I don’t know yet.

&amp;#x200B;

8)  Professional investment opportunity flexibility: I train for 9 years to do one job. I’ll be in enough debt and earning enough to keep me doing that job.  Although savvy loan repayment schemes are an option, I don’t know if I want to join the military or do public service.

&amp;#x200B;

9)  Interesting: I like science, doing experiments, designing new things, thinking like an engineer, new challenges every day, learning all the time.  Medicine has new challenges and clinical practice changes all the time.  But will that be enough to keep me engaged?  I don’t know.

&amp;#x200B;

10)  Work/life balance: Medicine is not just a job, it’s a 65-100 hour/week lifestyle. The training is grueling.  I like weekends.  I’ve given them up for three years, and now I would like to have them back.  

&amp;#x200B;

How much vacation do I want?  More than 2 weeks a year.  I like holidays.  In training, each one is a gift.  During a career, earning more than a couple holidays a year is a privilege. 

&amp;#x200B;

My hobbies?  I run ultramarathons.  I like to camp, hike, and play music.  I enjoy time spent on home improvement.  And I love dogs.  In my lifetime, I’d like to rescue a few.  The physician lifestyle makes that tough.

&amp;#x200B;

personalfinance,Total and Permanent Disability Discharge: What happens after the three year monitoring period?,"As a precursor: I am permanently disabled and actively looking for work. But the employment opportunities for me as someone who is deaf, disabled, and unable to drive are just not there. 

I have some questions TPD discharge.

Effectively, during the three year monitoring period I would not be allowed to make more than the federal poverty limit and would have to report any changes of income to my loan holders and such. If I made more than that limit, my loans could be reinstated.

But, what happens if I make more than that limit after the three year post-discharge monitoring period? Will I face the same repercussions? I'm looking at making some solo video game projects that might take off after 3 years (but who knows really)",finance
personalfinance,Dealer won't take pre-approved loan,"Throwaway because this has a lot of details I don't want on my main account.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going through the process to buy a new vehicle.  I did all the things recommended - negotiated the price down (checked with a few dealerships to do this), negotiated my trade-in value up.  Got pre-approved through my credit union for more than the price I'd need.  Got all the way through to the financing part of buying the vehicle and then I run into all of the issues.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm told that they've never heard of my credit union before (it's a federal credit union), it's not one of their partners, it's not in their system, and they'd have to pay a bunch of fees for me to use my credit union for my loan.  They said that the interest rate offered by my credit union (2.99%) was too low and because of this, I needed to sign the contract with dealer financing at 4.99% ""just for a few days until the credit union loan comes through"".

&amp;#x200B;

I called my credit union and they said that this type of thing is pretty normal, but that sometimes it can get worked out on weekdays when the loan officers are in.  My credit union said that usually when something like this happens, they just fill out paperwork to refinance with the credit union and then I'd get the original approved rate, unless something goes wrong and then they would guarantee the rate quoted by the dealer.

&amp;#x200B;

I told the dealership I'm not signing anything, I'll talk to my credit union tomorrow.  They wanted me to give them my down payment today to ""hold the car"".  I told them no.  They asked if my credit union says it's okay will I sign for the 4.99%.  They told me that they do this whenever they deal with credit unions.

&amp;#x200B;

My gut tells me this whole thing is shady but I don't know what to think since my credit union seems to think this happens often.  Is this normal?  How can I get through this with just my credit union loan?

&amp;#x200B;

Just for context: credit rating in the low 800s.  income well into the 6-figures.  spouse has comparable stats but is not co-signing.  Location: CA

&amp;#x200B;

Update:

&amp;#x200B;

I ended up talking to my credit union again and they assured me that this is a normal thing that they see all the time.  I went to the dealer and they said they had to run my credit.  Again, I asked my credit union and they said it was totally normal.  Completed the paperwork, watched the guy at the dealership fax the info to my credit union, left with the car that day and the check was overnighted and delivered/cashed.  Everything seems to have worked out and I've got a loan through my credit union.  What ended up convincing me was my credit union assuring me repeatedly that it would be fine.  I'll update again if it all goes to hell but I wanted to put this out there for anyone searching for answers in a similar situation.

&amp;#x200B;

personalfinance,"Somehow, someone has my information and is trying to hack my accounts.","I'm not sure if this is the right place to post but I don't know what sub covers this.

Beginning of April I received an email from Discover saying they found small, strange charges on my account in a different state. Called them, got a new card and was refunded, no issues. I also got a new debit card to be on the safe side. 

Within the next week I received 6 emails from FSA (Federal Student Aid) saying my account had been locked. It locks after 3 failed attempts. I logged in, changed the password and my challenge questions. I've gotten 6 emails and changed my info each time, so I doubt this is someone accidentally mistyping their ID. I disabled my ID (you can't delete your account), but apparently all it takes is logging back in to reenable it? This is not clear on their website. Then yesterday, within two hours, I got the same email that my FSA ID was locked and and email from my bank saying that I had failed to answer my challenge questions properly. Now, I was concerned before, but this freaked me out. They both have very different login IDs &amp; passwords. To try to access my FSA account without the password, you would have to access my email to get the reset, or a code from my phone. To get my user name, you would have to go through the email or text process, or you would have to know my full name, SSN &amp; DOB, **then** answer challenge questions. To try to reset my bank login information, you would have to know my bank ID, account number, SSN, DOB **and then** answer challenge questions. I'm sure you can understand my concern now. I changed all my information and while I've gotten another FSA lock out email tonight, nothing from my bank. I called the bank today to express my concern and they gave me a case number and told me they'll contact me Monday. Me, on the ultra safe side, placed a freeze on my credit with all three major credit bureaus, as well as a fraud alert. I'm more concerned with someone actually accessing my bank account. I'm young..I don't have other accounts (yet). I've been watching my account like a hawk. I made a **very large** purchase today w/ my debit card and kind of expected it to be declined as a safety measure so I would call them, but nope. Anyway, I'm talking to my bank tomorrow and want my ID and account number changed, as well as some kind of fraud alert placed on the account. I guess I'm making this post to ask, what the hell is going on? There are not many agencies that have access to my SSN - and my bank info? my account number? Every account I have has 2FA if it's available, as well as stupid strong random passwords. My email, which I've had for a long time and use for everything, I actively check security logins and have an authenticator set up with it. My only guesses are 1. I accidentally accessed my bank app over unsecure wifi on my phone  (can't rule it out). 2. There was a breach somewhere that exposed my info. I mean, my SSN and DOB? How?? 

Anyway, this is half rant and half plea for help? Is there something I can be doing? I think I'm going to call FSA tomorrow as well. What do you do when your information is possibly out there like that?",finance

personalfinance,Retirement Plan Fund Selection Question - Probably Millionth Thread,"Hi all - long time lurker, first time poster. I have a question about 401k fund selection. I looked at the guide and reviewed my fund options, but I would be curious to know the opinion of the collective wisdom of this group:

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, I (31M) have three retirement plans. Two from my former employer - a 403(b) and a pension - and one from my current employer, a 401k. In the 403(b) I have 13,185.55, in the pension plan I have $8,709.606, and in my current employer's 401k I have 6,673.17. I understand I'm very far behind on contributions to my retirement, but I think that's a post for another day.

&amp;#x200B;

In my current employer's 401k, I've 100% invested in a target date fund (American Funds 2050 Target Date Retirement Fund - Class R3) with a high net expense ratio of 1.07. The following are my plan's other options:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

|Fund|NER: Annual Report|NER: Prospectus|Asset Allocation (Present)|Asset Allocation (Proposed)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**American Funds 2050 Target Date Retirement Fund - Class R3**|**0.67**|**1.07**|**100**||
|Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund|||||
|Vanguard Short Term Bond Index Fund|0.15|0.15|||
|Vanguard Short Term Federal Fund|0.2|0.2|||
|**Vanguard LifeStrategy Growth Investment**|**0**|**0.14**||**100**|
|PIMCO Investment Grade Credit Bond|0.99|0.99|||
|Janus Henderson High Yield|0.88|0.88|||
|Vanguard Long Term Treasury Fund|0.2|0.2|||
|American Funds 2020 Target Date Retirement Fund - Class R3|0.66|0.99|||
|American Funds 2025 Target Date Retire R3|0.66|1.01|||
|American Funds 2030 Target Date Retire R3|0.66|1.03|||
|American Funds 2035 Target Date Retire R3|0.66|1.04|||
|American Funds 2040 Target Date Retire R3|0.66|1.05|||
|American Funds 2045 Target Date Retire R3|0.66|1.05|||
|Vanguard LifeStrategy Moderate Growth Investment|0|0.13|||
|Vanguard Value Index Fund|0.17|0.17|||
|Vanguard FTSE Social Index Fund|0.18|0.18|||
|Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund|0.14|0.14|||
|Vanguard Growth Index Investor|0.17|0.17|||
|Principal MidCap R4|0.97|0.97|||
|Vanguard Small Cap Index Investment|0.17|0.17|||
|American Funds Europacific Growth R4|0.83|0.83|||

&amp;#x200B;

After reviewing the guide, while a target date fund is preferred, I'm thinking I should reallocate 100% of my contributions to the Vanguard LifeStrategy Growth Investment, since it is a balanced fund and has a much lower net expense ratio.

&amp;#x200B;

In both my former employer's 403(b) and pension plans, I'm 100% vested in the MassMutual Select T. Rowe Price Retirement 2050 Fund target date fund. This fund's net expense ratio is relatively much lower (0.56), but still not great. However, I don't think these two plans offer similarly better alternatives, and the guide does advise to keep money in a target date fund with a relatively high net expense ratio if it's comparable to other options in the plan.  Here are the other options:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

|Fund|NER: Annual Report|NER: Prospectus|Asset Allocation (Present)|Asset Allocation (Proposed)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|PIMCO Real Return Fund||0.88|||
|**PGIM Total Return Bond Fund**||**0.41**||**31**|
|PGIM High Yield Fund||0.56|||
|MassMutual Select TRP Retirement Bal 1||0.34|||
|MassMutual Select T. Rowe Price Retirement 2005 Fund||0.38|||
|MassMutual Select T. Rowe Price Retirement 2010 Fund||0.38|||
|MassMutual Select T. Rowe Price Retirement 2015 Fund||0.41|||
|MassMutual Select T. Rowe Price Retirement 2020 Fund||0.45|||
|MassMutual Select T. Rowe Price Retirement 2025 Fund||0.48|||
|MassMutual Select T. Rowe Price Retirement 2030 Fund||0.51|||
|MassMutual Select T. Rowe Price Retirement 2035 Fund||0.54|||
|MassMutual Select T. Rowe Price Retirement 2040 Fund||0.56|||
|MassMutual Select T. Rowe Price Retirement 2045 Fund||0.56|||
|**MassMutual Select T. Rowe Price Retirement 2050 Fund**||**0.56**|**100**||
|MassMutual Select T. Rowe Price Retirement 2060 Fund||0.56|||
|JP Morgan Equity Income Fund||0.5|||
|**Vanguard Institutional Index Fund**||**0.04**||**48**|
|JPMorgan US Equity L||0.6|||
|MainStay Large Cap Growth Fund||0.75|||
|Vanguard FTSE Social Index Fund||0.18|||
|JHancock3 Disciplined Value Mid Cap Fund||0.85|||
|Vanguard Mid Capitalization Index Fund||0.05|||
|MassMutual Select Mid Cap Growth Fund||0.72|||
|Columbia Small Cap Value II Fund||1.02|||
|Vanguard Small Cap Index Fund||0.05|||
|Janus Henderson Triton Fund||0.67|||
|American Funds Capital World Growth and Income Fund||0.45|||
|Harbor International Fund||0.72|||
|**BlackRock iShares MSCI EAFE International Index Fund**||**0.06**||**21**|
|Oppenheimer Developing Markets||1.05|||
|Principal Real Estate Securities Fund||0.87|||

&amp;#x200B;

However, I think that it may be a good idea to reallocate my contributions accordingly: 31% to PGIM Total Return Bond Fund with a net expense ratio of 0.41, 48% to Vanguard Institutional Index Fund with a net expense ratio of 0.04, and maybe 21% to BlackRock iShares MSCI EAFE International Index Fund with a net expense ratio of 0.06. However, I concede that the best option may just be to keep the money where it already is.

personalfinance,How to solve for fixed monthly income with increasing withdrawal rate over time?,"Hey all,

&amp;#x200B;

I've been trying to figure out the math for a scenario I've run into but I'm not quite sure how to make it work. Starting with a few assumptions:

&amp;#x200B;

1) Initial account balance of $0

2) A fixed amount $X will be deposited into the account every month over N years

3) The account earns an interest rate of A%

3) Withdrawal will occur from the account at initially $Y monthly, however this will increase by B% every year. (So the withdrawal schedule looks like \[Y, ..., Y, Y\*(1+B), ..., Y\*(1+B), Y\*((1+B)\^2), ..., Y\*((1+B\^2), ...\])

&amp;#x200B;

Solve for X such that the account balance at the end of N years is $0.

&amp;#x200B;

It's kind of seems similar to a loan payment except the loan payment is increasing over time and you earn interest on whatever amount you overpay the loan payment by so I'm not sure how to make it all fit together. Bonus points if you can figure out how much money needs to be instantaneously withdrawn/deposited if at any point in time A or B change.

&amp;#x200B;

personalfinance,Extra loan payments on a zero interest loan?,"I have a ~$10,000 student loan balance in the form of a unique zero interest loan. The minimum monthly payments equate to about $75 which puts completing repayment about 12 years in the future. Does it make any sense to increase the minimum payments if I can? The only thing I would get from this is piece of mind by getting out of debt quicker. I could be making a percentage by investing the money I don’t throw at it and would like to buy a home soon. I could pay this loan off tomorrow but it doesn’t seem like the right thing to do since the interest rate is 0%. What are your thoughts?",finance
personalfinance,"Overwhelmed w/ info about paying off cc debt, which has resulted in my inaction","So I have a shit ton of CC debt across 3 cards which has given me a shit credit score of 600:

* Ultimate Rewards card (I've had since August 2018): $595.53 w/ 28% interest rate
* DiscoverIT card (most recent CC card, since Jan 2019): $2,749.19 w/ 27% APR on 06/25/19 (end of promo period)

I've been making minimum payments after my monthly expenses, which include $900 rent, $50-80 utilities, $130 cell phone, $153 cable, Entertainment (Hulu, Netflix, Spotify, etc): $43.67, iCloud $2.99 and I also use Digit to help create some sort of a savings (and I use the CC payoff feature for $5/month).

&amp;#x200B;

I make a little more than $2400/month after taxes

I've been reading all around this sub &amp; there are so many varying opinions that I don't know which is best for me- taking out a personal loan to pay everything &amp; stop paying interest, getting a balance transfer card, etc. I've already decided I'm going to sell at least 1 thing around my home that I don't use a week &amp; use any funds from that to tackle my debt.

I just want to eliminate all this as quickly as possible and I have no idea how and I've just got information overload. Please help me out.

I've removed automatic payments for cable, netflix, and Hulu, and have halved the spotify payments to keep some sort of peace in my household.

I have a side gig of teaching sunday school and will be applying that extra $400 monthly to my CC payments instead of having it go to my mom.

personalfinance,Did an IRS payment plan for the first time. Completely lost,"Due to an accounting blunder on my part I owe about $7k in federal taxes this year. I filed through TurboTax and used their system to set up a payment plan. I thought that was all I needed to do, but I've been checking my bank statement and no funds have been withdrawn yet even though I set it up to pay $1k at time of filing, and $1k/mo after that. So I read through the tax docs and I figure I have to also set up the actual payments through [irs.gov/OPA](https://irs.gov/OPA)?

I went ahead and did that, entered my account number and routing number and selected automatic bank account withdrawal, and the last page of the IRS site has all this language about making payments on time. So do I also have to set up the payment on my bank website? Or did I screw something up and I'm going to be paying double each month now since I set up the payment plan on TurboTax and on the IRS site?

Am I on the right track? Should I call IRS or TurboTax for clarification?",finance

I really messed up, and had planned ahead to have all my credit cards paid on time and was doing well for many years. Burdens came up, and I unfortunately took up much more debt then I could handle since other huge expenses appeared. I have other debt totaling in about $5000 across other cards I could manage, but after school and living expenses are paid off, I’m only left with about $200 a week to pay off debt. Every time I pay off this higher debt credit card, the interest rates keep the balance up. I don’t know what to do. 

I’m considering just closing the account and hoping the settle the amount with the company because I couldn’t afford to pay this card right now or for the foreseeable future. But I don’t know what that means for my credit history future. I’m at a lost. My credit score is horrible right now so I can’t even get a balance transfer card to help. 

I’m at a lost. Please help. This is my fault entirely because I should have been planning even further and having a deeper saving account just in case, but life really threw me a curve ball. 

Should I default on this account and settle for a much lower account at the expense of closing the account and having remarks left on my credit history?",finance
Forex,GBP/USD: The Pair Keeps Declining,"**Current market conditions**

GBP continues its decline against USD within a narrow downward channel. In mid-March, the pair moved to a narrowing lateral channel and has been moving in it for a month. At the beginning of the last trading week, the pair succeeded on breaking the key support level of 1.3000 and moved even lower. 

The downtrend momentum persisted throughout the past week, and the pair reached 1.2865 and pointing to new lows. The main drive for the decline was the positive data on the labour market, durable goods orders and GDP for the US, creating an increase in demand for USD.

Starting this trading week, all eyes should be on the data for the major indices in the US and the UK. Another factor to pay attention is the Fed meeting regarding interest rate decision and follow-up comments. 

**Support and resistance levels**

For the short term, GBP/USD is likely to revisit previous lows of 1.2775 and 1.2700. In the medium term, growth in demand for the US dollar is expected because of the Fed's opportunity to raise the interest rate. 

The pound, unfortunately, cannot recover due to the pressure of Brexit decisions. 

Technical indicators are confirming the decline forecasted by fundamental events. MACD on the D1 chart indicates the rapid growth in the volume of short positions, and Bollinger Bands are directed downwards.

Resistance levels (RED): 1.2975, 1.3000, 1.3030, 1.3160, 1.3215, 1.3300.

Support levels (YELLOW): 1.2855, 1.2775, 1.2700, 1.2640, 1.2585, 1.2410

I plan to transfer both to a university to pursue a bachelor's degree in both fields. 

I attended college for one semester in 2014, and just decided to go back to college (at a different college) my GPA for my first semester was a 3.86 and this semester it'll be at least a 3.5 if not a bit higher, I have 2 weeks left. 

I don't play sports, and I don't have a lot of extracurriculars aside from clubs at my current school, and I don't have any recent volunteering experience, most of the scholarships I receive would have to be academic based. 

My ACT composite score was only 21 and I haven't taken the SATs.

personalfinance,Opinions and options on Roth IRA/CDs and banking,"Hello everyone, there’s a few things I want to tackle with this post and am looking for ANY AND ALL feedback. To start, my employer contributes 6% of my salary to a 403b without me doing anything, they then match up to another 3.5% that I contribute which I do, this is through TIAA. I’m looking into opening a Roth IRA ASAP. I was considering going through TIAA, Fidelity or Vanguard. At first I liked the idea of leaving TIAA because I want this to be completely unrelated to my employer, but if they’re my best option I’ll do what needs to be done. Fidelity sent me through to their “Fidelity GO” where they manage everything at a fee, Vanguard won’t even do this unless I have 50,000 with them apparently and TIAA is the same as Fidelity however, I’ve not heard much about TIAA as most people preach about Fidelity and vanguard. 

My second area I’m looking for advice on is CDs, what’s the best route for this? Where do I start? I’m vaguely familiar with them i.e. if I get a CD for 1k and pay it over a period of ex amount of time it raises my credit score and I get that 1k after the amount of time, correct?

Thirdly, I am looking to open an Ally savings account strictly for the interest rate, and throwing an emergency fund into that account and continually adding into it overtime. Seems like a pretty straight forward idea to me... 

Fourth, currently I bank with Wells Fargo, have been since 2010 but I was looking into other options, I noticed chase has a 200$ bonus into a checking right now if you sign up with them and do direct deposits. Those of you with chase, how are your experiences with them? Is it worth leaving WF for essentially 200 free dollars even though I’ve banked with them for 9 years? Does my time with Wells mean anything to them over someone that might only have been with them for a year?

And lastly, what is the best option to invest my money in the short term? Index funds? Mutual funds? Something I can take and add money with no penalty for big purchases I.e. a house, a car, etc etc. a “rainy day” big purchase fund and who would he ideal to go with as far as vanguard, fidelity, TIAA etc

My question is:  I took a TSP loan out a few years back after my divorce.  I am in the position now where I pay $500 a month towards it with it scheduled to be paid off in 3.5 years.  I am renting a one bedroom apartment for $1500, but can afford a place up to $2500 a month (MD is outrageously expensive).  My desire to move is because I have 2 daughters (11 and 14) and, again, the apartment is a 1 bedroom.  Since my new job a year ago I can now afford more home which allows them to have their own rooms when they are over.  I have given myself two options:  The first, basically pay an extra $800 a month towards the loan and it is finished in 1.5 years wile contributing 3% towards TSP (for the matching), about the same time as the apartment lease is up, then get a place.  My girls will then be 13 and 16.  The second option, pay the loan as scheduled and get the place now.  Getting a place now means missing out on tsp contributions for a year and a half until my annual increases add up enough to do so, and continuing with the loan schedule of $500 a month for the next 3.5 years.  I'm trying to weigh that against my daughters and their ages and providing for them a better living environment when they are over.  Is a year and a half or so too long to miss out on  tsp contributions as well as the amount of the loan not being in the market (20k) if I am planning to retire in 20 years?  In about 3 years child support drops, then again in 6 years. I'm currently paying about 2k a month support and in 6 years I'll be able to heavily contribute to my tsp.  I'm wondering just how big of an impact the next couple years will have against my TSP if I just go a head and upgrade my place now vs. paying the loan early.  It's essentially a realocation of where I would put my extra income, home or TSP, for the short term.  Any advice is greatly appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,Deceptive Banking Practices,"So my wife and I have a vacation account with a large multi state bank. We only use it to hold our vacation fund and have purposely decided to separate it from our savings and checking bank. We place any gifts (Christmas, Anniversary, and Birthdays) directly into this account to save for something fun in the future. When vacation comes we use this account to pay our spending. 

&amp;#x200B;

The account charges $3 for paper statements (Rip off I know) so we have had digital statements for &gt; 3 years with no fees. Because of this we rarely get mail from the bank to our address. So when we received a statement I was a bit surprised but knew to open it right away. Sure enough they charged us the $3. I called the branch and they confirmed that the digital account was close that is why they sent a paper copy. They could not tell me why the digital account was closed and said that there are no notes associated with the closure. 

The teller was nice and explained the bank manager was out and took my info to have her call me back. After &gt; 2 hours I decided to go another route and contacted the national twitter account. Of course they were very quick to respond when I wrote that I am willing to take my complaints to the OCC and Federal Reserve for complaints of deceptive banking practices. They contacted via phone apologized and confirmed again that the online banking was closed. They again told me they did not have any notes about the closure. I asked for a date the online banking was closed and they said they could not provide that info to me. They did reopen the online account and they did refund the $3 fee.

&amp;#x200B;

I have sat and thought about it for some time now. Should I still contact the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Federal Reserve to file a complaints for deceptive banking practices. As a large multi state bank could they be doing this to others? I fear they are being deceptive and placing accounts back on paper statements that have little activity in the hopes that the account holders don't notice the $3 fee. If that is the case the only way they are going to stop is if enough complaints are filed. Why were they so unwilling to provide me information such as the reason why online banking was closed or the date it was closed?

&amp;#x200B;

I wasn't entirely sure if this belonged here or r/legaladvice but at the very least it serves as a reminder to always check your statements. Even if its an account that isn't used very often.

Edit: Made to remove the sentence that we use the debit card on vacation. This was a mistake and a previous practice. We currently use our credit cards on vacation and pay off the bills using the vacation account.",finance

personalfinance,Advice on cash-out refinancing?,"We bought our home almost two years ago with a conventional loan financing $130k at 4.65% interest through Quicken Loans. Our payments are $915 a month. We have a couple of high balance credit cards that we were trying to take care of, so we looked at refinancing. The value of the home is appraising at $164,000 now, so thru Quicken we are looking at refinancing the $122,000 we have left and taking out 5,500 towards the credit card, and another 5500 to put into the house, there are a lot of repairs that need to be made, and things that we just never had the money to do. Interest rate will be 4.25% and new loan amount would be $142,000. They have recommended putting us from conventional to FHA, and our payment will go up from $915 to $967. Credit score is around 650. The closing costs are going to be $8145. 

Is this a bad deal? we really wanted our mortgage payment to stay the same, but the interest rate we're paying on the credit card is insane, and having that money to get the house painted make repairs etc is going to help us a lot.

I reached out to another lender, Sebonic, and he said he thinks they could do the same deal but for 4000 less in closing costs. Since we've been using Quicken since we got our house, I'm a little hesitant to switch lenders, the reviews about Sebonic are mixed. 

We're torn on what we should do here, any advice on how to negotiate closing costs with our current lender? What is the benefit of going from conventional to FHA? Anyone have experience with this? Advice would be much appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,Should I pay off a student loan with my emergency savings?,"I'm considering paying off one of my student loans. I have many others, but this is the only one not eligible for PSLF and I'm trying to get it paid off ASAP. (Yes, I know PSLF is effed, but I'm still carefully banking on it someday since I work at a nonprofit and have been diligent in checking all of the right boxes each year.)

The balance of the federal loan in question is $4232, and the interest rate is 6.55%. I was planning on aggressively paying it off with a $300 payment every month, but I hate watching the money go from my paycheck. Paying it off now would save me around $200 in interest vs. paying the $300 a month.

Here's where my hesitation lies: I would have to take money from my emergency savings to pay it off, reducing my emergency savings by more than half. It would then have about 3 months of living expenses rather than the 6 I have socked away now. Being able to save that $300 a month would effectively get my emergency savings back up to the 6 months it's at now by January 2020.

I have no credit card debt, I'm putting money away into a high yield savings each month, and I'm maxing out my retirement match at work (I put in 8% and get 12% from my employer). My job is stable, I'm in good health, and the hope is that nothing in our house breaks or explodes anytime soon. Is it relatively safe to pay this loan off or should I just keep chipping away at this for the next year or so and leave my emergency savings alone? I'm paranoid about money so I can't tell if that's where my anxiety around this is coming from or if it's truly not worth doing.",finance

CryptoCurrency,How Will the Transition from Fiat to FULL BLOWN CRYPTO TAKE PLACE,"Just as the title states. How??? I haven't really read or heard anyone post any ideas. The most i have read about is that it will happen in a blink of an eye. 

I think that it will happen like a roll out. Maybe they do the ""Bank Holiday"" bail in type of deal. Everyone gets 10 percent cut off the top, everyone is protesting going ape shit because they cant draw out their money. Then to find out they got less in their accounts then they did the previous 24 hours.

Hence this is how they fully introduce negative interest rates

Then the Government responds by saying they (the people) need to go to their current banks and set up a new account to continue to use their current bank and this will be a little tutorial while at the bank on how to use their crypto platform. That or you can opt out for the online tutorial. If you dont have  a bank account then you go to your local drivers license DMV to enroll that way. Having to show all proof of identity to get your PIN like your Social Security number to used by only you for the rest of your life. So now they have a way to see your purchases etc.

Hence this is how they fully introduce negative interest rates aswell. So we all have to bail out the banks. Not only that but they will be able to stop all transactions with a push of a button.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe its after a world event. Short war etc. 

What do you guys/gals think. How will the transition roll in your eyes. I think we all can agree is that when it does whoever owns any crypto/ any coin will be okay/ well off. Then the fomo will come in and then after the next bubble the 90 percent of cryptos will die off.

personalfinance,Trying to build a plan to get out of $90k debt,"I (34M) am $90,500 in debt.

I owe $60,000 in federal student loans.

I owe $9,000 on a personal loan.

I owe $9,000 to American Express.

I owe $5,000 to Chase Visa

I owe $4,000 to Citi MasterCard

I owe $3,500 to PayPal credit

I grew up in a very poor, immigrant family in the US, often homeless. I was raised in a variety of group homes and foster homes from age 8-18. I was a first-generation college grad with no family support so I took out max loans along with the grants. 

Worked in nonprofits for 5 years hoping to qualify for federal loan forgiveness. I wanted to pay forward the help many nameless social workers gave me. The state had a record-setting budget impasse and I racked up credit card debt during the many layoffs. 

Married, then divorced, then depressed then suicidal when wife turned out to be impressively unfaithful. Counseling and retail therapy threw more on credit cards. My share of the wedding had also added about $10,000 to it.

I now work in digital marketing making $42,000 a year. I occasionally freelance, adding maybe $5,000 a year. 

I take home $2,600 or so a month and pay a little over $1,300 in minimum payments of just this debt. 

I know and accept that all of this is because of me and my choices. 

I’m trying to cut costs but life issues/I keep getting in the way. Tire blowout, car towed, broken phone, etc. I also keep getting surprised by renewal charges and services that I vaguely remember signing up for. The most expensive ones were to make my work easier.

 I have many payment options saved via Apple Pay, in a cloud-passed credentials manager and other 'one-click charge solutions'.

I rent a guest house so tiny, I can trip and be in three rooms when I fall. My neighbors are a junkyard, an auto repair shop and some kind of industrial pallet yard. Rent is $500 a month mostly because my landlord is someone I helped a lot during my nonprofit time (rent in my area is normally in the $900-$1,100 range).

So I live paycheck to overdraft, month after month. In fact, I just got an alert that my balance just went under my alert threshold. So that's fun. 

Meanwhile, I got engaged. Fiancee has no debt, but makes less than me. Has lots of family support. The wedding is looking expensive. I am contributing what I can when I can, but we're both on the same page for my plan. She wants to help me stick to my plan after the wedding.

\----------------

My plan:

1. Evaluate all remaining services and cancel or budget for must-haves only. If I need something for work, then work needs to pay for it. Otherwise, it goes.
2. I've become very abrupt with 'No'. No is my default answer to invites out.
3. Take up more freelance opportunities. Maybe a second job.
4. Follow the handy dandy flowchart from the sidebar here.

Edit:

5. Gonna update my budget spreadsheet to show Total guaranteed income, minus all expected expenses and the budget gap. That x1.5 is what I want to make in a side job + expense cuts. Might make a Google Data Studio 
out of it cause nerd.

6. Gonna contact debt holders

7. Gonna talk to boss about my situation. Hell, he might be down for me freelancing for him (keeping my productivity in the company).

8. Use unbury and check snowball v avalanche for debts. See which plays out better.

personalfinance,Maintaining Multiple High Yield Checking Accounts?,"I am looking to transition away from a traditional bank to a modern, online bank with higher interest rates (e.g. Schwab High Yield Investor Checking @ 0.40%). My current banking set-up involves having several checking (5+) and savings (5+) accounts, in order to track different types of spending and savings, and also for security reasons. (e.g. one of these accounts is an account that I keep empty and link to other banks / Bill Pay so that if this number is compromised, the rest of my accounts are still safe.)

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately it seems like many of the truly high-yield accounts make this difficult. I am thinking in particular of Schwab, which forces you to open additional brokerage accounts w/ every checking account, and also does a hard credit pull for each account opening (I called and confirmed this). This seems unnecessary and risky (having needless account #s floating around unused). I also looked into LMCU max checking, and they only offer the max 3% interest rate on one account, even if you open multiple accounts. Ally is excellent with maintaining multiple accounts, but their interest rate is low @ 0.10% (assuming no min balance).

&amp;#x200B;

So, my question is simple: Any advice or experience opening and maintaining a large number of accounts with a single bank, while maintaining a high interest rate, low fees, and no minimum balance? Maybe I am asking for too much, but it never hurts to ask.",finance
personalfinance,Reconsolidating my student loan - fixed vs variable,"Last year, I consolidated my government loan to a private company and it made a pretty substantial impact to my interest rate (~6% to 5.1%)

This year, given the amount I have paid off (it’s an aggressive payment scheme), I looked to reconsolidate again. Given that I’m paying $1,000 a month, it thought it best to reconsolidate every 6 months to a year to get a better rate. I looked today and saw I could get 4.9%.

But I also noticed that I can get 4.7% if I go variable. If I then reconsolidate a year later, i wouldn’t be hit with the “gamble” that is variable rates. Would I be opening myself up to any issues by taking this path and getting that extra 0.2% a year (mind you, that’s only $146 so if it’s even a smidge of an issue, it’s best to stick fixed or not change anything st all).",finance

personalfinance,Need another few sets of eyes to tell me if I'm blind,"Like the title says, I just want to run this past a few people to make sure that I’m not missing anything. My husband has been working as a contractor for the last 3 years. He was told multiple times that he would never be hired but he likes the company and I generally carry benefits through my employer so it’s never been an issue. He asked for a raise a couple weeks ago because he hasn’t gotten any COL adjustments since he started. They offered him a permanent position with the best insurance package we’ve ever had as well as a $7/hr raise. It feels like we’ve won the lottery and neither of us have quite gotten over the shock of it.

Here is the rundown of our current budget and my plan for our new budget.

* **Take Home Income** - Was $4,700, now $5,800

* **Mortgage &amp; Escrow** - Minimum payment is about $1,100, we have been paying $1,500 and don’t plan to increase it any more right now. Interest rate of 3.6%

* **Auto Loan** - Minimum payment of $175, I wanted to pay cash for it but the interest rate we were offered is 2.04% and it just didn’t make sense not to finance. We are planning to trade this in at the end of the year and keep a similar payment. (Trading a gas Wrangler for a hybrid Wrangler)

* **Health Insurance &amp; HSA** - Was $650, the new health insurance premium is accounted for with the new take home pay and we won’t be eligible for the HSA anymore. However, I plan to put aside the max contribution that we are eligible for which will be a one-time payment of $1,700.

* **Cell Phones &amp; Utilities** - $380

* **Auto expenses** - $400 for two cars, one new and one old. Planning to drive the old car until it dies, no issues besides rust. It’s a 2007 Aveo, I would be buying something similar but only a few years old when it gives up the ghost.

* **Pets** - $200 (one cat, one dog, both in their senior years. We carry insurance and buy them special food and OTC meds to keep them in good shape.)

* **Groceries** - $150

* **Misc Spending** (Clothing, eating out, haircuts, hobbies, other insurance, ect.) - $200

**Total Spending** - Was $3,655 with $1,045 surplus, now $3,005 with a $2,795 surplus

**Retirement** - In the past each of us has been contributing the max each year to our respective IRAs, because neither of our employers match on 401k contributions. I’m planning to double that so we are both contributing the max to a Roth as well as traditional IRA which would be $2,000/month. At the beginning of the year we had about $55,000 across our IRAs and HSA.
I’m expecting that we’ll be staying in the 12% tax bracket until another major tax reform bill comes through. I work for a non-profit with no mobility and my husband doesn’t have much room above him either. I’m not expecting either of us will get any large boosts in pay but we both like our jobs and don’t plan to leave.

Now on to my questions:
1.	I did a retirement spreadsheet with contributions of $24,000/year assuming an 8% return for the next 20 years, a 5% return for the next 5 years after that, and 2% each year on. Also assuming annual withdrawal of $30,000/year and increasing 2% per year for COL we could retire in 20 years and live about 50 years on the money that we’ve saved. Is there something I’m missing? Even with compound interest it seems too easy.
2.	We are going to have a surplus of about $800 per month and we already have about $30,000 on hand. Should I just throw it into a taxable brokerage and set it out of my mind? I feel like its stupid to open a 401k that we really don’t need and won’t be matched. We do some charity giving but mostly volunteering, and we are planning to do some traveling but likely only once every few years. 

This is literally more money than I know what to do with.  I grew up poor, my husband grew up working class, and we don’t need much to live on. I’ve been stressing more about money this month than I have in years because I’m afraid I’m missing opportunities or forgetting something that everyone else knows to plan around. Does anyone else see something that I’m not accounting for?",finance

worldpolitics,Sanctions does not work in the Arctic,"Russia, thanks to a large number of icebreakers and a military-technical base, «staked» the Arctic behind, which is rich in deposits of oil, gas and minerals, but further development of the region requires significant investments and the use of new technologies. According to American publishing house «The National Interest», the low price of oil and US sanctions can seriously restrict Russia's access to the riches of the Arctic region. Nevertheless, at least a dozen of world states are interested in long-term partnership with Moscow. Among them are France, China, Japan, Korea, India, Vietnam, Singapore and even the oil giant - Saudi Arabia. This is evidenced, in particular, by the visit of the Minister of Energy, Industry and Natural Resources of Saudi Arabia, Hadid Al-Falih, to the opening ceremony of the first stage of the «Yamal LNG» plant in 2017.

President Vladimir Putin at the plenary session of the 5th International Arctic Forum «The Arctic is the Territory of Dialogue», which was held on April 9-10, 2019 in St. Petersburg, said that the sanctions interfere, but not in a critical way. «To a certain extent, this even encourages us to actively develop our own technologies». In 2018, President Putin’s government invested about 1 billion rubles in import substitution and plans to scale up these efforts.

It is important to note that the melting of ice in the Arctic Ocean opens up entirely new opportunities, but the West is not able to use them because of the complete absence of the icebreaking fleet. Russia's main rival, the United States, has only a few large dilapidated icebreakers, which, in turn, are already under 50 years old, while Russia has 40 of them, as well as the newest LK-60s. Thus, it is obvious that Russia has no competitors in the Arctic region.

It is clearly visible that the United States continues the sanctions policy towards Russia and thus tries to limit or stop the influence of the Russian Federation not only in the Arctic region, but also in other important directions. Sanctions also prohibit investing in Russian LNG projects abroad. Thus, any LNG-related operations, and in particular gas liquefaction plants, for example, «Etinde» in Cameroon, where «Lukoil» owns 30%, «Rosneft» and «ExxonMobil» partnership in Mozambique, can come under the bill, as well as the possible participation of «Gazprom» in LNG projects in Iran, which is already complicated by US sanctions.

But nevertheless, according to analysts\` opinion, Russia has managed to set a record for oil production, the nuclear power industry is actively developing, and foreign contracts are also being implemented. But Finland and Hungary, that are the members of the European Union, that supported sanctions against Russia, both are implementing nuclear power plant construction projects with Russian «Rosatom». Moreover, the Finnish project uses funds from the Russian National Wealth Fund.

Moreover, on April 10, 2019, in the government of V. Putin they stated that due to the great interest of foreign investors, Russia, in turn, is ready to protect and guarantee these investments. It is obvious that foreign investors do not intend to «turn off» projects that are extremely beneficial for them in the Arctic and are still set up for a long-term partnership with the Russian Federation. Thus, Moscow, even under sanctions, remains «afloat», once again, confirming its status as a key player in the global economic arena.",energy

I'm curious why events have led us to where we are now. Our economic situation is so curious, and so inexplicable by historical standards, that one has to wonder where we strayed. Student loans, increase in bad credit/loans, *huge* increase in wealth inequality, Europe on the brink of recession, tax cuts, quantitative easing/tightening, Fed rate policy. We could point fingers all day. I don't want this thread to be about pointing fingers. I instead want to talk about where we go from here. 

The German 10 Year Note is no longer negative, but at less than a single basis point, it's basically negative. How much longer until the EU powerhouse finally falls into a recession? How will the rest of the world react? Further, we've been saved from Brexit until the very fitting date of midnight Halloween. Get your stock market related costumes out. What happens then? If you're not following happenings across the pond, I don't blame you. The gist though is that the UK has been denied access to EU elections/votes in exchange for getting a ""long"" Brexit extension. The UK has now finally become what they only feared they had become before the Brexit vote, which is also very fitting for a nation whose population (technically 51% of the population) is constantly afraid of taxation without representation. 

The 3m/10y U.S. curve is no longer inverted, and inversion was short-lived, but it happened. Was that a fluke due to unprecedented QE/QT? Or does current behaviour of the bond market, when juxtaposed with the stock market, hint towards future perverse happenings? How should we react to an all-time high stock market if we're similarly witnessing high demand in the bond market? I truly believe that the US economy will continue to do well, but the stock market has not always followed economic outlook. It is very possible for the market to stagnate or drop whilst the economy prospers.

On the positive side, the U.S. economy basically stands alone compared to the rest of the world here. We're the only ones doing well, and we're doing *really* well.",finance

1st year = 54K

2nd year = 55K

3rd year = 57K

4th year = 58K

5th year = 60K

&amp;#x200B;

**Expenses:**

1. Mortgage/rent
2. Food
3. Lease/buy car
4. Furniture, TV, etc
5. Internet, water, electricity

&amp;#x200B;

**Housing:**

1. **Should I buy or rent a house?**
2. I want to buy a house as an investment and sell it in 5 years when I finish residency, I want to eventually move back to Vancouver, Canada.
3. House budget: $300K maximum (have been approved for a loan with 3% down), cost of living in my area of central florida is good, homes can be purchased for around 200K. I have enough saved up for a down payment.
4. My mortgage lender quoted a rough interest rate or 4.25-4.375%. Is this a good rate?
5. I have a co-resident who wants to rent a room and stay in my house
6. I am concerned that I will have very little time to maintain a home, with residency being 80+ hours a week and as my top priority, I may not have time to be a landlord, should I hire someone to do this for me? What is a good company?
7. Pros of buying: could get the invested money back after I sell it, versus renting is sunk costs each month
8. Cons of buying: lots of time and effort towards maintaining home which I won’t have
9. Pros of renting: no extra time needed for being a home owner
10. Cons of renting: all that money paid towards rent is lost
11. If buy, what tips can you give for a first time home owner and what do I need to know before buying a house?
12. What questions should I ask when shopping for the best mortgage lenders?
13. What questions should I ask when looking for a suitable house?

&amp;#x200B;

**Car:**

1. **Should I buy or lease a car?**
2. I have a 2000 Nissan pathfinder in Vancouver that I could ship down to Florida but that might cost a lot for a car thats probably worth $1000

&amp;#x200B;

**Savings Plan:**

1. **Where should I put my savings?**
2. I’ve read about Roth IRAs and 401K’s should I contribute there?
3. Should I invest in Vanguard Index Funds?
4. What should I look for when finding a new bank?

&amp;#x200B;

**Rough Approximation of Monthly Costs:**

Florida has no state income tax so I will be looking at say $3500 a month take home in my 1st year. Mortgage approximately $1800. Food $200. Internet, electricity, water $200. Car lease $300. So now I’m left with $1000 a month. Roommate contributes $700. Left with $1700 a month. $1700 a month x 60 months = $102,000. This does not include the additional income from selling the house at the end of residency. Is this possible?

personalfinance,Should I refinance my car loan?,"Quick details...
•Original loan amount: $38,000 (rest in cash)
•Loan length: 75 months ***
•APR 5.3% 
•Total left: just under $30,000 and 57 payments remaining 
•$595/month payment 

I’m finding it hard to justify that high a percentage, and it looks like I can save damn near $80/month according to my credit karma if approved (shows loan option ads). 
When I turned 18, I bought a car for $13k or so, and financed about half of it for 36 months at a super low interest rate (like 1% or 2%). 
36 months later, I decided to get an additional car. Jumping from $7,000 financed to $38,000 financed was apparently a leap of faith, as 5.3% is the lowest I was approved for at the dealership, regardless of my credit score and history (like 750)
I’m not big on change, and I probably won’t change lenders, but I want to know if it would be worthwhile anyways... and anything I should watch out for. 

***(no, I didn’t /need/ a loan this long. Was planning on making larger payments if I wanted and pay it off quicker.)

personalfinance,Quick US Tax Question From Foreign National,"Hi, 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been a member of this community for years, it's helped me as a foreigner here in the US get my credit into a great state and been a constant reminder to build for the future. That said, I wanted to ask this one under a throwaway.

&amp;#x200B;

**short question;** 

* how the heck can I stop owing so much money to the tax man? My wife &amp; I have 0 across all of our withholdings

&amp;#x200B;

**the context;** 

* Foreign national married with no assets in our home country
* Both work 1 job each - no overtime or bonus
* 0 on both state &amp; federal withholding
* $265k HHI pre-tax
* Own no property in the US

&amp;#x200B;

Projecting for next year based on my most recent paycheck, **we are looking at owing over $9k again**. Does this sound normal? Should we change our withholding status to single and file jointly? Should we pay quarterly?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not well versed enough in how it works here (*previously we had been un-married and filing single, so we just used free software and always got a return so never looked into it*), but it just feels weird to continually owe this amount of money?

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this all makes sense.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

personalfinance,Federal or Private Medical School Loans?,"Hello, I am going to start medical school in the US in July and I am trying to figure out the best source of funding.

I need approximately $80,000 a year for four years.  After graduation I will start residency which will be 3-4 years of making \~$50,000 and when I graduate residency I will be done with my training.

I have two options: a private Wells Fargo Loan or federal graduate loans.

**WF is 5.99% fixed with a 20 year repayment plan and I can take out the full $80,000 at this interest rate.  With the federal loan I can take $40,000 at 6.7% fixed and the rest at 7.6% fixed.**

I know people usually suggest avoiding private student loans, but I have a way better interest rate with WF. Would it make any sense to do the federal loan route?  The terms of my WF loan states that repayment begins 6 months after medical school graduation, and at that point I will be in residency making some money.  I will be 24 when I start school so I have a good earning potential in front of me.

personalfinance,Mortgage confusion,"I've seen slightly differing opinions on this. Am I supposed to base my max mortgage monthly payment on my _net_ income? Or my _gross_ income?

If we say I make about 100,000$ a year with zero debt, my take-home would be around 5,000 per month.

So if I use gross, I'd end up with mortgage payments around 2000-2100 (including fees). If I use my 'take home' I end up around 1400.

Which in the DFW is a fairly considerable difference in housing availability.  I'm currently paying 1000 a month, which is easily comfortable (and in fact I over-pay, I'm paid up till December (Yes, I'm learning that's not a great plan, so please don't crucify me)).

I'm planning on a 30 year, with 100,000-120,000 down from selling the current condo. I'm not sure what total value I can reasonably afford, I'm working on the pre-qual right now but I presume I'll get a low interest rate (high single income, no kids, no debt, etc.)

**Our situation:**

About us:

We're looking for our forever home. No more looking, saving, improving, committing to a house we don't see ourselves in long term. We have no kids, but plan on having 1. We have a cat. We both travel for work (me 60-70%, her 10-15%), so often need additional support with lawn care, etc. We don't live near my parents. Her mother is close by, so is her sister, but sis has 3.5 boys if you count the husband. We're looking to move into this forever home around January or February of next year. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Income: $244K, plus bonuses and stock discount purchase plans**

Gross Income: 244K/yr, which is around 14 - 15k / month after taxes

Jobs are stable, my job has good growth opportunity (trending towards promotion in the next 2-3 years)

This figure does not include bonuses, around 15k/year. I generally get increases of about 4-5k per year. Stock options allow purchase at 15% discount twice a year, about 1200 net gain each time. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Monthly Expenses: $2,408 (not including mortgage)**

Car Payments (Don't judge me): 1150 total, 650 goes away april 2021, 500 two years after. the 650/month loan will be worth 25k+ at the time it's paid off, the 500/month car about 20k. No plans to replace them once they're paid off for 5+ years. 

Insurance: 165

Gas / Sewer: 60

Groceries: 320

Household supplies &amp; Cat Food: 100

No Student loans

No Phone Bill

Electric Bill: 170 (this may go up a bit with the home upgrade, not much)

Internet: 50

Hulu/Youtube/Spotify: 63

Computer Payment: 80

Security System: 50

Pest Defense: 35

Lawn Care: 150

Audible: 15

&amp;#x200B;

**Additional Costs Planned at the time of closing** on the home (we do not currently have these expenses):

\*Contribute to Savings: 500

\*Daycare: 2000 - i know it's expensive, i'm hoping this is conservative

\*Housekeeper: 250

&amp;#x200B;

**Assets:**

By the time we close, we expect to have around 170-175K in cash and equity. 

45k in company stock (unless i sell it first)

75K in equity (same house down the street sold last year for 344, we currently owe 268. 

50K in Cash

It seems it would be beneficial to use some of this loan money in order to offload my credit cards. I know that paying off debt is never mentioned in student loan agreements- they are designed for school related experiences. On the flip side, from various non-professional sources I have heard that it’s nearly impossible for the student loan companies to track this or enforce this rule.

gaming,Idea for a Red Dead 3 installment,"So Red Dead 2 added to and fleshed our the backstory that was relatively untold in Red Dead 1. With that being said it seems the next game in the series would have to take a very different approach. So, here’s my idea for the plot of a third installment: 

The 3rd game would follow John Marstons son once more. Jack has gone the way of John himself, as told in the epilogue of of the first game. He is now a criminal. 

The catch is he’s a criminal in a much more industrialized world as we find ourselves in 1930 during the final years of prohibition. 

Jack is working a small time gang of moonshine runners for the early organized crime families. The story follows his rise through the criminal underworld right up until either the feds come to make him a deal like his father, or until he is marked for death after losing a shipment. 

Either way, you go on making runs, fighting enemies, burning down other rival groups moonshine rigs, robbing people, etc. industrialization means larger cities, but there is still long stretches of wilderness between them which allows for hunting, fishing, and exploration. Cars are now more common place but horses exist heartily still, allowing the player to keep a stable and a garage. 

The end of the game sees jack either Best his enemies and walk away from the life altogether, or it sees him killed much like his father, only to have alcohol legalized again a few months after his death. 

I feel that jack would be alone with no family, just lots of whores since he’s bitter about his upbringing and having seen his father killed. In his anger, he winds up the same type of violent man John was but without the moral regret. He can either walk away after winning in the end to do what John never could before his death, or he could die much as John did, ending their bloodline and closing the loop of the Marston story. 


I think this would be a fitting way to tie up a lot of the story including the death of the Wild West, marstons story, and the industrialization and politicalization of America. It would also allow us to keep the game features we love but add more such as automatic weapons, cars, and perhaps even planes. Likewise, we get a whole new environment for the series in sprawling decrepit industrial cities along with the backwoods country where hillbillies hide to make their brew. It can also make use of current events of that time such as racism (which jack would not approve of) and the continued abuse of native Americans. We also can have more thorough heists with tech from WWI and fun chase missions with police.

* Too many hard pulls on my credit history within a few months
* Losing the protections the government offers on their loans for unemployment, reduced income, short-term deferment, etc. Especially considering my somewhat unknown employment/income status in the near future.
* My credit score is 767. Can I raise that to above 800 in a few months to earn a better rate from the refi company?
* Anything else I should think about?


PF, when is a good time to refi my student loans?",finance

btc,The increasing interest for lending might be a ploy to attract lenders onto Bitfinex since they are short 26% of users assets.,"[I have noticed that for the past few days someone is reserving lots of funds](https://www.bitfinex.com/stats) (scroll to the bottom section ""Rates on Margin Funding"" and compare ""TOTAL SUM OF ACTIVE FUNDING"" vs	""TOTAL AMOUNT USED IN MARGIN POSITIONS"") that are being lent out on Bitfinex but that they are not using much of the reserved funds in any position. (eg. over 100k BAB reserved but only 50k used in actual positions, $4 million tether reserved but $2 million used in positions), 

Could it be bitfinex trying to stop lenders from pulling out crypto by locking the type of funds that they are short of for the next 30 days, but paying them interest to compensate them, or even pushing up interest rates in general to attract new deposits (recently the rates were terrible and it didnt make sense for lenders to stay on their exchange)?

[Like they have only 74% of their assets, but that still means they have to stop 74% of their users from withdrawing or they will be left with 0%](https://www.coindesk.com/tether-lawyer-confirms-stablecoin-74-percent-backed-by-cash-and-equivalents) and a big IOU of ""shares"" that they lent to themselves as collateral for the missing 26%.",cryptocurrency
investing,Trump calls on Fed to cut rates by 1% and urges more quantitative easing,"&gt;The Fed currently targets its benchmark interest rate in a range between 2.25 percent and 2.5 percent. It has hiked the rate nine times since December 2015, though it indicated in March that it likely is done with increases for the rest of 2019 despite forecasting two more at the end of last year.

&gt;China is adding great stimulus to its economy while at the same time keeping interest rates low. Our Federal Reserve has incessantly lifted interest rates, even though inflation is very low, and instituted a very big dose of quantitative tightening. We have the potential to go...

personalfinance,Bug it out or Upgrade?,"I have a 2002 TDI Beetle- Manual. It has over 250,000mi; It was my parents car in OR and they gifted it to me since I moved to the Midwest (3yrs ago). The timing belt needs to be replaced. Probably could use some other adjustments and the check engine light flickers on and off from time to time. It's my commuting car for 100mi/ day. I honestly have no idea when it comes to car maintenance other than I take it to the dealership/ mechanic for oil changes and replacing lights and a motor for the windshield wiper (2x).

I'm very hesitant to put any money into the bug. It's valued at $1.5k and with the miles I put on it everyday the value in it is just the fuel economy alone. Should I bite the bullet and just put in the money to keep the car going?

However, I've had my eyes on some larger vehicles for my safety and to comfortably take my labradoodle places.  I'm looking into a Subaru Crosstrek or Outbacks or anything along the 4-wheel drive to *combat the Midwest weather*. Seeing as the bug did me absolutely no favors this last winter. If anyone has any experience in car shopping for something that will help, lend me some advice? I'd rather put the money from repairing the bug into a down payment for a new car. I'm not really interested in a pre-owned vehicle seeing as Subaru or anything I'm interested ""holds it's value"" and it's not much of a discount in my eye.

Edit: I currently have some student loan debit; making a monthly payment of $350+ (when I have some left over funds for the month) for a fixed federal 24k Loan. It's graduated and my credit score is upper 700's. I'm pulling around 43k annually. I'm looking into some low interest bank auto loans, I don't trust dealership unless someone can convince me. \^\_\^

Thank you in advance for my ignorance! ha -Momo",finance
personalfinance,Guidance With College Debt Repayment,"Hey /r/personalfinance,

Throwaway account because why not. I'll be graduating college (undergrad) in a few weeks, and had a question about loan repayment. My current loan situation is that I have 4 federal, unsubsidized loans with relatively low interest and a private loan with a higher interest. Here are the details:

1. $7,500 @ 5%
2. $7,500 @ 4.4%
3. $6,700 @ 3.75%
4. $5,500 @ 4.25%
5. $10,000 @ 11.6%

Loans 1-4 are the federal loans, and 5 is the private loan. I've accrued about $2k in interest between loans 1-4, and none for 5 as I've been making interest payments. The only other important detail is that repayment doesn't start for loans 1-4 until December (6 months after graduation), where loan 5 is in repayment starting next month.

I can comfortably afford to put about $2,200-$2,500 towards my loans each month. I'll be living at home for the rest of this year while working full time to help get that taken care of.

My question is: does it make more sense to ignore loans 1-4 until December and put all my money into loan 5, or pay all of them as if I had to make minimum payments to 1-4 following the snowball method, or something completely different. Any advice is appreciated, thanks in advance!",finance

personalfinance,Should I invest in my Roth IRA or an index fund?,"A little about my financial situation:

&amp;#x200B;

I am a 22 year old last semester university student with $13k in savings, \~$5k in debt, $2.5k in checkings, $2k in a Roth IRA and $500 in Robinhood stocks. I own a car and will be receiving a $7.5k sign on bonus in August.

&amp;#x200B;

My debt is interest free until 6 months after I graduate and then has a 4.29% interest rate. Additionally, payments will be partially subsidized by the company I'm going to work for. With this in mind, should I contribute to my Roth IRA or an index fund (VTSAX)? My current IRA asset mix is 90% stocks and 10% bonds. My rationale for investing in VTSAX has to do with liquidity and time value of money.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice is appreciated!

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: For clarification, I'm investing in VFIFX for my retirement account and am looking to open a non-retirement brokerage account with VTSAX. The purpose of doing so would be to not have money tied up until I am retirement age.",finance
personalfinance,"How to juggle aggressively paying off my remaining debt, vehicle repairs and saving.","25 F. Got a 12,500 loan in 2016 for my vehicle. There is a remaining $6,294.55 on it at 4.9% interest.

I have a FICO credit score of 771 and just paid off my discover credit card.

Approximately $136 in my checking (after paying off my card in full) and $775 in accessible savings.

10k in an annuity and a few hundred in a 401k (just started a new job a few months ago)

My big plan is to be financially independent, retiring early would be nice but not crucial. I would like to pay off my loan by the end of the year. Should I look for a better interest rate? Use my credit card to transfer the debt (2% interest on my card)? Here is a brief summary of my [expenses](https://imgur.com/a/iX90ImT)

I have been paying $300 on my loan because money has been tight up until the new job. I fully intend on dedicating as much money to that as possible, but want advice from those smarter than I on how to allocate things effectively. Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,Is this mortgage situation safe enough?,"We are looking to buy a property for $175,000 with 5% down and 3% seller concessions. 4bds 1.5 bath 1800+ sq ft. PITI comes out to ~$1,240 with (~$260/month in property taxes and ~$75/month in homeowners insurance. PMI is $83 and the rate is 4.25%). For comparison, our 3bd 1 bath 1100 sq ft. apartment is a steal at $1,700/month. 

We have about $20,000 saved up and after we close will be left with ~$7,000. I know in most situations r/pf would say how this is not enough money left over for an emergency fund or if some big repair is needed. But... The roof is ~10 years old and is expected to last about 20 more years in this region of the country. The water heater and furnace were replaced in 2018. The fridge, range, and microwave are all new, never used. 

I feel like this gives us a good safety net in that we shouldn't need any large repairs for many, many years. The roof is small as the house is built up more than out and shouldn't be more than ~$12,000 to replace, but again, that's probably a good 15+ years away. 

Monthly debt is $0. Monthly income is ~$2,750 net, for now. I am a federal employee and I essentially have a guaranteed pay raise every 52 weeks. This September, I will move to GS-09, the following September to GS-11, and the following to GS-12. So while today my mortgage would be about 46% of my take home, in September 2019 it will be closer to 36%, in September 2020 it will be closer to 30%, and then in September 2021 it will be about 25%. I put the full 5% match into my TSP and also the mandatory 4.4% into the pension. 

Other fixed monthly costs:

Phone: $75 for 2 lines of unlimited data
Internet: $29.99 100mbs Comcast (no other real options)
Groceries: ~$350
Eating out: ~$50
Car insurance: ~$150 (2018 Nissan Altima 2.5 SL)
Gas: ~$80
Utilities: ~$125 (Can only guess as to what they will be, but there is no AC at the property so I don't think the bill will get too high)

I'm projecting our monthly expenses to be about somewhere between $2,100 and $2,500 to be conservative. This would allow for saving $250-$650 a month now, and starting in September 2019 it would be $1000+. 

Is this too much of a gamble? I'm banking on nothing expensive breaking in the next 5 years, and probably not in the next 10. By then I will easily be able to have saved a lot of money for potential issues in the future.",finance
personalfinance,Vanguard Prime Money Market vs Citi Accelerate Savings Account for Emergency Fund,"I am building an emergency fund to cover at least a year's worth of expense: about 30-40K, so the interest rate matters.

Citi is offering a 2.36% APY on their online savings account, and the Vanguard Prime Money Market Fund an 7-Day SEC Yield of 2.44%, a Compound Interest yield of 2.47% and an expense ratio of 0.16%.

How do I determine which account is most suitable for my emergency fund based off of the interest yield? Does the SEC and Compound interest yield of the include the expenses, or would I have to subtract it myself to get the \`true\` yield? This distinction would make the difference between Vanguard's fund and Citi's savings account.
