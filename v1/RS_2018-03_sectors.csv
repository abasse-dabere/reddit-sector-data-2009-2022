personalfinance,What to do with 100K,"Hey guys - I have roughly 100K in cash saved up (not counting rainy-day fund, 401k, roth, etc., but does include what would essentially be all of my ""extra"" savings). 

I am in my late 20's, have no family/kids, rent in a relatively HCOL area (but my rainy-day fund accounts for this), and have a relatively high paying job (that may continue for the next 3-5 years but thereafter may change to a slightly lower paying job (think just under 100k/year)). I've maxed out my 401k, contribute to a Roth, and maxed out (and am investing) my HSA. I have very small student loans with very low interest rates that I don't plan on paying off anytime soon (essentially because it's free liquidity). (Think that covers all of these steps: https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics).

So, I'm open to all ideas for this money. Got stock tips - let's hear it. Epic vacation splurge - why not?! Put it all in an ETF - probs makes the most sense. Fire away!",finance
personalfinance,Loan using Outstanding Loan Balance vs Average Daily Balance,"I took out a loan that calculates interest by Outstanding Loan Balance instead of the usual Average Daily Balance.  It seems as though I 
can make a payment the day before a statement, and it counts the same as if it was 29 days before.  Could someone confirm if I am reading this section right?

&gt;The method used to calculate interest is monthly compounded interest. Interest will be assessed on the last day of each loan invoice
period until you have repaid your loan in full. This is your Monthly Interest Charge. The Monthly Interest Charge is calculated in the
following way:

&gt; • First we take your Interest Rate, divide that by 12, and then round to the nearest one ten-thousandth of a percentage point. This is your MPR.

&gt; • Then, we multiply your MPR by the unpaid loan balance that remained on the last day of your prior loan invoice period, and
round to the nearest penny. This unpaid loan balance is the Outstanding Loan Balance from your prior loan invoice.



&gt;The Outstanding Loan Balance that appears on a loan invoice is calculated as follows:

&gt; • We start with the Outstanding Loan Balance that appeared on your prior loan invoice;

&gt; • Then we add Loan Disbursements (if any) made during the current loan invoice period;

&gt; • Then we subtract any payments and credits applied during the current loan invoice period; and

&gt; • Finally we add the Monthly Interest Charge that is assessed at the end of the current loan invoice period.


If I want to pay extra principal, does it matter when that payment is made?  It sounds like I can get wait until the day before my monthly payment is due.",finance
personalfinance,Anyone have any idea what type of mortgage program this is?,"We are closing on an fha loan next month and my mortgage lender sent me this today but didn’t explain anything. What is [this ](https://m.imgur.com/a/UgwrT)? It seems too good to be true

Edit 2: spoke with my lender - it’s through this third party company that works to pay down ALL your debts but you won’t pay more than your current payments...? He said they work on paying down those with the highest interest rates to the lowest one. I think it’s just someone using the Dave Ramsey Avalanche method for you.

economy,Basic Income Budget and Calculations,"Although this is based on the Canadian government budget and calculated based on Canadian data, same could be done for any other country. In Canada, tax credits cost keeps increasing as politicians use it to attract voters. But like tax relief in UK and U.S. it does not really help the people who need it the most. Not to mention the high cost of administration and bureaucracy.

This calculation was done back in 2015 and includes alternative budget and estimates of revenue from flat tax via income tax. Since then proponents of BI have called for Land Value Tax and other common resources royalty as revenue source instead of income tax. 

The calculation shows how a negative income tax can easily be paid as well as a UBI based on the poverty measures per household.

It is still in draft state so the calculations and ideas still have to be reviewed and refined. But here are some summary/outline of contents:

Negative Income Tax (NIT)

* List of formula and variables used for calculating a Negative Income Tax (a mean test type of guaranteed income / basic income).
* Table showing the gradual cutoff under various negative income tax rate. No welfare trap or penalty for working more.
* $50.3 billion cost of NIT under a balanced 50% negative tax rate (using market based measures as poverty measures at 100%, i.e. zero poverty rate) - based on economist Simpson and Hum estimates.
* $217.1 billion is the cost of Universal Basic Income (UBI) treated by household than individual, hence much lower cost than Universal Basic Income paid to each individual adult.

Basic Income Amount

* A sample budget of a single person and basic amount of $1,190 
* Comparing it to Ontario's pilot amount of $1,390 per month for single person.
* Comparison of current tax rate vs flat tax rate of 50% (below Nordic/Scandinavian countries rate) and show how low income earners are still better off, and $500,000 or $1 million income earners increased payment are relatively minor.

Alternative Budget

* 2010-2011 Federal Budget was used to create an alternative budget (with explanation of why that year's budget was used). 
* There are direct savings or funds that can be readily redirected from social transfer related to poverty to a basic income. ~ $80.70 billion.
* At least $10 billion in administrative / bureaucracy savings.
* ~ $29 billion savings from drastic reduction to poverty for province/territories.
* ~ 15.5 billion savings for municipalities.
* Total savings of ~ $135.45 billion without increasing taxes.
* UBI would need strong collaboration from all levels of government to make it work efficiently.
* NIT can be readily implemented now and using the savings identified above, there will be a surplus of ~ $37.39 billion (after free post secondary and Child's BI, which are already included and deducted)
* With UBI (Simpson &amp; Hum estimate), additional $121 billion of revenue would have to be raised. This can easily be done with a switch to flat tax. Although some UBI proponent calls for revenue to be taken from shared resources, land value tax, etc instead of income tax. 
* A non-expert estimate of a very simplistic UBI cost paid to all adults and how it is paid with a flat tax of 46%, currently the highest tax bracket rate for combined Fed and Provincial marginal tax rates (No one is worse off since non-taxed basic income received by everyone more than covers for increased tax rate. 46% is already the top end paid by higher income earners).
* Under the very simplistic calculation and revenue from flat tax, a surplus of `$10 billion is possible. (this is after free post secondary education and improved UCCB s a Child's basic income. $5,000 per child for all families, above current UCCB of ~ $1,900 that is only applicable to poorest family)
* Option for use of surplus towards National Pharmacare (which is estimated to cost $19.3 billion to $22.6 billion according to the Parliamentary Budget Office.
* An alternative option is to set aside the $80 budgeted for transportation in the basic income payout to be pooled and goes toward municipalities infrastructure and free transportation plan. Yes, free transportation like one being proposed in some Germany's city right now can easily be paid through redirection of these funds.
* Free post-secondary cost is ~ $13.5 billion while an effective UCCB to act as child's BI cost $28.5 billion
* A very pessimistic estimate was also done with huge drop in worker's participation vs the likelier 15% seen in various past BI experiments. 
* List of alternative funding options, including Land Value Tax which is said to have complimenting effect of preventing landlord taking advantage of increased income of renters, to raise the rental rate.

The spreadsheet used for the calculation can be seen in the spreadsheet linked below. It is still in rough draft stage so there might still be errors and some parts (especially in the ""Scratch notes of thoughts"" worksheet) have sentence structure that probably still needs quite a bit of work. And dump of ideas that needs to be evaluated to see what is practical.

Feel free to criticize and question assumptions and calculations. Or suggest improvement or share any other ideas you might have.

CryptoCurrency,"Charlie Lee is a scammer, a cancer to crypto and you should be aware of it.","Well, this is likely going to be down voted to oblivion, but I can't let it pass.

Charlie lee is nothing short of a bitconnect scammer.

He pretends to be a ""nice guy"", he uses his persona for personal gains while trying to shift focus out of him through hating over other projects and/or using infantile memes to gather attention from young audiences..

You should first start here: https://medium.com/@bitfinexed/coinbase-insider-trading-litecoin-edition-be64ead3facc

There are some pretty disturbing ""coincidences"" there.

Charlie not only started LTC opportunistically copying BTC and gluing together some pieces of code (that he managed to make worse than the originals - such as asic resistance), but he also have being absolutely flippant in everything he says about bitcoin.

He surfed the wave of being ""silver to bitcoin's gold"" since 2011. Suddenly, after managing to get listed in coinbase, he left it right after to ""work on LTC"" (all that time LTC had really near zero development). What was his work? To implement segwit, that was the only concrete thing that happened to LTC and it is highly debatable if that is even good. That's right, from 2011 to 2017, the only thing that happened to LTC was copying segwit from bitcoin core repo.

After he surfed the wave of ""being a test bed for these awesome technologies"", all of a sudden these ""awesome technologies"" apparently were not that awesome anymore, so he dumped all of his LTC.

Lets draw a timeline here:

2011 -- LTC is born from a major copy&amp;paste event: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=47417.0 (notice that he edited the OP up to june 2014 to make it look better - hover over the date)

Up to 2017 **nothing** really happens, except mining. LTC is silver to BTC's gold, and LTC will succeed iff BTC succeeds. That's the narrative.

April, 2017, charlie lee leaves coinbase after he manages to list LTC there. LTC was DEAD and suddenly spikes violently in price right before listing is confirmed.

Until august, charlie lee only shills about LTC, segwit, LN and blockstream related things, posting infantile animes and cartoons. Goes to a TV show and says that LTC is like a token, for fun, embarrass himself. LTC community gets pissed and he replies to them saying that *it is not his responsibility to pump their holdings*.

Surprise! After 1st of august, he starts to slander BCH, call it a scam, getting pretty vocal and tweeting more shit than anyone can possibly tolerate and says that ""he is done tweeting"". Then he deletes several of his tweets. But comes back a couple of days after this bluff. A guy who doesn't stick to anything he says, never.

Suddenly his tweets are talking down BTC now, and shilling LTC alone, contradicting what he said to his followers in reddit, that he wouldn't shill LTC - remember: for over 5 years all he did was cheer-leading BTC and say ""hey I'm the same but I'm the silver version"". He continues to badmouth BCH without nothing to back it up. Even luke-jr, BTC core dev, gets pissed with him and calls his shitcoin out (https://twitter.com/LukeDashjr/status/923414550157938688), saying that he would rather use BCH (https://twitter.com/LukeDashjr/status/923435699084431360).

Charlie was often posting pictures of him with ""HODL"" shirts and etc. There is scant content to be found besides memes and other crap like that. Clear shilling.

December 2017, charlie lee dumps ALL his LTC he accumulated over 6 years of mining at the top of the hype (http://archive.is/l6Z6u). Not a part, but all, without further notice. I mean, there is nothing wrong in trading, but if you are a public figure and founder of the project, you gotta observe at least some responsibilities from a moral stand point. 

The LEADER of a project and public figure can't simply dump everything after shilling it to hundreds of thousands of suckers, this is criminal level.

He then poses as a ""nice guy"", saying it was because of ""conflict of interests"" (supposedly the interest of getting rich after the pump and the interest of keeping hold of a future-less shitcoin.)

He also says he was so good that he donated part to LTC foundation, he is such a boy-scout! It turns out that he ""donated"" money to himself, since he controls the foundation, and DIRECTLY to his pals over there (confirmed by one of them). This much is of course for money launder (not defending taxes, but just stating the obvious.)

You think that bitconnect is a scam because it promised high returns and then bitconnecters sold on their supporters their bitconnect tokens. Also because of that carlos mattos ridiculous videos.

Fair enough, but charlie lee also conned people into buying LTC. His tweets are maybe not so obviously ridiculous like carlos mattos, but they are pure shill. His tweets display him with HODL messages, moon memes and other shill stuff. He then sells without telling anyone and invents some gullible crap to divert attention, also using FUD against BCH and other crypto to divert attention. 

Who bought LTC? Charlie Lee followers in tweeter, his own community, and his reddit subscribers!! The listing of it in coinbase and other places, where he had obvious influence, was the pump he needed to eventually get rid of his coins. I know 8 months seem like a long time in crypto, but for a waiting of 6 years, it is really a very short time.

Now, the shameless lee is shilling Raiblocks/Nano. Let me be clear, I have technical criticism over Nano (for instance, laid down some [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/80z0xa/after_selling_his_ltc_charlie_lee_is_now_shilling/duzrtbt/) ), but I do not think the project launched as a scam, not really. I just think it doesn't work for the reasons pointed in the link above.

But you should be aware that now charlie is involved and using his social farms to down vote, censor and shill. He admitted *having nano*:

&gt;Charlie Lee: ""Disclaimer: I own some NANO"": &gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20180301053624/https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/968931625001140224

Now, let's be reasonable: isn't it **very strange** that this guy sold all coins of his own project, then when he thinks people already forgot he goes to a totally unrelated and (in principle) *rival* project to talk about it? And that, only after he got zillions of votes, reddit gold and visualizations, he says ""hey, I have some nano, just saying"". 

WTF?! Does this seems like a healthy market to any of you? Do we really need this low level of manipulation to make money trading? I don't think so, we should call out the shit and we depend on good projects succeeding to go to the next level of adoption.

So I'm doing my part: be aware of the scam and trade carefully.

gaming,"What was your ""golden age"" of gaming?","Hey everyone,

since gaming is still a rather new thing of course there is no such thing as a golden ""age"" but I think we all have periods we like to remember as the most awesome ones to be a gamer. 

It might be  because one particular game has been released and surfed on the hype wave or because we attended a certain event or whatever. I'd like to know what was your favourite point in your personal gaming history.

Mine was what I call the gaming winter of 2011/2012. I play games since the early 90s but back then I felt totally amazed by all the awesome games I was looking forward to. It started with Skyrim in Nov 2011, followed by The Old Republic a few days prior to Christmas. I know TOR wasn't as great as they initially promised it to be, but it was Star Wars, felt a lot like Knights of the Old Republic and I was able to play it with my friends. It made for an awesome Christmas holiday season. By the time I was done with TOR they released Mass Effect 3 in March 2012 and Diablo 3 in May 2012.

Nowadays there is maybe one game I am really looking forward to per year, sometimes two, but back then I had 4 of my most anticipated games within a 7 month range.

personalfinance,Need help with which credit cards me and my wife should pay off to make the smartest/wisest choice.,"Ok so me and my wife have been battling credit card debts for years.. like literally 4 years straight. Its alot better now than it was in the past. We’ve worked really hard to be where we are now. It started with putting our wedding on a credit card, then buying random stuff we didn’t need and living outside of our means. A lot of the times it was my fault. I would suggest buying this and that. When we didn’t need any of it.

I was an impulse buyer. What helped me was finding out I had ADHD and was put on some meds and ever since then I’ve had NO ERGE AT ALL to want to buy anything. I’m now looking back and realizing how much of an asshole partner/husband I was to allow this to continue, because it was mostly me wanting the things and my wife just ok’ing it. 

So originally we had like $20,000 in about 6-7 credit cards. We’ve **never** had a saving **ever**. It was me working and wife at home. We were paying bills with nothing to spare. So what did we have to do? Buy all of our necessities with credit cards. 

So we’ve managed to get it down to about $12,000 and we both work now bringing in about $65,000 together a year. My income is $45k and hers $20k. These are our totals, without interest. But I’m sure you can imagine what a normal interest rate is for these cards.
**NOTE:*** We can pay our bills and have money to save and what not now. Payments listed are minimums.

***Credit Debt:***
•Navy Fed: $2,700 / 0% interest / $50
•Chase Slate: $2,600 / has interest / $70
•Chase Mileage: $5,600 / has interest / $160 ($100 of this payment goes to interest *inserts sad face*)
•JC Penny: $1,600 / has interest / $60
•Navy Fed (mine): $500 / 0% interest / $20
•STAR: $400 / 0% interest / $20
•Care Credit: $700 / 0% interest / we pay $100 I think minimum is like $30

My income monthly: $3,350
Wife’s income monthly: $1,600 

My wife usually puts 90% of her check into savings so we can save in bulk to pay off debts and have a good savings for emergencies. 

We have $5,750 to put on debts. What I’ve seemed to be the better option is paying off:
•Navy Fed: $500
•STAR: $400
•JCP: $1,600
•Chase Slate: $2,600
And that puts us at $5,100 and put the rest on the Navy Fed: $2,700 or pay off the care credit. 

Now this is why I am here asking because I do not know if it’s easier to pay off a lot of the small ones or pay off the big one and that’s it. We pay a total of $480 a month on these CCs. The way I configured above brings it down to $310 a month (this includes the $100 a month we pay on Care Credit instead of the $30 minimum). If we were to pay off the biggest debt it would bring it to $320. We are not necessarily looking to have the cheapest payment a month, but more so what is smarter/wiser to get payed off. 

Thank you, and I hope this all makes sense.",finance

You've successfully completed this challenge once you've filed your US federal income tax return by March 31st.

Recommended Steps:

###Plan
1. **Learn how US income taxes work:**
* Watch [Basics of US income tax rate schedule](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/core-finance/taxes-topic/taxes/v/basics-of-us-income-tax-rate-schedule)
* Watch [Tax deductions introduction](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/core-finance/taxes-topic/taxes/v/tax-deductions-introduction)
* Read /r/personalfinances's very own [wiki page on income tax](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/taxes)
* *Understand* what exactly your tax return is: A form you fill out, telling the government how much money you made, calculating how much taxes you owe on that money (your ""tax liability""), and ""squaring-up"" with the government: Figuring out if you already paid more than your actual tax liability throughout the year with paycheck withholdings (in which case you will get a tax *refund*), or if you haven't paid enough throughout the year, and owe a balance to the government.
2. [Determine your filing status](https://www.irs.gov/uac/what-is-my-filing-status) and determine whether you can be claimed as a dependent by anyone (for example, your parents), or can claim any dependents. ([IRS Dependent Tool](https://www.irs.gov/uac/who-can-i-claim-as-a-dependent))
3. **Prepare a ""map"" for what documentation you will need to fill out your tax return**, then go through the list and make sure you have the documentation for each. **Don't worry if you forget something.** The software you use to fill out your tax return (or the tax return form itself) will remind you of things you might have forgotten.
* Jot down every possible way you made money this year (remember, even if you don't get a form, you still need to report it):
    * paycheck from my job (W-2 form)
    * interest on my bank account (personal records like your December account statement, or a 1099 form)
    * dividends from my stock (1099-Div)
    * income from my small business or self employment (personal records, or 1099 form)
* Make a list of all the possible deductions you might think you are eligible for, and make sure you have documentation:
    * mortgage interest you paid (1098)
    * student loan interest you paid (1098-E)
    * education expenses (1098-T)
    * state or local income taxes (W-2)
    * charitable contributions (personal records)

### Prepare and file your Tax Return
**Using one of the following methods**

1. See if you are eligible for [completely free tax return preparation software](https://www.irs.gov/uac/free-file-do-your-federal-taxes-for-free) sponsored by the IRS
2. Use paid (or free) tax return preparation software. Examples: TaxAct, TurboTax, CreditKarma, AARP, FreeTaxUSA, TaxSlayer. [See our megathread for discussion.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5ohy01/tax_filing_software_megathread_a_comprehensive/)
3. ""Manually"" fill out the tax return form online using [IRS Free Fillable Forms](https://www.irs.gov/uac/free-file-do-your-federal-taxes-for-free)

By starting early, it allows you more time to deal with unanticipated questions about your tax return. ""Wait, can I claim my girlfriend as a dependent""? ""Do I have to report income from renting out the spare room in my house to a friend?"". When these come up, feel free to create [a new post](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/submit?selftext=true) asking for help with as much details as you can provide.",finance

gaming,What are things that were seen as a controversy to the community that you personally had no issues with?,"I'm curious as to what and why people think of a certain controversy.  
Let me start.

I had no issues whatsoever with the ending of Mass Effect 3.  
And this was **before** the extended cut.

It was kind of obvious that it would end up this way.  
To me, the personal bit was the journey, not the end.  
Something of that scope had to have a finale that could take in every different possible choice was too unrealistic.

It was Control, or Destroy.  
If you had enough forced, Synthesis.  
I went for control, and the end was pretty short, but I had a headcanon.  
And the extended cut aligned with what I thought, and I was cool with it.

I never expected BioWare to somehow take my hundreds of decisions, and make me a personalized ending.  
I would have liked more of the short scenes of my companion and the species' lives after the war ended, but the small bits I got made me happy enough.

I did what I set out to do.  
And the galaxy moved on without me.

I was totally happy with it.  
My only real gripe with the game was the lack of music at important scenes.  
Where there was music though, damn was it good.

So I was rather surprised when so many people raged about it.  
I was like ""What did you expect...?""

Regardless of what you did, you would lose the war against the Reapers.  
There was a 0% chance of winning in combat.  
So, a deus-ex-machina was not something that people should have been surprised by.  
I personally wasn't even that iffed with their explanation of it.

I don't understand the kid's importance in the entire story though, so it taking the kid's form, the nightmares and all, that shit was weird.  
I would rather have had the nightmares be your interest, and the hologram thing to be Anderson.

So... yeah.  
I was totally fine with ME3's ending.

stocks,Is there a Stock related calendar?,My current assumptions are that these market dips of this week are related to the news coverage on the fed chair talking to people on capital hill.

Is there a place where there is an updated calendar that I can quickly glance at and see these meetings scheduled before they happen or even before announcements of economic related numbers come out? My portfolio would definitely benefit.,finance
personalfinance,Ignorant to most financial stuff - I have two 20% credit cards through my bank. Should I consolidate to get a lower rate?,"My bank offers credit cards, which (a long time ago, during promotional and sign up) were ZERO interest.

It's been, like, 10 years since first signing up with these cards. Today, I found out, they have 18.99% and 19.09% interest rates on them.

I have card A paid down to $130, and card B is $1700. Making minimum payments each month.


I used my tax refund to pay down card A to below 30%, which made me actually take a look at them closer, and instead of blindly paying ""50 bucks here, 30 bucks there"" never actually looking at the empty pit these credit cards are. 

I don't know how this works - consolidating credit cards, or getting a Mastercard to 'buy off my balances' on these 2 high interest cards and then just pay 1 credit card bill instead of 2?


My only other credit cards are: $0 balance Furniture card. A $150 Best Buy card, which I only pay the minimum on. Best Buy usually gets paid off almost fully, then we purchase something else, so it gets used rather well, I guess. Furniture was used once for a couch, but is still active. Might get a bedroom set soon.


The only positive I see in using these bank cards, is I can easily make payments to them, by simply transferring money online/mobile.",finance
personalfinance,Student loan prepayment advancing due date?,"We've been submitting extra payments to my wife's student loans to finish them off, serviced by MOHELA. The payments are being applied to the principal balance, but they are also advancing the due date. The lender's page says this about prepayment:

&gt;Each time you satisfy a bill due, we will automatically advance your next payment due date and your billing statement will indicate a payment is not required for that bill. You may still continue to make payments to decrease your total interest cost and pay your loan off sooner. You have the option to select if you want your due date to be advanced on your loans. To request that all payments made over your monthly payment amount be applied to your current bill and not advance your due date, please see Submitting Special Payment Instructions.

I don't understand what advancing the due date versus ""applied to your current bill and not advance your due date"" is doing in this case. 

I am 100% sure that the principal balance is being reduced, and that each extra payment we are making is being applied to outstanding principal balance. Here's the last extra payment:

&gt;Total:	$1,000.00	02/26/18

&gt;Applied to Principal:	$992.43	

&gt;Interest:	$7.57	

It's overall a small balance and low interest rate, with frequent extra payments. Perhaps not advancing the due date means that interest would just accumulate and the full 100% of the extra payment goes to principal, and I would see that if it were a larger loan or at a higher rate, collecting more interest?",finance
personalfinance,2018 IRS withholding calculator telling me to use 8 allowances?,"I just plugged my numbers into the new 2018 IRS withholding calculator. The results it said was for me to claim 8 allowances, that seems very high. I currently claim 6 (rough estimate off the 2017 worksheet), and only have ~$90 withheld for federal on my biweekly paychecks. I will be claiming HOH, and child tax credit come filing time in 2019. I just got a raise to 49k, and expect to make maybe ~3-4k in overtime this year. I will receive a $1,200 bonus this year aswell.

Does that seem too high to anyone? If I keep my allowances at 6 I will have an over payment of $758, if I bump my allowances to 8 it says I should receive a refund of ~$300. I have paid $748.20 YTD in federal taxes.

personalfinance,On investing vs. paying mortgage and PMI,"People often ask if they should put extra cash into their &lt;4% mortgage or invest in something like the S&amp;P 500 where returns over the long term average 8-10%. I have always been in the camp of investing the money due to the higher return, the leveraging of deductions on mortgage interest, and the remaining liquidity of the funds. 

But I just had a realization that I've never seen anyone else bring up: Mortgage Insurance.  My mortgage rate is 3.875% but when I calculate my effective interest rate including PMI, it jumps to 7.224%! Suddenly the difference between a guaranteeed 7%+ vs. the riskier potential 8%+ is not so large that the investment seems like the obvious choice.

One thing to note, though, is that (at least on my loan), my PMI payments are fixed each month, so they don't decline as I pay off principal. This leads me to believe that what MAY be the most optimal course of action is to continue investing, then cash out when I have enough to pay down the principal enough to eliminate PMI.  The primary benefit here would be keeping the funds liquid (though let's all assume anyone considering this already has an emergency fund), and maybe the increased deduction from paying mortgage interest. Of course, mortgage interest may no longer be a factor for many Americans starting with next year's taxes.

Here's the web site I used to calculate my effective mortgage rate: http://artofbeingcheap.com/removing-pmi/

Interested in your opinions on this consideration. Why haven't I seen anyone discuss PMI as part of this conversation before?  Anything I'm missing?",finance

personalfinance,Question on Paying off a Car Loan Sooner: Payment in Advance or Direct to Principal,"Hello all,
 
Long time reader but first time posting, but I wanted to see if anyone could offer advice on how to more effectively pay off my car loan. 

Background, I have no other debts than my car loan and pretty stable financially.

The loan total amount remaining is 10,237 with a 3.09% interest rate. My monthly minimum for the loan is $250. 

The loan is handled through Chase and they allow me to pay in advance but they also allow me to pay directly to the principal after the monthly minimum is paid. I personally like to be 2 months ahead on my bills and that's where I'm sitting right now. 

But my question is, if I have extra money to get even further ahead on payments for the loan, should I do that or keep the same 2 month buffer and just put any extra money towards the principal?",finance

personalfinance,Employer just opened up the Roth 401(k) option for me. What's my best move?,"I've read the various wikis on this and have a moderate understanding of the issues at play here, but would love some guidance that's more specific to my situation. Thanks for your help in advance!

Here are the basics:

My annual salary is around $83,500 before taxes. Of this, I contribute 9 percent to my traditional 401(k) and I max out a Roth IRA, to achieve a 15 percent overall retirement savings rate. I'm currently saving for a wedding that's about a year away, but once that's taken care of I'll be looking to put more into my retirement accounts again. We're planning to have kids, but probably no more than one and not sooner than about 4 years from now. I'm in my late 20s. She's in her early 30s. We're living in a HCOL area for the long haul.

My partner makes $100,000 a year, contributing 6 percent to a traditional 401(k) — enough to get the full match — and throws everything else at her student debt. Over the next couple of decades, I think we can expect modest increases in her earning power, and smaller increases for myself. Due to my saving more and beginning earlier, I expect I'll be the primary income generator between the two of us in retirement.

I anticipate that our tax rate in retirement will probably be the same or lower than it is today based on our lifestyle.

My financial plans for the post-wedding future initially involved maxing out my 401(k) and applying any excess to an after-tax mega backdoor Roth strategy. Things got more complicated this week (in a good way!) when my employer announced a Roth 401(k) option. I now ought to consider how much of the IRS's annual $18,500 limit to allocate to the traditional 401(k), and how much (if any) to allocate to the Roth 401(k).

What's the best breakdown between traditional and Roth contributions, given my situation? My gut says to fill out the rest of the 401(k) with traditional contributions* ~~and then continue to pursue a mega backdoor Roth with what's left~~.** 

*One of the main benefits of this strategy is not only reducing my taxable income for federal tax purposes, but crucially for state taxes, too. Given that the state and local tax deduction is limited to $10,000 even for married couples filing jointly beginning in tax year 2018, it probably behooves us to minimize that exposure as much as possible once we're married. Right?

**I've now been informed by my 401(k) administrator that my plan doesn't allow for in-service distributions, ruling out the mega backdoor strategy. Would love to hear folks' thoughts on alternatives.

EDIT: A follow-up question regarding the mega backdoor Roth. What's the optimal approach to doing the rollover? Should I be trying to do a rollover, say, every month?",finance
personalfinance,Is there a good way to borrow cash to cover selling a house for a loss?,"I own a house in a small rural town (Idaho) that I haven’t lived in for about 5 years that I would love to get rid of but might have to sell it for a loss to do so.  I’ve had a couple renters in it but have not been able to get back as much in rent as I’m paying on my mortgage every month (charging $550/mo and mortgage is about $620/mo).  I’m in the process now of kicking out a renter because they have not been able to pay and they are way behind.  I never wanted to be a landlord and am not enjoying it, especially since I now live about 3hrs away from the house.  I’m currently living in a rental that I’m staying in for very cheap in exchange for working on the place while I live here.

The town the house is in lost a couple companies that were the main employers (my job left and that’s why I moved) so the town is kinda dieing and there are a ton of houses for sale and the market there isn’t too great.  I currently owe about $75K and it could maybe sell for right around that but it also needs a new roof which my realtor has suggested covering with a roofing credit in the sale.  I’m afraid that it might have to sell for less and this is the first house I’ve sold so I’m not sure what kind of commissions and such I might wind up having to pay.

If when it’s all done I receive several thousand dollars less than I still owe, is there a good way to come up with that money?  I have good credit, about $1,000 in an emergency fund and about $8,000 in medical debt from the birth of a child on credit cards that I’m making good progress at paying off (the bulk of that is in an interest-free period for another year and I’m shooting to have it paid before that expires).

I’ve looked into a short-sale a little bit but I’m thinking that won’t work.  By my understanding, I would have to prove that I can’t afford to pay the current mortgage.  I “can” afford to keep paying it but it’s dragging me down and I really don’t want to keep paying it.

Would my bank let me just keep paying them until the difference is paid even though it wouldn’t really be a mortgage anymore without a house title being tied to the debt?  Is there any type of loan I can get without a house as the collateral that won't involve crazy interest rates or dealing with the mafia?",finance

investing,Higher interest rates + lumber shortage...thoughts?,"It seems as though interest rates are going to rise, and perhaps with a sharper ascent than was previously anticipated. With that will almost certainly come increased difficulty in buying houses.

On top of that, it seems there is [a significant lumber shortage](https://therealdeal.com/la/2018/03/01/wildfires-and-a-trade-dispute-with-canada-creating-u-s-lumber-shortage/) that is creating a bona fide crisis and adding substantial costs to new homes.

Higher interest rates plus a lumber shortage would seem to indicate a double whammy for new home buyers. Add to that that wage growth has been uneven and is still some what lagging at the low- and mid-levels, [according to the Economic Policy Institute](http://www.epi.org/publication/the-state-of-american-wages-2017-wages-have-finally-recovered-from-the-blow-of-the-great-recession-but-are-still-growing-too-slowly-and-unequally/), and one can envision some real problems coming in the housing market.

personalfinance,1099-R Question: Non-Taxable vs. Tax Exempt Pension Income,"Hi all - I have something that I'm very confused by, so I will try to explain in a non-confusing way.

I was a Massachusetts state employee with a pension until I left my job last September. I decided to take a cash refund of my pension to fund my graduate study in lieu of taking out more student loans.

I received a 1099-R form and am currently filing my taxes. 20% federal taxes already withheld and TurboTax calculated an extra 10% penalty for cashing out early. All fine so far.

Now I'm doing my Massachusetts State taxes, and it asks ""Do you have any tax-exempt income from pensions or annuities?""

So under the ""state tax withheld"" box on my 1099-R, it states ""non-taxable"" and on the Mass. Board of Retirement website, it states:
&gt;""Certain government pensions, however, are exempt under Massachusetts law, including pension income received from a contributory annuity, pension, endowment or retirement fund of the U.S. Government or the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and its political subdivisions""

So does this mean I should select the ""tax-exempt"" option when filing? 

I'm worried because it makes it go from me owing the state several hundred dollars to getting a small refund. So I really don't want to do it wrong and pay for it later. 

Any insight my dear tax-savvy friends?

Edit: I found this further tidbit from the state tax instructions: 
&gt;How do I report lump-sum distributions?
&gt;If you were an employee of the U.S., Massachusetts or one of its political subdivisions and left public employment prior to retirement, you are not required to report as income the lump-sum distribution of your previously-taxed pension contributions.

&gt;Lump-sum distributions of qualified employee benefit plans in excess of the employee’s contributions which were previously subject to Massachusetts tax (or not previously excluded from Massachusetts tax) must be reported in line 4. Generally, qualified rollovers are not taxable in Massachusetts to the extent they are not taxable on your U.S. return.

investing,[Debate] Inflation vs. Deflation,"Let’s spark a conversation on inflation and deflation. Where do you see risks in today’s investing and economic environment? Should we be worried about inflation running away, or is deflation a bigger concern here? 

Tax reform, infrastructure, wage pressures, consumer price increases, globalization, technology, capitalism at play (i.e., Amazon)...

I think this will be a salient topic in 2018 and beyond as we battle volatility in equities and interest rates throughout the year.

personalfinance,"Loans, open lines of high interest credit. I need help sorting this stuff out.","This sub has helped me immensely in getting my finances turned around. I feel like I'm in the next stage of what I need to do and need some further guidance.

I currently bring home about $2500 a month. My all in monthly bills with minimums is about $1600 because I moved out of my expensive townhouse and into my buddy's basement. We have a good relationship and I'm safe there for a while. Only thing that sucks is I have to dig out my car from the snow since there's no covered parking for me and I don't have my own kitchen. 

I paid off all but one of my high interest credit cards using my federal tax return. When the state tax return comes in I should be able to pay the rest of the credit card stuff off. I still have a personal loan with about 7k at 13%, a car loan of about 11k and 9% (it's worth about 9k per KBB), and a 401k loan of about 1.5k. I just found out that my credit score is now labled as ""good"" in comparison to when I borrowed most of this money it was ""ok"". My thoughts are to finish paying off this last credit card and work on paying off the personal loan, while continuing to pay the minimums on the car loan and 401k loan. I also want to try to negotiate the interest rate on the car loan by going to a credit union to see what they will offer.

I also know from reading the wikis here I should have some type of emergency fund. I should also start putting together first, last, security depots for my next place. 

I've got a few questions.

1. What should be my priority? One of the loans, emergency fund, getting setup for my next place, something else?
2. Does it make sense to try to negotiate my credit card APR since most are over 24%? Should I cancel any cards if they won't negotiate and have a yearly fee?
3. Any other sage like advice I should know considering my current situation

TL;DR
$2500 in, $1600 out means opportunity to pay down more debt
loan debt = ~20K with comparable interest rates.

personalfinance,Disappointed and Confused about my Taxes,"I have a friend in Texas who got a tax return of over $7,000 this year. He has a full-time job making maybe 50k per year. He does not own a house. He was a student working on his master's this year. He had a second child this year. Texas does not have state income taxes. 

I moved from Texas to Oregon in the middle of 2017. My wife left her job in Texas and I started a new job in Oregon. Combined we made $66k last year. We also bought a house. We also had our second child. Oregon does have state income tax. 

I haven't completed the file yet. But Turbo-Tax is showing me getting around $3,000 in a federal return and then OWING Oregon $1,500.

I'm not any better than my friend, obviously, but after he bragged about his return and our lives are relatively similar, I thought I would be getting more back. I'm mostly just confused as to why he got so much more back federally. I also have NO idea why I owe the state of Oregon money. 

Can someone please explain this to me? How can I avoid owing money in the future?",finance
Bitcoin,"If you were a juror in the LocalBitcoin trader Morpheus trial, these are the question the Judge would be asking you. (Something similar might go for SaltNPepper and NODEfather.)","**The Judge would be the instructions you would receive:**

&gt; This a criminal case brought by the United States government. The government charges  the  defendant  with  conducting  five  financial  transactions  involving  property represented to be the proceeds of specified unlawful activity, which is a form of Money Laundering.  The charges against the defendant are contained in the indictment. The indictment simply describes the charges the government brings against the defendant. **The indictment is not evidence and does not prove anything.**                       
&gt; The defendant has pleaded not guilty to the charges and is presumed innocent unless and until the government proves the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. In addition, the defendant has the right to remain silent and never has to prove innocence or to present any evidence.              
&gt; In order to help you follow the evidence, I will now give you a brief summary of the elements of the crime which the government must prove to make its case:

&gt; Second, the property involved in the transaction was represented by an undercover law enforcement officer to be the proceeds of specified unlawful activity; and  Third, either the defendant conducted the transaction with the intent to avoid a transaction  reporting  requirement  under  federal  law, or  the  defendant  conducted  the transaction with the intent to conceal or disguise the nature, location, source, ownership or control of the property.

A similar thing happened last year (note: this was before we were married so I tried to stay out of it.  She also sold last year's stocks at a loss, so there was no taxable gain and we thought that would be the end of it.)

It's not a huge difference, but what are your suggestions for dealing with this moving forward?  What are the legalities of cashing out stocks as the ""guardian"" and not in any way the beneficiary?

personalfinance,WSJ: Wells Fargo’s Wealth Management Unit Attracts Justice Department Attention,"Edit: Instead of a ""copy and paste dump"", 

All credit to Wall Street Journal for this article. 
Provided here is a summary. For the full article (behind a paywall), please use the link posted by mod team below. 

In late 2017, the Justice Department asked Wells Fargo (WFC) to look into its wealth-management business due to allegations from whistleblowers from within the bank about its sales problem.

The firm hired to conduct this independent investigation, Shearman &amp; Sterling, is the same firm that represented the Wells Fargo board on the sales-scandal disclosed in September 2016. In April 2017, they released a 113-page report that ""was a long-anticipated deep dive into the questionable sales conduct affecting as many as 3.5 million accounts that dated to 2002 and ultimately resulted in a $185 million regulatory penalty in September 2016."" 

At this time, nothing is confirmed about what Sherman &amp; Sterling has discovered about WFC's wealth management division. According to the bank, the investigation is in ""preliminary stages"" and is about ""whether there have been inappropriate referrals or recommendations, including with respect to rollovers for 401(k) plan participants, certain alternative investments, or referrals of brokerage customers to the company's investment and fiduciary services business.""

WFC has continued to face a series of problems including:

- ""The Federal Reserve announced an unprecedented enforcement action capping the bank's assets. The Fed also said the bank would be replacing four members of its boards in 2018""

- ""Last year, Wells Fargo said it also improperly charged around 800,000 auto-loan customers and up to 110,000 mortgage customers. The bank has said it is in the process of refunding those customers more than $100 million""

- ""Wells Fargo also disclosed in the Thursday filing that it is reviewing fee calculations within certain fiduciary and custody accounts. The bank has found instances of incorrect fees applied to certain assets and accounts that resulted in overcharging customers, according to the filing""

- ""The Wall Street Journal reported in late 2017 that the bank had fired four FX bankers, and federal prosecutors opened an investigation of the FX operation""

On a related note, Fed chairperson Jerome Powell conceded after an intense exchange with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) that WFC's plans would be put in front of the Fed board for a vote instead of being determined solely by a low-ranking Fed official. 

As a response, WFC CEO Mr. Sloan said that while the problems ""may seem discouraging"", he asked employees to ""remember that we are making significant progress in our work to build a better Wells Fargo, and we recognize that more challenges and more hard work lie ahead.""",finance

personalfinance,Best way to settle up my CC debt?,"Hi there!

I've got a total of $8,607 in CC debt (not happy about it, I know, but such is life).  I recently got a nice raise + a decent bonus, and after paying off some other expenses, I'm currently sitting on $5,527 in my checking account.  

After all my expenses, my monthly net gain is $2,520.

My plan was to take $4000 and just knock into the debt (leaving myself with ~$1,500 for this months remaining bills/personal expenses).  

I have two cards -- Card A with a $5,282 balance and 24.24% APR, and Carb B with $3,325 and 26.15% APR.  I was going to pay $2,000 to each card, and then my plan was to pay $400/month to EACH card ($800/month total).  That would leave me with ~$1,720 per month, which is enough for bills and some fun money.  

Also, I might be seriously over estimating my monthly cost of living... I am tracking EVERY purchase in March so I get an idea of what my monthly personal expenses are.  I live in NYC so cost of living is slightly higher... but I'm not sure at the moment (trying to get better at this budgeting thing lol).

Does this sound like a reasonable plan, or is there a more efficient way to go about paying off the debt?  Such as completely paying Card B since it has a higher monthly interest rate, and then just putting $800/month towards Card A?  Or should I try to even out the debt so I eliminate the debt at once?  Or apply for a first-year 0% APR balance transfer card (very confident I can eliminate the debt in a year, also my credit score is 720 I think)?

I'm not too great with numbers/finance, and my plan is just the most logical way that I know how to pay off the debt.  I am definitely committed to getting rid of it this year, so willing to any and all suggestions!  Thank you very much!",finance
personalfinance,At a crossroads with medical student loan debt,"2 years into being an attending has resulted in an astronomical loan repayment increase.  I started with no loans from undergrad and took out about $360k in loans to pay for medical school.  I deferred repayment in residency allowing the interest to accumulate graduating with ~420k in loans to pay.

I consolidated my federal loans @7.5% interest and entered the REPAYE program after graduation, using my W2 from 4th year to calculate my year 1 payment of $324/month.  After a full year of work, my take home jumped from 50k to ~285k.  

I am in PSLF program but am very wary of its long term viability.  Recalculating my REPAYE with this past year's W2 is resulting in a jump from $324 to $3124.

I live in North Jersey and rent, with no credit card debt.  Just did get married.

My question to you redditors is should I refinance to a private company at a much lower rate or hope to the Buddy Christ PSLF stays afloat?

personalfinance,Always wanted a socially-responsible credit card; also any good for travel to SE Asia?,"Really this is two questions, because I doubt I can kill these two birds with one stone, but you're welcome to try!

For many years I've been considering switching to a [socially responsible credit card](https://greenamerica.org/green-living/responsible-credit-cards), but kept the same cards I have out of inertia (easier not to change anything).  I have a Citi ThankYou Preferred rewards MasterCard, and a Discover card.  I used to have a Chase Visa card, but it was cancelled after I didn't use it for several months.  The Citi card is the account I have had open the longest, since 1999 or 2000, I think.

My brother (who never reads his bank statements) has gotten into financial trouble a few times, and his Discover Card has taken advantage of him in several unscrupulous ways, leading to the fact that I am fed up and unwilling to do any more business with them or their parent company, Goldman Sachs.  So, I have not used my Discover Card for almost a year and do not plan to use it again.  I plan to cancel it, and plan to get this taken care of ASAP, before leaving for Thailand.  (The only reason I kept the account open was I was thinking of suing them to recover money they took out of my checking account without authorization, but I don't actually care because all the money went to my brother's account, so if I did manage to get it back from them, most likely they would just take it from him.)

So, I've been considering switching to one of [the cards Green America recommends](https://greenamerica.org/better-banking/take-charge-your-card/responsible-credit-cards), for being affiliated with socially-responsible banks instead of mega-banks that are out to screw anyone to make a fast buck.  But it looks like they are all Visa cards.  Isn't Visa a mega-corporation too?  Maybe they're just a payment processor and not actually all that bad, I don't know.  It seemed like there were once choices that were completely run through smaller companies, but I think one closed down in 2012 after the new financial regulations made it impossible for them to survive.  Also, more recently I found the [Halo Card](http://www.halocardproject.com/personal-card.html).   I'm not sure why it's not listed on Green America's site, but when I actually tried to apply for one a few months ago, for some reason they were not taking applications at the time.

I charge about $1000 a month on my credit card, and pay it off in full every month, except very rarely I have trouble paying it.  That's one reason I would prefer to have two cards, if I have trouble paying one, I can use the other one until I get the first one paid off.

So I've been procrastinating, for years not doing anything about still supporting those greedy, irresponsible mega-banks!  But now, for personal reasons, I have a trip to Thailand planned (and the money saved to pay for it) and I would like to get this all taken care of before I go.

Some questions:

1. I suppose all of the socially-responsible cards are good.  Do any look particularly good or bad to you?

2. If I really want to dissociate myself from all mega-banks, I have to get rid of my Citi card.  How much would that hurt my credit, since that is my longest-open account?  Should I wait for a year or two after getting rid of the Discover card?  It is possible I already hurt my credit by adding my girlfriend as an authorized user of the Citi card?  I did that about two months ago.  My credit rating was always around 800, hers is probably in the 300s.  And I haven't checked my credit score for a few months.

3. What is the best option for paying for things in Thailand, since I'm traveling from the US?  I think my Citi card is pretty reasonable on foreign transaction fees, but I think there's a fee per transaction, and if there are a lot of little things, that will add up.  Is there a better card I should look at?  Or just pay for everything in cash?  I would prefer to not have large amounts of cash on me.   It's my first trip to another country.  I guess I have heard of travelers checks.  Is that a good option?",finance
personalfinance,Leaving Military Service: Pay off vehicle or student loans first?,"I might be leaving the military within the next few months.  By my calculations, I should have around 15-20 thousand saved before I transition into attending college full time.  If attending college due to my scholarship I will have a guaranteed tax-free income of $500 with the possibility of that to increase to around $1,000. All college tuition, books, housing, and food will be paid for.

Right now I owe around $17,000 for my truck at 3.74% with a monthly payment of $365
I have a mix of private and federal student loans totaling around $25,000 at 1.7-6%.  These loans will go into deferment once I start school again.

Would it be better to pay off my truck in full and use some of the extra money during college to work on the loans? Or pay my student loans off now since they have a higher interest rate?",finance

I’m not sure what this means, but it looks like I’m about to get screwed. 

Some background: I haven’t taken classes at my university in 2 years due to being unable to take out more loans. I’m a senior and have under 10 credits needed to graduate. But I’m working just above minimum wage at the moment. I’m paying a credit card collections account, and I’m paying the university directly for my outstanding tuition that wasn’t covered by loans.

CryptoCurrency,Genuinely interested in what made people get into crypto and what they think the overall outcome will be,"This is not a fud, shill or whatever, just wanted to express my opinion and hear others

I’ll start off by saying I got into crypto early last year purely because I saw the price of bitcoin surging and wanted a piece of the profits. I brought the next best one as I thought btc price was too high and this one would surely moon to the same price, right. I’ve made my profits, day traded and am just holding the rest. I’ve never actually used the coins as a currency to buy anything, screw that I want my profits. 
Now here’s the thing, every post, group, blog, news article etc talk about the price relative to fiat. Everyone I know who brought into it in the last 3 months does absolutely no research and are just in it to make more fiat back, there is no interest in actually using any of this stuff. Everyone seems to share screenshots of their portfolio or talk about market cap. Everyone seems to want to own the “next best thing” cos they are hoping it is going to “moon” like bitcoin. 

I’m in my late 20s, still young, but I remember getting my first bank book when I was under 10, then I moved onto my eftpos card, then came internet banking and debit cards, mobile apps and even securities trading now through bank accounts. I’ve never thought fees were too high, in fact I never pay atm fees as I don’t use cash where I live. The bank has never lost my money, and I get good interest rates on my savings. I recently travelled and got a travel money card which was super simple for having access to foreign currency when overseas and the rates weren’t bad at all. I live in a different country than where I was brought up and I send money back often with a forex account for the best rates and it’s super simple with pretty thorough security checks. In fact, the whole crypto process is far more draining. Multiple exchanges account, hard wallet, VPN, can’t sell from certain countries. Exchanges stopping fiat transactions blah blah blah list goes on.

After travelling a bit recently and forgetting about my portfolio, I’m starting to get the opinion that this is all just a craze like Pokémon go. This technology is usable without the need of a “coin” or “token” and companies have already been doing it for years. 

Also, after travelling, I have noticed that a lot of Asian countries are still very very heavy cash users, and I can’t see them transitioning to crypto if they haven’t even done digital transactions yet. 

Anyway I’m interested to get other people’s thoughts and why they got into it?

personalfinance,How to distribute student loan payments among my wife and I's loans.,"So between my wife and I we have about 72K in student loans. I graduated a few years ago and have been making payments on my loans for a while now. She just graduated recently and we just hit her 8 months after graduation so her loans entered repayment.

I was on an IDR plan before we got married. I had high interest credit debt I was paying off so I was only making the minimum payment on my loans as required by my IDR plan. My wife currently does not have a significant income as she is getting fantastic experience in her field at the cost of part time hours at a low rate. We were able to recertify my IDR plan and have her apply for an IDR plan as well based on our incomes. Her IDR plan came back with a $0/month minimum payment due for the year. 

My question is how I should consider distributing payments to all of our loans. Obviously I will need to meet the minimum on my IDR, but now that my high interest credit debt has been paid off I have freed up money I can apply to our student loans. What I'm considering right now is to focus all extra payments to my student loan with the highest interest rate (6.5%). I have a few loans around 2-3K at this 6.5% rate so I am thinking if I can pay off one or two of them this year while she isn't required to pay on her loans, it will help me free up more money to snowball onto the other loans. I'm just really concerned on the impact of the interest building and capitalizing on her loans if we don't make any payments. Is there a rule of thumb for this scenario? 

Thanks for your help.",finance

CryptoCurrency,"A mixed Debt/Crypto Portfolio could soon be less risky, and higher return than 100% Equity","**Summary**

A 90/10% Debt to Crypto portfolio could very soon be less risky and potentially more rewarding than a straight Equity portfolio.

If money starts to migrate from the Equity markets into the debt markets, then by having a small fraction in crypto too enables a similar portfolio Return potential, but with less risk.

**An Equity portfolio gives:**

* Uncapped returns (the price can rise indefinitely)

* Dividend payments

* Votes at the AGM

* Last tier payback in event that the company goes under

**A Debt portfolio gives:**

* Limited returns - The price you paid for the bond will be paid back at the end of the bond term

* Fixed Coupon Payments - So X% per year

* A higher probability of receiving some payment if a company defaults --- companies have to pay back debt firstly, before equity holders are compensated

So - In a low interest rate environment, returns on corporate and government bonds are going to give low yields. (Investment rather than day trading). However they are more secure than Equity investments.

Currently, Equity markets are the winners in the continuing cycle of money between Real Estate, Equity, Debt, Cash, Gold.
This makes sense, as low returns on Debt, Real Estate had a small problem just recently (ahem), US economic policy seems to be promoting growth in US corporations. Hence for ROI -- where else to go?

Well, we're now in an environment where Central Banks are socializing Interest Rate rises...

At which point - debt based instruments will start to give a higher return.

**So why would money not pile into Debt from Equity -- well, you have a limit to the upside in Bonds... equity has no upside**

However if you still want unlimited returns having 10% of your portfolio in crypto provides this.
And your combined portfolio will have less risk... why?

Well -- you are no longer at as much risk of a company going bankrupt.... why? Your bond gets paid back before any Equity holder.

From an ROI pov -- and based on historical data - crypto increases have been an order of magnitude higher than Equity increases.. so 10% can give you the same uncapped return on investment as a 100% Equity portfolio.

So there you have it.... you now have a portfolio with less risk and higher rewards.... Just depends on when the rate hikes happen.

**Pricing CryptoCurrency Using Portfolio Based Equivalence Analysis**

The other interesting thing here - is that by performing portfolio analysis and comparing the cost of hedging an equity portfolio / debt portfolio against a corporate default and various anticipated return levels, with having a portion of crypto, and running a Monte Carlo simulation, you can actually put a price on cryptocurrency.

A few things to note for going forward:

1. I now have a dog, so I anticipate those costs to be ~$100/m, though with only 2 months and ""new dog"" costs still adding up, it's hard to tell
2. I've cut adobe cc since I stopped using it once going full time 
3. Rent will most likely go up in September...either by moving or by staying
4. Actively looking for a job in the city so as to get rid of the work costs (aka the car). This would put public transportation up a bit, as well as ""work food"" costs, so would save me probably $400/m.
5. Otherwise anticipate most costs to be the same going forward minus any tips you guys have that'll help me more
6. Savings: It's almost impossible to tell how much I'm saving each month, with savings moving around between accounts and such and with interest added on top, and mint not doing a good job of tracking what's what. According to the math above, I have about $33,946 of take home pay saved in various accounts (savings and investment) from this past year. I also put almost $12,000 in my 401k.

I lost power for a week, and there were cable lines down in my back yard.  The cable box located on the wires also caught fire.  
I lost service from 9/10-10/4.  It wasn't until that last day on 10/4 that a crew came and replaced the lines.  We were frustrated but they knew we had no service. 
The bill was auto-payed as usual for ~$230.  
In the coming weeks to months, my parents called multiple times trying to get a credit but they were ignored.  There's also a $60 Pay-Per-View that was added that they sure didn't buy.  

Well I called today for my parents saying I would try to take care of it for them.  Here's how it's going so far:
Pay-Per-View charge was credited back to account.  
The representative said that the window for credits for the hurricane had passed, and out of $230 they could credit me $44.  I told the representative that services were not rendered and that I would only accept a credit for the amount of services billed but not rendered.  I told the representative that I would be submitting complaints to the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) and FTC (Federal Trade Commission) who would surely defend my rights.  I asked that the representative speak to their supervisor and we settle the matter by way of a credit in the full amount for services not rendered.  
The representative spoke to her supervisor.  They restated that the most I was qualified to receive is $44.  I told the representative I do not accept and I would like to speak to the supervisor.  I was told I would receive a call back by an hour from now.  
It's been a half hour.

personalfinance,"Young adult (22) with ~15k in the bank, no debt, and 0 guidance regarding money management/investing. What is the best way to invest this money?","Hi, I'm graduating college this April.  Due to extremely fortunate circumstances, I'm graduating with no debt and about $22k (edit: Title of the post is slightly inaccurate.  Should've said ~15k to invest instead of ~15k in the bank).  I don't really have anyone in my life who is experienced with saving/investing money, there's nobody I know IRL who can give me good advice about money (including my parents).  

I should be starting grad school in fall of 2019.  My tuition will be waived and I'll be receiving a stipend which will cover my living expenses, with not much to spare.  I was thinking I would take about 7k of my saved money, and just keep it in a checking account.  Grad school is three years for me, so if I divide that 7k by 36 months, I can give myself about $190 a month to use for spending outside of what is covered by my stipend.  (Since the stipend effectively covers living expenses but doesn't leave much for other activities, I'd probably use this $190 a month to enjoy myself a bit by going out and maybe buying a video game every once in a while).  **Is this a smart idea? Or is there a better way to manage this money?**

If I do save 7k to use for my time in graduate school, I'll still have 15k in the bank.  I know that interest rates for savings accounts barely keep up with inflation, and I'd like to grow the value of my money, not see it stagnate or decrease in spending power.  

**What is the best way to invest this 15k, so I can see my money's value increase?** I understand that investing in the general market as a whole is a safe way for guaranteed long term growth.  Like an index fund, I believe?  Is this what I want to look into?  Can anyone recommend a specific fund/or group, and explain the basic steps towards getting started?  One other question, if I do participate in an investment like this, how accessible is the money?  If there was an emergency, can the money be removed from the investment without big penalties, or is it ""locked up""?

One other important piece of info, between graduation and gradschool (April '18-August '19), I'll be living with family with essentially 0 expenses, so I don't need to worry about rent, etc, during this time.  During this time, I'll be working too, so increasing my savings.  I should be working 20-40 hours a week at $10-$15 an hour (I know its a huge range but I don't have a job setup yet)

investing,Found A List Of Every Buffett Insight Since 1977,"Here's some of the points:

Edit - apologies for wall of text!

Edit II: Here are the links to the full formatted list:

https://forum.basic-capital.com/t/every-insight-on-investing-and-business-from-warren-buffett-since-1977-part-1/251

https://forum.basic-capital.com/t/every-insight-on-investing-and-business-from-warren-buffett-since-1977-part-2/252



1977
**Insurance &amp; People** - Insurance companies offer standardized policies which can be copied by anyone. Their only products are promises. It is not difficult to be licensed, and rates are an open book. There are no important advantages from trademarks, patents, location, corporate longevity, raw material sources, etc., and very little consumer differentiation to produce insulation from competition.
It is commonplace, in corporate annual reports, to stress the difference that people make. Sometimes this is true and sometimes it isn’t. But there is no question that the nature of the insurance business magnifies the effect which individual managers have on company performance.

Our experience has been that pro-rata portions of truly outstanding businesses sometimes sell in the securities markets at very large discounts from the prices they would command in negotiated transactions involving entire companies.
1978
**Investing** - We paid less than 100 cents on the dollar for the best company in the business, when far more than 100 cents on the dollar is being paid for mediocre companies in corporate transactions. And there is no way to start a new operation - with necessarily uncertain prospects - at less than 100 cents on the dollar.
1979
**Operating Performance** - On this basis, we had a reasonably good operating performance in 1979 - but not quite as good as that of 1978 - with operating earnings amounting to 18.6% of beginning net worth. Earnings per share, of course, increased somewhat (about 20%) but we regard this as an improper figure upon which to focus. We had substantially more capital to work with in 1979 than in 1978, and our performance in utilizing that capital fell short of the earlier year, even though per-share earnings rose.
“Earnings per share” will rise constantly on a dormant savings account or on a U.S. Savings Bond bearing a fixed rate of return simply because “earnings” (the stated interest rate) are continuously plowed back and added to the capital base. Thus, even a “stopped clock” can look like a growth stock if the dividend payout ratio is low.
**ROIC** - The primary test of managerial economic performance is the achievement of a high earnings rate on equity capital employed (without undue leverage, accounting gimmickry, etc.) and not the achievement of consistent gains in earnings per share.
Inflation - the inflation rate plus the percentage of capital that must be paid by the owner to transfer into his own pocket the annual earnings achieved by the business (i.e., ordinary income tax on dividends and capital gains tax on retained earnings) - can be thought of as an “investor’s misery index”. When this index exceeds the rate of return earned on equity by the business, the investor’s purchasing power (real capital) shrinks even though he consumes nothing at all. We have no corporate solution to this problem; high inflation rates will not help us earn higher rates of return on equity.
1980
**Gains In Purchasing Power** - Only gains in purchasing power represent real earnings on investment. If you (a) forego ten hamburgers to purchase an investment; (b) receive dividends which, after tax, buy two hamburgers; and (c) receive, upon sale of your holdings, after-tax proceeds that will buy eight hamburgers, then (d) you have had no real income from your investment, no matter how much it appreciated in dollars. You may feel richer, but you won’t eat richer.
Indexing - Indexing is the insulation that all seek against inflation.
But the great bulk (although there are important exceptions) of corporate capital is not even partially indexed. Of course, earnings and dividends per share usually will rise if significant earnings are “saved” by a corporation; i.e., reinvested instead of paid as dividends. But that would be true without inflation.
A thrifty wage earner, likewise, could achieve regular annual increases in his total income without ever getting a pay increase - if he were willing to take only half of his paycheck in cash (his wage “dividend”) and consistently add the other half (his “retained earnings”) to a savings account. Neither this high- saving wage earner nor the stockholder in a high-saving corporation whose annual dividend rate increases while its rate of return on equity remains flat is truly indexed.
For capital to be truly indexed, return on equity must rise, i.e., business earnings consistently must increase in proportion to the increase in the price level without any need for the business to add to capital - including working capital - employed. (Increased earnings produced by increased investment don’t count.) Only a few businesses come close to exhibiting this ability. And Berkshire Hathaway isn’t one of them.
1981
**Buying Great Businesses** - Regardless of the impact upon immediately reportable earnings, we would rather buy 10% of Wonderful Business T at X per share than 100% of T at 2X per share. Most corporate managers prefer just the reverse, and have no shortage of stated rationales for their behavior.
Many managements apparently were overexposed in impressionable childhood years to the story in which the imprisoned handsome prince is released from a toad’s body by a kiss from a beautiful princess. Consequently, they are certain their managerial kiss will do wonders for the profitability of Company Target).
Such optimism is essential. Absent that rosy view, why else should the shareholders of Company Acquisitor want to own an interest in T at the 2X takeover cost rather than at the X market price they would pay if they made direct purchases on their own?
In other words, investors can always buy toads at the going price for toads. If investors instead bankroll princesses who wish to pay double for the right to kiss the toad, those kisses had better pack some real dynamite. We’ve observed many kisses but very few miracles. Nevertheless, many managerial princesses remain serenely confident about the future potency of their kisses - even after their corporate backyards are knee-deep in unresponsive toads.
1982
**High Prices** - For the investor, a too-high purchase price for the stock of an excellent company can undo the effects of a subsequent decade of favorable business developments.
1983
**Poor Industries** - The projections will be dazzling - the advocates will be sincere - but, in the end, major additional investment in a terrible industry usually is about as rewarding as struggling in quicksand.
Last year, in discussing how managers with bright, but adrenalin-soaked minds scramble after foolish acquisitions, I quoted Pascal:“It has struck me that all the misfortunes of men Spring from the single cause that they are unable to stay quietly in one room.”
1984
**Stock Buybacks** - The other benefit of repurchases is less subject to precise measurement but can be fully as important over time. By making repurchases when a company’s market value is well below its business value, management clearly demonstrates that it is given to actions that enhance the wealth of shareholders, rather than to actions that expand management’s domain but that do nothing for (or even harm) shareholders. Seeing this, shareholders and potential shareholders increase their estimates of future returns from the business. This upward revision, in turn, produces market prices more in line with intrinsic business value. These prices are entirely rational. Investors should pay more for a business that is lodged in the hands of a manager with demonstrated pro-shareholder leanings than for one in the hands of a self-interested manager marching to a different drummer. (To make the point extreme, how much would you pay to be a minority shareholder of a company controlled by Robert Wesco?)
The key to a successful family business - All members of the family: (1) apply themselves with an enthusiasm and energy that would make Ben Franklin and Horatio Alger look like dropouts; (2) define with extraordinary realism their area of special competence and act decisively on all matters within it; (3) ignore even the most enticing propositions failing outside of that area of special competence; and, (4) unfailingly behave in a high-grade manner with everyone they deal with. (Mrs. B boils it down to “sell cheap and tell the truth”.)
**Large Cap Growth** An an iron law of business is that growth eventually dampens exceptional economics. just look at the records of high-return companies once they have amassed even $1 billion of equity capital. None that I know of has managed subsequently, over a ten-year period, to keep on earning 20% or more on equity while reinvesting all or substantially all of its earnings. Instead, to sustain their high returns, such companies have needed to shed a lot of capital by way of either dividends or repurchases of stock. Their shareholders would have been far better off if all earnings could have been reinvested at the fat returns earned by these exceptional businesses. But the companies simply couldn’t turn up enough high-return opportunities to make that possible.
Price Swings - Wild swings in market prices far above and below business value do not change the final gains for owners in aggregate; in the end, investor gains must equal business gains
1986
**Family Businesses** - Usually the managers came with the companies we bought, having demonstrated their talents throughout careers that spanned a wide variety of business circumstances. They were managerial stars long before they knew us, and our main contribution has been to not get in their way. This approach seems elementary: if my job were to manage a golf team - and if Jack Nicklaus or Arnold Palmer were willing to play for me - neither would get a lot of directives from me about how to swing.
Working with people who cause your stomach to churn seems much like marrying for money - probably a bad idea under any circumstances, but absolute madness if you are already rich.
1987
**Remarkable Businesses** - Our premium of business value to book value has widened for two simple reasons: We own some remarkable businesses and they are run by even more remarkable managers.
You have a right to question that second assertion. After all, CEOs seldom tell their shareholders that they have assembled a bunch of turkeys to run things. Their reluctance to do so makes for some strange annual reports. Oftentimes, in his shareholders' letter, a CEO will go on for pages detailing corporate performance that is woefully inadequate. He will nonetheless end with a warm paragraph describing his managerial comrades as ""our most precious asset."" Such comments sometimes make you wonder what the other assets can possibly be.
**Moats**. Experience, however, indicates that the best business returns are usually achieved by companies that are doing something quite similar today to what they were doing five or ten years ago. That is no argument for managerial complacency.
Businesses always have opportunities to improve service, product lines, manufacturing techniques, and the like, and obviously these opportunities should be seized. But a business that constantly encounters major change also encounters many chances for major error. Furthermore, economic terrain that is forever shifting violently is ground on which it is difficult to build a fortress-like business franchise. Such a franchise is usually the key to sustained high returns.
**Borrowing**. Really good businesses usually don't need to borrow.
**Franchises** - The record of these 25 companies confirms that making the most of an already strong business franchise, or concentrating on a single winning business theme, is what usually produces exceptional economics.
Newspaper Business - It may not be coincidence that one newspaper leads in both categories: an exceptionally ""newsrich"" product makes for broad audience appeal, which in turn leads to high penetration. Of course, quantity must be matched by quality. This not only means good reporting and good writing; it means freshness and relevance. To be indispensable, a paper must promptly tell its readers many things they want to know but won't otherwise learn until much later, if ever.
1988
**GAAP &amp; Fraud** - Then there are managers who actively use GAAP to deceive and defraud. They know that many investors and creditors accept GAAP results as gospel. So these charlatans interpret the rules “imaginatively” and record business transactions in ways that technically comply with GAAP but actually display an economic illusion to the world.
As long as investors - including supposedly sophisticated institutions - place fancy valuations on reported “earnings” that march steadily upward, you can be sure that some managers and promoters will exploit GAAP to produce such numbers, no matter what the truth may be. Over the years, Charlie and I have observed many accounting-based frauds of staggering size. Few of the perpetrators have been punished; many have not even been censured. It has been far safer to steal large sums with a pen than small sums with a gun.
1989
**Buying Businesses** - Ike Friedman is not only a superb businessman and a great showman but also a man of integrity. We bought the business without an audit, and all of our surprises have been on the plus side. ""If you don't know jewelry, know your jeweler"" makes sense whether you are buying the whole business or a tiny diamond.",finance
personalfinance,Just paid off my car. Thinking on selling it and buying a cheaper used one.,"I am currently working abroad, spending 3/4 of my time in another country using a rental car paid by my employer. By the end of this year I will have used my car for only 12-15 weeks.

My current car is worth $10.6k and I can buy a new, cheaper one for $8.4k or a 2-3 year old for $7.5. Both have similar maintenance costs and fuel efficiency, but the cheaper one is a compact one vs the midsize I currently have. I would put my profit in a long-term savings account.

I just ran some numbers, considering a 4% yearly depreciation, 3.5% price inflation, and 12% interest rate of my savings account.. and the 5 year NPV of not doing this (-$7.5k) vs going forward with it ($1.4k)  has left me considering this as a viable option, but I am not sure if I am missing some costs/assumptions that might skew this analysis either way. 

What else should I consider in my analysis? Would this be a wise decision? Is saving $7.4 over 5 years worth going from a car I am comfortable with, to a car that will have just the basic stuff?

***

1. I have seen some interpret this number as an intentional exaggeration based on the fact that Musk later specified the initiation of deliveries on July 1st as ""an impossible date"". The two factors are easy to separate, though, if you look further down in the transcript. 

 Musk says,  
&gt;  ""I feel confident about the topline number, but the mix internally, it is difficult to figure that out. Maybe it's something like 100,000 to 150,000 S and X, and then maybe 300,000 to 400,000 of 3, I don't know. It's really hard to say."" 

 Musk was obviously incredibly confident in a figure in the ballpark of a third of a million by the end of 2018, so it's reasonable to extrapolate that at the very least, 10% of that should have been done in 2017-even if factoring for the frequently mentioned ""production ramp"", which Tesla can never seem to get a hold of. We'll see if they can find the traction necessary to make it a reality. 

 Tesla has actually been sued [over the matter of failure in Model 3 production readiness](http://money.cnn.com/2017/10/31/technology/tesla-shareholder-suit-model-3/index.html). They mentioned it themselves in their [Q3 2017 report](http://ir.tesla.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID=1564590-17-21343&amp;CIK=1318605): 

 &gt; On October 10, 2017, a purported stockholder class action was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against Tesla, two of its current officers and a former officer. The complaint alleges violations of federal securities laws and seeks unspecified compensatory damages and other relief on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of Tesla securities from May 4, 2016 to October 6, 2017. The lawsuit claims that Tesla supposedly made materially false and misleading statements regarding its preparedness to produce Model 3 vehicles. We believe that the claims are without merit and intend to defend against this lawsuit vigorously. We are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with this lawsuit.

 I haven't seen any update on the case's progress but would update this if anyone has info.

***

***

I'm going to add a component to this which I feel is necessary because oftentimes when I see a post/comment which highlights Tesla's inability to meet goals and/or deadlines, a Tesla fan (or investor) comes forward and questions its significance within the overall market - usually against automotive competitors.

So, I'll compare projections for the Model 3 against the Bolt since those are both in the 200+ mile range EV segment.

I checked various investor materials from both companies' going back into 2012 and coming forward to 2017. In addition, I checked media reports for general events. Here is when each company made projections of availability for the respective segment entry, when revisions occurred, and the actuality:

Note: There were a handful of mentions of the Model 3 in terms of future outlook which dated quite far back. The [Summer 2011 letter](http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/ABEA-4CW8X0/6055843436x0x494001/DD297293-EC2D-4DC5-8DB4-63D491FB6BD0/Company_Overview_Q3_2011.pdf) included a mention of the then-called ""Gen III"", but I didn't include them as they were relatively theoretical in manner and not projections in any regard. They actively disclosed the project was on a TBD-basis so I granted them the benefit of said disclosure.

personalfinance,Consolidated Debt (CC + Student Loan) Question,"I'm entertaining the idea of requesting a personalized loan to help me payoff my debt. My debt is a combination of cc debt and a single student loan. This is the break out:

1. Type: CC   Amount: $6,850    Rate: 15.24%
2. Type: CC   Amount: $13,250  Rate: 24.24%
3. Type: SL   Amount: $4,450    Rate: 8.49%

Current salary is 90k (Clear $4,800/month) and the lowest interest rate offer I've received is from SoFi which will allow me to pay off the total balance with a rate of 9.2% and monthly minimum payments of $740 (over 3 years).

Is this good? Should I look elsewhere? Should I proceed? This seems like a great idea as I'm barely able to make a dent into the principal of any of these loans. I also pay $500 per month towards another Student Loan with a much larger balance, however I did not want to consolidate this one as it is a Government issued loan under IBR and allows much more flexibility. For those curious, I got into the current situation as I tried to start my own company, completely self financed, and it fizzled out (except for the Student Loan portion). Based off of my budget, I can easily contribute, at minimum, $1,200 per month ($460 more towards the principal each month).",finance
stocks,How to invest 0% interest debt?,"First of all I am Canadian. I am getting braces next week. I initially planned to pay it all in one single payment, until they told me that they don't charge interest. So I chose the 30-month payment plan. However the braces could be removed in as little as 18 months from now (14 months following the first payment), so I can't invest in two-year CDs/bonds with what would have been the 24-30th month payments.

&amp;nbsp;

After the initial payment, I am left with $6750, $225 a month, with the first payment being on May 1st. I would invest in March and keep the first $2700 in my 2.1% savings account in my TFSA (tax free account, yes we have Roth IRAs on steroids up here).

&amp;nbsp;

I am thus left wondering where to invest the remaining $4050. I am thinking either GICs, which are the equivalent of CDs (best I could find is 2.35%, maybe 2.45%), or bonds. Since I'm already buying in my TFSA tax free account, treasury or municipal bonds would provide no tax advantage. I have *some* default risk tolerance, as in a worst case scenario I could sell some equity to cover losses.

&amp;nbsp;

Two things that seem to me like they complicate things are the incoming interest rate increases in the US and possible increases in Canada, and the fact that I would have to invest $950 more in fixed-income instead of equity to reach the $5000 minimum. Or are there lower minimums available? Maybe a solution would be to buy on the secondary market?

&amp;nbsp;

I literally have zero experience with CDs/GICs and bonds, since my portfolio has always been entirely comprised of stocks, ETFs and savings accounts.

&amp;nbsp;

So basically, do I invest these $4050 in a savings account, CDs/GICs, bonds ($5k minimum or nah? secondary market to avoid the 5k minimum?) or some other fixed-income investment I don't know about? And is investing the first 12 payments in my savings account the best solution, or could I do something such as investing the first 6 payments in my savings account and the other 6 payments in some 6-month fixed-income investment?

personalfinance,Should I leave my job for career change?,"I am only 24 years old and I have been working at my job for 9 months. Right now my department is in shambles. We should have at least 5 employees, but at most we had 3 employees and no one has stayed for more than 2 months. I've seen at least 6 people come and go in the past 6 months which is pretty high. The workload has been overwhelming for me, but I've been making some accomplishments here and there.

Right now, I am working with another person, but this is her first week and I told the upper management that I want to leave on a good note, so I gave them a 1 month notice (End of March). My manager wants me to stay because I cannot possible train the new hire everything I know in 1 month and no one else would be able to do the work.

By next month, I would have saved about $14 - 15k which I was planning on going to a programming boot camp (HackAcademy). I do have loans and auto debt but my loan is around 10k w/ a 3.3% average interest rate. My auto debt is 14k with 0% APR so I can just pay the monthly fee until its gone. I was planning on paying 10k on the tuition and borrow loans for the rest. The remainder 4 - 5k will be used as an emergency fund for the next 5 months.

I currently live with my parents, however, I do pay some bills and help my family with payments. With that my ATH monthly expensive is $1000/month. With 4 - 5k, that would be enough to continue without a job and still help my family + my bills for another 5 months. This all includes my monthly car loan, and the extra money I put in for school loans.

I really wanted to go to bootcamp and hopefully land a big job, but there's no guarantee that I will get a programming job right off the bat. The bootcamp is a 9 - 6 course for 3 months and probably studying until 12 AM to keep on track, so I will be full-time. I will probably do some small part-time as a delivery driver during weekends to get some income. I'm literally taking a leap of faith that will either make me successful or back to square one.

I also realize that now, I have the high cards at the company I work for. I get paid a little under than what is normally paid around my area due to the reason that this was my first job and I suckered myself when asked what's my desired pay. My manager told me to approach the COO and propose that I should ask for the following.

1. Get a tuition reimbursement to receive a certificate for my job position (I started off with a different position and the upper management threw me to this job because there was nobody. I basically learned everything through observance, learning, and how the company functions)

2. Ask for a significant raise.
        - This is a tricky part. Right now I am gratefully living with my parents, but around 7 months, they'll be moving far from 
          my current job and with the pay that I am getting right now, I wouldn't be able to afford housing and pay off my 
          debts/bills even if I live with a roommate (I live in a ridiculously high COL area). My COO is very family orientated and 
          can understand and relate to hardship like that, but I'm not sure if I should tell her about that situation while asking for 
          a big raise.

3. Change my job title to appropriate one. I am working with the same job title as I was working when I first started. Right now I am nowhere near doing the same line of work however, I was never told that my job title would change.

4. Tell my COO set up a reasonable explanation on the current situation and propose what would happen in the next 6 months if I was gone and no one was managing my work.


The safest decision I believe is to approach my boss and extend my stay with a pay raise proposal. Not only will I have more money in my pocket for the next 6 months, I will also have my own place to stay and probably still save a little more if I budget right. 

Or I can attend the bootcamp, work my ass off while my parents provide me with their home. Land a job which will pay so much more than my current job even with a raise.

I feel like I am missing out on a opportunity with my current company, but I am also missing out the career change. At my age, I feel that choosing either would be okay.",finance

Or maybe I should only put 6 months worth of payments in a savings account and the remaining $850 in some better 6-months-to-maturity fixed-income investment I don't know about?

 

I am thus left wondering where to invest the remaining $4050. I am thinking either GICs, which are the equivalent of CDs (best I could find is 2.35%, maybe 2.45%), or bonds. Since I'm already buying in my TFSA tax free account, treasury or municipal bonds would provide no tax advantage. I have some default risk tolerance, as in a worst case scenario I could sell some equity to cover losses.

 

Two things that seem to me like they complicate things are the incoming interest rate increases in the US and possible increases in Canada, and the fact that I would have to invest $950 more in fixed-income instead of equity to reach the $5000 minimum. Or are there lower minimums available? Maybe a solution would be to buy on the secondary market?

 

I literally have zero experience with CDs/GICs and bonds, since my portfolio has always been entirely comprised of stocks, ETFs and savings accounts.


Thanks!

&amp;nbsp;

**TLDR:** Am Canadian. Will invest in a tax free account (Canadian Roth IRA on 'roids) so no tax benefit from treasury/municipal bonds. $6750 0% interest debt, 30 monthly payments of $225 starting May 1st. 

1. Is investing the first 12 payments ($2700) in my 2.1% savings account the best solution, or could I do something such as investing the first 6 payments in my savings account and the other 6 payments in some 6-month fixed-income investment?

2. Do I invest the remaining $4050 in a 2.1% savings account, 2.35% CDs/GICs, bonds ($5k minimum or nah? secondary market to avoid the 5k minimum?) or some other fixed-income investment I don't know about? Relative bond default risk tolerance. Possible 2018-19 interest rate hike complicate things.",finance
personalfinance,Employer registered me as having 99 dependents?,"Hey everyone, I'm very lost and very worried. Pretty much as the title says. I started working my 2nd real job this past October and when I filed my W-4 I registered as single with 0. I only just found out about the company's online paystubs and realized that no federal income taxes had been taken out all this time.


Logically, when I got my w-2 in the mail  right after, my federal income tax box was empty. I called a representative and found out that it's been registered as single with 99 dependents since October.  Between this job and my last I've made less than $6,000 last year, but I'm honestly worried and confused.


I spoke to my supervisor and a member from our corporate office and was basically told ""I don't know what to tell you"" when I stated I had not put 99 in my W-4.  I have submitted a corrected W-4 form for this next year.


I don't know if I'm going to end up owing money because of this, I'm honestly terrified this is going to come back and get me later in life.  I don't even know how this will affect how I file my taxes (which I've yet to do because I'm so lost.).


I called the IRS the other day and a representative told me I needed to submit a corrected W-4 to my supervisor for last year? That didn't make sense to me though, because where is that money that wasn't taken out my checks going to come from?

I graduated in December with my Bachelor's in environmental science. I'm really interested in conservation work and currently have a job in my field. I make about 30k a year, but I absolutely love what I do.

I've been offered a job that will pay between 70k and 80k a year, depending on overtime, but it's the exact opposite of what I do now, and the work is what I hated doing in college. Right now, I work outside for the majority of the year, and with the new job, I would be in a lab the entire day/workweek. I work in a park district, and the new job would be working for an oil company, which is something I never saw myself doing. So, again, it would be doing the exact opposite of what I do now and what I actually want to do.

I have about 45k in student loans, all federal, and the interest rates are all below 5%. I'm able to put about 60% of my take-home pay into those loans while I live at home, but I'm looking at moving out in the next year or so. I also have about 2k in credit card debt, but it's all 0% for the next 12-18 months. I don't have a budget right now, but I am tracking my expenses and working on reducing them and living like a broke college kid again, so I can save/pay off debt as quickly as I can, while I can. 

The only thing holding me back is I know that I'd hate the work and I know I'd get burned out very quickly. If I take it, I can live like I'm making 20k-30k and get the student loans out of my life in a couple years, and then possibly get back into conservation work. Advice?",finance

personalfinance,First-year college student looking for loan advice,"For context: I (18F) currently attend a small liberal arts school in New York, with an undeclared major. I started school with some credits and will have completed 52 by the end of this semester. I’m interested in potentially majoring in English (I know) but if I do this, I’m likely going to try and take some comp sci classes and potentially double-major to make myself more marketable. 

Anyway, my situation is kind of wonky so this is where my questions come in. Parents and I have already sunk ~23k (savings &amp; killed my college fund) to pay for this first year, and I have $5500 in federal loans. Ended up not liking the school as much as I expected to, and was planning on transferring to a SUNY for sophomore year. However, my parents just informed me that they MAY be moving out of state (various options; likely NC but still pretty unclear) this summer and want me to look for schools in the south. I know that this would present out-of-state tuition issues and keep me at a pretty high need for loans- to this my mom replied that I should just go to a CC there and transfer to a state school after getting an associate’s. At this point I’d rather just complete a degree- I’m worried about my credits transferring, and credit-wise am over a semester ahead at my current school (I realize this may change with a double major). 

At this point I’m considering staying at my current school for another year as my parents don’t really know what they’re going to be doing and if they move OOS my tuition won’t change. Based on the 2017-18 costs, best scenario I’d have 20k to pay in total next year after scholarships/grants and assuming max Stafford loan. I have a part-time job set up over the summer (would be making ~$3-4k max) and ~$1k in savings right now; I’m considering finding a second job for the summer, but this also depends on whether they move- if they do and I stayed I’d be living with my grandparents 25 min. from my summer job. Assuming my income/savings all go toward tuition I’d still have ~$15k I’d have to find for next year. 

Is this cost high enough to justify attending an OOS CC next year (likely about ~$8-10k), even with likelihood of losing my current credits? If I do end up needing the $15k in private loans, should I do it separately per semester in case I or my parents came in to extra money (is that even an option?) I also have a life insurance policy that my grandparents just transferred to my dad that has ~$2k cash value; would it be stupid to cash that out? Otherwise it would just be paying itself off (I don’t know a ton about the policy). Basically any advice about acquiring private loans to cover the $15k would be appreciated; I have been applying to scholarships but without luck so far. I’d also be looking in to graduating a semester early if I can, so ideally would be only needing private loans for around 5 semesters. 

TL;DR: Should I move with my parents out-of-state and risk losing college credits accumulated so far to attend CC and transfer to a state school later, or take on private loans where I am and try to graduate a semester early?

I am a long time lurker on this sub and have a question noted on the title.

I am currently in college with an internship who really needed a new car. My parents forced me to get a new car with low mileage since my last car broke down at 125k miles. On this car I paid 5k down payment and 7.5k on loan for 5 years at 7.89% interest rate.

I have no other debts or anything. I have the cash to pay off the car right now. But will it affect my credit score alot for only having the car loan for 3 months? I did not have the 7.5k a month ago. This was a gift from my father for getting good grades. He advised me to pay off my loan. Since i just moved in the US from canada, i have no credit history and this car loan has bumped my credit from 680 to 730 in two months. 

Question is, how much will it affect my credit, because if i pay off the loan, ive paid about 100 in interest instead of 1500 that it would charge me in interest over the years.

I want to know the best suggestion.

personalfinance,Hoping to move but crippled with debt.,"So first let me lead off with my income and expenses, then my story.
So I make about $2,000 monthly, $1,000 every two weeks form my employment.
I have two credit cards with garbage interest rates totalling a combined, probably about $3,000. I have a car which is nowhere near paid off. I owe about 10k on the car and pay $280 a month. My phone bill is about $100 a month. I pay $200 per month in rent. I also recently fell victim to a check scam and am on the hook for about $5,000 for that as well. I was hoping to have enough of this paid down so I could move come June, at least have the cards paid down. I buy groceries and try and limit the amount I buy cooked food. I do it sometimes but I keep it infrequent. I usually eat ramen or I cook chicken. Gas is steep here, and I drive an SUV. I maybe spend $100 every two weeks on food, $100-$200 tops, and usually about the same on gas.
Now for my story. I moved to Georgia with all my shitty debt and did a shitty job of managing it or paying it down. A wealthy family member of mine (Uncle) had heard that I had moved, and offered for me to move in with him in CA and he would pay for me to go back to school. The summer job I had in Georgia ended and I packed my car up with all my possessions once again, and drove to California. Long story short, My Uncle changed his mind after he saw how much it would cost him, but I had already quit my job and spent everything I had to come here to CA. Then he started charging me rent, which he never mentioned until I was already here for 2 months. He is also just generally an asshole and treats me like shit and I need to leave. The job I have is good, but it is a temp position which ends in June. I don't just want to move back home to New Jersey. I know it sounds crazy and stupid but I fell in love with a girl from Europe while we were both in Georgia. I feel like there is more opportunity for me there than here in the US, and I want to be with her. I want to have my finances in order so I could move there come June. I'm worried I wouldn't make it through immigration or get a legal status with all that debt to my name if I just ignore it. We love each other, but I don't think we would be ready to get married, I'm definitely not, so that isn't a path to citizenship or legal status or whatever.
 I can't afford my car and it isn't worth anything near what I owe, I can't keep up on my credit cards and can't keep up with interest and late fees, but I'm scared going bankrupt will make it impossible to travel, since I wouldn't have a credit card.
The answers I really want to glean from this are:
Is there any way to pay off most of this debt before I move? I'm worried having this much debt and just ignoring it would make it tough to immigrate, and it just seems like a shitty idea.
 
Could I reasonably move to a foreign country without a credit card? I could bring cash, but is that possible, or worth it?

Is bankruptcy the answer? I am young, 22, young enough to make these mistakes. A clean slate would feel amazing. I plan on voluntarily having my car repossessed anyways, I can't afford it as-is, and definitely don't want to pay for a car I won't be driving. Would bankruptcy be possible to have done so I could leave by June? Could I, in theory, hide 2k away somewhere so I can have a nest egg for when I arrive but don't have a job? 

I hope this sub has answers for me because since I've moved I've had all kinds of problems and barriers inhibiting me from getting a handle on my finances. Honestly, I'm desperate, I feel like I'm drowning and I have no one to help me out and no one who loves me here. I don't want the fact that I was born into a broke family and that I'm broke now to keep me form leading a happy, fulfilling life. If I can't take this chance and go be with the woman I love and find opportunities to succeed abroad I will always wonder what could have been. I don't want to let this debt rule my life. Not yet. Thanks again so much! I'll repost this in the AM if the visibility is too low and I don't get helpful responses.",finance

“It’s good to learn from your mistakes. It’s better to learn from other people’s mistakes.""
—Warren Buffett

Investors spend a massive amount of time trying to make all the right moves. The collective effort dedicated to picking good stocks, managers, exchange-traded funds, and so on, is immense. There are countless books, magazines, newsletters, podcasts, blogs, television programs, and more dedicated to helping investors make the best possible decisions when it comes to selecting and managing investments.

Far less energy and commentary is committed to the topic of how not to make the wrong moves. Here, I’ll discuss three common mistakes, all of which I’ve made (and will continue to make) myself. The three are related in that they are all behavioral issues that have been hard-wired into us over centuries. I’ll also share the potential consequences of these behav­ioral blunders and how you might be able to avoid them.

#### Mistake #1: Trying to Control Things You Can’t ####

Countless factors drive global markets. Randomness rules, so predicting how these myriad variables will influence securities’ prices is impossible. Thinking otherwise is foolish. Deep down, we all know this, but we prognosticate nonetheless. What’s more, we have a tendency to think that we not only know how the future will take shape, but that we have some part in shaping it.

Investors cannot control the path of interest rates, increases in productivity, the level of  Amazon.com’s (AMZN) stock price, and so on, but we often act as though we can. The illusion of control is pervasive. It is in some ways a form of self-preservation, and it’s been linked to positive mental health.  But as inves­tors, it can be hazardous to our wealth.

The illusion of control can lead to overconfidence. Overconfidence can lead to overtrading. Overtrading will almost inevitably leave you short of meeting your goals.

While I could go on forever enumerating the things that we cannot influence, the list of those things we can control as investors is much shorter. The most meaningful levers we can pull to affect our investment outcomes are as follows.

1. Save. Sock away as much as you can. This is the investor’s equivalent of advising you to eat dark green leafy vegetables. We know it’s good for us, but we’d like it better on a pizza. The earlier we begin saving, the better, as it buys us more time for the magic of compounding to work in our favor.

2. Invest. This may seem obvious, but the biggest determinant of your investment success isn’t which stocks or funds you pick, or how you allocate your assets, but simply whether you’re in the market at all.

3. Allocate your assets appropriately. Asset-allo­cation matters, though it’s a distant second to simply being invested in the market. How you allocate your assets depends on your goals, your time horizon, and your willingness and ability to assume risk, among other things. Having an appropriate mix of stocks, bonds, and cash will do more to move the needle than trying to pick the best securities or managers you can find.

4. Minimize costs. Fees, commissions, taxes—every penny spent covering these costs is a penny that will not compound over time to be savored down the road. So spend every penny wisely.

5. Avoid taxes. Please note that I did not write “evade taxes.” While we can’t control tax policy, we can respond to it. Locating less tax-efficient assets (closed-end funds, for example) in tax-deferred accounts and investing in relatively tax-efficient vehi­cles (such as equity ETFs) in taxable accounts can help you avoid putting any more pennies into Uncle Sam’s pocket than you have to.

There are countless things investors cannot control, but we often kid ourselves into thinking we can. Avoid overconfidence by keeping this short list nearby. Give it a look the next time you think you know what the launch of the iPhone X will do for  Apple’s (AAPL) stock price.

#### Mistake #2: Recency Bias ####

Recency bias describes our tendency to extrapolate our recent experience into the future. When my three-year old throws a tantrum, I tend to picture her as a grown woman kicking and screaming on the floor, even though I’m confident she’ll become a well-adjusted adult. Investors do the same. Stocks have been marching higher for the better part of a decade, so surely they’ll only continue to climb...right?

Recency bias can become particularly dangerous in bear markets. Falling stock prices can lead to panic selling, and shellshocked investors can be slow to get back in once markets rebound. There’s plenty of evidence that the psychological effects of the global financial crisis linger with investors to this day, as many of them have remained on the sidelines for much of the ensuing recovery. Remember, whether or not you are invested is the most painfully obvious determinant of your outcomes. Sitting out on a nearly decade-long rally has been a serious setback for many.

One of the bigger investment mistakes I’ve ever made can be partly attributed to recency bias. In February 2009, I bought shares of the paint, coatings, and chemicals manufacturer  PPG Industries (PPG). The market was near its nadir, and this was a highly cash-generative company that had consistently raised its dividend for decades, was in good financial health, but was clearly going through a rough patch (what wasn’t?). I saw this as an once-in-a-lifetime buying opportunity and acted on it.

One month later, I sold my shares. At the time, it seemed like the world was ending, I’d made a few bucks as the stock had bounced back, but it seemed to me at the time that the market—and maybe even the global economy—had more pain in store. Recency bias got the best of me.

What began as a contrarian move by value-oriented me turned out to be a costly mistake. From the time I bought PPG shares on Feb. 20, 2009, to the end of October 2017, the stock returned 27.6% annualized. Meanwhile,  SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY) gained about 17% annually during that same span. Having sold in March 2009, I missed out on virtually all of that recovery. My opportunity cost was greater still, as my recency bias led me to leave the proceeds of that sale in cash for years afterward.

How can we try to control recency bias? The first step is to recognize that it exists (in 2009, I wasn’t familiar with the concept). But that alone isn’t enough. Inevitably, we will be lured by the siren song of “This time is different.” It’s true that every zig and zag in the market is driven by distinct factors from the zigs and zags that preceded it. So, yes, technically speaking, every time is different. But what’s also true is that the long-term trend in markets has been positive for more than a century. Markets grow as economies grow as corporate earnings grow. This trend has persisted through countless crises. So if there’s any good way to avoid recency bias, I’d suggest that it would be to periodically look at the arc of the markets during the past 100-plus years as a reminder that every time is different, but the markets are still driven by the same fundamentals.

#### Mistake #3: Paying Too Much Attention ####

Our most meaningful investment milestones are decades away, but our attention is monopolized by the moment. Paying too much attention to our invest­ments today can put us at risk of missing goals that are years away.

One of the chief side effects of monitoring our invest­ments too closely is that it fuels our aversion to loss. Loss-aversion is but one suitcase among our abundant evolutionary baggage. The theory is that we feel far greater pain from losses than we experience pleasure from gains of equal magnitude. The tie to evolution is that Fred Flintstone had far greater incentive to avoid being mauled by a saber-toothed tiger than to order another oversize rack of ribs from his already-toppled car.

Loss aversion can have a meaningful impact on investor behavior. In “Myopic Loss Aversion and the Equity Premium Puzzle,” Shlomo Benartzi and Richard Thaler demonstrated that the disconnect between the duration of investor’s goals (retiring 30 years from now, for example) and the frequency with which they monitor their portfolios (typically at least once a year) leads to a behavior they coined “myopic loss aversion.” The likelihood of losses in any given one-year period is far greater than the probability of losing money over a longer horizon. But the authors found that annual reviews led investors to behave as if their investment horizon was a year out and not 10 or 20 or 30. This leads many to take less risk (by allocating less to stocks, for example) than is necessary to meet their longer-dated goals.

The best way to shake this behavior is to simply stop paying so much attention to the markets and our portfolios. I am a firm believer in an approach to port­folio monitoring and maintenance that borders on benign neglect. There is so much noise in the markets that the signal typically fades into the background. Tuning out the noise will also help to diminish the illu­sion of control and recency bias. In recent years, I personally have made a habit of only looking at my own investments once every few months or so. I’ve found that every time I turn up the volume knob on the market’s noise-making apparatus, it’s tempted me to tinker with my portfolio. While it’s tough to put the market on mute, I think we’d all be better served by tuning out a bit more often.",cryptocurrency

Ripple Rips Me Apart
by Juan M. Villaverde 

Dear Investor,


When we built our cryptocurrency ratings model, we did so with one fundamental goal in mind: To help crypto investors make more money with less risk, and do so objectively!

That's why Weiss Ratings never accepts any compensation or favors whatsoever from the sponsors or issuers of the investments it rates. Once, a company we rate sent everyone on staff a free bag lunch. We sent it back. On another occasion, they wanted to cover our travel expenses. No way!

That's also why our cryptocurrency ratings are based purely and exclusively on data! We built our model from the ground up to make sure that it sweeps away our own personal preference and intellectual biases as well.

I can find no coin to better illustrate these kinds of contradictions than Ripple. So I am dedicating a three-part series to show exactly what our model says … what I think … and how it all can impact Ripple investors in the future. This is Part 1 of that series.

Ripple gets a good grade in our model. But I personally don't like Ripple very much. If I didn't have the discipline of the model I built, I'd probably never give it a good grade.

Because it defies my fundamental vision of what defines a true cryptocurrency -- decentralization.

That's not Ripple! Ripple is centralized, controlled by a fintech company.

Here's the key: Whether I happen to like it or not, Ripple is making -- and could continue to make -- good money for investors.

Ripple is one of the fastest blockchains in existence. And the company behind is actively working to improve it, including a way to foster decentralization.

Ripple also allows for the tokenization and trade of real-world assets like fiat currencies and metals.

It is one of the most actively used crypto networks today. Usage and adoption grow every day as the company adds more partnerships.

In some sense, it's among the least-speculative investments among cryptocurrencies. (Although there are some related caveats I will discuss later in this series.)

So, add it all up and guess what! The model is picking up on all these strengths and overriding my prejudices. In effect, Ripple is ripping me apart.

The Big Idea

In today's so-called ""modern"" world of banking, the technology for moving money around is actually arcane. It's relatively slow, costly and inefficient.

The big idea behind Ripple is to jump into that space. They want their token, XRP, to be the ""coin of banks"" -- the cryptocurrency for financial institutions.

And because Ripple is based on blockchain technology, it has the obvious technological advantages of any cryptocurrency. Transactions are peer-to-peer, bypassing arcane interbank payment systems. They are nearly instantaneous. Their cost can be tiny.

Let's say bank A wants to send money to bank B. Ideally, here's how the Ripple payment system would work:

    Bank A buys the XRP token.

    It sends the token to an address controlled by Bank B.

    Bank B turns the XRP into the currency of its choice.

    Done.

Their mission: XRP emerges as a standard for interbank transactions across the globe.

And through RippleNet, the company aims to create a more decentralized payment and settlement system for financial institutions worldwide.

The technology allows the tokenization of fiat money, like dollars, euros, or even real assets like gold or silver. This allows the tokenized assets to be sent instantly across the globe, using the Ripple protocol.

""Beam me up, Scotty!"" In other words, transform matter (in this case money or gold) into energy, beam it, and then transform it back into matter.

The use of XRP?

There are a number of liquidity providers and market makers participating in Ripple's distributed exchange. When an institution is sending a payment to another institution, a series of intermediate transactions take place.

The XRP token is what ensures there will always be a market for turning asset A into asset B at the other side of the transactions.

This isn't revolutionary per se. As a matter of fact this is more or less how the legacy financial system works today. The difference is, by using a very fast blockchain protocol, RippleNet has less friction and fewer intermediaries, thus helping to dramatically drive down the costs of sending payments through the financial system.

The Bigger Idea

Ripple's XRP dreams of becoming THE standard and a widely used store of value. Some folks hope it will even take on characteristics of a global reserve currency.

That's where I step back in and say: ""Hold your horses!"" Before leaping into dreamland, take note of the challenges by asking some basic questions:

    Who controls the global financial system?
    Who are the key players?
    What are their vested interests?

It doesn't take a genius to figure out that, if XRP were to become the standard for interbank settlements, it could pose a threat to anyone or anything that's tied to the U.S. dollar, euro, yen, pound or renminbi as the world's dominant currencies.

Nor do you have to think deep to realize that each currency is the core instrument whereby the world's more powerful nations exert their power and influence. As Bitcoin advocate Andreas Antonopoulos puts it, ""Currency is an instrument of control.""

Getting your currency into the elite club of global reserve currencies is an even more elusive goal. Saudi Arabia and some of the richest oil countries of the world learned that lesson the hard way many years ago. China, with the tremendous weight it can throw around, is actively working toward establishing its renminbi as a valid alternative to the dollar, yet adoption hasn't materialized yet.

Beyond the U.S. dollar, the only currency that can claim some secondary reserve status is the euro. And that's only with 28 countries voluntarily giving up their autonomy, letting others take control of their monetary policy.

So if the folks behind Ripple want to get in on the game of competing for reserve currency status, they need to take a number and go to the back of the line -- behind the U.S., the E.U., China and many others.

Just ask Bernanke, Yellen, Draghi and other central bankers what they think. From their perspective, currencies are the weapon of choice to combat financial crisis.

They'll tell you that the reason 2008 didn't cause a global meltdown was because of their ""adept deployment of the centrally managed U.S dollar.""

They'll insist that the reason the entire E.U. didn't get buried alive by highly indebted members was because of how they leveraged the power of the euro to buy up worthless bonds that no one else would touch with a 10-foot pole.

They'll point to Japan, which has been pulling off similar stunts for nearly three decades and counting.

Are we to believe a Ripple is a serious competitor in this space? I certainly don't.

""There you go again, Juan,"" Ripple folks will say. ""Letting your personal bias get the best of you.""

Yeah, maybe. Still, a global reserve currency? No. I just don't see that in the cards.

Best,
Juan",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Home repairs- batch together or do piecemeal?,"I have some major home repairs coming up- I know for sure that we need a roof and paint, and I think we are going to install a new furnace. We heat our house with wood and the system is getting old. We have only been in our house a year, so we are still learning the ins and outs. My instinct is to take out a home equity loan and use to to pay for all of these things and also pay off about 4K in credit card debt that we have accumulated this year due to unforeseen expenses. We have almost no savings (4K) and are in our mid-thirties. We have collectively about 170K in federal loans that will be forgiven in 8 years under PSLF, but I am finding myself depressed looking at all these repairs and facing the possibility of yet another debt. One one hand, there are some home equity loans with very low interest rates, so I feel we should just take a lump sum for all of these repairs and not sweat it. On the other hand, the idea of taking on more debt is incredibly frustrating to me given we have never been able to save money (so far) and we are in our thirties. We do have about 65K in equity in our house and own one car, with about 8K owed on the other. I have a private l student loan that is about 2K. Overall we have avoided ""bad debt,"" but just can't. get. ahead. It seems. Our AGY is 91,000 a year if that helps. So the idea of now taking our a 30-40K loan to add to our mortgage is depressing me, as it was the one source of leverage I felt we had. Would it be better to try to make the repairs piecemeal and pay for them ourselves? Or is that strategy creating stress that will ultimately reduce our cashflow and prevent us from being able to start contributing to our 403bs etc.?",finance

personalfinance,First time home buyer - Down Payment Strategy?,"Hi r/PF! 

Everyone loves to give advice and their own personal experiences about buying their first home, but I've heard three conflicting opinions on this topic, so I'd love to get this community's objective comparison of the three positions. I'll try to summarize as briefly as possible:

Position 1 (my Dad, baby boomer, has lived in the same house for 30 years): Always put at least 20% down to avoid paying PHI. More money is more money so I should never put less than 20% down.

Position 2 (Coworker, mid-30's, bought his house around 2008 coming off the bubble burst): Interest rates are so low putting 20% doesn't matter. What's another 1% of PHI over the long term.

Position 3 (coworker, 30, just bought his first house last year): Lenders essentially penalize you with fees for putting 20% down to make up for the PHI. At 25% this goes away, but 20-25% is essentially the same as less than 20%.

Other facts - I'm 26, first time home buyer. Chances are I'll be in the house for around 5 years, but I'm single so will likely bop around over time. 

SUMMARY QUESTION: What is the ""best"" down payment strategy for someone in my position? Should I put as much down as possible or try to minimize my cash expenditure since I probably won't be in the house for decades?

Thanks so much for any feedback!",finance
personalfinance,Paying extra towards mortgage,"PA. 

I bought a house with my ex husband in 2009, then refinanced into a new 30 yr in early 2012 because interest rates dropped. We had planned to live here quite some time, likely long enough where we intended to fully pay off the mortgage. 

We are now divorcing. I will have the house. I’ve been paying extra (half of a months principal amount extra each month) towards my mortgage with the idea that it would save us compound interest over the long haul. I’ve paid off like 10 years’ worth on the new 30 year loan in 6 years. 

Original balance: 169000
Current balance: 129500
Interest rate 3.875
Payment: 750
Additional principal payment: 150

Now that my circumstances have changed, I’m no longer sure that I will still be in this house in 2-5 years. 

Is it better to just invest that extra money vs paying it on a mortgage that I likely won’t see to the end? I’ll obviously recoup my payments as equity when I sell, but I should make more in the market than my mortgage rate anyway.

personalfinance,Need some help checking if I'm crazy or not with a house I'm about to purchase. [Housing] [Investing],"Hi all, first let me thank you for reading this. I really need a sanity check here. Here's my situation:

**Current Situation**  
My current house has been on the market for a few weeks, it has about ~100k in equity that we hope to capture. We have someone stating that an offer is coming ""any day now.""

My current job status is great. I make right around 100k per year, I don't see any specific threats to me and my status with my company. However, this is a very large company that has been in the news lately for some not good reasons (if you follow stocks you'll know who it is). That gives me some anxiety, but not a tremendous amount as I'm in a field that is only growing.

**The situation I need help with**  

I've had the idea in my head for a while that the next house needs to be an investment house. I have that idea because the city I'm moving to is a tourist city and it would be very very easy to constantly have high dollar tenants their for any of our crazy festivals. I also do not think I'll be living at the house for forever. I'd like to have kids and stuff and I would like to do that in another state entirely.

But, can I afford it? I have found a house that features the following specs:

* Agreed upon price 403k
* Duplex of two 3 bedroom 1.5 baths
* 20% down payment
* 4.62% interest rate
* ~2300/month mortgage note
* Current note is 1400
* Current mortgage rate 3%

*That interest is .8 points higher than when I started this process and 1.6 points higher than what I pay now, this is freaking me out and is the driver of such a high mortgage payment.*

So right off the bat I'm looking at 900 a month in costs that I'm not spending now. That means, essentially, we have to have a tenant in the house at all times in order for me not to feel that pain.

But, what keeps me around is the investment. I could easily take a job in a bigger market and go to a state I'd rather raise kids and actually make money on the property. Rental rates in the area of the house say I could have up to 1300 in ""profit"" a month if I rent out both sides.

**Conclusion**

On the investment side of things I feel very comfortable with this. On the lifestyle side of things, I feel doomed. Which way is right, if any? Should I back out and get a smaller single family home? Should I even go through with this at all considering how low the rate is on my current house?

Sorry, lots of questions I know, I just need a neutral opinion.",finance
personalfinance,1st time home buyer advice based on current real estate market,"I'm looking for advice as a first time homebuyer. I'm 28 and live in southern Mass/RI. I'm single, make 80k and have paid off 45k of student loan and car debt so I have good credit (~780). I'm looking for a single family house or condo in the 180k-250k range, and could put between 10-15% down max. At face value, renting would be cheaper ($1200-1400/mo).

There are a lot of good incentives for first time homebuyers here (MA &amp; RI), including a forgivable (after 5 years) $7500 loan towards the downpayment, $2000 tax credit for life of the loan, no PMI and closing cost assistance. I'd probably realistically stay 5-7 years, but maybe longer if I found the right place.

The reasons I hesitate is real estate demand is super high right now, and supply is super low. In the past year alone house and condo prices have gone up something like 7%, and time on the market continues to shrink. Interest rates aren't too bad right now, but they'll probably go up in the coming years. With the standard deduction going up next year to 12K from 6.5k, you'll get less advantage than before of owning versus renting.

So the question is to wait for supply to rise or a correction in the market and risk potentially paying higher interest rates, or buy now at a potential market peak and take advantage of all the first time homebuyer credits and putting money towards actual principal.",finance

I didn't have any expenses or anything, so I thought it'd be fairly straight forward but I'm finding it a little overwhelming.

I paid quarterly tax payments throughout 2017, with one more payment left to pay. I made payments based on the assumption that I would make a total of $42,000, but I left a few months early and only made $35,000. Does this mean my last payment will be less than my previous payments? Did my estimated payments cover federal and state taxes, or just federal?

Do I need to file a 1099? Or is that something my ex-boss needs to do?

I just want to declare my income and be done with it.)

gaming,Fed up with toxic behaviours ? Tired of playing alone ? Here is our LFG website : FLARE !,"Hello everyone !

**TLDR: We were 3 gamers fed up with toxic behaviours, so we launched a free website where you can find friendly teammates on your favorite games 👉 https://flaremate.com/en/home/**

So why we started this ? 

One year ago, we were regular Overwatch players and **we were annoyed by toxic behaviours**. People who leave the games, rage in the chat, insult, ... destroyed the pleasure of playing video games.

It is for these reasons that we decided to set up this LFG (Looking For Group) project.

During the development, **our main focus was to be able to quickly find friendly teammates on as many games as possible**, and we hope you'll find the website simple to use and understand.

Here are the features we developped

* **An automatic creation of a in-game group**: no need to add everyone as a friend on steam, Flare automatically put you in the same group.

* **A customizable search**: depending on the game, you can specify your criteria (“Mercy” on Overwatch, “Gold” rank on LoL, “Section” on Fortnite, etc.).

* **A rating system**: If you meet a nice teammate, you can leave positive badges: Friendly, Leader and Teamplayer.


**So you can try the Flare beta here 👉 https://flaremate.com/en/home/** (It works on mobile phones too !)

And you can join our community and leave feedback here 👉 https://discordapp.com/invite/d9QW4gR

**At the moment, we really need feedback in order to improve our website. :)**

personalfinance,Dreaming of moving but crippled with debt.,"So first let me lead off with my income and expenses, then my story.
So I make about $2,000 monthly, $1,000 every two weeks form my employment.
I have two credit cards with garbage interest rates totalling a combined, probably about $3,000. I have a car which is nowhere near paid off. I owe about 10k on the car and pay $280 a month. My phone bill is about $100 a month. I pay $200 per month in rent. I also recently fell victim to a check scam and am on the hook for about $5,000 for that as well. I was hoping to have enough of this paid down so I could move come June, at least have the cards paid down. I buy groceries and try and limit the amount I buy cooked food. I do it sometimes but I keep it infrequent. I usually eat ramen or I cook chicken. Gas is steep here, and I drive an SUV. I maybe spend $100 every two weeks on food, $100-$200 tops, and usually about the same on gas.
Now for my story. I moved to Georgia with all my shitty debt and did a shitty job of managing it or paying it down. A wealthy family member of mine (Uncle) had heard that I had moved, and offered for me to move in with him in CA and he would pay for me to go back to school. The summer job I had in Georgia ended and I packed my car up with all my possessions once again, and drove to California. Long story short, My Uncle changed his mind after he saw how much it would cost him, but I had already quit my job and spent everything I had to come here to CA. Then he started charging me rent, which he never mentioned until I was already here for 2 months. He is also just generally an asshole and treats me like shit and I need to leave. The job I have is good, but it is a temp position which ends in June. I don't just want to move back home to New Jersey. I know it sounds crazy and stupid but I fell in love with a girl from Europe while we were both in Georgia. I feel like there is more opportunity for me there than here in the US, and I want to be with her. I want to have my finances in order so I could move there come June. I'm worried I wouldn't make it through immigration or get a legal status with all that debt to my name if I just ignore it. We love each other, but I don't think we would be ready to get married, I'm definitely not, so that isn't a path to citizenship or legal status or whatever.
 I can't afford my car and it isn't worth anything near what I owe, I can't keep up on my credit cards and can't keep up with interest and late fees, but I'm scared going bankrupt will make it impossible to travel, since I wouldn't have a credit card.
The answers I really want to glean from this are:
Is there any way to pay off most of this debt before I move? I'm worried having this much debt and just ignoring it would make it tough to immigrate, and it just seems like a shitty idea.
 
Could I reasonably move to a foreign country without a credit card? I could bring cash, but is that possible, or worth it?

Is bankruptcy the answer? I am young, 22, young enough to make these mistakes. A clean slate would feel amazing. I plan on voluntarily having my car repossessed anyways, I can't afford it as-is, and definitely don't want to pay for a car I won't be driving. Would bankruptcy be possible to have done so I could leave by June? Could I, in theory, hide 2k away somewhere so I can have a nest egg for when I arrive but don't have a job? 

I hope this sub has answers for me because since I've moved I've had all kinds of problems and barriers inhibiting me from getting a handle on my finances. Honestly, I'm desperate, I feel like I'm drowning and I have no one to help me out and no one who loves me here. I don't want the fact that I was born into a broke family and that I'm broke now to keep me form leading a happy, fulfilling life. If I can't take this chance and go be with the woman I love and find opportunities to succeed abroad I will always wonder what could have been. I don't want to let this debt rule my life. Not yet.

personalfinance,How Do You Ever Retire at 65 and Live to 95 Given the Power of Inflation?,"I recently created a retirement spreadsheet using excel and am having a hard time understanding how, given the power of inflation, you could ever retire with relative certainty that’d you’d be ok in the long run. 

Suppose you retire at age 65 with optimistically $1.5 million in savings. Suppose that generates 5% per year in interest income that you plan to live on = $75K/yr. Suppose you pay 30% total income tax on that (fed/state) leaving you with ~$50K/yr or roughly $4,000/mo. Clearly today $4,000/mo is plenty to live on comfortably.

But ~30 years from now (I am 36), assuming 3.2% annual inflation, $4,000/mo is worth only about $1,500 in today’s dollars. Still maybe ok if you live frugally; maybe have a place to live for free at that point (assuming you didn’t need your home equity to get to the original $1.5M nest egg). 

But the thing that really has me scratching my head is what if you live to be 95? That $4K/mo is now worth only ~$600/mo. That’s tough to live on. AND the thing that is even harder for me to understand is how much money it would take to make a material difference — suppose you double the $1.5M nest egg to $3.0M. By 95, that is still only giving you ~$1,200/mo in today’s dollars worth of purchasing power?

Clearly you might have additional income — SSI and/or work pension etc. But for the sake of simplicity, assume you don’t have those additional sources (because 1.5M as a nest egg is a stretch as is, so in coming up with the above numbers, I already shifted them to assume some of that original $4k/mo includes those sources).

How does one responsibly plan to live into deep old age (the universe willing) given the power of inflation? Once you stop working and start living on interest income, your dollars seem to devalue rapidly. Is the only solution kids/other family support by ppl working who make salaries inflated to 60-years-from-now levels? Or just enjoy the first 10-15 years of retirement while your money is still competitive? Is the advice on so many finance websites to aim for 1M to 1.5M in retirement savings dated (keyed to today’s dollars or even 30 years from now dollars, rather than 40/50/60 years from now dollars)? Or the advice that you should save X times your current salary to sustain X quality of life somewhat incomprehensible, since retirement is not a static situation, but rather a dynamic one in which X quality of life takes increasingly more income to sustain every year?

I’d really appreciate any help with reorienting my thinking about this if possible. I thought the retirement spreadsheet drafting process would make me feel more secure, and instead I feel less secure.

TL;DR - draft retirement spreadsheet has me confused as to how one can ever reasonably expect to live 30 years post-retirement on interest income alone without many millions in savings given the power of inflation. Please help :)

EDIT: Wow, thank you all so much for the incredible response and wealth of information. To summarize major takeaways: 1) The biggest mistake I made was to assume that I would live entirely off interest income in retirement; rather, most people seem to draw down principal and a 4% draw is very likely to last 30 years, a 3% draw almost certainly will (see Trinity Study and concept of “Safe Withdrawal Rate”). 2) I made many assumptions that are too pessimistic: a) tax rate is likely to be something closer to 20%, b) real return (inflation adjusted) is likely to be 3-5% annually, in part because c) 3.2% is likely too high an estimate of inflation (100-year historic average does not take into account modern monetary policy). 3) If possible, try not to assume the equity in your home will become part of the nest egg; great if you can live in the home to reduce housing expenses in retirement. 4) For many, retirement at 65 may be optimistic given increasing life expectancies — consider staying engaged even in part-time work you enjoy beyond that. 5) Expenses do tend to go down in retirement, though this may be non-linear (early active years, more sedentary mid-retirement, increased care costs in late retirement). 6) Consider “bond tent” or similar approach to asset allocation near the retirement age. Since poor stock market returns near retirement can cause you to dip into principal in a way that dramatically alters performance throughout retirement, it is a good idea to shift some of your portfolio to bonds near retirement age (see “Sequence of Returns” concept). 7) If an appealing option, consider jurisdictional arbitrage — i.e., make money in a place where wages/income are relatively high and then retire to a place where cost of living is relatively low (tl;dr - work in the US and retire to Mexico/South America/Southeast Asia). 8) Lastly, wherever you are on the path to retirement, proceed in the face of inherent uncertainty (even the corrected assumptions above about SWRs, future tax rates, real returns, and inflation are not certain), balancing as best you can the ability to hedge risk and plan for the future while also enjoying today.

stocks,"How the Trump tariffs may actually cause a recession, when? That depends","I thought my comment would be more appropriate for a whole post, I believe not many people, including the Trump administration are not aware of the full repercussions of the tariffs.


**(Copying and pasting from my other post.)**

**If someone is aware of basic economics they will realise that no one wins a trade war. I will try to make this short, brief, detailed, and easy to understand.**
**This is a fairly easy concept but it seems as Trump and his administration haven't thought this out. Tarrifs would have chains reactions that would brutally affect us and allies/other countries**


* A trade war isn't that straight forward and will have a chain reaction felt globally
* An example of the previously mentioned (chain reaction &amp; not-fully-though-out detail) would be the trade deficit that Trump outcries. 
* The U.S. federal debt is getting bigger and bigger (currently $21 trillion) and could become $1 trillion more by next year. 
* The rising amount of debt the U.S. has, could lead to a hike in interest rates, because the U.S. Treasury would have to offer higher interest rates to borrow more money.
* This would increase the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses - including mortgage rates - seeing as the **interest rates track government bonds**
* What happens when the cost of borrowing for American businesses rises? The businesses can't grow as easily and quickly, and they will also have to offset the cost to borrow by *raising the prices of their own products.*
* Consumers of the products would have to pay more, the businesses would not make a profit/less profit if consumers can't afford the products.
* The biggest buyer of U.S. debt is China, it owns more than $1 trillion of our debt (government bonds).
* The reason why China is the biggest provider of the money we borrow is because of the trade deficit were in (which the president outcries).
* The trade deficit we're in is an incentive for countries like China to finance our debt because they have something to do with the extra-cash they get from the deficit.
* **If this trade gap shrinks**, China and other countries won't have much of an incentive to buy our government bonds anymore and that could make interest rates rise significantly (again, because interest rates of things like mortgages, etc tend to follow the interest rates of government bonds)

**Understood? Good, now take a look at what would happen.**

* If/when the Fed raises rates, tons of foreign cash will flow into the U.S. bond market because of the higher interest rates.
* Because of this, the dollar will rise compared to other currencies.
* When the dollar rises, this will raise the cost of U.S. exports and lower the price of things we import.
* Corporate profits will decline, leading companies to do multiple unfortunate things such as laying off workers, etc. therefore U.S. stock market will decline. (There will be no more earnings beats, investors will expect negative of the companies, EPS will decrease, lesser/no more dividends, no more share buybacks, etc)

**If you made it through, well, be happy, because the tarrifs haven't even passed yet. This may be quite a ride from here though.**",finance
personalfinance,"If you were me, where would you put this one time bonus?","So here's the situation.  I cringe to even write this out, but it is what it is and pretending the problems don't exist doesn't make them go away.

I'm pushing 50, got three kids in various stages of teenagerdom, each with piddling college funds. Married, both my wife and I work.  But life being what it is we're drowning in debt.  I've got one credit card clinging to those 0% promotional balances, and another with a more typical interest rate I think around 14%, both carrying balances over $10k.  Our home equity line of about $80k is nearly maxed after work we did on the house. We have no meaningful savings account, a thousand or two, the kind of thing we dip into every couple of months when an expense pops up, and then try to build back up where we can.

So here's my question - I find myself with an unexpected bonus of $5000.  What should I do?  I figure here's my options:

* Just stick in savings.
* College fund.
* Make a dent in the equity line. While it's interest rate is lower than the credit cards, the balance is higher by a great deal.  Plus, if I have room there then I can breathe a little easier if any unexpected home expenses show up.
* Pay a chunk of the higher interest credit card.
* Pay a chunk of the currently but not forever 0% credit card.  It has a lower balance anyway so I could maybe get that one gone faster.

Or something else?  Whatever I do it isn't going to solve any of the problems I've gotten myself into, so I'm trying to figure out where it helps the most.  Each has its own benefits.  I'm not in a position to make major life changes, and it's not like we're dying.  We pay our bills.  It's just that over the years the debt's crept up on us and it's not going down nearly fast enough.

My current theory would be to put it on the equity line, both because it'll give us that breathing room in the event of emergency, but also it might help bring down that interest payment a bit so that as long as I keep up the fixed amount payment I've been making, more will now start going to principal and I'll get a mini snowball going.  I suppose the same is true of the credit card but ideally the credit card is something I'll stop using, whereas the equity line is something that's there for a reason, to help the house not fall down.

personalfinance,Climbing out of a hole,"Hello all, I am a 23 year old recent college graduate (Graduated in December) and I just got a job as a IT Developer and will earn $55,000 a year before taxes, and based on TurboTax estimates, around $41,000 after taxes. I have about $74,000 in Student Debt, so my main priority will obviously be to start paying that off. 

I don’t have credit card debt, and plan on living at my parent’s house for the foreseeable future, meaning I don’t have to pay rent, utilities, and my father said he’ll continue to pay for car insurance/phone bill for a year. I’ll pay for gas and obviously other miscellaneous consumption expenses. What is the best course of action in terms of starting to pay that student debt off? Is it wise to invest a decent sum of money where my rate of return is higher than the interest rate on my loans? Should I minimize as much consumption spending as possible since the outstanding balance on my loan is quite high? I feel like its a deep hole to climb out of and will take a while, but I am fully committed to climbing out of this hole.",finance

From my perspective, I'd much rather have a few million $$ in a 401k or IRA than some fixed monthly income from a pension in retirement. Also, the concept of being forced to contribute to a pension fund that I have no control over how it is invested doesn't sit right with me. I also understand that there are some limitations on how pension income can be passed on to my future children or spouse if I pass away, whereas money in my 401k is my responsibility and if managed correctly, can be passed down for generations. Also, if I understand correctly, if I leave my job at any point I get what I contributed to the pension back, not what has grown on that money.

XRP,Credit money and crypto,"I know this has to have been brought up somewhere already, but I haven't been able to find it yet. 

I'm thinking about the interactions between a credit money monetary system and a decentralized token, such as bitcoin, xrp, whatever token(s) suit your preferences.

Currently, the US economy functions largely as a credit-fuelled consumption economy with real wages stagnant or decreasing, based on the USD enjoying near unlimited demand by the world's producers of goods and services. We create fresh credit money (USD) and purchase the output of the world, leading to the deficit/surplus balances we observe globally. The US debt level will tend towards infinity over time and the system functions as long as the world is willing to accumulate financial assets in terms of dollars and the domestic US population accepts that most productive jobs will be moved to the lowest wage regions and/or automated away.

USD credit money has been very easy to come by in the US specifically to fuel/maintain domestic US demand and employ the world to produce things for our consumption. But, USD loses value over time (purchases fewer real goods or services), due to inflation targeting by the central bank. The stagnation we're experiencing is largely due to this wage-credit dynamic as wages are suppressed and household/firm balance sheets reach maximal debt burdens. Defaults and collapse are only held at bay by low interest rates—which unfortunately incentivizes further unproductive credit creation (paper profit and asset price inflation).

When a token is introduced in a credit money based system like this, there exists an incentive to take on fiat debt (credit money) and purchase tokens, and to save in terms of tokens rather than credit money (fiat). Those tokens are appreciating over time (given the decreasing supply of the tokens), have no corresponding liability, and exist on a payment system that is immune to collapse. This is very different than the current asset/liability credit money payment system maintained by banks, which can cease to function when assets on banks’ balance sheets implode, resulting in insolvency and bailouts to prevent total payment system collapse.

The credit money system can only persist over time via continued intervention by central banks once the wage-credit stagnation steady state is reached (QE forever), and you experience cycles of asset bubbles fuelled by low interest rates. The result will be debtor indifference to defaulting, as debtors know the central banks backstop all traditional financial assets and tokens that that debt purchases are suitable replacements for making payments. The credit money system is thus a leaky system, where participants are ready to take on debt to purchase tokens, and may be willing to walk away from their debt obligations during collapse, or default immediately after loan creation given that the tokens are difficult for creditors to collect. This will lead to a credit fuelled token price bubble that endangers the traditional financial system, given it is vulnerable to political unrest associated with bailouts. So the first interaction between credit money and the token can be summarized as: get credit money, buy tokens, default on your loan, implode bank balance sheets. Hence banks are incentivized to prevent fresh credit money from being used to purchase tokens, but simultaneously create enough credit money to sustain domestic demand.

The second interaction between credit money and tokens I’ve been thinking about relates to consumption and household income. Given the steady state of stagnant wages and maximal debt, households generally consume all of their income plus some additional credit, rolling over debt obligations until they die. The system is largely deadlocked in this stagnant steady state as a result of entrenched rentier interests who heavily favour wage depreciation as it reinforces their influence over a political system which relies on private financing. Keeping household wages low reduces households’ political efficacy and increases their reliance on credit, which reduces their ability to negotiate higher wages. The debt feeds the profits of rentiers who then supply the financing for political representatives, and control over government spending is maintained. Another way to think of this is as the inverse of the stagflationary era of the 1970’s, when workers held power over capitalists due to strict policies of full employment and strong unions.

In this stagnationary steady state, households have no option to save: they face low or 0 interest rates for whatever money they manage to save out of stagnant wages and positive inflation. However, tokens provide an appreciating asset which can be loaned out to other participants at a equal rate of interest, thus providing a higher total return (unrealized capital gain plus interest income). As participation increases so will the capital gain, which further incentivizes fresh credit money used to purchase tokens. This is an amplifying process which may cause households to reduce their consumption, as their income prospects are completely stagnant, token investment could be seen as “the only way out”. The result is decreasing consumption within a consumption economy, which necessarily demands more credit creation to fuel demand as consumption falls. This interaction coupled with the first interaction is an explosive unstable process which will cause the traditional financial system to destroy itself without government intervention either to prohibit tokens, continual bailouts until the political system collapses, or the total conversion of the traditional financial system to tokens.

I can't post this on the ripple reddit, maybe someone can repost it there for me. I'm interested to hear people's thoughts or get some directions to more of the literature on these interactions.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,"Overdraft $12.50 and pay back in 48 hours? That loan was at 51,000% APR.","*Edit:I understand it's not legally described as loan.  I am also not arguing against banks or their practices.  In fact I believe a fee under $35 has most likely been determined to be ineffective in curbing people's spending habits.  I just find the math fascinating.*

My sister works at a bank and is extremely concerned about her financially illiterate customers who constantly overdraft their account.  

I remember asking an account manager at a branch a few years ago the banks logic in charging $35 dollars for a small overdraft.  She responded with ""well, the bank is technically loaning people money.""

So I always wondered what the APR interest rate would be on an overdraft fee. 

Lets say you bought a burger combo for $12.50 and received a $35 overdraft fee.  You pay back both the fee and the principal amount in 48 hours.  

Here is an explanation of the math:

If you took out a loan of $12.50 at a 10% APR interest rate you would incur $1.25 in interest charges.  Simple enough.  This equates to $0.00342 per day (1.25/365)

And since it took you 48 hours to pay back your $12.50 burger loan you were paying $17.50 per day in interest.  So we ask ourselves how much more is our $17.50 daily interest payment than the $0.00342 10% APR daily payment?  It's 5,116 times greater!  But remember, it's 5,116 times more than a 10% interest rate.  So we have to times 5,116 by 10.  

**Which gets us to 51,116%**

We can check our math by asking, what is the yearly interest payment on a 12.50 loan at 51,116% APR.  The answer is $6,396.25, which if you divide by 365 equates to $17.52 per day.  Which is our original daily interest payment which over the course of 2 days totaled $35.  

Edit:

I fully understand overdrafts are technically not a loan, but a fee.  But most people think of money borrowed (which is what you're doing) in terms of interest on said money.  I guess one could think of it as a flat loan fee.  Which is why fiscal logic states it's better to overdraft on a purchase of $1,000 than a $12.50 purchase.",finance

I could go to like 7500 and pay off my loans even faster) and dump every extra penny into my loans, then snowball into my auto loan.

personalfinance,(US) Capital Gains Taxes' Effects on Income Tax Brackets,"Hi everyone, I've been searching around everywhere for an answer to this but haven't been able to find a particular answer yet.

Given the hypothetical situation that one were to retire around the age of 50 with a considerable investment into an index fund (not a 401k, IRA, just a normal, personal investment account without age withdrawing limits), and were thinking of retiring completely off of a small, nominal safe withdrawal rate of 3% for the remainder of his/her years, would the withdrawals count towards one's taxable income and thus potentially bump you up in Capital Gains Tax brackets?

For example, say I'm married filing jointly, and in my long-term investment account for the year 2017 I withdraw 80K, of which 50% have been gains (40K). Assume I have no other sources of income.

My question is: is the 40K added when calculating my income tax bracket, making my taxable income for that year 40K?  To my understanding, the long-term capital gains tax would not apply to this withdrawal since this would be within the 0% bracket. Would I be taxed on that 40K in terms of regular federal/state income tax as well, or not because it already went through the capital gains tax?

We are filing our taxes jointly but my question is simply, how do we handle this situation? Do we declare this income like any other 1099-MISC but leave the Federal Tax ID # blank? Not having a FIN basically prevents us from filing using most services online as they all typically require it. We have been in contact with the candidate and it is unlikely we will receive a 1099 or that he will acquire a FIN before the tax deadline.

TLDR; How do you report contractor income if the employer never had a FIN and likely didn’t report the contractor income to the IRS?

Any advice would be appreciated and please let me know if I left out any pertinent information. Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,(US CO/GA) Multi State Tax Filings,"Having a bit of an issue filing my taxes with online software tools, and want to avoid actually having to pay a lot more to go to a professional, hoping /r/personalfinance can help.  

In 2016, I worked remotely for a company out of GA while living full time in CO.   My company messed up and paid from my paycheck both GA and CO income tax, so for the 2016 tax season, I had to file both states.    

In 2017, I worked for that company for only a few days before being laid off and paid a severance.  ON the W-2 sent to me, the state taxes are indicated as CO.   I was under the assumption that I would not need to file for GA.   

This assumption held until I went to finish my federal and CO state tax returns, the tax software flagged me saying I should file a GA return also.   I don't understand, it doesn't feel necessary.   

Do I need to file GA even though all my taxes were coded as CO from that company?",finance
personalfinance,Tax Return is way more than expected...,"So...the IRS just gave me way more money for my tax return than what I expected. I think I know why, and I'm trying to fix it...but I had some questions for the mind hive. 

Between January - June, I was paid through a grant and did not receive a W2 or a 1099. It's supposed to be all self-reported income. I paid about $7320 in estimated taxes for this period through EFTPS. 

Between July - December, I was paid through an employer with a W2 and I got taxed through federal withholding on my monthly income (easy). 

Here's the rub. When I filed taxes this year through Turbotax, I imported my W2 for July - December, BUT I FORGOT to report the income from January - June. So while I was expecting a return of about $2000...I just got my refund and it's closer to $9000! My best explanation for this is that the IRS must have seen those estimated payments I made through EFTPS and refunded it back to me, since I forgot to report the income during that period. 

So. I'm looking to file an amendment. And I'll obviously report the additional income from January to June. But here's my question...

Since I THINK those estimated payments 0f $~7000 were paid back to me in this over-paid refund...do I still report in my amendment that I paid estimated taxes during January-June and assume they will send me a bill for that money back? Or do I just assume I am now starting back at zero taxes paid on that unreported income since the IRS refunded me that money (I think?) and just file an amendment stating that I have NOT paid any estimated payments for those months, then pay the refunded ~$7000 back with the amendment?

personalfinance,Conundrum: wipe out debt or continue saving?,"Hello all,
 
My father passed away unexpectedly a few months ago leaving me (30,M) with a substantial amount from his life insurance policy (around 125k). I have a decent salary (60k) and around 20k in savings. Renting, no car payment, live somewhat frugally with my partner. 

I do have about 105k in federal student loans which I’d planned on discharging through student loan forgiveness. I’m on a PAYE plan and have been working at a non-profit for two years, with 8 years to go until the loans are forgiven. 

Until now, I’d been saving for a house. Now, with this unexpected income, I could wipe my debt out entirely.

I’m wondering how to approach this issue. On my current PAYE plan, I wouldn’t even be paying 30% of the total debt (plus tax) once it’s forgiven. I like working in non-profits and have no desire to join the private sector for the next decade. I’m also in a masters program which is almost fully subsidized by my employer. 

In short, I could wipe my debt out now, or save/invest around 140k for a future home. I have experience budgeting/saving but not with investing. 

Any tips or insight would be much appreciated. Thank you. 

Edit: for those mentioning interest rates—these are federal loans so the amount I’d end up  paying through student loan forgiveness would not even touch the principal plus interest after ten years. Paying the full loan off would essentially mean forfeiting the benefits of this program to the tune of 30-50k.",finance

personalfinance,Won’t be approved for a large enough mortgage?,"Hey everyone, first time home buyer here. Checking a couple mortgage calculators I’m finding I probably will not be approved for a large enough mortgage to buy anything decent. I would like to buy a 3 bedroom property, live in one room, and rent the other two, but after checking I’m not able to afford much at all.

Here are my current financials:
30k cash (Have more saved as emergency fund)

760 credit score

Income of $3,200/month before tax

Debts of $750/month car and student loans
(I’m assuming I leave my other expenses like auto insurance, cell phone, etc off this?)

When I check mortgage calculators I assume:
20% down
4.5% interest rate
2% property tax
1% insurance

All of this together in the calculator says I can afford a $95,000 home. Does anyone know if I have any other options? Would an FHA loan approve me for more? In my area 95k won’t get far. I was looking more around 150k (thus the 30k for 20% down) for a decent, smaller fixer upper style home.

I think it’s because of my debt to income ratio. So would it be a good idea to take my down payment, pay off a good amount of my student loans to lower debt, then get an FHA loan with 3.5% down?

Hi everyone! Hope you're all well, financially and etc.!

I need some advice in regards to my mom's financial situation. She turns 50 this year, but she is VERY untrusting towards the market and only has money in a credit union account and cash in a safe. She's very stubborn when it comes to her money, but I've recently become very concerned when I found out something recently: she has $80k and cashed out about $20k from a mutual fund...after it lost $200 in the first 2 months of it being open. This leaves her with $100k cash: sorry for the confusion.

Yup. That's what I'm dealing with.

She is self employed, so she usually has to pays taxes every year. I'm planning to have a sit-down with her sometime soon to go over how much she makes a year and try to come up with a game plan. I'll update soon once I find out her salary. It fluctuates every year, but last year I believe she reported $40k. The $80k figure is mostly cash she has, almost quite literally, stuffed into her mattress over the years.

Luckily though, her house is almost payed off. I believe she owes about $75k now on the mortgage. So now my mom is talking about paying off the house to not to have pay a 3% interest. But again, she's stubborn.

I'm concerned now that if she pays off the house, she will have close to nothing saved to put into an IRA or something. So my biggest question is: what kind of financial tools can I use to help my mom stay financially stable? Or is there any way to get her a comfy retirement in a reasonable time frame? She cleans houses and businesses, and I hate the thought of her having to work the rest of her life. 

The goal I have in mind is trying to get her enough to retire in 15 years, but clearly not even a high-risk investment portfolio would build up enough for her to have a decent retirement. Any and all advice is more than welcome!

Also, I know I might be lacking in information. This post is mostly impulsive because I LITERALLY found out more info on her financial situation 5 minutes ago. I'm freaking out! But I will update as I go. I'm gonna try and look at her stuff tonight or tomorrow.

Thanks for you help in advance!

EDIT: Sorry for the confusion on how much my mom has. And I apologize for the misleading title, I guess I meant my mom has no money in any retirement accounts. My mistake :/

UPDATE: Okay, I sat my mom down and looked at her stuff. She plans on filing this year's taxes later this week, but I got a pretty good picture of her financial situation through the past 2 years of her taxes.

She has been paying ALOT in taxes, but that has to do with her having to pay the full 15% due to her being self employed, which I had completely forgotten about. Looks like her gross income was just shy of $40k total for the past two years. I get W-2's from my employer, so I've been kinda spoiled that I didn't have to keep track of my income AND I pay 7.5% and they cover the rest (for those who aren't familiar with how W-2's work, that's pretty much the rough idea). It's nice getting returns.

We registered her on ssa.gov and turns out she'll will probably be getting $500 a month after she retires (she thinks around 70). That was a pleasant surprise!

She now has a game plan for putting her cash into a savings account with 1.5% interest. We're gonna use discover since they seem very safe (her words, not mine), and I've never had a bad experience with them, so it seemed like a no-brainer. She'll hopefully have the majority in it by the end of the month.

This brings me to another question: would the IRA have reason to audit her should she dump a bunch of cash into any asset, like an IRA or a 1.5% savings account? Is that something we should consider?

She is already paying towards the principal of her mortgage, so it looks like she'll have it payed off a few years early! And she had refinanced about 4 years ago to a 15 year amortized schedule. And that was for a balance of $86k at 2.99% interest, which blew my damn mind. That was when I found out my mom has nearly perfect credit. Last time I saw it was when i was 14 and it was barely 500! Now it's over 800!

She has been paying extra towards her principal, too. Looks like she may be finished paying the house about 4 years early, assuming she keeps paying the same amount.

 Oh, and according to some paperwork from last year, the house would be worth $300k if we can get the thing up to code. She doesn't want to sell it, but I think she understands it could be a last-ditch effort should, for some ungodly reason, everything else falls through. Which won't happen.

But I mean, 2008 and all that...

She refuses to invest in the market, and I don't blame her nor do I want to make her, but she is considering investing into a Roth IRA (she likes the idea of not paying taxes when she needs the money) and max it out as much as possible until retirement. 

No 401k. It doesn't seem to be really worth it. According to her, anyway. We'll see after we speak to a financial planner.

She doesn't have much debt. She got a new car a few months back with a principal of $12k and an interest rate of a little over 4%, but she is actually considering paying it completely by year's end. Otherwise, she has barely any credit card debt (total of $2k) which I learned was absorbed into the mortgage when she refinanced, so it's like she has none at all. And she uses Cricket, which charges her like $40 a month. She's in good shape debt-wise.

We will be confirming all of this with a financial planner sometime this week after she finishes filing her taxes. I'm actually excited now!

So we have a game plan, we just need to talk to a pro and execute. I actually feel much better and I've learned a lot through this experience. It fascinates me how different my mom's behaviors have been over the years, but she will still, somehow, end up in a pretty decent spot when she retires. And that's all with her cleaning business she had even before I was born. I certainly feel much better.

Thank you for your guy's help! Feel free to comment on what we plan on doing. I love hearing from you guys.",finance

edit: Should you try to keep the loan balances at proportional ratios to their respective interest rates? For example, loan 1 is 20,000 at 4%, loan 2 is 15,000 at 6%. 4:6=66%, so if loan 2 is more than 66% of loan 1, it would be more efficient to put money towards loan 1.",finance

personalfinance,Capital One 360 Money Market account does not offer a debit card?,"I already had a Capital One 360 Checking account and I decided to open a Capital One 360 Money Market account to take advantage of the higher interest rate (1.50%).

However, after opening the 360 Money Market account, I couldn't find a way to link the debit card I already have for the 360 Checking to this newly opened 360 Money Market account.

Furthermore, there doesn't appear to be an option through Capital One's website to get another debit card for the 360 Money Market account?

personalfinance,Which Debt to Destroy,"Hi. I have a question about my financial situation. I have a 3800 dollar school debt, and around 1300 dollars in credit card debt. I have 1500 dollars to spend on the debt. I know credit card debt is supposed to be more detrimental in the long run. However, I have had that school loan in the process of being paid for close to two years now. I want to take care of it as fast as possible, and feel like I may be more motivated to pay the credit card debt quickly anyway, because of the higher interest rate. The credit card debt is newer. I just want to know what anyone else would do with 1500 dollars, and to what they would apply the money. What is your best advice?",finance

They are federal loans so they will never go away, I just want them off my credit report so i can get hired for a better job.  I'm scared if i make a payment now they will stay on for another 7 years.

investing,Moving money to different countries for the Interest Rate,"Why dont people move their money into (or maybe i should ask why im not) countries that have really good interest rate to inflation rate rations.

I know Iran in a shit show but look at Russia; 7.5% interest rate and 2.2% inflation. What am i missing? Can I just set up bank account in these countries and collect the interest?

personalfinance,Question about co-signers and credit,"I'm looking to buy a new car(used but new to me)... My credit score is good(800) but I have never had any major loans before(only 28 y/o, always rented my residence). I bought my last car in cash for 7k that I saved up over the course of a year(which appears to have been a bad move in hindsight). I'm looking to get something much newer than that car and so I'm looking at around $25k which I won't be able to do out of pocket.

Other than that last car I've never had a major purchases. No loans to speak of either, got a grant for college. The finance departments of car dealers (or the banks they work with?) say even though my score is good since I've never had any big loans before I don't qualify. One said I would qualify if I had 3 credit cards going for more than 3 years, I've only had one credit card ever. I went to my own bank but the interest rate they gave me was ridiculous.

My father will co-sign a loan with me. If that were to occur, would I still get the benefit to my credit score if it's paid off properly? E.g. the next time I want a loan would this loan that was co-signed with my father reflect on my score to allow me to qualify on my own? Or does it only reflect well for him as the co-signer?",finance

personalfinance,HSA contributions question for income taxes (US),"I'm married and am filing my income taxes jointly. Both my wife and I have an HSA account, however only I have an HDHP through my employer. My wife does not (she is on my family plan though).

For the 2017 year, I nearly maxed my contribution limits to my HSA. However, my wife's employer messed up and contributed over $600 into *her* HSA. She withdrew the full amount and spent it on eligible medical expenses.

Now that I'm doing my taxes, I'm seeing that about $200-300 is being deducted from my federal return because I reported her contributions and said she had no health plan. Credit Karma Tax states that her maximum allowed contribution limit is $0. I think this is causing some sort of excise tax.

Sadly I wasn't aware of the implications this situation would have until now, and I'm not sure what our options are. Can we only file our taxes and take the hit? Is there something we can do to get her employer to fix the mistake? What are our options?",finance
Bitcoin,Legality of Bitcoins in Belarus,"According to the decree number eight, named ""On the development of the digital economy"", which will be enacted on 28 March 2018, using crypto-currencies in Belarus are declared legal providing Belarusian will be processing all their digital money transactions through residents of government's controlled special zone for IT entrepreneurs ""High Technological Park"".

This zone, launched in 2015, contains around 200 startups companies, which enjoy various tax and legal allowances from Belarusian authorities. Mining and trading crypto, organizing ICOs as well as serving as go-between all other citizens and the crypto-world are now added to this list of government's backed privileges. Additionally, all those crypto related activities will stay tax exempt until 2023.

Looks like Belarus has just joined the long directory of countries where ruling elite wants to closely monitor and to control people's access to the new free and borderless economy.

Business Notes for Startups Founders:

political climate: not friendly;
economic climate: not friendly;
regions to focus: locally;
industries to focus: mobile e-services, SaaS, entertainment;
major limitations: government regulated stagnating economy (GDP growth rate is slightly above zero), high CB interest rate (exceeds eleven percents, high administrative and legal barriers to SME, brain-drainage, fixed Internet penetration rate is around 60%, shortage of seed and VC financing, low middle-income consumers (per-capita is below six thousands dollars);
stimulus: low costs, low competition, population is about ten million;
opportunities: to create an e-business aimed at the young urban users of mobile Internet.
Cryptocurrencies and ICOs (outlook): limited legality (moderately negative)

personalfinance,"~35k in debt, given our interest rates, should we snowball or consolidate our debt?","Hello PF,

Thank you in advance for anyone that can provide some advice on our current situation.

My husband and I have about ~35k in debt on two CC's and a personal loan, all of which was accrued by various unforeseen expenses over the past few years. We already meal prep, coupon, and budget, however we feel like we're not making any headway on paying off our debt due to the interest rates. We've explored the Snowball and Avalanche methods but are also considering consolidating our debt in hopes of putting the money we save from interest towards the total.

After taxes we take home a little over 60k. I have a FICO score of 700 and I believe his is about the 670 range. We've never missed a payment and would usually try to pay at least $200 extra but as of this year, have only been able to pay the minimums due to medical bills. 

Here is the breakdown for each item, the debt, and the interest rate: 
CC #1: $14,900   18.40%
CC #2: $9,500 	16.49%
PL: $9,466 	12.75%

We were considering consolidating through our bank (WF) and saw that they offer a program that starts at 8.24%.

Given our situation, would it be wise for us to look into debt consolidation or should we try either the Snowball or Avalanche method?

I hope this is enough information to start and am happy to provide more if necessary. We truly appreciate any advice we can get. We're staying positive and doing our best to roll with the punches! Thank you.",finance
personalfinance,Need Advice regarding recent car accident where the other driver has no insurance.,"I was recently involved in a car accident (I live in Alaska which is probably relevant). The other car ran a red light and t-boned me in the intersection. Based on the police report it was determined that I was not at fault, however, the other driver does not have insurance.

I have full coverage and working with my insurance company. They are supposed to do an assessment of the damage this week. From what I saw its probably going to be a total loss (frame damage, driver side doors unsalvageable, all the airbags blew, hood needed to be pried open by first responders, etc.). I have gap insurance so I am not necessarily worried about my losing money on my vehicle but I need advice on how to move forward. 

I have no savings at all as I'm currently trying to pay down about 10K in credit card debt. I definitely need a new vehicle but I really don't want to get another loan. My previous vehicle was a bad financial decision, 4% interest rate and I paid too much for it. So as far as silver linings go,  maybe the accident wasn't the worse thing. 

As far as injuries go, I'm ok for the most part. Knee got pinched between crushed door and steering wheel so I'm going to get an MRI this week to check. Hopefully, everything is good. 

Financially, I don't know what to do. I don't want another loan but I need a vehicle. I probably owe more on the loan that its worth so I am not anticipating any money from my insurance company. And since the other driver doesn't have insurance I think my only option to get money from them is to go to court. 

So am I totally screwed? Have any recommendations because I am kinda lost.",finance

personalfinance,Need help deciding what route to go when looking at a car.,"Long story short my old car died and I have been looking into the best way to get a new one. I'm not that knowledgeable about the process and neither are my folks so I'm hoping for some help. 

I am currently 23, live at home, 14K in savings and earn roughly 60K a year before overtime/bonuses and before taxes. I have 50K in student loans with a 300 minimum a month that i've been over paying on the higher interest rate. My only other set expense is the $240 cellphone bill I cover for my family. That doesn't include gas + parking fees at work. No matter what I was considering putting something between 4 and 6 thousand down for whatever route I went. 

I had all but decided that a 2015 Honda Civic with sub 25K miles at around 14,000 would probably be my best bet. I have good credit so I assumed I would be able to get a decent rate. I've begun to notice that reliable cars that I like, Subaru and Honda's specifically, basically retain most of their value so i'd have to go older + higher mileage. This discourages me since I would like to keep it forever. 

Given the only minimal price difference between new and used I was considering the idea of going new. The price would be higher, but I thought I would save money on maintenance in the early years. This led me to either a new Civic hatchback (roughly 21K) or a Subaru Crosstrek (22K)/Impreza (21K). Is this a bad decision? 

I am not the type of person who wants to upgrade their cars. I want this car to last me for the next 10 plus years. Also any tips? My fear i being taken advantage of since me and the family aren't great with cars. For example, people always say to get used cars from a dealer looked at by a mechanic. How would they let us take it to one? 

I know PF always says go used, but figure things change. I don't have my heart set on anything yet (though I do really like the Subaru.)

Can I still write the tuition off on my taxes? I’m worried that double writing will turn into tax fraud or something.

UPDATE: I opened my Charles account using a VPN because I'm outside the states. Charles picked up the foreign IP address and is now requiring I go verify my identity in person at a local branch in the states. This was unexpected and I didn't think of this when opening an account. I've called and chatted countless times but nothing. It's frustrating. I had high hopes with Charles and I'd figure they could lift the restriction. 

Heads up expats! Use an IP address from the states to avoid this. 

.......

About me and this list: 

I'm living and working abroad so many of the items mentioned below are focused on providing a wider range of services for a more wholesome banking experience. More so than interest rates and no matter where you are. 

I think banking should be enjoyable, easy to join, and easy to maintain regardless of balances. High interest rate checking accounts are not on this list because of their requirements. 

What you will find is basic information and specifics like visa conversation rates and WIRE/ACH transfers info.  It's important to be able to fund online accounts somehow from bank to bank while having access to your money. 

I need a debit card to function. I also use apps like Square cash with family and it's great to transfer funds while being abroad for free.

I emailed DSD about their right to refuse withdrawal. It's in their disclosure agreement and applies to both savings and CDs. The Bank may refuse to permit withdrawals in cases such as, but not limited to, the following:

The Bank chooses to exercise its legal rights to require up to 60 days advance written notice of any intended withdrawal from this Account and the 60 days have not passed since we received the required notice from you;

To which they replied


""This legal right is granted to the bank under NYS Banking Law Section 238-2. Emigrant Bank has been in operation since 1850 and has never exercised that right.""

They don't mention anything about inactive or dormant fees, they can also close your account without cause. 

If anyone has experience with DSD please comment.

...........

Conclusion: 

Charles and 360 have simple yet attractive fee schedules online that are worth checking out. Discover also lays out fees and benefits pretty well online. 

I narrowed it down to 360 and Charles because of the many similarities but went with Charles for Checking. I'm still deciding on savings. 

I didn't want to jump through hoops to apply for 5 different debit cards just to get 5% or sign up for a bank called redneck. Banking should be enjoyable, easy to join, and easy to maintain. Without the monthly debit requirements most high interest checking accounts have. Charles is the exception and I was willing to have my credit pulled, and hard. 

I'm was thinking of opening an account with DollarSavingsdirect because of 1.8%. Some people have good and bad experiences with DSD. Mostly about transfers and there's a lot of talk about their rates not being consistent so no. 

Another option I was thinking about was Discover for the 1% Cashback and 1.5% on their savings. Although it be convenient to have both checking/savings in one place Discovery isn't as widely accepted and the 1% cash back is eh. 

I'm keeping my 0. 10% CU Savings with my awesome CU 7.9% CC. I'll update the list in case I forgot anything.

personalfinance,Pay off credit card or hold on to savings?,"Background: I'm early 30s, single, rent, and make about $45k/year before taxes. I did some contracting work overseas for a few years, and managed to put about $15k in savings. I have student loans ($450/month) plus about $5k in credit card debt (I was in the hospital last year and couldn't work).

Question: Does it make sense to just pay off the credit card debt now using my savings and lose almost 1/3 of those savings? Or just keep paying it down monthly (about $1000-$1500/month, but I put everything on my credit card so I'm also spending about $500/month). My interest rate is 17.24%. 

Or is there some other option that I'm not considering? I tried to do one of those ""interest free credit cards"" and transfer the balance, only to be told that I can't transfer this balance (Chase Bank credit card). 

Sorry for what is probably a dumb question. This is the first time I've had so much debt, and while I know it's not nearly as much as some people in PF I just don't want to let it get out of control.",finance
gaming,How the Hunger System works in Worthy Stories?,"Recently I ran a test open to the public and got several feedbacks. The main concern was the clarity of the Stamina system. So I made this article explaining about this system that is very important for the gameplay of Worthy:
http://farthurstudios.com/en/001-worthy-stories-mechanics-1/

But I'm not here to get views. So, here's the full article:

The first time I thought about Worthy Stories (when he still had no name, inclusive), the core of the idea was: I will make the project to train my skills, so I’ll do something simple I can do in a month. That was in November 2017. I can say that there were two causes for this tremendous failure in my goal: make a personalized art costs much more time than I ever thought; implementing differentiated mechanics is hard too, but control your ideas is much more.

There is a phrase from Antoine De Saint Exupery (according to Google sources) that says “The Designer knows that he has achieved perfection, not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.” That is, simple is best. So I decided to first define the scope of the project, how should it looks like (what the player should experience while playing, what skills will be necessary, etc.), and from this concept I took some time polishing the project, until reaching a minimum number of mechanics (and resources) that allow the game to have the face that I would like without requiring too much time in development. Whoever is a developer knows what I’m talking about.

The main idea of the game is described on the Homepage. But if it’s not clear enough: it’s an adventure RPG, where you follow the story of the protagonists, especially four of them, helping them make decisions that will directly influence how they will be seen by people (NPCs). Of course there is a major problem, but over time you will see that, just like in real life, there is not just one problem to solve.

In this poverty-stricken environment, the first difficulty facing the four orphans is: what are we going to eat today? It’s a simple question, which I thought would be a good aspect of the game, since that would be a constant question in my mind if I were in their situation.

So the first mechanic I developed was the Hunger system, or Stamina.

Making the Right Questions
The first question to be answered was “How Hunger will affect them in combat?” Basing on the real life, if a normal people feels hungry he will be weakened, being dizzy or can even faint.  And on the other hand, well-fed people perform their tasks with 100% energy. How to implement this to the game in a way that is challenging and rewarding at the same time?

First, by adding a hunger indicator, in this case the Stamina Bar. Whenever you feed, it regenerates up to a maximum of 100. If a character has Stamina full, he will fight with 100% of his forces, that is quite logical. But if he’s got 80% of his full stamina, it doesn’t seem reasonable for him to fight at 80% of his full strengh. A person can maintain 100% even after several hours without eating. So, the strenght reduction will only start when the Stamina is under 40%.

When you reach this point, the reductions will be drastic in Attack, Defense, Magic Strengh, Agility and Accuracy. So it is important to always have extra food to keep your Stamina above at least 40%. But if you are careless and run out of food, you can still fight with Stamina below 40%, but be wary: you’ll take more damage, deal less damage, and the more you strive the more weak you will get. Be smart by buying as much time as you can while feeding those who will have the strength to carry you out of this mess.

Second question: “How will hunger interfere with the regeneration of the character?”. Most games of this genre have potions or spells that simply heal a lot of HP, saving your character from being knocked out. But I must remind you that they are children and don’t have money to buy such items, nor can they cast spells like this (at least not at the beginning). How will they regenerate theirselves?

The Hunger system came in handy to solve this problem. Again based on real life, a well nourished person can recover more easily. So if the character’s Stamina Bar is healthy he will regenerate HP from time to time. The opposite is also true: malnourished people die slowly. So if the Stamina Bar is low it stops regenerating, and if it is too low it loses HP. I found reasonable to apply this rule also to MP.

These are the basic rules. From them, we were able to define the points to close the system:

Performing an action in combat, such as attacking or using a skill, consumes Stamina points, depending on the skill. The default is 1, except for the defensive stance “Guard”, which doesn’t consume Stamina.
The Stamina Bar is always falling at fixed intervals. In this way, while you perform tasks you will feel hunger even if you do not get into combat. Stay alert.
People’s metabolism interferes both in how often they feel hungry and in how they regenerate. Therefore, each character will have its own pace of regeneration and degeneration of the Stamina Bar. The biotype of the character already says a lot, but if you want to pay attention, you will see which ones have fast metabolism and which ones do not. We will explain shortly the advantages and disadvantages of each.
Everyone has favorite foods. Why not the characters too? So be aware: if a character has a Stamina regen above average with certain food, this is a good opportunity to save a lot of money.

Feedbacks e Updates
When I made the first public test available, I received several feedbacks from the same thing: the character collapsed without the player noticing. So I noticed that this system was not really clear, especially since the Stamina Bar is visible only in the Pause menu. Therefore, we are already implementing the following changes:

We’ll add a HUD to show clear stamina indicators for each character, highlighting those who are at critical levels.
The NPC Descartes already gives a good explanation on this system, but perhaps it is worth adding this to the pause menu? We’re studying the case.
Any feedback is always welcome, so we can correct grotesque mistakes that we, blind developers, can not see: D.

Worthy Stories will be released on Steam for Windows and Mac. We don’t have a release date yet, but all updates will be posted here, and on our networks.

personalfinance,"Planning to buy a home, but have a previous mortgage with my family.","We got married last summer and now look to start a family soon. Our next step is to look into housing    options. One option is to buy. The only problem is my parents, siblings, and I decided to purchase a home 10 years ago with a 30yr mortgage. 2015 We refinanced with a lower interest rate and moved to a 15yr fixed rate. 

Now that my wife and I want to get a place of our own would it be close to impossible for us to to get a home together?  How hard would it be get out of my first mortgage?

personalfinance,"23 and about to start a full time job making $70k. Pay down loans aggressively, or save for a house?","My fiancee and I are considering whether to pay down her medical school loans or save for a down payment on a home. Some much needed background information:

I'm 23, about to graduate and start a job in June making $70k a year. I have no debt, have about $7500 in a 401k from a previous workplace, and will be able to save about $1450 a month after all of our monthly expenses are accounted for. 

I'll be contributing 25% to my 401k. This will put my annual 401k contributions at about $17250. I'm planning on saving very aggressively for the next 5-10 years since early 20s are so important for retirement savings.

For the next 2 years I'll be living with my parents in the city where my job is located. My fiancee will be living in another city about an hour away in an apartment I pay for. The $1450 a month ""excess"" accounts for these costs as well as insurance, gas, groceries, entertainment, utilities, etc.

My fiancee is 23, and is about to finish her second year of medical school. Currently she has no debt (due to her father paying for the first 2 years of medical school), but she expects to take out approximately $80k for the final 2 years. These loans currently carry an interest rate of 6%.

In 2 years, she'll be making about $55k during residency, putting our combined income around $125k (neglecting raises). 6 years later she'll be making about $200k after she has completed her residency and fellowship.

We really would like to be signing on a house after she completed medical school in 2 years. We're looking at around $150-200k homes, and I'll be able to to have saved about $35k for a down payment **if I don't pay anything toward her loans for the next 2 years.** We would then have her entire $55k salary (minus 401k contributions and taxes) to pay her loans down extremely aggressively. Our estimated payoff is approximately 45 months after she starts making payments. 

Is it a better idea to take the down payment on the house and apply it toward the loans to pay them off even more aggressively, or do I have a pretty solid plan laid out? Any other alternatives? Please tell me what you think, Reddit!",finance

**UPDATED WITH ANNUAL EXPENSES**
Not gonna lie- Our budget could be tightened up in a MAJOR way since we are not super budget conscious people. Given the general vibe of this board, these numbers will probably make some of you cringe, but here are our actual 2017 numbers: 

Total Money In: $160k

* Total Household Expenses: $89,000
* $33,000-Total Savings
* $15,000-Business Expenses and Taxes (self-employed so we itemize)
* $22,000-One time Home Upgrades (finished basement and attic spaces, new roof) 

Our income will drop to about $125k-$130k after this year because I was receiving a payout from a partnership in a business but that ended last year. 

Sorry this is such a convoluted explanation but it's what our finances currently look like so I'm trying to be as open as possible. 

Thanks so much for all your input and advice thus far.  Based on these numbers we are NOWHERE NEAR being FIRE, but I feel that if we tightened our budget quite a bit we could easily get our annual spending down to about $75,000, which would put us a lot closer to the goal. 

$1.8million seems doable in the next 15-20 years if we tighten the budget, continue saving and investing wisely at a good rate. 

Thanks again for all your help!

I took the home office deduction this year worth a few thousand (TurboTax walked me through it- internet, phone, a certain square footage of our home, etc.) 

We owed about $2000 in federal taxes this year, but DH has adjusted his withholdings, and so much has changed in the tax code that I don't feel I can make any inferences for next year.

I was offered a salary position for $47k at this same company, and would become a W2 employee. I can basically decide what I want to do- health insurance is not of interest to me (DH's plan is ideal for us because of the HSA, etc.) I know some suggest becoming an LLC or something to pay less taxes under Trump's tax plan, but I don't know the specifics.

Forgive me if this is wrong place for some of my questions but I decided to lump the together since they are all related. I’d like to finish this preface by acknowledging my younger self was a stupid idiot and did not make educated financial decisions.

Back story: 

Around the turn of the century, I had just graduated high school, was accepted to my first choice school (a local state university about an hours drive north of home), received Hope scholarship, and had a plan. I was gonna go to college for computer engineering and figure it out along the way. First mistake. First semester went well, I kept Hope, 3.2 gpa, and got an internship working with a local systems installer. While working mornings and studying evenings, my mental health quickly began to deteriorate as I saw the zombies surround me. Lifeless shells completing tasks all day to go home and play video games to forget the time they’ve wasted. Being surrounded by these depressing souls brought me down, as well as my gpa, leading me to lose Hope. School was now my financial burden, so I took out a private student loan to help complete my education.  By the fourth semester of school I was completely broken, I couldn’t sleep, didn’t want to eat, didn’t go out... then one night, in a stunning turn of events, the police showed up at my campus apartment claim someone reported the smell of marijuana in the hall. ‘Its a college campus, the whole dorm reeks of reefer!’ I exclaimed to the officer, and after keeping them outside for 15 mins, the RA shows up and informs me that they’re allowed to come in, regardless of my objections since it was campus property. After some hard talking to, searches of the common area and bed room, they find some beer bottles in common area, and having not found any marijuana, they pinned minor in possession of alcohol on me (even though it wasn’t actually mine and two of my roommates were of age) and within a week I was evicted and placed on academic probation. And with that I was defeated. Lawyers, probation, and the stress ruined me. I left my internship and went back to my previous job as a school photographer. And stayed afloat for a year or two, I don’t really remember; I worked security at a nightclub and moonlit as a bartender some weekends. Completely ignoring my financial obligations, I ended up defaulting on my student loans. The calls and letters never stopped until I got on a cruise ship and traveled the world two years. (I’m sure the calls continued but being on a remote island in southern pacific, the reception was a little shotty). But through my travels I learned a lot, become a manager after one contract, and meet my future wife, who I followed to Thailand, and proposed to at beach during the sunset with a $100 tanzanite and sliver ring. Fast forward a year and we’re back in the USA, building a future together. 

Issue I: School

Yep, I’m an idiot, I defaulted on student loan but am currently in a forgiveness program that will finish up in September 2018 at which point I can renegotiate the terms and hopefully get that settled. I wonder what my options for consolidation or whatever might be after I finish the forgiveness plan. Total debts are in three loans of 3k, 5k, and 9k. 

I recently have returned to school, albeit with the blessing of my fathers checkbook this time. Thankfully my credits transferred in and I am about to complete my sophomore level classes this fall, but the checks are not unlimited and I’ll need to be looking at scholarship options for my senior year, however I’ve already started employment with school as a part time video production assistant and I’m working towards my goal of becoming a flight instructor to continue my education with master degree. (Which the school will pay for if i work for them full time)

Issue II: IRA

During my tour as a elementary and middle school photographer, I participated in my company’s employee stock ownership program, and accumulated a holding of just over 4k. However, recently this company was bought and my holdings were transferred to IRA with ‘principal bank’. I currently have a Roth IRA with my credit union, but being a young, dumb kid in rough times, I drained that one of all but $100 a few years back. So now I have two IRAs and I’m wondering what is the best place for this money?

Issue III: Personal Business

This post was prompted by a post submitted a few days ago detailing an employee who was added to a personal account of their employer and their credit was negatively affected. My wife and I operate a business buying luxury goods (coach, Kate spade, Nike, Gucci, Burberry) and selling online overseas. In January 2017, it was a hobby running $3000 in revenue a month, but by October 2017, we were spending $20,000 a month and when my father saw the credit card bills, he had a mini heart attack. Since then I’ve been trying to ween ourselves off his 2 high limit cards onto my own personal cards with $1000-5000 limits. Needless to say, the high utilization and new cards has wrecked my already shitty credit score down to a low 600. We need to solidify the business (I’ve already established a federal tax ID and prepared last years taxes) I want to work with a bank, but with my complete lack of knowledge, I just have a feeling I’m going to get bent over barrel by any bank I go to. We don’t need loans, we just need an account to receive our collections from Overseas and lines of credit to make larger purchases (we want to get into watches and more expensive shoes but with limits of $1000, we’d be able to buy one pair of shoes at time when we’re currently shipping 90lbs of shoes and purses every other day....) 

TL;DR got kicked out of school, defaulted on my private student loans, drained my savings and IRA account to get out of trouble and survive for a few years. Now I’m married and we’re building a business with a first year revenue of ~$120,000 on personal credit cards (paid off weekly), my ESOP program was paid out to a holding IRA when my pervious employer was recently bought out, and I’m studying to be a pilot at a stupidly expensive university with enough money set aside for two out of three years.",finance

personalfinance,How to pay for school,"Hello everybody. I’m 26 years old and trying to go back to school to advance my career. Right now I work in the tax department of a nationwide payroll company making around $40k. I am married and my wife cannot work due to health issues. I am looking to go back to school to get my accounting degree so I can advance either within my company or elsewhere. The thing is I’m terrified of taking out loans. I am currently debt free and have been so for the last 3-4 years. I have found a school that is very cheap compared to others ($6000-7000 yearly). I have filled out the FAFSA and I make too much money to be given any kind of federal grant. I was wondering if anyone here knew of any other means to help pay for schooling that I haven’t really thought about.

personalfinance,Is the hit to my credit score worth $500 bonus?,"I am able to open a business credit card with my bank for my sole proprietorship (reports under my personal SSN). I’m eligible for a $500 cash bonus by meeting certain charge requirements in the first 3 months. There’s also a 1.5% cash back reward which is higher than my current business credit card.

I’m not worried about interest rate, as I won’t carry a balance, though the first 12 months are interest free, if that’s relevant.

My only hesitation is the credit pull. I don’t have any inquiries in the past 2 years, my score is 815. It will probably knock it down about 5 points. Are 5 points worth $500? I feel like it is, but wanted some other perspectives.

personalfinance,"How do you ""shop"" for a mortgage? And general process for buying a house?","My wife and I are looking to buy our first house. We are looking to purchase around the end of June as that is when we should have 20% saved up for a down payment. We have been working with a real estate agent and looking at a few houses to get an idea of what we are wanting in a house.

The company that our real estate agent works for has a financing division that is a completely different entity from the real estate side. We spoke with one of the financing reps back in November or December to try to get a little guidance. We gave him some of our financial information and he gave us an estimate of the rate he could get us; he didn't run our credit though. He said that was our pre-qualification but not pre-approval.

I guess my question would be, how do we go about shopping for a mortgage? Do you typically need to schedule an appointment with a lender to talk about obtaining a mortgage? How do we find a reputable lender? Is interest rate the only thing to look for when getting a mortgage?

I don't want to default to our real estate company's financing just because we are working with one of the real estate agents, but rather choose them if they can give us the best mortgage option. I would like to talk with multiple lenders to see what rates we can get, but I don't want to get a bunch of hard credit pulls and kill our credit scores. 

I realize that these may be stupid or simple questions but we are completely ignorant and naive when it comes to buying a house.",finance
personalfinance,About to start in the real world and need to help planning,"Hi PF, this is a throwaway account. I am looking for advice on how to “begin” my life. Several medical events (MRIs, Visits, and one surgery), have left me with about $5,000 worth of expenses with ~$3,000 in credit card debt and ~$2,000 owed to care providers. Currently, I owe $5,817.4 in credit card expenses at varying rates, $1,895.06 in medical debt, and $27,881.50 in federal loans with the expectation of paying back a $9,000 ParentPLUS loan that my mom took out for me to attend college. My total liabilities equal $44,5933.96. Below is a detailed summary of these expenses.

**CREDIT**  
- Discover: 816.52 @ 14.24% ($35.00/mo)  
- Capital1: 1,499.62 @ 26.15% ($48.00/mo)  
- WellsFargo: 2,490.20 @ 25.62% ($55.00/mo)  
- Chase: 1,011.06 @ 24.24% ($31.00/mo)  

**STUDENT LOANS (Currently making no payments)**  
- Federal: 27,881.50 @ 4.66%  
- PlusLoan: 9,000.00 @ 6.50%  

**MEDICAL (No Interest Charged; minimum payments $25/ea)**  
- Medical1: 1,458.63  
- Medical2: 436.43  

There are several sub/unsub loans with interested rates from 3.56-4.66%, so I just went with highest.
My mom owns this loan but I am expected to pay it.

I have to take a few summer classes in order to graduate and will have to take out a loan of around ~$3,000 to afford tuition. I currently work at the school I attend and make anywhere between 300-600 a month. This is quickly eaten up by the payments above ($216/mo) followed by gas and food expenses. I have no real monthly expenses aside from the above and $100 payment to my parents for my cell phone and car insurance. Currently, I have $1,569.63 in the bank. I have no credit limit available on any of my 4 cards.

Thankfully, I am graduating with a job! I will make $58,000 starting out. After 1 year of employment, I expect to be at or over $60,000. The area I will be living in is low cost of living and I will be splitting first year expenses with a buddy. For reference, I’ve estimated that once all my expenses have been covered, I should have between $1,000-1,500 available to pay towards loans, however, I was planning of paying no more than $500 as I have a goal of saving $20,000 in my first 2 years of working.

My goal is to be financially independent within the next 2- 5 years. I am here to ask you how I can best reach that goal. My dad has offered to co-sign on a personal loan up to $10,000. The interest rate on this loan would be between 6-8%. The purpose of this loan would be to wipe out the $7,712.46 owed in credit and medical debt, and to cover my summer tuition. Should I accept this loan? Should I invest into 401k, Roth, stock or bonds during my first working years or focus on my loans? I would like to take my $20,000 2-year savings amount and invest it into a house or business venture. Does doing so make sense?

I am not entirely sure what the best questions are to ask. What I do know is that I am in the hole. Man, I owe a lot of money. It sucks! I am currently 24 and only getting older, ideally, I would like to clear out this debt by the time I am 30. What would advice would you give to your children or friends?",finance
personalfinance,Please Help Me [18] Get My Mother [58] Out Of Debt And Help With Her Gambling Problem,"Reddit, I'm in a slightly overwhelming situation currently and I'm asking for advice and insight on what to do. To give some background information I'll start by saying that my mother has always been very poor with her finances. She filed for bankruptcy about 8 years ago and since her mother died she's been struggling with a gambling addiction. 

My mother has a very good paying job and makes around 75k-80k a year now, however she moved to San Diego and she was unemployed for about 3 months and I guess she had to fall behind in a lot of her payments and dip into her savings and 401k.  This really caused her to fall into a void of spending on her credit card and also spending whatever money she did have by going to the casino and gambling a lot of it away. 

Part of her gambling problem, I feel has come from her living situation. She lives with her brother and his wife and she absolutely hates it. Her brother and his wife are constantly fighting, theres so much tension in the house, and my mom feels like her brother's wife is always taking her ill feelings out on her. So my mom works a lot as a dialysis nurse (like 7am to 9pm 4-5 days a week) or if she's not working she decides to go to the casino because it's her only pleasure. She can't garden, have a pet, or really cook (which are things that give her pleasure) in the place she's living now so she turns to the casino to give her a sense of purpose. 

Now for the financial issue that my mom and I have sat down and agreed to try and fix. Bi-weekly my mom gets paid around $2500 - $3000. However on her most recent paycheck, which was about $2600, she spent around $1300 at the casino. Here are her monthly necessities which for some she hasn't paid yet because she spent a majority of her money at the casino.

-$1000 a month rent for living with her brother

-$800 a month for her car (Not sure why it's that much, she still owes $21,000 on it too)

-$450 a month for my brother's car. My brother is 28 and works 2 jobs but somehow he can barely even afford to pay $200 a month to my mom to help pay for his car. It's really frustrating.

-$350 phone bill. My mom, me, and my brother are on this phone bill. I've told my mom that I'll pay for my own phone and phone service to help take off some financial burden for her and to take responsibility for my own things.

-$100 a month for car insurance.

-$120 gas for car

-$100 to $120 for groceries

All of these payments put my mom at around $2800 to $3000 a month. This month is a real struggle since my mom lost a lot of money and can't even pay rent to her brother now. Her checking account is also overdrawn $1200. 

In terms of loans/debt she has:

-Car loan, interest rate 12.74%, balance $21,685

-Personal loan (she can't even remember what this loan is for, she thinks it might've been for my brother's school), interest rate 15.4%, balance $4749

-Credit card, interest rate 11%, balance $2002

-Personal line of credit, interest 8.3%, balance $1499

-Money that she borrowed from a friend to go to the casino, balance $3000

-She also has a couple other loans of $700, $800

I work 2 jobs and live on my own. Im currently not in school, Im just taking a gap semester, working, saving up, and doing a bit of traveling. Im better at saving money and budgeting than my mom so thats why she's looked to me for help. Originally, I wanted to distance myself from her because she is a falling knife when it comes to money, but I feel like I do need to help her with this as her daughter.

I'm not too sure where to start to help her. She's given me her credit and debit cards so she can't take money out to go to the casino. I have access to her bank account and can see when her checks get deposited, so she's entrusted me to give her some spending money/cash to pay for rent/groceries/gas once a week, and then from online I can decided where to allocate money to in terms of her car payments and other debt. 

My first step is to get her help with her gambling problem, we've agreed to go to meetings and try to get her out of the house. I've also been looking at trying to get her to move out of that house since she is so depressed and trapped there. However I'm not sure what to do about her overdrawn account and paying her other debts. The next time she gets paid is March 16th and obviously a lot from her paycheck is going to go straight to the overdrawn. From there I'm not too sure what to do. The next thing I can think of is just try and divide up whatever money she has left to her late expenses and get her caught up, get some money to her savings, and just try to get her credit card debt down and pay off some of the loans she has.

Sorry if this was a lot, I just feel like in over my head but I know my mom needs help. Any clarity would be helpful, I'm not too sure of the direction I should go with this problem.

Tl;Dr: My mom has a gambling problem and is in $30,000 of debt, her checking account is overdrawn $1200, she's given me her credit/debit cards and bank account information and has entrusted me to help her save money and get out of debt. Not sure the right direction to go in.",finance

personalfinance,What is the best way to pay off this credit card?,"I will be the first to admit that I've made some mistakes (like most do) when it comes to personal finance in my early twenties. I possess a credit card with some debt on it that I feel that the sooner I pay this card off the bigger relief I'll have and will allow me to start getting ahead in other areas financially. I am struggling with the best way to go about paying this card off which leads me here. Any advice would be appreciated.

I currently have a $666.08 balance on the card with a 26.15% APR. My minimum payments are $25.00 each month with the next one coming up on the 14th.

My income is roughly $1600 monthly and I get paid bi-weekly.
My expenses at this moment look like this:

Rent - $425
Phone - $70
Car Payment - $315
Credit Card - Min. $25
Car Insurance - $211
Gym - $26
iTunes - $4.99

I'm in the process of finishing up a specific IT certification at work that would allow me to make more money but for now, with my current income, I know I am getting ripped apart with this interest rate and feel as if I've just been churning my wheels with this debt.

financialindependence,What's your story that led you to FI?,"Here's mine:

Ever since my first job as a busser when I was 16 at a local Italian restaurant I've been saying ""Man, I can't wait till I retire"". Most of my co-workers, friends and family thought I was joking and just brushed it off with ""Ha, you've got a while to go kid"". At the time I was only halfway saying it ironically, but it was based on truth - a desire to not want to do crap I didn't want to do.

Goofy Side note: I would be paid nightly in crumpled up $1 and $5 bills which I would take home and iron out so it wasn't a pain in the bank teller's butt.

Anyhow, as I went through high school and college, I switched jobs a couple times, but always kinda had the same attitude - can't wait to retire - same responses from coworkers - was pretty good at saving and a novice at investing at this point. Didn't really have any goals with the money, but at least it wasn't being thrown away.

Our first day of college, our professor had us stand up and rattle off a goal we had. I randomly said ""to retire by the time I'm 30"". She literally scoffed and said ""well, you better not have any kids"". Even though I was (mostly) joking, the way she said that really kinda pissed me off and only strengthened my resolve.

One Christmas, i guess I was 19, my sister's fiance gifted me a copy of Rich Dad Poor Dad, which I view as the turning point in my financial life. It gave me a purpose of something to work towards. I know it's relatively shallow, but for introductory purposes, it fits the bill.

So now I'm saving more and investing more, but still haven't been properly introduced to FI.

A few years go on where not much new happens until I graduate from college and get my first job. On day 1, I joked with my mentor about retirement and he ended up sharing MMM with me and since then, I've had FI on my mind as a primary goal.

Anyway, that's a little of my story on how I learned about FI - eager to hear yours.

personalfinance,Buying New Chevy Volt,"Background - 24, making $70k per year, 780 credit score, 15% + 5% match into Roth 401k, well funded emergency fund

I'm strongly considering a brand new off the lot Chevy Volt as my next car. I know the arguments for and against new cars, primarily depreciation, and for me I tend to keep cars for a long time. I'd be replacing an unreliable German sedan that I've had since 2011, and have put nearly 100k miles on. It's worth maybe $2500 - $3000 and is generally a POS inside and out. I still live at home, and commute via public transit/work from home so while I don't really need a new car, it would be shared among family members who have a much longer commute than I do and drive similarly old/inefficient vehicles.

Now, the Volt is not exactly my first choice as a young male but I'm pragmatic and for that reason it's an appealing choice one for a number of reasons (50+ miles electric range, 350+miles with the gasoline engine, hatchback so it's relatively practical, can use the HOV lane with a single occupant). The model I want is the lower end model with a few options, so it would be around $36k without dealer incentives. The reason I'm even looking new and not CPO is because of various credits, the Federal tax credit, State/Local credits add up to $9000 back in my pocket at the end of the day, which makes a brand new car about the same prices as a CPO model, or anything in my local Craigslist.

Bitcoin,Legality of Bitcoins in Belgium,"Belgium government bureaucrats from The National Bank of Belgium (NBB) and the Belgian Financial Services &amp; Markets Authority (FSMA), which are responsible for forming country's financial politics, have more than once expressed their strong disapproval of all crypto-currencies, which fall outside of their own strict oversight.

They are joined by the Federal Public Service Justice head, who, after two cases of Bitcoin seizures had been revealed to the public by local press, called to strengthening of governmental control over all forms of digital money.

Such hostile predisposition of Belgian finance and legal gatekeepers towards crypto leaves little doubt that, although there are not yet specific regulations regarding digital money in Belgium, it's just a question of time before Belgium lawmakers lay their heavy hands on Belgium fledgling crypto-community.

personalfinance,I need help getting money back.,"In October 2015 my checks started getting garnished because of a student loan I failed to pay. I got some cash and settled that debt however the money that was garnished was supposed to be returned to me and I never got the checks. The agreement was I would receive a check for each time I was garnished which totaled to about $300 in 3 checks. All of 2016 I would call and ask about my checks, supposedly they were mailed to me but never cashed. After a while I got tired of calling and going through the process of confirming mailing address and all that crap that I just figured that money was lost for good. 

2017 I had to pay $680 to the state and $230 to the feds for my taxes. I fucked up by paying the $680 amount to the $230 balance when I called to sort that out I was told the money would be applied back to the state balance and not to worry about it. When I called the state to check on that they said that my balance was the same, I called the feds back and was told I would receive a check for the amount I overpaid. The check never came in and I just got a letter saying I never paid my State taxes and that I have a balance of $711 now.

This varies depending on how much I eat out, etc. I do not follow a budget although I probably should.

I want to put almost everything away to my loans but I'm not sure if thats the right move. My thinking was I could save about $1600 in interest over the remainder of the 5 years I have on the loans. The $250 I normally spend on monthly payments could be added to my savings to replenish what I've spent. In just over a year I'd be back to where I was. Alternatively I can just knock out individual loans over some months and see how things go.

I'm not really expecting to have big expenses in the near future like a wedding or buying a house. I would be exposed without a safety net for a bit though. I wanted to get some feedback on this route. Anything I should look at or ask myself before doing something like this?

personalfinance,Relative is trying to claim me as a dependent when I provided my own support (paid rent/own bills and insurance) and have income.,"I was wondering if my aunt and uncle are able to claim me as a dependent and how that would affect my own refund. I was renting a room out of their home in 2017, but moved out in January this year. I'm 23, but I'm not a student and have provided my own support for the entire year that I lived with them. I also pay my own bills and insurance.

I received a 1099 form for taking a death distribution (no early withdrawal penalty) from the IRA I inherited from my mother. This would be my only income for the 2017 tax year. 

I had 10% of that amount withheld (for both federal and state taxes) when I made the distribution, and from my own calculations, I understand that I'll be receiving a tax refund based on how much I will be paying in taxes this year on top of the withheld amount.

If this would be my only taxable income for this tax season (let's say about 60k), how would my refund be affected if my aunt and uncle claimed me as a dependent on their taxes (if they even could)? What would they even be gaining by claiming me as a dependent?",finance

CryptoCurrency,I made a site where everyone can learn about major cryptocurrencies,"TL;DR: Fed up with price discussions. Made an educational site. For now mostly cryptocurrency articles. Tech explainers and interviews incoming.  

Here’s the link: https://longcaller.com  
 
Hi. About 1 year ago I started to read about cryptocurrencies. First Bitcoin, then Ethereum, then other alts.  

But after a few months, I realized that most of the content on Reddit focused on price. Shilling, pump&amp;dump, questions like “What’s the next Bitcoin? What’s the next Ethereum?” And it’s not only on Reddit, it’s everywhere. Bitcoin talk, telegram chats, twitter.  

I don’t have a problem with price discussions. If people need it, let it be. But maybe at least focus on long-term gains?

After investing in a bunch of ICOs, I came to the conclusion that it’s more like a gambling. I don’t believe that you can spot the next x1000 when you see it before the pump. And even though I doubled my Ethereum investment, I decided to not invest into ICOs anymore.

But it’s not only about ICO. I don’t believe that it’s generally possible to spot x100-like gains. For me, it’s luck. I know that many people went into Ethereum, RaiBlocks, etc before they really hit, but there are also a lot of people who invested in now dead coins. Survivorship bias FTW.

So I switched to more stable coins, like Litecoin, Monero, and others. But I wanted to know: is the coin in top 10 because of tech and adoption or it just randomly went there, even though there’s nothing behind it? Is the coin going to stay in top 10 in the next 2 or 3 years? Am I safe to invest into that coin?

I did my research. To be honest, I feel that I only started and still need to do 99% of research. But I also feel that I am much more confident now, and make fewer mistakes.

I also decided that other people might follow similar goals. That’s why I created Longcaller. Here I publish reviews of coins like Monero or Dash. I try to research all primary sources available to make a short and easy-to-understand review.

You may see my other posts as I already posted some of the articles here on Reddit. In fact, Reddit is the biggest drive of traffic for me right now, bringing about 50% visitors to the site.
In future, I want to write more articles about cryptocurrencies, blockchain, and smart contracts. I would also like to make interviews with devs and founders.

That’s the story! Would like to hear your opinion. Oh, and I also launched on Product Hunt today. For those who care, here’s the link: https://www.producthunt.com/posts/longcaller",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,"Currently in college, but don't know whether to save the $2000 my mom gave me and continue taking loans, pay off some old loans, or take less loans and factor $2000 into budget","(I also posted this in r/student loans)

My mom surprised me with a $2000 gift in cash. However, since I've been putting myself through college (with the exception of occasional hundred dollar Christmas or birthday money), I've been taking out federal student loans. I don't quite know what to do with this $2000. I have a loan for $3400 that is unsubsidized, $3000 subsidized, $994 subsidized, and $666 subsidized. My question is how should I use this $2000? What is my priority? Should it be to pay off these loans right now? Should it be saved to after college, when my payments are no longer deferred? Should I use that money to reduce loan amounts for next year?

I'm also working part time for minimum wage. Right now, those wages are going to fund my study abroad. But, once I meet that goal, I'll have an additional ~500 per month, on top of the disbursement from student loans and financial aid (I didn't anticipate getting a job when I took the loans). Should I sit on some percentage of that money so that once I graduate, I have a buffer to throw money at mandatory payments? If so, how much shpuld I save? Or should I just throw Ll my money at loans?

So many questions!",finance

personalfinance,Hoping for some credit and mortgage advice!,"A little background:
My wife and I made so questionable credit decisions when we were both kicked out of our respective parents houses. Our credits scores up until about year ago were in the low 500s. (They’re now in the low-to-mid 600s) We were able to finance a new car back in 2012 (We desperately needed a vehicle due to mine breaking down.) We also recently financed another car in February of 2017 (we needed a second car for both of us to get to our jobs. So we have one car note about two years from being paid off and another fresh car note with both interest rates in the double digits. (I know it’s terrible but we really needed the car in both situations.)

But now onto my main question. We’ve gotten one secured credit card with a $300 limit and that eventually let us get a regular credit card with a $400 limit. We don’t use them for much more than gas or emergencies and always make our payments for the credit cards and car loans on time. The older car loan has a large number of late payments on it from 2+ years ago when things were financially tight for us but has been current on payments for a year now. My wife and I have a few items in collections totally less than 2k each, though she does have a government student loan in collections due to having to drop out. We are looking into how to find out how to make payments on this collection amount with the department of Education. 

We want to buy our first home when our apartment lease ends in September. 

We have looked at a community near us that is being built and sold by a single builder, LGI, just as a kind of starting point. They pulled just one of our credit scores , Experian, and it came out with both of us having a credit score around 630 and 635. But told us that we don’t qualify for any loan because our income doesn’t qualify for the mortgage payment which would be about $1400, and that we need to get that student loan out of collections. They say that our income would only qualify us for a $1300 mortgage payment. 

We are ideally looking for a $0 down home loan, and we live in Houston, Tx. Any help or advice would be GREATLY appreciated. This is my first post here so if I left anything out please let me know. 

Edit: I really appreciate the honesty guys but just saying you’re not ready, oh just go save $30k, or you’re hemorrhaging money doesn’t really help that much. Could someone maybe suggest a good place to start to get one or both of my cars financed without getting my credit run 20 times? Also would it be possible to refinance both the vehicles together into one loan and one monthly payment? Any kind of starting place for this process would be appreciated because my wife and I want to have a home sooner rather than later. I know having a large savings cushion is a highly recommended thing but to be honest I really don’t know a lot of people that have $15k+ just sitting around in a savings account. We know people in much worse situations than us financially that were already able to get a home.",finance

personalfinance,Need help with a credit decision.,"First, you guys have been extremely helpful as I've read through this sub. Recently, thanks to this sub in large part, it's come to my attention that I'm paying a pretty high interest rate on my auto loan and my personal loan.

 My question, hopefully, isn't very complicated. I have a loan with around $6,300 left until it's finished. My interest is 12.76% on said loan. My credit has significantly increased since I got this loan so I can now get better interest rates. Let's say 8.5% or so.

 Should I get a new loan for 6.3k with the lower interest rate, lower payment but 8 month longer payoff date? 

To make this a bit more complicated, I have to refinance my home at the beginning of next year to remove my ex from the mortgage and I want the best rate I can get when I do it. Getting the new loan to cover the old one will pay off an older account and give me a hard inquiry which will likely drop my score. Am I correct in thinking this or am I completely off course? 

Next, my auto loan is at 6% but if I refinance it it will add 6 months to the life of the loan but reduce interest by 2-3%. Again, hard inquiry, older account going. 

I fully intend to pay off both of these loans as early as possible, starting with the personal loan. I'm just now really getting my finances in order like I should have years ago so I'm not 100% sure when that will be yet. 

Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,4th year medical student needs help understanding loan repayment options and how to prepare,"Hello personalfinance,


I am a 4th year medical student (US med school) graduating this upcoming June.  Throughout medical school, I was primarily dependent on loans for tuition and cost of living (estimated at about 50k/year total).  All loans I have are federal, and have no undergraduate debt.  


I haven't had a job or filed taxes since starting medical school, but a few recent grads have been telling me I should file taxes this year, showing $0.00 income.  They say this will benefit me if I opt for a 10 year, income-based repayment plan for my loans.  The benefit being that I will receive credit for a year of payment of $0.00.  


The other question I have is, my parents want to file taxes and list me as a dependent on their filings (they helped out occasionally during school).  If they do this, can I not file independently, even though I have no income and made no profit this year? 


My cousin says they can list me as a dependent while I file as an independent.  My dad's CPA believes this to not be possible.


I am not very knowledgeable about tax laws and finding ""loopholes"" in this particular area.


Any guidance to valuable resources or any advise would be greatly appreciated.


I am 26 years old and unmarried.  This past year, I have spent a lot of money for interviews (travel, hotels, etc).  Not sure if it is relevant, but thought I'd list it anyways.  If I left out any other important details, please let me know and I can edit the post.

personalfinance,What should I do about my finances when I move from the UK to other EU countries? (UK/Europe),"I am a EU citizen (Spain) currently halfway through a PhD in the UK and pondering future career paths. 

I'm working in biosciences and I know that many funding sources highly value researches that have worked in different countries. I have also had many postdoctoral researchers tell me that I should try to work in Germany or USA for at least a couple years. So, I'm currently thinking about which countries I would consider moving to (so far Germany, France, the Netherlands, or moving to a different UK city are my top choices) and also thinking about what these moves mean for my long term finances (because, although I'm fairly sure I want to leave the UK for at least 3-4 years for a postdoc, I'm also fairly sure I will eventually want to go back to Spain or the UK).

Now, I'm someone who loves saving money, making budgets, looking at her credit score and thinking about her investing options. I don't get paid a lot (just a normal PhD studentship - a little bit over £1,200 per month - plus some extra money I make from teaching), but I don't have any debt and I do save 20% of my income. I currently have over £5,000 pounds on two UK savings accounts with a nice interest rate - 5% for £2,500 and 2% for the rest; and I also have something around 700€ in my Spanish bank account (I don't get any interest from this bank, Spanish banks haven't been very generous this past decade...). My UK credit score (just in case this is relevant) is not that great because I a) Have only been in the UK for 4 years so I have a very short credit history; and b) I am a foreigner so I am not in the electoral roll. 

My questions: 

1) Do I need to worry about my credit scores? (I know every country has it's own credit measuring system, and whenever I move somewhere new it's going to look like I am an 18 year old with no credit history). 

2) Do I need to worry about government retirement pensions and what can I do about them? (I know you need to work over 30 years in most countries to get the full amount, and I'm fairly sure my career is going to be split in between 2-3 countries).

3) Should I move my Euros to the UK and lose money in the transaction, or do I leave them in my Spanish bank account knowing that they won't grow? 

Obviously I know that the economic landscape (and borders... Brexit...) might change a lot even in the short term, so it's all very subjective, but I'm trying to learn as much as possible about the current system so that I can make the best decisions. 

Thank you, and sorry for the long post. If you know of any websites with information for people in a similar situation/career paths please let me know too :)",finance

personalfinance,Refinancing FHA in HCOL area,"My husband and I bought our first home in Seattle in 2016. We actually got an decent deal on the purchase price and closed with 5% down on an FHA loan. (We had intended to do FHA limited 203k, but there were hiccups and we didn't do as much research into the change as we should have).

Now - with interest rates trending up and home prices in Seattle skyrocketing, we're at 78% LTV and want to get rid of MIP. For FHA, we're required to refinance to drop it.

Our initial lender has offered a conventional loan at 4.7% (our original interest rate was 3.375%) which essentially puts our monthly payments at the same amount. We would drop the MIP, but we'd be paying interest to our lender instead.

We have excellent credit, only debts are the mortgage and student loans, and I'm more than willing to sit tight and wait for a better scenario if it seems prudent. Also, we've traditionally itemized on MFJ, but it comes in lower than the new standard deduction for 2018.

Is there an upside to refinancing from FHA to conventional now? and if it's obvious and I'm not seeing it -- can someone ELI5?

I've been using Mint for a few years and am finally fed up with it. I think it's a great tool for some people but I'm having lots of issues with transaction classification, transactions disappearing, pending transaction management (tips included later but duplicate expense doesn't always get removed), cashflow analysis being hard, and accounts not syncing a lot of the time. 

A little about my finances: My wife and I have 15+ accounts (bank, paypal, venmo, savings, investments, mortage, debt, retirement, etc.) We classify our transactions across only a handful of categories based on I Will Teach You to Be Rich thinking. Most categories are predictable so we end up managing against the Guilt Free Spending line item for the majority of expenses. We have plenty of income and save quite a bit - we just have cashflow management issues sometimes when we keep all of the savings withdrawals automatic. We also pay ~$1k in work expenses/month for which we are reimbursed every 2 weeks to a month - that also messes with cash flow and credit card limits occasionally. 

Note: I have no issues paying for software to help with this. 

What I'm ideally looking for: 
1. Data accuracy between the accounts and the management tool - I have a huge problem with Mint on this issue. 
2. Ability to create custom transaction classifications
3. Preferably some ability to learn transaction classification over time, although I do this manually on Mint right now so it's not a deal breaker. 
4. Some sort of cashflow analysis function so I can make sure my savings withdrawals don't bounce.  
5. Easy management of transactions between accounts (mostly savings transfers and credit card payments) so it doesn't muck up my budgeting
6. Preferably a good (android) smartphone app

personalfinance,[Budgeting] I am a 20 year old student trying to develop a budget due to high tax return and high salary for upcoming internship,"Hello! I am a 20 year old college student studying Computer Science. I am trying to develop a monthly budget.
My current income is $132/ week, for a monthly income of approximately $528.
I am covered under my parent's health insurance, and my rent is covered as well, so my expenses for the most part are groceries, dog supplies (just food and treats mostly), and miscellaneous expenses such as coffee/eating out on dates/etc.
I created a budget on Mint for monthly expenses, but could use input on it.
The budget is as follows:

Coffe Shops: $50 (I know this is high but I am on campus usually at least 8 to 10 hours a day without the opportunity to go home and without a meal plan, so this covers coffee as well as food if I am really hungry)

Groceries: $200 (Also includes other necessities like toiletries, cleaning supplies for apartment, etc)

Other Food &amp; Dining: $40

Pet Food and Supplies: $60

Gas money and Mscellaneous car needs: $90

Lyfts and that sort of thing when needed: $40

Mscellaneous other or savings: $48

I could use insight on how to tighten my budget to save more. 

Additionally, in terms of long term budgeting, I am expecting a tax return of approximately $900. I also have a 10 week summer internship this summer (40 hours per week), paying $35/hour, with a $1000 signing bonus, 401k with employer matching up to 4% (if I contribute 6%), and paid sick days. This is a lot of money coming in and I could use long term budgeting advice on how to handle that money. I plan to keep the same budget for the summer as I use right now, with possibly more budgeted for gas as my commute will be 15 minutes each way.

I also have student loans to pay for college:

This is less than what we have been paying for our current apartment for the last year($1117.00 current rent).

$160,000 home with $8,000 down has a $1,262 payment.

$180,000 home with $9,000 down has a $1,411 payment.

I know we are married so our financials are technically together, but we want to apply for the mortgage under my name only, to ensure that we don’t over-spend on our home. Also, my wife’s credit score is not the best compared to mine, but she is working on it. For this reason, I am going to separate our financials below.

My financials:

Gross-$70,500/yr

Take home-$3,220/month

$45,000 401k-(25% contribution)

$20,000-E-fund(6 months after-tax income)

$11,425-house fund(enough for $7,000 down, and $4,425 for potential closing costs)

786 credit score, zero credit card debt

DEBT: $18,500 student loans @ 3.6%, paying the minimum of $240/month

Wife’s Financials:

Gross-$56,000

Take home-$2,925

$15,000 401k/457 (10% contribution)

$10,000-E-fund(3.5 months after-tax income)

$500-house fund

660 credit score, zero credit card debt

DEBT: $12,000 car loan @ 2%, $375/month payments

DEBT: $3,750 medical bills @ 0%, $250/month payment plan with hospital, no pre-payment discount was available

Using the 3x salary house rule, my gross income puts us in a $210,000 house, but my take home income puts us in a measly $116,000 house. What is the most expensive home that we can safely afford?

personalfinance,Trashed my credit. Want to get on track. I need advice. (US),"I have been a long time browser of this thread. This is my first post, so I apologize in advance if I break any rules.

Before I begin, I would just like to clarify, I am NOT going to be trying to justify any of my actions/decisions. I made many mistakes to get to where I am, and I recognize that. I was, for lack of a better word, an idiot with regards to my financial life. I am simply looking for advice. 

Like many of the cases I've seen on here, I was irresponsible in my early twenties, and took out many credit cards and maxed them out (mistake number 1). There was no lender I would say no to. I was not making much money at the time, but I didn't have rent or a car payment, so my income was enough to cover minimum payments on the credit cards. I lived like that for a year or two. 

Some months went by, and I graduated college and got my first ""real"" job, where I made a decent income. Time to pay off these credit cards, right? Nope. Instead, I got an apartment that costs about half my monthly take home pay. Needless to say, I was struggling to make payments on the credit cards, and pay the rent. Instead of downgrading my life, and moving out of the apartment, I decided I was going to stop making payments to all my credit cards. It didn't seem like a big deal at the time. I just figured I'd get around to paying it at some point. (mistake number 2). 

Forward to today, I have since significantly raised my income by working hard at my current job. I now know the value of a dollar. My apartment is now only about 25% of my monthly income. After all my monthly payments, I have about 2-3k leftover at the end of the month. I decided it's time to start working on fixing the mess I made with my credit. 

But where do I start? It has been about 2 years since I gave any payments to these credit cards. Most have been charged off. Some have been sold to collections agencies. For the ones that have been sold, who should I contact? Original creditor, or collection agency? 

I also have student loans, but I am current on those. Aside from this, I have no other kinds of debt. No car payment, no mortgage, etc.

On a side note, I am looking at applying for a federal job, and it requires ""Secret Clearance"". I know that in my current situation, I would likely be turned away. However, I've read in some places that they might be more forgiving if I can show that I am making progress with my financial situation. 

Any advice is appreciated. Even as I write this, I feel angry/sad that I decided to make such irresponsible choices with my life. I expected more of myself. But I am determined to fix this. 

Edit: A few months ago, I went to one of those ""Credit Repair"" agencies. I thought that they could help. Needless to say, I stopped doing business with them after I read up on what they were doing. I do not know if they did anything to my report that I should be undoing.",finance

I received the W2s from one job on time, the 2nd Job, my new employer not so much. So, I went and submitted my taxes with the information I had knowing I could go back and amend my return when I received my other W2s.

personalfinance,Recently in an accident and car is totaled. Should I wait for insurance to pay off remaining loan amount before applying for a new one?,I was recently in a car accident that resulted in my car being totaled. I have already received the settlement amount from my insurance company and they will be paying out $3k more than I owe (~$14k). I have already started looking at new cars and need to buy one soon and would like to get pre approved through a credit union that offers low interest rates before I purchase.

Will I get a better interest rate if I wait until it is paid off (credit score is in 780s)? When I spoke to them yesterday they said it could take up to 10 business days before the payoff amount is received by the bank that gave me the initial loan and I will likely need to buy a new car before then.

personalfinance,Would it be reasonable to trade in my vehicle?,"Hi all, 

I currently owe $13000 with an interest rate of 6% on a 2013 Toyota Tacoma. It's worth ~$24000 in a private sale and ~$21000 for a trade-in according to KBB. 

I have begun to take a greater emphasis on saving money and investing recently and have been reviewing my expenses. Upon doing so, I realized that while I can easily afford it and I enjoy having it, I don't need a truck when I really only need a vehicle to get from A to B.

I'm thinking about trading in my Tacoma for a cheaper vehicle such as a Honda Accord that costs around $13000-$15000. In my mind it sounds reasonable, as if I paid the difference in cash I could walk away owning a newer vehicle with less miles, much better fuel efficiency, and lower insurance rates (I'm a 21 M).

On the other hand, I'm getting a pretty nice bonus in two months. With that, I'm not sure if it would be smarter to pay off the Tacoma with the bonus and drive it for years until it breaks down to avoid losing ~$3000 of equity by trading in. I'm a little stuck on this.

personalfinance,Not sure about getting a personal loan to pay off some cc debt.,"I posted a little while ago asking advice on my mortgage, and one of the comments suggested I apply for a personal loan to pay off some of my cc debt.

I'm self-employed  
Gross $1,200 a month ($14,000 last year)  
Mortgage: $635 (currently applying for modification to lower that)

Total cc debt: $18,000  
Interest rates between 13% and 24%

personalfinance,Am I thinking right about my 2018 withholding?,"I *think* the federal tax changes are helping me personally. By my reading of reputable guides (IRS, TIAA, TurboTax, etc.) it appears I will owe zero in federal taxes this year. Since I've already paid in $500+, I *think* I'm good to change my withholding to zero and keep an additional ~$140/month, but want to see if anyone agrees with my analysis...or can point out absolutely stupid thinking on my part, if any. The details:

* single dad, one kid, sole custody so only one who claims him each year, filing head of household
* one job, expected income ballpark $40K, after $3K to 401(k) and $ to FSA health care and FSA child care, expected AGI roughly $30K
* head of household standard deduction $18K
* therefore taxable income $12K
* at head of household 10% rate, amount of tax prior to credits is $1200
* child care tax credit last year $125 as paid over amount set aside in FSA; child care more expensive this year but set aside slightly more, so estimate this as $100 credit
* child tax credit, $2K of which $1400 is refundable
* would get nonrefundable $1K savers credit since putting over $2K in 401(k) through work, if tax liability wasn't already zero
* no IRA, no stocks/bonds/annuities/anything similar, no student debt, no credit card debt, no other income, no other complications

So...by my math, my tax liability starts as $1200.
  $1200 starting tax
-   $100 child care tax credit
- $1400 refundable portion of child tax credit
-$1000 savers credit if tax liability was still positive

...equals I will owe absolutely nothing for federal taxes, and may well get a few hundred back...plus getting back the $500ish I've already paid in. Am I missing something? If not, it seems stupid for me *not* to tweak my withholding and keep every single penny rather than giving the treasury a tax-free loan. (I live in Kansas, and would not adjust my state withholding...unless someone here convinces me otherwise.)

Any guidance/thoughts/complete shredding of my analysis would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!",finance

CryptoCurrency,Pure virtual economies.,"Hi guys! What if control over an object were traded instead of ownership of an object? 

If you loan a lawnmower to your neighbor, and they mow their lawn, and return the lawnmower to you, and then mow your lawn, that is a trade for control over an item for a service. 

Now a service can be valued, however a share of control over an object depends on what the rules for controlling that object are. If the rules are a majority control take all situation, then the value of a share is either the total value of the object, or nothing. 

Obviously this means that shares of control over an object are impossible to value, and therefore any valuation assigned to them is purely virtual. 

Now, lets say there was a catalogue of objects, with relative values of each object, such that 1/10 the shares of a lawnmower is worth 1/2 the shares of a baking pan. That exchange rate of control allows a person to pay a small fraction of the control over their house for example to a third party as a form of a reverse mortgage. 

What would be truly interesting is that a person's day could be treated as a property. I give you 1/3 of my day to you, and in return, you give me a controlling share in a house, or a store where I can buy food. 

By treating every single action as a transfer of control governed by ethereum smart contracts of control (not ownership), you can rewrite all exchanges between people to have no value. And a society that generates no monetary value, and binds the unit of account to be a function of the transaction is a society that cannot be taxed implicitly on each transaction.

Yes the fed will cry and pout and send soldiers and ask for bank statements... and then we tell them that we have no bank statements. Nobody owns anything new, we have simply traded control of our property back and forth a few times. Sure a few purchases have been made, but all of the people have below poverty level income (even in crypto) and yet everyone has everything they want and need.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Seems like the right move...but am I missing something? (Loan Payments/Refinancing),"Hey PF - So I currently have two forms of debt looming over me - a student loan w/ Mohela for $40k at 7.5% interest (payment = $400/month), and an auto loan for $19k at 4.5% interest (payment = $490/month).  

  
I have just over $20,000 set aside from recent commission bonuses to make a substantial payment on one of these loans, and obviously since the student loan has such a high interest rate my plan has been to knock out about half of that loan -  
However, today I realized that since my credit score has gone up substantially the last year or so (770ish) I can refinance the student loan with PenFed to 4.3% interest with a 5 year term, with a payment of about $800/month.  
With this recent development it seems to me that the smart choice would be to knock out my car loan in one fell swoop and then just begin to focus on my student loan.  
My new monthly total payment will be about $100 less, and I will be paying less interest.  
This all seems very obvious to me, however I cant shake the feeling that I am missing something and I could be making a smarter decision. I am not super well versed in managing finances and up until the last 7 months where I was lucky enough to land a very high paying job I have never had much financial security, so I really want to make sure that I am not making a mistake here. I would appreciate any advice on how to split this $20k between loans, and to find out if I am indeed making the right decision.  

Also, I am not sure if this matters, but I see most threads on here ask this question: I am currently working as a 1099 employee, and I make between $3200-4000/week. I should be converting to W2 in the next month, at which point I expect a slight decrease in salary down to about 130-140k/year.

personalfinance,Help: Company improperly withholding taxes...and lying about it.,"Company based in Oregon, we live in Georgia

TL;DR
We believe that our company is improperly withholding Federal Income Tax on our commission checks.  We receive monthly commission checks separate from our bi-monthly base salary checks.  Instead of using the aggregate or flat rate method to compute our Federal Income Tax withholding, the company is withholding our commissions (defined by the IRS as supplemental income) as if it were a stand alone income stream - as if our monthly commission check were our only income.  So our allowances are being applied to our base salary and then again to our commission checks.  The result is that the company is grossly under-withholding for Federal Income Tax on our commission checks.  For many of my colleagues, this has resulted in large tax bills for 2017 and tax penalties for under-withholding.

We would like to know:
1. Are we correct that the company should be using the aggregate or flat rate method for our commission checks and that what they are doing now is against the tax code regulations?
2. If so, do we have any recourse with the company for them continuing to do this?
3. Do we have any recourse for the fact that the company made this change at the end of 2016 without notifying anyone?

Now on to the details…
Hi everyone,
I’m cross posting this in both /r/legal and /r/personalfinance because I’m hoping to get help from two awesome sets of Redditors!  This is also a collaborative post from myself and some of my coworkers, as we don’t really know where to turn; first of all to have it fixed, and second of all, to find out what our company is liable for, if any.
I’ve been working at my company for about 3 years.  I am in a sales position where about half of my income is base salary, and the rest is commission based on a sales compensation plan.  In 2016, no tax issues.  But as I started to do my 2017 taxes, I noticed an extremely high tax liability—as in, $7,000+.  I have not yet filed my taxes because I decided to seek professional help.
However, in talking to many of my coworkers they suddenly noticed the same thing.  So we all did some digging.  It appears as though they violated IRS publication 15 aka the Circular E, starting on page 19, which in summary, says that commission should be taxed as supplemental income.  Basically, our company taxed commissions as separate income.  They should have withheld 25% across the board (22% in 2018 and moving forward) and did not.  Because it is not that much pay some months, there was an overall average of 8% withheld in all of 2017.  Some months, even 0%.  My withholdings that I chose when I started at the company in 2015 did not change at all, and show consistently correct an all paystubs through 2017.
One of my senior coworkers started to do some digging, and questioning the payroll department.  He was initially told that a minor change was made from doing some processes manually to a flat file upload to ADP in November of 2016, and that only a small group of people were affected, and they were contacted by our (no-longer here, conveniently) Chief Revenue Officer.  However, we are finding out that ALL of sales was affected, and we are now almost 1.5 years later, with no formal notifications.
The legal side of this comes in when I found out another coworker caught this TWICE last year.  Once in February, and once in June.  When he notified HR and payroll, our VP of HR gave him a response that equated to “F off, we are doing this correctly.”  He thought it was just affecting him so he immediately changed all of his withholdings to 0 and had more taxes withheld beyond that.  Following a call he had with payroll again 2 weeks ago, another “small group” of people were notified that they “may have been affected.”  Again, I was not on that email.
So in summary:
1.	The company is now very aware this is a problem, and has still not notified the majority of people affected.
2.	They were notified it was a problem last year and took no corrective action.
3.	The employee withholdings did not change and yet our tax liability is extremely high now.
Our questions:
1.	Do we have any tax recourse to fix this?
2.	Is our company liable?
3.	Is ADP liable, if something got messed up in the feed?
4.	What other advice do you have, either finance, tax, or legally related?",finance

politics,"I'm Clayburn Griffin, congressional candidate in NM's 2nd. This is my first run for public office, and I'm running to build a new American Dream for the modern world. AMA!","Hey everyone.  

NM's 2nd is the largest congressional district in the US that isn't an entire state.  It consists of all of southern New Mexico including some towns you may have heard of like Roswell (yes, that one), Las Cruces, Silver City, Alamogordo and my hometown of Lovington.   The incumbent is running for governor of our state, so it's an open seat.  It's a competitive race with five Republicans (including me) currently in the primary and two Democrats.  

I grew up in New Mexico, but left for several years to NYC because the local economy didn't offer much opportunity.  It's even worse today, and as technology and globalization is rapidly changing our economy, the American Dream hasn't kept up with modern times.  So, a large focus of my campaign is a vision for a new American Dream.  I don't want to bring back manufacturing jobs; I want to change what having a job means for the 21st Century.

* Reduce ""full-time"" employment from 40 hours to 32.
* Universal Health Care so people aren't dependent on a job for health benefits, freeing them to pursue entreprenurial interests and to freelance easily.
* Emphasize and incentivize telecommuting and remote work.
* Federal subsidies and incentives to bring new industries to economically homogenous regions of our country.
* On-the-Job training programs to give employees access to careers they'd otherwise be unable to get.
* Free trade with allies around the world to encourage development and economic growth.
* Significantly limiting copyright to roll back the consolidation of valuable intellectual property by a few immortal corporations.
* Protecting Net Neutrality to ensure every business has free and fair access to compete on the Internet.

There's no silver bullet, but we need people in office working toward a long-term vision for our society.  I want to live in a world with self-driving smart cars, universal high-speed Wi-Fi and over 75% of our energy supplied by wind and solar.

personalfinance,"Should we rent it, or sell it? And other....","Hi PF!

I'll try to be brief:

Combined income (wife and I, both 34 y/o) ~100K, in Central New York -LCOL(ish), 2 Kidos

Take home after Taxes, Health Insurance, company(s) 401K, etc: ~$6100 we are saving 15% towards retirement via 401K's and IRA's although they are obviously not maxed out, we have been stashing it away for a new home.

We have 0 debt besides current mortgage ($700, taxes and insurance included in that), as well as my wife's lease($289).  

We bought a home ~10 years ago when we were making *significantly* less money in a down economy, it's a nice little house in a great school district. All the ""major"" expenses have hit already - New Roof, New Gas Heat, New Hot Water Tank, blah, blah,blah. We also added some creature comforts during our time in the house (in-ground pool, renovated a bunch, etc). 

Owning it for 10 years, we have equity in the house, however I highly doubt we ""get back"" what we have ""put in"" through the years, which isn't the worst thing in the world I guess, we've enjoyed the house while we have been in it for the most part. However, we absolutely would like more space, and can afford it, so we are moving (this isn't a can we afford to move thread, or how much house can we afford thread, we are absolutely moving, and can afford to do so). Pre-approval came in at 320K, we will spend no where near that, and will most likely end up around $220K - $240K.

My question(s):

Sell the current house (we don't ""need"" the equity for the new home purchase), or rent it out (Est $1,200 per month in rent)? 

Sub question: While we do have the funds for closing, down payment (with no PMI) and still have an E-fund that conventional financing requires, my wife is a veteran, and we have never taken advantage of a VA Loan. VA Loans require $0 down, and regulate closing costs with no PMI. Taking this option would keep a lot of our cash on hand, for investments and the like, but with interest rates rising, again I am on the fence as to what would be the best choice.

personalfinance,"Planning to Pay for Medical School with Student Loans, 529 Distributions, and Early IRA Distributions","Hello /r/personalfinance

I've been a long time reader here which has significantly helped me with financial planning through my career. After a few years of working as an engineer I decided to apply to medical school. This is something I've considered for a long time but initially wanted to try a job that didn't require 4 years of additional school plus 3-7 years of training with an income near the national median before making a significant salary. Leaving my job with no guarantee of acceptance kinda forced me to ignore everything I had learned from r/pf because it was such a poor financial decision. Fortunately, I got into an in-state medical school and will be starting in the fall (and now it doesn't hurt to think about financial planning!). I have been planning out how I will pay for four years of school and living expenses and have run into a few decisions that I was hoping r/pf could help with. My potential assets to pay for medical school are the following:

* $54,000 in a 529 (I got really lucky here with the recent index market and have since moved the funds to a money market fund)
* $25,000 in a Traditional IRA (all rolled over from my former employer 401k)
* $5,000 in a Roth IRA (Part Roth 401k rollover, part Roth IRA earnings. Unfortunately I had to live off some former Roth IRA contributions during the application transition)
* $3,000 in a Savings Account (this is largely my short term E-fund, built from recent employment)

All in all this is pretty exciting. Ignoring my savings account, I can cover about half the estimated total cost of attendance which is around $46,000 per year. I think I can live off $40,000/yr given my frugality, but only time and budgeting will tell that. The typical federal plus loans that I'd be guaranteed to take out start at a rate of around 6-7%. 

* Obviously I'll be using my entire 529 balance to pay for part of these expenses. My initial inclination is to entirely exhaust this balance first as this will delay interest accrual on loans by one year. Are there any other considerations here? If I exhaust all the 529 funds one year, will I be denied loans on the next FAFSA application because they assume there is more?

What is the consensus on using IRA money instead of taking out loans? I get that this is essentially the same question others have, but on the other side of the loan. Most people are asking if they should pay down student loan debt or contribute to a tax advantaged retirement account. I'm wondering if I should take on that additional debt in the first place.

I see all kinds of options with the IRA. 

* If I wanted to save the balance, I could convert the entire traditional IRA to a Roth IRA in 1-2 years while I have little to no income in med school and pay minimal taxes, letting that money grow tax free for my entire career. 

* If I wanted to use the IRAs to pay for school expenses, I could also take a full distribution from both IRAs without penalty because I'll have $46,000/year in qualified education expenses as far as 529s/early IRA distributions are concerned. I may even qualify for the 2000 Lifetime Learning Tax Credit if I distributed the entire traditional IRA in one year (this credit doesn't count room and board expenses as qualified).

Does anyone have any guidance on what would be optimal in my situation? Although I'm entirely sold on attending medical school, I wouldn't say I'm entirely comfortable leveraging large amounts of debt (which is what keeping $30,000 invested in the IRAs invested while taking on the same amount in student debt at 7% feels like). I guess I'm essentially deciding between taking out ~$80,000 in student loans versus $110,000, which is probably not a huge difference after residency with a solid loan repayment plan. How does r/pf feel about those alternatives? Am I forgetting anything else here?

Thanks in advance for your input!

Edit* Few words

If anyone sees this through the search function and feels like weighing in, please do! I've got a few months before I have to take my first distribution and I'd love any feedback.

Edit 2: For anyone in the same situation as me, I ended up deciding to convert the traditional balance to a Roth IRA over the next 3 years and take out loans. My plan is to aggressively pay down the loans after residency no matter what, I may as well stick it out for potential market gains in a tax free account.",finance

personalfinance,Online Savings/CDS: State income taxes??,"I'm a Massachusetts resident and have recently opened a few online high yield savings / CD accounts. Now that I'm in the process of working on my state taxes, and noticing that non-residents must still pay taxes on interest earned from Massachusetts banks, I'm wondering what the hell tax *filing* situation I've created for myself next year regarding other states.

This isn't an issue that I've never really seen talked about, so I'm left wondering if and how it generally works out. Some possibilities:

1. The MA filing threshold is $8,000 in income. Other states are similar, and most people never earn enough interest to have to file. But technically you could run afoul of this, especially as interest rates are rising.

2. The popular online banks deliberately locate in states with friendlier requirements than Massachusetts. (Which would imply that one could still be surprised by the less-popular online branches of traditional banks!)

3. The popular online banks are under Federal charters and therefore aren't considered state banks/income even in the state of their headquarters or other physical presence.

4. The popular online banks are under Federal charters, and my account is designated being a Massachusetts account (similar to how Bank of America considers my account there a Massachusetts account, even though as far as I'm aware they don't have a specific Massachusetts charter. And how I've never heard of a local regional bank necessitating the filing of taxes in their home state)

It seems that if there isn't a clear answer to this question, I need to figure out the state of each online bank account I have and figure out their rough rules and filing thresholds.

Conversely, does anyone have experience as an out of state customer of DCU or Salem Five and needing to file Massachusetts income tax returns?",finance
gaming,Do Not Let Ubisoft Go Down the EA Path.,"Cross-posted from r/rainbowsix. You can watch the battle going on in there, if you wish. [Original post here.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/82jgwr/what_the_hell_ubisoft/?st=jehjb3p5&amp;sh=182c9fc0)

TL;DR at the bottom.

**Here is the original post's text, copy-pasted. I tried to make things understandable for non-Siegers, but sorry if I missed some points:**

...

This season is a total mess, right off the bat. Ubisoft has been Ubishafting us for the last several months, pushing the community as much as they can to find out where the limits are and what they can retroactively change and what they can fuck us over on.

No, this isn't just about cosmetics. If you comment 'its just cosmetics', you didn't read the post.

They are becoming increasingly uncompromising and anti-consumer as the game becomes more successful.

**FIRST UP: OUTBREAK AND THE ORIGINAL CONTROVERSY**

Ubisoft started out by announcing they were jacking the price of the game back up, with a 5$ instore pat on the head to justify increasing the price by $20. Additionally, Outbreak Packs would be cash-only, and new players would get 14 packs while current players get 4. Each pack is about 5$. We, naturally, lost our lids over this.

To shut us up, Ubisoft promised everyone the Ash Elite skin. Now everyone gets the minimum of 4 packs to start, rather than bumping everyone up to 14 (taking the low road), and the game price would remain steady instead. For whatever reason, this was enough for the subreddit. 

The game price staying the same was a good win, but Outbreak Packs costing real cash only was/is still a massive issue and is extra anti-consumer. Now that the packs have arrived, there's all manner of issues with them. But more on that later.

**THE ASH ELITE**

Oh the hilarity of it not working day 1. But don't worry, the Outbreak Pack version still works, so go ahead and buy some packs if you want it.

So here's the thing about the Black Viper set; it's a cannibalized version of a Renown-purchasable set we were going to get. Back in Janurary, one of our diligent data miners brought us a cart of an Ash Bundle leak, which had the same camo skin the Black Viper Elite set now has. We never received this bundle, which is extra unusual since the promotional art for it was all done and ready to go. 

What happened to it? Well when Ubi did some damage control to promise us the elite skin and shut us up without really fixing much, they cannibalized a 'renownable' set to make a second elite skin, so they could keep those Outbreak Packs nice and stuffed with goodies.

**THE JOKE OF A ""TECHNICAL TEST SERVER""**

The TTS was (almost) a worthless endeavor this time around. Over the course of two weeks, we had only two real fixes; Blitz was made not-bugged and given less accuracy, and Finka was slightly nerfed.

Every other bug presently listed here existed day 1 of the TTS. Issues like the Damascus Steel skin have been around for almost an entire season now, and everyone not recieving their minimum 4 Outbreak Packs was reported constantly from day 1 of the TTS.
Most notable are the VOIP issues, huge performance bugs (some of the 'permanent' ones can be fixed by turning off vsync, or restarting the game as an fyi), and triple delay time between Buck's Skeleton Key and weapon switching, which is effectively a huge nerf until its fixed.

Either the timeline for the TTS needs to be increased so issues can actually get fixed, or the TTS is just a beta preview where they can fix any Siege-destroying issues but not much else.

 Either way, Ubisoft has had the time and the data to figure this shit out by now.

**INCREASED PRICES AND OUTBREAK LOOTBOXES**

Some of you may have noticed we only have two renown-purchasable seasonal skins. Some of you might have also noticed the jacked-up price of them, as well. (The price was normal on the TTS; they jacked it up for release) Additionally, we were told Outbreak Packs could be earned by playing Outbreak. The original page that said this has since been edited, removing this tidbit, as the only way to earn packs now is to buy them.

But did you also know the season headgear price has increased too? What was once 5k is now 12k, a 2.5x~ increase in price for every single operator. Ohh, but don't worry; the R6 price hasn't increased as much. It only went up by about 2x the price. Effectively, Renown is now comparatively worth less R6 cash points in some cases, and this gap may continue to enlarge in the future.

*Update: Confirmation from the community managers that this is indeed the case. *

*""We are going to be ""harmonizing"" the R6 Credit/Renown ratio more or less across the board moving forward. While we won't be able to get it on the dot in every situation, we are aiming for 600 R6 Credits = 25,000 Renown"".*

As such, the Renown cost for these bundles was increased to align with that.

Additionally, the Health Hazard weapon skin added for the new ops is presently the most expensive non-global skin in the game, sitting at 15k. The closest a non-universal weapon skin has ever come to that is the GROM skins added last season at 7k. This is over double that price, and once again, an increase in price from what it was on the TTS. 

Most seasons we get 4 seasonal weapon skins. This season we got 4, again - but as I said, the price for them has increased significantly. Not only that, but two of them are locked behind Outbreak Cash-only boxes.

This isn't even touching on the fact that Outbreak is a limited-time event specifically to get people to impulse buy Outbreak Lootboxes, much like Overwatch's timed events are to get people to impulse-buy lootboxes.

This is ontop of the massive number of R6-only sets, and the $321.55 USD of cash-only sets. And that's only counting what is currently available. Not to mention 3 years worth of seasonpasses, 5 different versions of the game, including the Trap Edition, 'gold' edition, and $130 'complete edition'. 

Speaking of...

**STARTER EDITION AND OLD OPS**

As we all know, Siege is plagued with the Starter Trap Edition. While some blame can be put on the consumer for making a bad purchase, ultimately Ubisoft should not be willingly providing us with a bad purchase, and no ability to upgrade. You'd think after a year and a half of the community chanting ""It's a trap!"", they might make some real changes to it. But they don't.

This season the Starter Edition got a slight buff, in that there are more initial operators available. However, this change is not applied retroactively, fucking over anyone who bought the Starter Edition before today. Bought it yesterday? Tough shit. 400 hours of grinding to get all the ops. Bought it today? Well, 200-300 hours of grinding still, but not 400.

Additionally, as all base ops are now free (and all attachments), the playerbase is not recieving any reimbursement. Again, if you dumped 20k in renown or 30$ in the past week to buy all the base ops/attatchements, you do not get any reimbursement today.

This, once again, shows Ubisoft not caring about its consumerbase - even the new ones.

All of this, when the game still has such glaring issues like trouble queuing together as a five man party, either failing completely or putting 2 people in a ranked match while kicking the other 3. I-frames while vaulting, hit registration, unstable servers, disappearing gadgets, countless exploits, insta-spawnpeeks, balance issues, hackers, and countless other problems. Instead of those fixes, we get more bugs, increased prices, cash-only lootboxes, and all this other shittery.

**What the hell, Ubisoft. **

TL;DR:
- Raised in-game prices silently? Check

- Created paid-only RNG lootboxes which contains items exclusive to the packs? Check

- Failed to give players the promised Ash elite? Check

- Uses bullshits reasons on why they can't do XY instead of telling the truth? Check

- Failed to fix several issues reported on TTS they day it went online? Check

- Screws over long-time players for the sake of attracting new customers? Check

...

**It's not about cosmetics or not. It's about letting Ubisoft test their customers, setting a precedent for what they can get away with.**

personalfinance,"I am wondering if transferring my credit card balance is the best option for me right now, but I am not sure. Advice please!","I am still working on paying my credit card that I received 3 years ago. Being young and naive, I didn't realize I had 18 months at 0% APR. I used the car to pay for major car repairs right near the end of my 0% APR..

Now, the interest rate is through the roof and so, based on what I make, paying around $100-$150 a month on my card is about all I can manage. Which is well about my minimum payment, but, still not enough that it's making a huge difference with the interest rate.

So, I am wondering if transferring my balance to another 0% APR for 18 months card would be a good idea? I have a good credit score and have great approval odds for in particular. I know a lot of people get into trouble with transferring balance because then they don't pay off on the new card and spend thus accumulating for debt.

I would do what I did when I first got my credit card, and I gave it to my boyfriend until I actually desperately needed it so that I didn't just spend it on frivolities. I would give my original card and new card back to him and work on making payments without using the card at 0% APR for 18 months, which I could definitely pay it off two months before my 18 months ran out at $150 a month for 16 months... or more when I receive any lump sums I could put towards it.

I'm SUPER cautious about my credit score, and right now I am sitting at 720, and simulated transferring a balance and it would drop my score to around 645.. which isn't great, but not the worst.  I know that i can get the score back up with my on time payments (I've never, ever missed a payment and have it the monthly minimum paid off way before it's due, 100% on-time payments) 

I guess what I'm trying to say is, I know that I am responsible enough to do this.. but I guess what I'm asking is.. is this a good idea?

personalfinance,2017 1098t Wrong?,"I was a student for part of 2017, graduating in May. When filing my taxes, I noticed that my 1098t lists zero tuition paid in 2017, as the university charges for their spring semester in the previous year's December. Upon investigating with my university, I found that my tuition was paid on 1/3/2017, leading me to believe this should have appeared on my 1098t. My tuition was paid with a mixture of Federal loans, parent PLUS loans, and scholarships. 

My fiancee had the same situation occur, as we both graduated from the same university. Is this something we should investigate further? As we filled out our 2017 taxes, we did not claim any educational expense, which ended up skewing our estimated returns as we had to pay tax on the scholarships.",finance

Not sure if I'm right but the way I understand it is getting into a morgage and buying a home is better while the dollar is strong. Anyone clear this up for me and explain pitfalls. Like how inflation might effect all of this. Is it not even a good time to get into the home market?

CryptoCurrency,CFTC vs SEC - US Judge Rules Crypto Are Commodities,"https://www.coindesk.com/us-judge-rules-cryptocurrencies-are-commodities-in-cftc-case/

What does this mean for us?

Let's start at CFTC vs SEC:
CFTC - Our boy Giancarlo is here.  They regulate over commodities

SEC - Assholes that crashed the market with their whispers of regulation of exchanges.  They regulate over securities.

Well with crypto being ruled as a commodity that means that the CFTC has jurisdiction over regulation of crypto where there is a lack of federal legal precedent.  Not the SEC.

What does this mean for the SEC?

I am not sure because I am not a lawyer, but I would say #CryptoDad will overrule any SEC regulation on crypto.  I think this recent statement about exchanges needing to be registered with the SEC will blow over, now that the United States has declared crypto a commodity.  They may have to ""rebrand"" or ""redefine"" themselves as not an exchange or whatever legal BS needs to happen to stay away but I think the future is bright.

Any other insight on this ruling and the recent wind of regulation would be appreciated and what it means for crypto.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,"Advice please! Stuck with unpayable $80k student loan, college closed down, so no degree and no good job.","First of all, this is my friend's situation, not my own, but I really want to find some good advice for him.  He's a great guy, very smart and motivated, and just got the worst end of the deal here, and has been stuck for a few years already...

The situation:  He was at a private college a few years ago paying something like $20k/yr tuition, and took out loans for 2-3 years worth of tuition at a high interest rate.  I forget exactly, but something like 8-9%?  Maybe even higher?  His current balance is something like $80k.  

Before his senior year, the school lost accreditation for his degree program and shut down.  As a result, he has no hope of getting his initial degree, but also can't transfer any credit for the courses he took into any other school.  He'd have to start from scratch at a new school.   

He has no money to pay for any new school, nor does he really want to start over and waste 3 years that he already did, plus he can't take out any new loans on account of the debt on the old ones.   Because he has no actual degree, he can't find any well-paying job, and is stuck somewhere just above minimum wage. 

He already exhausted his legal options (that he knows of) on getting the student loan written off.  It's not qualified to be discharged in a bankruptcy.  It was taken through a private agency, nothing gov't related, and doesn't qualify within those new loan-writeoff laws if a collection agency can't trace the actual loan ownership.  

Given the interest gathering on the loan, it can truly never be paid off with his available income, and the balance actually just continues to grow larger.  At the same time, he has no real incentive to work because whatever he earns would get taken to pay toward this unpayable loan.  So with no seeming way out, he simply moved home, didn't work for a long time, and gave up making any loan payments.  But this thing is still hanging over him, apparently forever.   He's been doing free online courses basically full time the past couple years to learn programming, but can't get his foot in the door anywhere in that field.  I think his leading plan right now is to leave the country, abandon everything, and risk never coming back.  

I wish I had some suggestions to give on how to dig out of this, but I just don't even know.  Any advice is appreciated!",finance

Lately I've been doing the snowball method and applying everything a pay off towards my student loans. I've had my car on auto pay since I purchased it three years ago.

The furniture has no interest for quite some time. However it is a pain because I have to physically go there to pay them.

personalfinance,Yet another student loan post: putting everything into paying off loans rather than retirement. Would love PF's advice!,"Hi everyone! Sorry if people are sick of loan posts, but I would love PF's insight into my financial planning. So my wife and I both just graduated medical school and are in residency. We have about $500K together in federal loans with interest rates ranging between 5.4% to 7%. We are both on REPAYE, so our minimum payments are manageable. We live frugally and net positive about $2K each month. Our employer doesn't do a retirement matching service, rather it just puts a percentage into an account for us without us having to contribute anything. In 3 - 4 years (after residency) we will both experience substantial increases in income. We don't plan on refinancing until then as staying in this federal program allows us more flexibility with monthly payments and keeps us in the running for loan forgiveness if I decided to work in a public service job after residency and we instead put all our money into paying off my wife's half of the loans. My question is, is it financially sound to aggressively put all our money into paying off my wife's half of the loans and hold on adding to retirement accounts until the loans are knocked out?

personalfinance,The most unusual benefits for &gt;800 credit score?,"It took me a while, but I've finally leveled up my credit score to ~810. From what I understand, 800 is the magic cutoff line that unlocks the best borrowing rates, makes it super-easy to apply for new lines of credit, etc, etc.

I've read many articles that describe the benefits of the &gt;800 credit score, and it's mostly more of the same: lower mortgage rate, higher credit limit, and so on.

What I'd really like to learn is this: are there any unusual, less publicized or downright eccentric benefits to having a really high credit score? Things like... Can I issue my own bonds? Can I walk into a bank and borrow a ridiculous amount of money for just a hair above the fed fund rate, with the payoff date being 30 years from now? Can I get a low-rate mortgage for an extravagant purchase (such as, say, a small island in the Pacific) with no questions asked? Are there special wine&amp;dine events only for the &gt;800 people?

Long story short, I have 28 years remaining on my mortgage, I have: 

two car payments that are about a year old each, brand new.
four credit cards that are topped off after a vacation and life
no other debt to speak of, really.

Basically, there is an offer to refinance our house (currently at 3.25 interest rate) to 5.25% and raise the total payment $400, to $1200 / month. Within the last three years, property values have skyrocketed in my area, netting quite a bit of equity on the house. Taking the Re-fi would not max out that equity, and leave about $20k above what we would owe for the perceived value.

Doing this would reset the loan at 30 years, and also fold all four credit cards and a car payment into the refinance; all in all, I would save about $700 a month (even after the mortgage increase) from what I am currently spending.

personalfinance,Ways to owe more in Federal taxes that benefit me?,"This year I'm considering the purchase of an electric car. The purchase of the car would allow me a $7500 federal refund when I file my taxes next year.
The concern is that when I filed this year I only paid around $4000 in federal taxes, which is fairly close to what I've paid for previous years.
For those who don't know, the $7500 refund doesn't carry over to future years, and anything I don't owe is basically left on the table (so, basically I'd only be able to get a $4000 refund, and ""lose"" the extra $3500).

Is there anything I can do that will allow me to owe more in federal taxes, but also benefit me in other ways? It obviously wouldn't make sense for me to purposely not take tax deductibles, just to get the extra refund. I also wouldn't want do anything that would introduce much risk.",finance

personalfinance,Student Loan - to pay off or save?,"Hi folks, 

I have been thinking about this decision more and more lately.  Here is my quick background.

I have approximately $94,000 in student loan debt.  I pay a minimum of $1,000 a month, which I've been doing for about the past 9 years.  This loan is composed of 3 sub-loans, one of which is $48,000 at a 7.5% interest rate (the other two are both 5ish%).  The monthly payment for this specific loan is $514.

Both my wife and I work full time and make just north of $200k combined (we are 34 years old).  We have approximately $30k in our checking account and $60k in our savings (not including 401k and IRA).  Our typical monthly expenses range from $8,000-$9,000 and we will typically have a $1,000-$2,000 surplus in our account at the end of the month (more student loan debt and daycare expenses for 14month old twins).

I love having the safety net of the money in our savings account if any emergency were to arise, or if I wanted to do any home upgrades / repairs.  However, the thought of knocking out half of my student loan debt and decreasing my monthly payment by $500 is very enticing, not to mention the money I'll save on interest.

personalfinance,Fedex is taking a loan on your money!,"This is just a PSA on the importance of checking your on line banking often, more often than you do. Things like this might happen and if days pass you might end up thinking that you have money in your card when in reality you have less than what you think!

My case started with going to Fedex Office to make a few copies. Total transaction: about 0.60 cents. I ran other errands and used same card I used at Fedex, because I knew I had plenty of money for all I needed to pay. When I came back home, I decided to check out my on line banking to check the balance of my card. Lo and behold, I find a $15 hold in my account for Fedex! I called the store and long story short the person over the phone told me that this charge was similar to those that hotels charge customers as a deposit fee on the card used to pay for the stay. In addition, the person told me that the charge ""should drop within 24 hrs and the actual charge for my copies should show up in my on line banking. If this did not happen after 72 hrs, the person told me to call my bank so they could fix that because ""it is something in the system"" that has to do with how banks clear transactions.....

Seriously, whatever this person said, let's be honest: I DIDN'T BELIEVE IT! Of course is not the worker's fault. I also know very well that some businesses do hold a certain amount from the account usually $1. Some businesses apply this hold until the transaction is cleared and some even say that is part of the verification of funds in the account. I mean OK $1? Fine but $15? 

The important take out here is that FEDEX IS TAKING A LOAN ON THE CUSTOMER'S MONEY and to top it off IN DISGUISE! I never agreed to pay $15 for copies that only cost cents! This people are CHEATING! They can easily go to a bank and get a loan if they need money and that is why they have investors too. Didn't they go public long time ago? Anyway, deal is that if Fedex asks for a loan, they would have to pay interest on that loan so they see it as a better deal to take money directly from customers without their knowledge!

This is how you lose a customer no more no less! If you have to use their copy services, I would recommend getting their card and load it with CASH! Otherwise, find another copy center that doesn't come up with BS of this kind, always print out your receipt, and monitor your on line banking.

Beware of this kind of stuff. We are living times in which predatory practices of all sorts are getting their chance to come stronger than ever. Take care of your hard earned money and be watchful because fat cats only care about how to squeeze the money from the little guy or the regular Joe. I guess we all can forget about ""consumer protection"" at the rate that things are going....",finance
personalfinance,Student thinking of buying a car with student loan for a summer job and future? (CAN),"Hey guys,



I'm a 2nd year Canadian graduate student in professional health program. Finished a bachelor's degree before this. I have 2 more years remaining till i graduate. I have no income at the moment as I am a full time student. I use my student loans to manage my living expenses. Each year I get funding from the government for school, and I use my private student bank loan to cover the rest.

At the moment, my student debt is:
government loan: $44,000 (NOTE: interest does not accumulate until i graduate)
private student bank loan (interest rate is prime+0.5% = 3.450+0.5 = 3.95%):  $27,000



Private student bank loan: 125k max limit, so I have access to 98k remaining.
Each year government loan provides: 15K in total (i have to pay back 7k ONLY, rest is a grant)

Projected expenses for remaining 2 years (includes living expenses and tuition): 90k in total for remaining 2 years combined. This is an overestimate to account for worst case scenario.

Projected income after graduation: 60k (hopefully lol)

I'm going to be starting a summer job in May-Aug. I have never owned a car. The commute takes 1.5 hours to bus there, and 1.5 hours to bus to back each day. Given my situation, would it be feasible to use my private student to buy a used car? I would take the car with me back to school for the remaining 2 years, and I would very likely need it for when I graduate and get a job.

Insurance costs roughly $200 for someone my age &amp; area each month.
If i were to buy a car, i need a used one that can last me for ideally 4-5 years!

We'd like to save to buy a car soon since mine is dying, but we're also debating maxing out my Roth IRA or increasing savings into our 401(k)'s. We're currently maxing one and contributing about 9000 to the other.

We're looking at used cars and ~$20k is the price point where we feel good about the vehicle and about the price. I know typical advice here would say buy something less expensive but we're pretty firm on this so want to get some advice on how we can best approach it. We expect to buy around October, and would have about $12k if we make no changes to our plan and put this $10k into Roth IRA contributions for 2017 and 2018.

We're fine with a small loan if needed and have good credit (800+). We also are paying extra toward our mortgage which could be diverted to help save for the car but we're not sure we want to deviate from our plans on that. Interest rate is 3.75% and we have 28 years remaining currently. I know we could get more in the market most likely but we want to get rid of this mortgage ASAP

**The bullet points:**

* Our emergency fund is fully funded at 6 months
* Husbands Roth IRA for 2017 is already funded, but mine is not
* On track to max my husband's 401(k)
* Contributing on pace for ~$9000 in my 401(k)
* Not eligible for HSA
* Car purchase would be around October or so. 
* Take home pay leaves us with $1000/month to save 
* Currently paying $875 extra per month toward the mortgage
* In our early 30's, ~$190k saved in retirement accounts.
* In my 401(k) I've got decent fund options but not amazing. Expense ratios are below 1% but not by much. 
	
**A few options we've come up with:**

* Put the entire windfall toward the purchase of the car and carry on as normal (pay cash for the car when it comes time to buy)
* Max Roth IRA for only 2017, save the rest for a car. If we have to get a loan, pay it off aggressively with the $1k/month we're currently saving. Would be close this way.
* Max Roth IRA for 2017 and 2018 to get it out of the way. We'd have ~12k unless we stopped paying extra toward the mortgage and then we'd have ~22k.
* Change my 401(k) to max, and use the $10k toward the car (pay cash for the car when it comes time to buy). Forget Roth's for right now.


If anyone's got input, or other ideas on how to use this money I'd love to hear some thoughts. We're so conflicted and don't think any of these options are terrible, but want to make sure we're being smart with our money. 

We don't mind a car loan and even if we had to take a $5k loan (or more so they'll want to issue it, then pay it off early with money we've already got saved up) we can pay it off pretty quickly.

personalfinance,Am I getting a fair price for tax preparation? Details in post.,"My tax preparer is charging me $250, and I am not sure if it is a fair price considering the situation. 

I live in a different state than my tax preparer (I moved about 1 year 1/2 ago), and because of state requirements for tax preparers, she is only able to file the federal taxes, and I will have to find someone in my new state to help file the state portion. 

She did spend some time researching this, but I feel she is charging me the standard price, and I should get a reduced rate since I still have to file the state taxes on my own.

Who better to ask for advice... r/personalfinance, am I getting a fair price?

UPDATE: Thank you all for the great advice! I ended up going with the $250 preparer. She had already done a lot of work, and I just wanted to make sure the price was fair. Next time, now I know to do it on my own for free! Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,How best to use my bonus,"Hey folks, wondering if you can help me figure out the best course of action here. I’ll start by saying that I understand I’ve made some mistakes here financially, and none of these options are anything to be happy about, but I’m doing my best to choose the right course. Here goes:

So I need to determine the best use of my bonus this year: my choices are to either pay off around 80% of my last bit of CC debt OR pay off about 80% of my federal &amp; state taxes. 

My freelance work blew up last year and rather than put aside an adequate amount or pay estimated quarterlies, I ended up reinvesting that money into business and home needs. After taking all the applicable deductions I reduced my tax liability considerably but will still owe.

At the same time, I have one last large CC debt that I’m working toward paying off. It costs me about $150/month in fees. 

Now, I get a bonus through my full-time job that will cover about 80% of either debt. It’s just a matter of deciding where it goes.

Worth considering is that my wife and I will be selling our home this spring/summer and buying a new home. Mine is the lower of our two credit scores, so paying off the CC seems like the right thing to do as it might boost my score. That’s said, if I have to enter into some sort of payment agreement with the IRS, is it likely that that debt will be seen on a credit check? 

I’ve had to pay in the past and I’ve never seen any of those prior debts appear on any credit report I’ve requested.

So that’s the general idea. Take it easy on me guys, I know a lot of this will probably leave some of you shaking your heads, but I’m hoping to get some practical advice here.",finance

personalfinance,Married vs. Single,"My husband and I were married in 2015. We have both received promotions since then.

We both claim 0 dependents, but the difference I learned was that I claim Married/0 and he claims Single/0 for federal. We both make about the same income wise but he had about $3000 more taken out of his taxes this year than I did. 

My question is, what is the difference with “Married, 0 dependents” and “Single, 0 dependents” in tax language? He has changed his status to “Married, 0” as of today but I don’t understand what that will mean for us come next year - since both of us will claim the same thing.

We just received both our state and federal tax refunds ($4k total) and want to put it all towards the card debt, as we have been able to save 3 months rent/car payment/insurance for emergencies, but because of the high balance, my credit score had taken a hit. It's on the upswing now, but my question is it better for credit score to make one big payment with $1k/card or maybe add it to our current payments and add $250/card/month and spread it over 4 months? Or does it not make a difference?

$90k combined income
$1360 mortgage/taxes
2016 Civic Ex @ 1.79% for 72 (payoff $9800) $222/month

Boat @ 5.5% for 84 (payoff $8900)  $143 month

Our plan is to sell off the boat the beginning of next summer (when prices are hot and everyone wants to buy) since we probably will not have time to use it with a child on the way.

Another thought running through my head was selling off/trading in my truck, and leasing a new truck. I can lease a better equipped model for about $350-390 a month with all the incentives and dealer discounts going on right now. I've already received a straight buyout offer of 30k (which is very fair), giving me ~$10,500 in cash that I turn around and use to payoff my wife's Civic to eliminate ALL debt and free up $222 of income.

At the end of the lease, I could decide to either buy and finance the truck, or lease another vehicle (I usually switch vehicle every 3-4 years anyways). 

Does this seem like a solid idea, even though our interest rates are really low? We don't NEED to sell, but it would be nice to have that extra income for childcare costs. Thanks in advance.",finance
personalfinance,Paying off Credit Card with Tax Refund.,"Hello PF,

I currently owe roughly $4,800 on my 0% Discover card. My 0% interest rate goes up the end of June of this year. My goal is to get this thing paid of before the 0% is up. I'm getting back $2,700 in taxes and plan on throwing all of that at my CC debt. 

My question is would it be wise and good for my credit if i put that $2,700 down on the card in one lump sum? Or should i stretch that out over the next 4 months?

$2700 then 4 payments of 525 OR 4 payments of $1200. 

Thanks in advance.

personalfinance,Still in school - does it make sense to pay off my smaller unsubsidized loan or use that money for another semester?,"I’m in my second semester of college, ridiculously overpaying at a private university, but despite my options I felt this was what lined up best with my career trajectory. 

I actually received decent scholarships, so I’m now only on the hook for less than $10k/year tuition as long as financial aid doesn’t change too much. I live in a house off campus and my parents cover that. 

I took out both subsidized and unsubsidized loans, or at least the meager amount they offered me. Around $1k each. My parents took out a PLUS loan for the remainder, as I wasn’t working at the time and couldn’t get approved, and they didn’t have the credit to qualify as my co-signers. 

I think I would be able to easily pay off the fed. loan that is accruing interest by early summer, and I probably would but I’m concerned I may not be able to get the financing I need for future semesters, and may need to hold on to that money for a worst case scenario. I think the interest is less than $50/semester, which isn’t horrible but it also adds more debts to my name. 

I’m doing contract work at a law firm that has no guaranteed hours. $30/week after taxes is optimistic, but I’m keeping it to help with law school apps. My schedule is weird so I’ve had issues getting a retail job, but it’s still my intent as soon as I can.

personalfinance,Federal Student Aid loophole for rich retired parents?,"Reading over the FAFSA, my understanding is that retired parents with low income and a lot of assets can have their kids qualify for maximum federal student aid. All they need to do is qualify for Automatic Zero Estimated Family Contributions.

According to the FAFSA, you can qualify if you have an Adjusted Gross Income of &lt;$25k and file a 1040A tax return.

For example, if the parents retired early and have $1M in their brokerage/savings accounts, $2M in tax deferred retirement accounts, and a $1M house. If they hold off on selling any securities, their Adjusted Gross Income on interest and dividends will be $1M*(~0.02)=$20k and will qualify to file a 1040A tax return. This will get their kids the same amount of federal student aid as a family living below the poverty line. 

If the parents instead have $2M in their brokerage savings accounts and earn a $2M*(~0.02)=$40k AGI they can still get away with not including their assets as part of the Estimated Family Contributions calculation and get a decent amount of federal student aid.

personalfinance,"Nothing Negative on Consumer Report, Yet Denied Checking Account","I was recently approved for an auto loan through PNC with a fairly low interest rate, provided I set up AutoPay to save the additional .25% APR. 


I went online to set up a checking account, and was essentially ""kicked out"" of the system after I clicked the wrong button. The next day, I went to a local branch and, much to my surprise, was denied an account. This decision was based on Early Warning Services - the company PNC uses to check banking account history. 


Immediately I suspected fraud, since I have a very responsible banking history. I requested my report from EWS, which took 15 days to receive. 


The only thing listed on this report were 2 inquires from PNC Bank, and a ""Post No Checks"" status from Simple Bank. 


(Simple Bank is an online-only bank that I opened an account with in November. They assured me that the ""Post No Checks"" status was not negative - it was only listed as such because the bank itself does not have paper checks.)

I assumed the ""Post No Checks"" status was negatively impacting my Consumer Report and affecting PNC's decision, so I had Simple Bank send me a letter saying that my account with them was in good-standing. 

The representative at PNC saw this letter and contacted an internal department to see if they could override it. They could not override it because the representative was told, they do not even SEE the Consumer Report - they only go off of the Deposit Score, or ""Score Report,"" which is a number. 

I contacted EWS to request my Score Report, and they emailed it to me right away. On a scale of 450-866, my score is a 532. 

How in the world do I have such a low number? Is it the Simple Bank status? Is it the 2 inquiries for PNC? I feel like EWS tells me one thing, PNC tells me another, and Simple tells me something different. I do not know who to contact to find out why my score is so low. Everything I've read online assumes a low score indicates you've written bad checks, you've had several overdrafts, you owe banks money, or your identity was stolen. Nothing on my report reflects any of the above situations.

CryptoCurrency,How to increase cryptocurrency adoption,"Stop being scared to touch your crypto.

Want to buy something from a vendor/donation that offers both FIAT* *and* crypto payment options?

Instead of just making the purchase with your credit or debit card, use the FIAT you were originally going to spend on the purchase, to buy some more crypto instead. Then use cryptocurrency to buy the item. Yeah you might take a tiny hit on transaction fees, but it will be worth it in the end when crypto becomes a daily commodity.

Think of it like using a credit card for purchases and then immediately paying off the credit card, instead of just using your debit card to make the purchase. A middle man to build credit (reputation).

Same concept. If we want crypto to get big, we have to get it out there in the everyday world.

Can't just have everyone sit on it and hope for magic.

CryptoCurrency,"Official Stance from Central bank of China: Digital currency inevitable, Gradual change, Focus on financial stability and risk prevention","In pictures

http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-03/09/c_137026784.htm

China is in no hurry in developing a digital currency, Zhou Xiaochuan, the country's central bank governor, said here Friday. The development of a digital currency should be a prudent progress and avoid excessive speculation, Zhou said at a press conference on the sidelines of the annual session of the National People's Congress. He added that the financial sector should focus on serving the real economy.


http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-03/09/c_137027034.htm


Zhou Xiaochuan stated that the development of digital currency is inevitable. The Central Bank’s research and development name is DCEP (Digital Currency Electronic Payment), DC is a digital currency, and EP is electronic payment. In the future, traditional banknotes may gradually shrink in size and may not even exist one day. However, in this whole process, we must pay attention to overall financial stability and prevent risks. As a currency, digital currency must consider the transmission mechanism of monetary policy and financial stability at the time of issuance, and at the same time pay attention to protecting consumers. As a big country economy, we must avoid making substantial irreparable losses, so we must pass thorough tests to ensure that we can promote it after it is reliable.

""Lots of cryptocurrencies have seen explosive growth which can bring significant negative impact on consumers and retail investors,"" Zhou said. ""We don't like (cryptocurrency) products that make huge opportunity for speculation that gives people the illusion of getting rich overnight.""

## My thoughts on the matter


It's still a long way away, but once a digital RMB is announced, I think it will serve to fulfil all the roles of traditional RMB with extra advantages to the banking system and the Chinese Government. The primary advantages of the digital RMB will be the ability for the Central Bank to control and monitor the flow of currency with precision, thereby obtaining more actionable data to inform monetary policy, reduce circulation costs, increase transparency and curb criminal activity (money laundering &amp; tax evasion).

I predict that the digital RMB will be closely tied to a digital identity that all Chinese citizens will need to possess, therefore money laundering and tax evasion will become extremely difficult. Following the money trail to catch criminals will become simple. In combination with the extensive CCTV network in China, committing a crime and getting away with it will be more difficult.

I feel digital RMB will probably happen within the next 5 years. The digitisation of the RMB will occur gradually and be co-ordinated by the People's Bank of China (PBOC) and the four major Chinese banks, Bank of China (BOC), the China Construction Bank (CCB), the Agricultural Bank of China (ABC), and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC). The population of China will barely realise it happening. The citizens of China will not mind the change as it is similar to their existing status quo (most transactions in 2018 are digital anyway with WeChat, AliPay, cash is rarely used). Law abiding citizens will not notice a difference in their day to day lives as the RMB they use is replaced by digital RMB.

personalfinance,Longer vs shorter loan terms with regards to investing,"So I'm looking at buying a used car and I've gotten pre-approved at my CU, these are the rates they've given me:

* 36 months @ 1.99%
* 48 months @ 2.49%
* 60 months @ 2.99%
* 72 months @ 3.49%

Now I have most or all of the cash needed to pay for the car already, but since a 1.99% loan matches inflation I can put the minimum down payment on the car and finance the rest and the inflation-adjusted cost of the loan is nothing, right? Then it's a no brainer to do that and invest the excess money (with an acceptable amount of risk) to generate a little extra income. (no there's no risk of me spending the money)

So the main question is this: Is it worth electing for a longer loan term (and therefore higher interest rate) to extend the number of years that I am able to keep the money invested? I did some spreadsheeting and it seems that for each increase of loan term, the inflation-adjusted dollars earned from investments increases. The tradeoff seems to be that the risk also increases, since clearly the 36 month loan is very close to zero risk with the right investments, whereas in order to profit from the 72 month loan I would need to have earned 1.49% annually on my investments which isn't guaranteed.

Do these calculations seem sane or have I made some grave error somewhere? And I know acceptable risk is situational but any suggestions on which loan term to pick and what sort of investments to make? Also how do accelerated loan payments play into this, if at all?

Edit: Here's the numbers I calculated for inflation-adjusted net earnings in case anyone is interested or wants to check them, with 10% yield on investments and 2% inflation:

* 36 months @ 1.99%: 13.39% of principle earned
* 48 months @ 2.49%: 16.43% of principle earned
* 60 months @ 2.99%: 18.76% of principle earned
* 72 months @ 3.49%: 20.32% of principle earned

personalfinance,Beefed Up Emergency Fund or Separate Savings?,"My fiancee works as an independent contractor and her pay tends to be very variable. There's 3-4 months of the year where she can make near double what she usually does and and then 2-3 months that get really, really slow. She's worked on trying to find extra things to fill in the gap during those months, but it's still variable. I manage her finances since her previous strategy was to spend the least amount of money possible and just hope for the best, but I'm still learning and not sure how to best approach this, especially since our expenses will be going up soon (I'm finishing school and my parents are covering a lot of the major expenses until I'm done, all she pays is rent and healthcare). 

I'm trying to figure out how much of her earnings to save to make up for slow months as opposed to saving for other things or putting into her Roth IRA (I thought that might make sense to do at the end of the year, so that way I kind of have an idea of how the whole year has gone, even though it means missing out on up to 11 months of growth). I'm also not sure how to go about this...I definitely don't want to designate it as savings for something else (it be super sad to think we've been doing great on wedding savings and then have to pull money out), but I'm not sure if there is any utility to keeping this savings either physically or separately from the EF. Should I just make sure the EF (it's in a high yield savings account) has 6-9 months in it as opposed to 3-6 months?

personalfinance,Focus on student loans or 401(k)?,"Basically, I'm about to graduate with $38k total student loans (split between 5 loans) and the weighted average interest rate is 5.14%.

My employer offers a 401(k) plan where the employer contributes 25%, up to 6% of my income.

After doing my budget, I'm estimating roughly $11,400 in ""excess"" after paying the minimum on my student loans (10yr plan) and my other expenses. 

Well according to this guy named Dave Ramsey (my sister recommended him), the priority is E-Fund &gt; Debt &gt; Mortgage &gt; Retirement. Then on the wiki flowchart for pf, they recommend matching your employer contribution as a priority before paying excess to low interest loans.

I'm curious though because I don't agree with everything he says, but I do think a lot of what he says makes sense. In addition, I'm very ignorant of the details of how a 401(k) works...therefore I don't know whether to agree or disagree with him.

From my understanding, the interest on student loans paid and the money I invest into my 401(k) are both above the line deductions (income adjustments rather than itemized). Granted 401(k) is taxed when it pay outs in retirement...

Then on average, most 401(k) investment groups have a RoI of 8% (varying greatly year to year, but long-term I would expect 8% average per year). Then on top of that, my employer contribution would be ""free money"", so I would actually see like 25% RoI on the first 6% of my income that I contribute.

So....shouldn't I just put all my excess money into my 401(k) oppose to ever paying down my loans more than the minimum?

Forex,AUD/USD Short Opportunity - Thoughts?,"Are interest rate differentials finally starting to dictate the AUD$/USD$ pair? While United States macroeconomic prospects have improved over the past couple of months, the USD$ has weakened against major G10 pairs. The USD$ weakness is surprising given that the macroeconomic improvements should warrant an appreciation in the USD$. Nonetheless, an opportunity to short the AUD/USD certainly looks attractive.

Common arguments for USD$ weakness across G10 pairs are political uncertainty, a focus on twin deficits, and attractiveness in emerging markets due to synchronous global economic growth. Although the AUD$/USD$ short has fared well since the end of January, the USD$ has yet to reach levels against the AUD$ as it had in early December.

The case for further depreciation of the AUD$ is built on the fact that interest rate differentials for AUD$/USD$ are negative and are expected to widen further. Australia’s economic growth and velocity of money are decelerating, which does not support a hawkish policy by the Reserve Bank of Australia. These key points, coupled with the improvement in the United States’ economy, should lead to an attractive trade in the short-term.",finance

I should have been saving for a down payment but I wasn't. Lease is up around the end of the year. 

I'm employed full time with between 40 and 45 hours a week depending on season. I currently make $14/hour in Northern California which is great for my age and locale. I'll be going back to school in the spring semester of 2019 while trying to maintain at least 30 hours a week to maintain my full time status.

Rent $385 (could go up do to roommate situations)

PG&amp;E $50-100 depending on season (old house terrible insulation, this would go down if I move)

All other bills/subscriptions: not more than $100 a month split between roommates and some (a lot) paid for still by my parents.

I'm looking at getting a new (not new new) car for myself and wondering what I can really afford. I'd start paying insurance on it as well so my expenses would go up for both. I have a great credit score and am sure that I could get loans with low interest rate.

Additional Info:

I don't plan on living in my hometown forever and as such am not interested in putting money into a home. I prefer something I can take with me like a nice car.

I drive a lot for fun and as such am looking for sportier cars but those come with higher insurance especially for a early twenties male.

I have ~$3,000 in savings and could get help for a down payment either through my parents or small 0% APR loans offered by my employer.

No substantial credit card debt. I pay it off every month.

personalfinance,I’m in need of 1099 help. I am a student,"Hello,

I recently got a part-time job for the spring semester and it’ll transition to full-time in the summer. On my first day, the office manager said that I would be a 1099 and not a w-2. I think legally, I should be a w-2 and can press the issue if I have to. 

However, assuming I stick as a 1099, what are the implications? I’m aware that I’ll be paying the employer portion of SS and MC/MC. I expect to make ~10k and the job could continue into my next year, and even permanent employment upon graduation. Let’s just go with the fact that I’ll be making 10k between now and August.

I’ll be taking the metro to work everyday and that’ll be roughly $5/day. Im thinking I can expense this. What else am I able to expense?

I’m living off of student loans rn (rent, living, etc. is all paid by my loans). The only things I can really think of being business related will be my metro and my occasional lunch out. Will I be able to expense anything else? 

What general advice can y’all provide? Will I have to report my earnings quarterly? Could I pay my rent with my earnings and then use my loans for personal expenses, instead of using my 1099 income, so that I could potentially expense my rent? How much should I set aside each paycheck for taxes? What total percentage (everything included: fed, state, SS, MC/MC) can I expect to pay? I’m pretty much at a loss of knowledge in this realm. 

Thanks for the help!",finance
devops,Getting Jaeger’s Java Client internal metrics into Prometheus,"We recently integrated Micrometer into the internal metrics collection mechanism for the Jaeger Java Client, making it easier to get them into Prometheus.

The Jaeger Java Client, like other Jaeger clients, already had an internal metrics mechanism for collecting data such as “number of spans started”. With the support for Micrometer included in the client version 0.25.0, it’s now easier to get this data fed into a range of backend metrics platforms supported by Micrometer, like Prometheus, JMX and/or StatsD, among others.

To demonstrate this feature, we developed a simple Vert.x application that would just accept a request on a given port, create a span, write back a “Hello” message and finish the span.

personalfinance,EFC: Am I doing this right?,"Hi I’m currently a high school senior and I was awarded a grant from my prospective college that pays for full tuition and fees. The catch is though, you must have an EFC in between $0 - $5000 to be eligible for the grant every year you file your FAFSA.

When I filed my FAFSA last October using my father’s tax return (mother is unemployed housewife) from 2016, he had an income of $27,000. And after I filled in everything else in the FAFSA, FAFSA determined my EFC as $360.

Just recently my father got back his tax return for 2017 and his income rose to about $31,000.

I’m worried that anytime during college after freshman year, I would have to take in loans or worst case, drop out in case I lose that grant. Just because I’m not eligible for aid due to my father’s increasing income.

I tried to calculate my future EFC with an EFC calculator online, but a lot of these are outdated and I don’t know my father’s federal income tax plus a lot of information that’s probably not on his 1040 tax return. (Sorry if this is a huge facepalm)

So what I did instead, was set up a proportion as 27,000/31,000 * 360/X. And by doing that, I found out that my EFC for the school year of 2019 - 2020 is probably $413.33.

economy,"If we ignore the double dip scenario that occurred shortly after the Great Depression and the contractionary fiscal policies after WW2 ended, it's quite possible we won't see another recession until 2024-2025 (15 years after the last recession ended)","And the 1948 recession was actually considered mild.  I believe the Fed has effectively stopped a double dip scenario after the Great Recession ended in June 2009 via quantitative easing.  This scenario opens up the possibility of a 15 year expansion, which would be historically long, but compared to the severity of the recession and the slowness of the recovery, would be understandable.

This all assumes the Fed doesn't make a policy mistake by tightening too fast or too slow, which is what the market seems to be fixated on lately.  The Fed has learned so much over the past 30-60 years they are in a better position than they were after the great depression to avoid the mistakes of their predecessors.  Expansionary fiscal policy is also making their job easier to tighten slightly faster than the market was anticipating, which will set them up nicely to lower rates from a reasonably high level during the next recession.",finance

personalfinance,Student Loan Struggle - Looking For Advice,"Good evening!

I've been a lurker here for some time now, but recent events have me in a bit of a panic so I thought I should post and ask for the assistance of those here who are already accomplished, or otherwise much better with money than I have proven to be.

I did not make good decisions when I tried to go to college.  I had my priorities all wrong, especially for someone going to school on private student loans.

Fast forward six years from when I stopped being able to go to my university, and now I'm staring a Stafford subsidised and unsubsidized loan (amounting to ~$8,000), and 7 private student loans (~$132,000) ranging from 9% to 14.625% APR, in the face.  I had about $880 on a credit card that I paid off before it began to accrue interest, and about $3,600 in PayPal Credit from a desktop computer build, a laptop when mine died, and miscellany I couldn't afford to get in one go, but decided to pay off over the course of 12 months.  I had made these decisions anticipating that my student loan servicer would continue to work with me.

I had been working with my student loan servicer, but they have decided that my monthly income is enough to pay them the contractual payment (at the full interest rate (they had me on a reduced rate repayment plan up until December - they denied the renewal and I didn't receive notification until last Thursday, at which point I drained one savings account to pay their ""past due"" amount and partially drained another in order to start paying things down)).  I budgeted down to be able to do that, but not a whole lot else.  I won't be able to take any sort of time off for illness or other reasons, and I'll be screwed if I lose one of my jobs.

About a year ago I was looking into bankrupting the loans, until I found out that I would very likely lose the case to discharge them.  Another stupid mistake I made: while contemplating the bankruptcy, I  was not paying them.  I didn't ask at the right time whether or not they would work with me, and I assumed it was an all or nothing kind of deal.  (Their call center agents made mention that they had plans, but wouldn't talk to me about them until I was out of deferment or forbearance.)

I'm currently working between 58.5 and 70 hours a week at two jobs (12 hour shifts, one job rotates between 3 &amp; 4 day weeks).  I commute to both, averaging about 2,000 miles a month on my car, and I bring home about $3400 a month on average after taxes (might be a little more since I'm bumping my hours by 4 starting this month).  I try to save $200 a month, half in an emergency fund and half in a fund to hopefully move out of my parents home, where I live rent free.  That has a time limit - my parents expect to retire and move out of state in 7 years or so.

I'm looking for some advice on how to get out of this hole.  Is there anything I can do?  My parents were talking about charging me rent to bring my disposable income down for the reduced rate plan calculation, but then applying that money to the student loan debt on my behalf.  I don't know if that's possible, or legal in this case.  I'm also concerned about their finances if they choose to do it this way.  They would have to claim that as income and that could screw them over in the long run.

I would also like to move into an apartment, but I don't know if I can tell the lender that I'm expecting a cost of approximately x dollars a month, can we work with that, because they now want my bank statement since they denied me to show the numbers.  It feels like I have to already be in a bad situation before they'll work with me, and I don't like putting myself in those situations so that I can ask for assistance and hope I get the assistance I need, because what happens when I don't get that assistance?

I'm also, in my free time, looking at getting certifications that will help me boost my income.  By my basic calculations, if I bring in $100,000 a year (bringing in $56k before taxes currently, all said and done), I could throw half my monthly at that debt.  But I don't have a clear path for getting there, especially without a degree.

Any advice would be appreciated.  Because I don't have a degree, refinancing is difficult.  The best I've found is $90,000, and depending on the interest rate it might bring the total payment down $200 a month.  But that's a big maybe.",finance

investing,Rising government debt - how does it play out?,"Rising government debt - how does it play out?a few seconds ago | Post #3916533
I am concerned about the rising US government debt and wondering how it may play out.  Mostly I am wondering how to protect my portfolio value going forward.  I can't see a good path forward, particularly if interest rates rise significantly.  For example what happens if rates rise 2 or 3% from where they are now?  How does the US service the projected next year deficit of 1.2 trillion with another 400 to 600 billion in interest on top of that?  Long term, it just doesn't seem like a sustainable situation.

I can think of 3 possible scenarios if the US debt becomes unmanageable and welcome thoughts about any other scenarios.  

1.  US prints money to finance the debt leading to inflation.

2.  VAT of ~5-8% seems the only way to come up with kind of money to pay the interest if rates rise.

3.  Some type of run on the dollar/debt leading to a crisis.

I have overweighted my portfolio compared to most in assets that that are denominated in foreign currencies (international/emerging market stock and bond funds) and a gold etf and miners fund to try to have a diversified portfolio.  I am wondering if there are other asset classes or stratagies worth looking at if any of the above scenarios play out.  Thank you.",finance

personalfinance,I have an emergency fund and can finally start saving! What now...,"After years of living paycheck to paycheck, i'm finally at the point in my life where I have an emergency fund, and can begin saving.  But I am at a complete loss of *what* to do about it, as well as how to go about handling said emergency fund.

To preface, any help in regards to any of the questions posed would be very much appreciated!  I am debating looking into going to a financial adviser for consultation, but I figured I would stop here first.

&amp;nbsp;

My two main questions are:

&amp;nbsp;

**1)  Is it feasible to invest my emergency fund savings into a high-liquidity account that offers competitive interest rates?**

According to the Wiki, CD's and I-Bonds are the recommended safe investment options that offer non-abysmal return rates.  However, in my scenario, I am debating the efficacy of this.  My understanding is that the liquidity of the investment is *very* important for it to be deemed as a safe emergency fund.  I completely agree with this.  However, the risk tolerance is where i'm a bit hazy in regards to my personal situation.  I cannot find a reason as to why it would not be more worthwhile to invest my emergency fund in a high-liquidity personal investment fund (i.e. Index Funds, Stocks, etc.).

The two main points defined as an emergency fund, as I understand, are the following

* Funds should be liquid ✔

* Funds should provide 3-6 months living expenses ✔-ish

By setting up an independent investment account, the only factor I would be risking from not guaranteeing satisfaction is the 3-6 months living expenses requirement.  However, the plan I am mulling over is to immediately contribute the bulk of my emergency fund ($3,500.00) to a personal investment fund, keeping the $500 for immediate cash requirements.  From there on, I would continue to contribute at a rate of somewhere ~$100.00-200.00/month to this fund.

My thought is that, even with contributing $100.00/month, by the end of the year, my investment account will have been funded $4,700.00.  Now, this would obviously be high-risk money as it is dependent on the market, however, even if I were to take a horrific scenario (-30.00%) and apply that to my investment portfolio, I would still be left with $3,790.00 + $500.00 ($4,290.00) - 3 months worth of expenses.

The only scenario that would be absolutely terrible is the scenario where I were to invest this money and shortly after the market crashes and I become unemployed.  At a loss of 30.00%, i'd basically be losing a whole months worth of expenses in the blink of an eye while losing my source of income.

However, I think, in my scenario, this is a risk that does not necessarily need to be accounted for.  The reasons being:

* I have over 4 years working in a high-demand field (software development), so finding new employment would *hopefully* be relatively easy

* I have family to fallback on in case of absolute worst-case scenario

* The company I work for is in *very* good financial standings

* I do not foresee any type of employment termination within at least the next 12 months

&amp;nbsp;

**2)  For future savings, what type of account should I invest in?**

Barring anything in relation to the first question, *how* should I be investing extra money?  My ultimate goal is to build a liquid portfolio of *now* money.  I am currently leaning towards some type of personal investment fund.

In regards to 401k, as I can see some arguing to max out my 401k before anything.  My rebuttal is that I am currently at about 10k/year on my 401k contributions and am 23 years old w/20k balance.  I plan on increasing my 401k contributions roughly 1% for every 5% increase in pay until it is maxed out, with a minimum increase of 1%/year.  According to all of the math that I have done, my 401k balance by the time I am 65 will be *MORE* than enough with my current contributions and my contribution increase plan.  Based on statistics in my field (software development), and my contribution plan, i *should* be maxing out my 401k before i'm 30.

So, i would prefer to have money now for things like home improvements, quality of life, etc.  

&amp;nbsp;

BONUS

**3)  Should I use my emergency fund to immediately pay off my $544.22 student loan @ 6.550% interest?**

Seems like this could be a good idea to me.  With the amount of extra money from income that I am receiving, and my spending habits, I would be able to replenish the $544.22 in ~4-6 weeks.

I've ready some archived posts but have yet to find my answer. Here we go!

Just bought my very first car and I got my first loan. I initially was going to pay cash but didn't want to wipe out my e fund and I didn't want to be considered a first time buyer. 

Car is a 2017 USED. I put 20k down and financed 7k. Sadly the interest rate was 6.99% and I'm a dope but I don't feel like refinancing it at the moment. I financed it for 36 months. 

I have had one credit card for a little over a year with a limit of 1k. No real debt cause I use it for gas and pay it in full every month. Credit score is 755. This is the only credit I have since I'm new to adulting. 

I want to raise my credit score but not sure what the best bet is. I wanted to buckle down and pay it off in 12 months but I want repayment history to look good. What do you all suggest?

I could pay off the loan today but I would completely wipe out my emergency fund so that's out of the question. 

Thanks!

Edit: thanks everyone, I'm obviously naive to this and am too concerned about my credit score. Glad I asked this question.",finance

personalfinance,I am considering taking a loan out on my 401k to pay off my car and get some cash in my savings. Is this a bad idea? I'm desperate.,"I am in a really bad place financially and I would greatly appreciate any advice you can offer. Basically I am just plain spending more money than I bring in with nothing left to cut out. I am sinking deeper and deeper each month and it has me constantly depressed. I made a little plan to get on the right foot- but I wanted to run it by some folks who are more knowledgeable than I am. 

I make about $16 an hour in a very low COL area. My actual take home pay after deductions averages out to only about $1600 a month because of a previous 401k loan I had to take out to fund a custody dispute a few years ago. If I add up my expenses and only include the essentials (rent, utilities, car, gas, groceries, insurance, prescriptions, doctor copay, internet, child support) the total is $1650. 

What I am considering is using my tax refund to pay off the $800 balance on my current 401k loan and getting another $4000 loan so I can pay off my car ($2000 balance) and put the remaining $2000 in my savings. This would eliminate my car payment and allow me to switch to liability insurance- saving about $250 a month for me. 

The reason I want to put some in savings is I am being killed by late fees every month. I need to get caught up on everything so I can stop taking steps backwards and start walking forward. My car and the 401k loan are both 8% interest rates- so wouldn't it be better to just have the 1 interest rate that is being paid back to me?

I could probably get a higher paying job but I would have to give up time with my daughter so that is something I really really do not want to do. My schedule allows me to have her half the week which is very important to me. 

Any advice you can give would be extremely appreciated. I am horrible at these things and I really need to get control of this. Thank you!",finance
personalfinance,Possible Fraud During Debt Consolidation,"I'm in the middle of a strange situation and I'd like to know if this is normal or not. About two weeks ago, I went into the bank with my wife to open up a second checking account to have separate bills / spending accounts. This was fine, but then the bank employee began asking us about our debt situation. We do have some credit card debt, approximately $6,800. 

We are currently working towards paying that off by the end of the year, and financially it's our number one priority. So the banker proposed that we consolidate our debt onto one card with a 0% interest since we could pay off the full balance in a year. This sounded great and aligned with the advice I've been getting from here - if you can avoid or lower your interest rates, there's rarely a reason not to.

Here's where it takes a turn though. He offered us a credit card from the same bank that our current credit cards with the debt are from. He said normally the bank doesn't even allow this, but he could open up the new card and send us a check for the amount of the credit limit. We could then use that check to pay off our existing cards, transferring the balance to the new one. I thought this was weird, as I like to really do things by the book, but the offer of no interest was very appealing so we agreed to do this.

We have still not received the check in the mail, so finally today we called the bank. They said this employee no longer works there, they have no record of a check being sent to us, and furthermore that they would never send a check to the people with the debt - they would send it to the company that the balance was owed to directly.

We have a pending transaction on the new card for $6,800, no check in sight, and still have our $6,800 balance on our other credit cards - effectively doubling or debt. We already called and reported this charge as fraudulent and the bank will be looking into it. My questions are:

1) Is this a normal practice in debt consolidation at all?
2) Is there any chance that I'll get stuck with this double debt?
3) What can I do to further prove that this is what happened? 

Thanks in advance. I've been really excited about paying my debt off this year, and I'd like to get over this roadblock.",finance

Rowe Price will either send me the full amount and I take the tax responsibility or I instruct them to send the taxes directly to the Federal Government prior to distribution at a default percentage of 10% or another percentage that I may specify.

Any suggestions to appropriately share both the proceeds and the tax liability with my sister?",finance
personalfinance,Federal Income Tax Audit,"Last year I received an audit notice from the IRS regarding misc deductions from my 2014 federal return. I just received notice of an audit regarding misc deductions from my 2015 federal return.

  I was working as an electrician in Oklahoma and Texas for one company during this time period. I was living out of motels and a camper. I had to use my personal vehicle, buy my own fuel, specialty clothing and tools without reimbursement for any of it. 

  Last year I sent in receipts and a milage log. The IRS requested I send in proof from the company that there was not any reimbursement or compensation program for fuel, clothing, tools ect. I sent a letter from the company and the IRS accepted everything that I had receipts for (I was missing a receipt for 1 rv park and a couple tools).

  I have receipts and a milage log for 2015 to send in but this year the company has told me their company policy is to not provide anything with their letterhead on it.

Is there any way to get the IRS to look at the audit from last year to see I have already provided proof of the company's reimbursement policy? I still have the letter but it is dated last year and the contact person on the letter is no longer with the company as of a month ago.",finance

I received a scholarship which pays for tuition, room and board and meals.

Why is this happening? The scholarships or grants I received, I didn't actually pocket myself or even use them myself. They were automatically used to pay for tuition/room and board/ and meals, so why is it causing my taxable income to increase so much?

Do I have to include the 1098-T form?",finance

personalfinance,"My wife's school loan payment plan is outrageously high, how can I get it lowered to a reasonable number?","Hey everyone,

Longtime lurker, first time poster.  I'll try to keep this brief but there are several key facts I need to go over.  My wife and I have been happily married for 5 years, we're both 29.  For the last 5 years she has been paying back her student loans which are substantial (100K+)from her masters and several certifications.  She and I are both civil servants, her a family counselor and myself a teacher.

Because of this we both have been on the Federal Employee Student Loan Repayment Program for the past 6 years and only have 4 years remaining on it to have it completely forgiven(https://www.myfederalretirement.com/public/340.cfm).

I make about 41K and my wife makes about 45K a year.  Last year her repayment plan was about $350 a month which was well within our budget.  But last year we decided to file together.  After that my wife was given a notification that because of our combined income her monthly amount would be $1300 a month.  I was told that we should file separately so that it'll lower the costs of her loans.  However my wife has not done hers yet so- as promised they pulled $1300 from her bank account about 2 days ago.  

I told my wife to call them, but she's afraid because each call is $100 under a ""courtesy fee"" to have your rates adjusted, but I told her I would pay it myself for her.  That all being said.  What should be the best course of action?  From what I can gather we should do her taxes immediately, filed separately.  Call the people, pay the $100 courtesy fee and request a lower rate.  And since there is only 4 more years of this nightmare number, if we can run out the clock on the lightest payment plan back that still holds to the policy, the better.  

I know that many of you are much more knowledgeable on this and have probably gone through similar stories so anything would be beneficial.  And if you have any financing tips for us that might be relevant it would also be greatly appreciated.  If you need anymore information I will happily update and respond.  Thank you in advance.  

Edit: Thank you everyone for all your great suggestions.  I'm heading out to go do some of them right now.",finance
personalfinance,Student Loans and Credit Score,"I'm 21 and just recently graduated College and started a decently well paying job. I have about $58,000 in private loans with ~9% APR. I also have about $4,000 in federal loans. I haven't started paying back either. I graduated early and I think I don't have a payment due till July. I also have two open credit cards. My credit score is usually around 750, but my utilization habits changed recently.

I had a $12,000 credit line for a while and spent about $1,500 a month. I've never carried a balance. I recently closed my newest card to avoid paying the ridiculous yearly fee (CSR). My credit line dropped to $2000 but my utilization stayed the same. On my last credit report my score went from 750 down to 698. 

I'd like to refinance my student loans before I start paying them off, and I'd like to have the best credit score possible before doing so. I already called one of my credit cards and got credit line increase (Made sure they didn't do a hard pull before doing so). Besides not using my card as much, what can I do to raise my credit score?

I can afford to pay the $4k loan off in its entirety right now. It's my most recent account since I just took the loan out last semester. I've heard mixed things about paying loans off early.",finance

The highest interest rate on one of my loans is 5.06% ($2.7k balance as of now). I have been so intense at paying off these student loans, per Dave Ramsey's Baby Steps program, that I haven't even considered the alternative: taking that extra cash and building a 6 month emergency fund instead, which would be about $12k (even though it's against the order of the DRBS program).

The budget grows, but there are tax cuts so less revenue coming in - how are they going to get the money? Not sure how much more you'd be able to loan from other countries, so my best guess would be the FED and just have them print the money and in turn inflate the dollar even more than it currently is.

personalfinance,(US) Savings Account Help,"This may be a simple thing that I'm overthinking but I have some questions about my savings account.

I have just started a savings account with an initial deposit of $500. In the disclosure my bank gave me it says the interest rate is .1000% and APY is .10%. The disclosure also has a section called ""COMPOUNDING AND CREDITING"" and it reads: ""Interest will be compounded quarterly and credited to the account quarterly."" There is another section titled ""BALANCE COMPUTATION METHOD"" and it reads: ""We use the daily balance method to calculate interest in your account. This method applies a periodic rate to the average daily balance in the account for the period. The average daily balance is calculated by adding the principal in the account for each day of the period and dividing that figure by the number of days in the period.""

I want to make an excel spreadsheet that shows the balance after each quarter of the year but I think I am doing it wrong because it is showing different balances than some of the online savings calculators I found. I was wondering if anyone knows any excel templates that I can use or point me in the right direction of what I need to do on excel. I will also be depositing $50/month to this savings account.

personalfinance,Sister has $48k in CC debt. Is Consumer Credit Counseling Service a scam?,"First I have followed pf for a while and I looked into the wiki's but I was not able to find much on the subject of Consumer credit counseling services.  Most of what i found was after you have gone into debt collections. But if i missed it, please can someone direct me to a proper post that discusses pro/cons of these places?

Now to the facts: obviously mistakes were made and she is coming to terms with them.  What got her in this trap was she took a $20k pay cut about 8 years ago and didn't adjust.
I am coaching her through this following pf's flow chart.  She now has a savings for emergencies (first time in 8 years she said!). Her mandatory budget is pretty reasonable I think (rent, heat, elec, internet/cable is about 30% net monthly income ($3k net a month)).   Now we are on to tackling the different debts,first up are the credit cards (We are still working on finding second/third job as well as reducing budget). 

She has great credit and has not defaulted on anything, but the minimums are killing her and obviously making little meaningful progress. So she took it upon her self to visit a Consumer Credit Counseling Service of ""the city she lives in"". They are claiming that they can reduce her monthly payment by $202 a month (from just the minimum the CCs charging). I did the amortization tables and she would save 6 months (if she stayed paying the current minimums and not reducing over time) and about $14k over the life of the loans (even with their $35/month fee) (I did not account for any NPV, just using today's money).  They claim the 4 different credit card debts interest rate would range from 1.25% to 4% (currently they range from 13% to 19%).  I had her ask a number of questions to the lady helping her, and they all came back positive/truthful (no penalty for paying off early, she cannot miss a payment or else a credit card company could forgo the deal, it will show up on credit report that she is doing this service (if she needed credit they would issue a letter saying she was in good standing), and it would negatively affect credit in short term (as these cards would be closed), there are no other fees or restrictions to be aware of.)

My understanding is this non for profit company literally is charging $35 a month to negotiate with credit card companies and provide coaching to people to get out of debt.  This seems very ""too good to be true"", so i am wondering what I am missing.  Oh an top of it all, they said that they wouldn't even let her do this until she could show another $200 in monthly income, because the numbers were too close and they like to have safety.

So thank you for reading, and this first post but I think I followed all rules, but if not please let me know where I veered and I will correct.

investing,"If someone has 100% cash right now, should they wait until the recession to invest?","Hey, 

So a friend of mine has quite a bit of savings, all cash. They've been sitting on it for years and years. I've been trying to convince him that he needs to do something with it. In the long run, my recommendation is just to have a buy-and-hold profile consisting of a few of the standard ETFs and some bonds. 

But my guess is that, since we're near the end of the cycle, it would be a bad idea to buy all-in now. My gut is to say something like: once the market drops around 15%, start buying a chunk of the ETFs you want to hold every 2 weeks until you've bought in. 

The other issue is bonds. Obviously bonds are in a bad spot right now. Am I wrong to say, though, that bonds are *not* worse than cash or money market, though? Would it be bad advice to advise him to start gradually buying into bonds later in the year, once we're farther along in the rate hike + fed bond selling process?  

Hopefully these questions aren't *too* hard to answer. I'm just trying to set him up with a basic set of investments that he can largely ignore until he's ready to get professional advice, and so on, but I feel like it's obviously bad advice to tell him to buy in at the tail end of this cycle.

personalfinance,How is my financial situation [28] and did I make a good choice in buying a new car? - I have been reading for 6 months and tried to apply the principals here to my life,"Hello, I have been browsing this forum for 6 months and it changed my life. I am 28 years old and live with my mom, and she helped pay for my college and for some other things. I am trying to make my way in the world, I have an analyst job making about $44,000 and a side job at a grocery store making $10,000. I am not the smartest person but I'm trying my best and living at home to save money.

I have had many cosmetic surgeries due to being transgender, facial surgery, 3 hair transplants, and breast implants. I paid at least half, my mom paid some for the facial surgery, and insurance covered some of the surgery. I feel I look more like a woman now so I feel that goal is achieved, now I need to lose weight. I admit this has been a HUGE expense but I have felt transgender my whole life and I don't want to get more into that but it has been a huge expense but it's over as of March 2018. No more surgeries, now it's on me to get in good shape, get better clothes, wear better makeup. I'm done.

In September 2017 I had $7300 in an old 401k, and $15,000 in the bank (money I got back from the facial surgery insurance reimbursed). I read this forum and put $5500 into a vanguard IRA, and since then I have set aside $12,000 of income into two new 401k's (for my current job and side job). So my retirement is about $25,000 right now. I also paid $5800 for that third hair transplant I mentioned (will be my last cosmetic surgery), which ate into my savings.

When I was 19 my mom bought me a 2009 Toyota Corolla and it had 18,000 miles on it. I drove it into the ground (I live far away from college and most jobs) and it has about 200,000 miles now and last night the check engine light came on. I brought it into the dealership today and got the bad news that it needed a new engine. I didn't want to pay $5000 for an engine with 82,000 miles on the engine plus whatever it would cost to replace other parts wearing down, and I had just paid $2000 in the fall to fix shit in my car.

I decided to buy a new car, a 2016 Toyota Corolla with 10,500 miles on it. I have $5500 in the bank presently and the car cost $15,000 ($16,102 after taxes), and on Monday will pay $5000 cash and the rest in a loan. My interest rate is 4.39%. I also bought for $2000 the vehicle service agreement so if major problems occur until August 2023 or I hit 100,000 miles, I will be covered. I also paid for a GPS service that tracks my car if it gets stolen, and I paid about $1500 for two services that I believe are mostly for keeping the interior and exterior of my car in good shape (this might have been a waste I feel paranoid). I get 10 of these services over 5 years.

So all in all I took out a $16,000 loan and paid $5000 cash for about $21,000 for the car (including Mass sales tax). Do you think I am okay? Did I overpay for this car or is this a good deal? I wanted a car that is fuel efficient, reliable, and a decent price. I work from home heavily now so I drive 10,000-12,000 miles a year instead of the 20,000 I was driving before, and I was an aggressive driver when I was younger and I will commit to being more tender and careful with this new car.

As of now, I am making hopefully $54,000 this year, I have $500 in the bank (bad), no credit card debt, this $16,000 loan for 5 years, and $25,000 in retirement. I live at home and have low expenses outside of these expenses. I want to pay off the car this year, there is no early penalty to paying off the car quickly if I so choose. Should I still contribute to my 401k and IRA this year (other than so I can reach the employer match), or just pay off the loan ASAP?",finance

personalfinance,Am I missing some benefit of 529 plans? They seem like a bum deal to me.,"Ever since I found that IRA contributions can be used penalty-free for education expenses, I've been eyeing that for my son's college savings.  If I use my Roth contribution for that college savings I have tax free distributions to pay for it, and if he doesn't go to college I have it as extra retirement savings.

The 529 plan would be exempt from federal taxes (same as Roth) but it seems like only a select few states have any state tax benefit.  My residency is a bit fluid but as near as I can tell any state of interest to me either has no tax benefit (such as CA) or the state has no income tax anyway (such as TX or FL).  On top of that, if my son ended up not going to college or college isn't as expensive as anticipated, there's a 10% penalty + no tax benefit on whatever is left!  A 10% penalty I don't have to deal with on the Roth.

This is all on top of additional fees I wouldn't be paying in a Roth, and more limited investment options.

So without a state tax benefit, and the additional 10% penalty, is there ANY positive to using a 529 plan over a Roth IRA?  It seems like a pretty clear cut advantage to me, yet nearly every article I read regarding using an IRA for college savings suggests a 529 instead, but I'm not seeing the benefit.  The only values I can see in favor of a 529 are if I wanted to contribute more than $5500 annually to his college fund or that I wanted to prioritize my retirement savings more (but I'm still under max 401k contribution so it feels like something I don't need to worry about yet).",finance
personalfinance,Stupid Question about Auto Loan,"I need to buy a new car this week (the transmission on my '99 started dying last night). 


I'm 21 (short credit history) and have a credit score around 775.


I can get a loan through Penfed, hopefully with an APR lower than what I can get at the dealership.


Do I apply for the loan today, before I go to the dealership? Or do I do it at the dealership after I have a specific car I'm gonna buy?


I'm not sure, because when I apply online they want numbers and I'm not entirely sure what car I'm going to buy and how much I can get for a trade in, if any.",finance

personalfinance,Owe $1K in taxes - IRS payment plan or charge to new credit card?,"Hi, team! I'm 25 and this is the firs time I've owed money. I owe just over $1K in state and federal taxes. I do not have the cash to pay it outright so I need to either do the IRS payment plan or charge it to my new credit card at 0% interest (I don't know when the promo period ends).

I'm reluctant to use the card because I'm working hard to decrease my credit card utilization (currently at 98%), but I also am not interested in the compound interest and payment plan fees through the IRS. I can't afford a payment of more than $100 per month either way.

So, what would you suggest - charge it and increase my already too high credit card utilization rate, or suck it up and get on the IRS payment plan?

Additional info: 25 year old woman living with my boyfriend in a mid-size city. Master's degree and a full-time nonprofit job plus a part-time contract position. Two open credit cards, one closed (on a debt management plan) and $70K in student loans.",finance
personalfinance,"I'm coming into a small windfall, should I pay off my interest free debt, or save the money? Also, how do I better prepare myself for my future?","Hi everyone, as the title states, I will be coming into a decent amount of money in the near future, and I am trying to decide what I should be doing with that. Here's a bit of background:


Age: 22 - Female

Location: Medium Cost of Living Area in the Midwest (US).

Salary: $45,000 per Year

Take-Home Pay: $2,150 per Month

I am coming into this money through selling my house. After paying back my principal to my dad, interest owed, and split the profits with him, I will be getting $12,000 in about a week. I am also getting my tax refund in another week or so, which is an additional $2,500. I also currently have $1,000 in my savings account, for a grand total of $15,500.

My current 401K balance is about $12,000 (50/50 split between traditional and roth)

My current Roth IRA balance is about $132,000.

I currently have 3 credit cards that I would like to get paid off before the end of 2018.
&gt; Credit Card 1: $1,340 @ 26.99% Interest

&gt; Credit Card 2: $3,800 @ 00.00% Interest until December 2018

&gt; Credit Card 3: $1,000 @ 00.00% Interest until December 2018

So I know that I should for sure pay off the first card since it has an extremely high interest rate, so that will be taken care of as soon as possible. I'm not sure if I should pay of the interest free debt though? Should I just stager it out into monthly payments, or is it best to take care of it all at once?

A large portion of this debt has come from past mistakes, so I have been tackling the debt over the past 4 months, and I haven't added to it at all, in fact it's gone from about $8,500 over 5 credit cards down to about $6,000 over 3 cards, so I am pleased with my current progress.

Here is my monthly budget:

&gt; Roth IRA Contribution: $450

&gt; Groceries &amp; Toiletries:  $300

&gt; Rent: $200

&gt; Electric, Water, Sewer: $175 (Average Bill)

&gt; Fuel &amp; Car Washes: $100

&gt; Dining &amp; Entertainment: $100

&gt; Spending Money: $100 (Clothing, Work Events, Etc.)

&gt; Gifts: $75 (Birthday's &amp; Christmas for 8 People)

&gt; Hair Appointments: $75

&gt; Internet: $65

&gt; Natural Gas: $60 (Average Bill)

&gt; TV Service: $45 (This will be going down to $35/Mo. in June)

&gt; Cat Related Costs: $35

&gt; Netflix &amp; Hulu: $25

&gt; Gym Membership: $25 ($20/Mo. is reimbursed through my employer.)

&gt; Cell Phone: $25 (Device Payment)

&gt; Renters Insurance: $10

I currently have a monthly surplus of approximately $305. Also, the actual costs based on my budget have actually been about 5% lower on average, so the surplus is actually around $395 per month. I know I could also work on cutting costs down in some areas as well, I would like to be able to lower my costs by about 7.5% of budget, so I am working on that right now currently. That surplus is currently going towards paying down my debt.

I moved in with my boyfriend in the Summer of 2017, things have been going very well for us. We agreed to split our costs as outlined above. I pay for all the groceries and utilities, as well as contribute $200 to our ""House Fund"", he takes care of the property taxes, mortgage, and home insurance.

My employer matches 25% up to 8% for my 401K (so 2%). I am currently contributing 7% (+2% match for a total of 9%) into my Traditional 401K, and I am also contributing 9% into my Roth 401K. January 1st of every year I will be increasing my contribution by 1% each, to hopefully stay in line with my pay increases. 

I plan on staying at my current job for at least 4-5 more years, maybe even longer. I should finish my Bachelor's in the Spring of 2020. Then I will go on to complete my Master's degree after that.

I can expect 2.50%-3.50% raises annually. I will also start receiving a bonus of 3% of my salary in employee stock beginning January 1 of 2019.

My dad currently pays for my books &amp; tuition. He also pays for my car insurance. That will continue until the Spring of 2020 when I graduate. My employer will pay for $2,000 of tuition per year for my Master's degree, and my dad will pay for the difference. 

My only shorter term goals for right now is to purchase a new SUV in the Spring of 2021 (hopefully in cash) and to have a 6 month emergency fund. A longer term goal would be that my boyfriend and I would like to build a house in the next 10-12 years (depending on the real estate market at the time), so we would like to build up some savings for that.


My questions are, how much should I be putting away for retirement? I heard that 15% is the ""standard"" but I feel like that's not enough. I would like to be financially independent around age 45, and have the ability to retire around age 50, and go work part time or volunteer in an industry I enjoy.

Should I still be contributing to my Roth 401K even though I have a sizable Roth IRA? I figure that (hopefully) I'll be making more in retirement than I am currently, so since I'm in the now 12% tax bracket, it will be beneficial for me in the future. There's also the uncertainty of the future though as well where who knows what the tax laws will look like.

Is it worth it to take a high paying, less enjoyable job while you're young to bump up savings for retirement? Right now I kind of have the ""dream job"" in my industry, so I'm a little afraid to give that up for something with higher pay and a better retirement plan if I don't really need it.

TL;DR: Lots of credit card debt, coming into a small windfall. I needs help deciding what to pay off, or what to with the money, and my financial future.",finance
personalfinance,"150$ in 1099-MISC income, do I really need to file a 1040 instead of a 1040EZ?","I'm helping my mother file her taxes. I like to use H&amp;R block's online tax software. Filing a 1040EZ as a W2 wage earner is free like a lot of other tax software so that's what I like about it.

My mom participated in this health-awareness thing last year at her job where they paid employees to get a physical and fill out a health survey. This money was given to employees in the form of a gift card. the 1099-MISC she got from it reports it as $150 under box 3.

I can't file for free with hr block if I have to add 1099 income because I have to file a 1040 instead of a 1040EZ. So instead of paying nothing now I'm paying $70 for fed + state. 

Is this the only choice I have? It was only 150 bucks. Other than printing the 1040 off and filling it out, then mailing it in, is there any other option to avoid the $70 upcharge?

My wife and I are in early 40s and still have 20 or more years of working life left. We don’t have any debt except mortgage and I think I should continue to pay monthly minimum on 15-year mortgage and invest in market to generate 7 to 10% return instead of pre-paying 3% mortgage. We have two cars – both paid in full. We do not anticipate any major expense in near future. We may have to replace one of the 10-year-old car but I prefer to buy a new car at 0% or 0.9% interest rate and continue to invest money to generate higher rate of return. 

Am I making any mistakes? What should I change if any as I look at 2018 and beyond? I really appreciate your advice and help.",finance
personalfinance,Using Retirement Fund to Pay Off Credit Card Debt,"Here is my situation:

Currently have ~3k in credit card debt.  I also have student loan debt, ~4.5k, but have been focusing on paying off credit card debt first as it has the higher interest rate (Student loan is fixed 3.3%, CC is 11-23% variable).

A couple years ago I worked with a company in Maine and put about 7k into a 401k.  I recently received a notice that the company will be switching 401k providers, and I need to make a decision on what to do with my very meager account.  This is a company that I will never be working with again, due to their location and my current career path.  Right now I am back working at a company that I've worked for before, am vested at, and have a large state retirement fund that I am continuing to put matched money into. 

Would it be worth my while to cash out that small 7k account that I have to pay off my CC debt, and then put the money I am currently putting towards my CC towards my student loans?  These are the only two debts I have.",finance

But reasonable minds can disagree and I can still respect them and not assume they’re on some anti-crypto jihad. Grow the fuck up guys.  

Relatedly, I think you’re grossly overestimating bitcoin’s importance in the current financial system. Bitcoin remains a drop inside a drop in the global economy bucket. People are much, much more interested in how the fed will unwind QE and whether they’ll boost rates three times this year. Plus, you know, financial assets that represent legal claims on the cash flows of actual irl businesses.

personalfinance,Tax/money management for summer internship [20 y.o.],"Hi everyone,  
  
  
So I'm headed off to my first 12-week paid internship, which is based in Ohio. My permanent address/family is in California, but I attend college in Pennsylvania (and I'm registered to vote there, if that matters?). Because of college, I do spend the majority of the year in Pennsylvania, only going back to California for maybe two months out of the year. My parents are supporting me through college (paying for tuition and living expenses, bless them) and I work a few hours at an on-campus job every week for about minimum wage (which I don't earn enough to pay taxes on). I am claimed as a dependent when they file taxes.  
  
  
So...taxes. Because of the multiple states involved, I'm not sure what to do. I've done some quick Googling, and it seems like I'd be filing in both Ohio and California, but since I'm also a dependent, I'm not sure how that affects things. I'd also like to get an idea of how much I should set aside to pay federal/state taxes, as well as some money management tips considering my future plans (will detail more below).  
  
  
Expected total income: $13,663 (salaried, paid every two weeks)  
  
* Will receive a lump sum relocation package, not sure how much it will be, but I heard it might be enough to cover housing  
  
  
Estimated expenses:  
  
- Housing (total, including electric/Internet/etc.): $2,370  
  
- Food: $600 ($50/week groceries)  
  
- Transportation: $300 ($50/2 weeks gas)  
  
- Social/Entertainment: $300  
  
- Big Purchase 1 (new laptop): $1,500-$2,000  
  
- Big Purchase 2 (new bike): $700-1,000  
  
Total expenses: $6,570  
  
  
Leftover: $7,093 (assuming I pay housing, $2k for laptop, $1k for bike)  
  
  
My first thought is to put $3,000 in a Roth IRA with a Vanguard Target Date Fund (as per sidebar advice) and put the rest in my checking account. However I've also read things about just keeping everything liquid (since it's relatively not that much) since I'm still young and might need it for life experiences.  
  
  
More information on my finances:  
  
- Checking: ~$3,000  
  
- School year expenses (paid by me): $200-300/month  
  
- Student loans: $14,000 as of right now, expect about $30,000 by the time I graduate (all federal loans, no interest until 6 months after I graduate)  
  
  
More information about my future plans:  
  
- Planning for all of the following senior trips after graduating: travelling to Japan with friends, cross-country road trip, and week-long+ bikepacking trip (would like to start setting aside money for this)  
  
- Currently a sophomore engineering major. Will at least graduate with a master's though (school has fifth year master's program). Average salary (from school statistics) for a BS would be around $70,000. I would guess the MS is maybe $75,000.  
  
- Seriously considering pursuing a PhD in robotics. If I were to go for a PhD, I would want to work in industry R&amp;D after. As far as I know (from talking to PhD students), tuition would be covered by grants and I would receive a stipend for living expenses throughout my education.  
  
  
Questions:  
  
- How do I handle taxes/what should I expect?  
  
- What should I do with the leftover money from my internship?

I really enjoyed reading through the Wiki. However I  felt that it didn't handle my circumstances well in that it ended basically around mega backdoor roth. I totally understand why however I was hoping for more advice.


My pf info:  

 * 25 yo  
 * Living in CA, USA  
 * No dependents but family may need support in the future  
 * CS, Econ double major (hopefully some understanding of finance)  
 * Earning ~250k (varies year to year by ~10k)  
 * ~30-40k (varies per month) in a couple of bank accounts. No fees paid, just to ensure liquidity. I use Charles Schwab checking for free atm use while traveling, discover savings for higher interest, main bank WF for ease of use, and BofA due to the status benefits of Premier honors or whatever its called .. etc.
 * Saved in 401k (~50/50 traditional / roth) ~140k Vanguard target date fund  
 * Saved in IRAs ~ 190k mostly ETFS with a few stock picks  
 * Own a home valued ~900k  
 * Mortgage 630k 3.8% interest rate, no other debts. I plan to live where I life for at least 5 years.  
 * Around ~150k invested in low cost ETFs etc  
 * Own a cheap honda that sips fuel, I mainly use my transit fsa though for public transit.  
 * I save an additional 1-2k per month to investments  
 * I save $200 a month to a 529 (in my name) but hopefully to pass to a child if I have one some day.  
 * Credit scores are decent 750 ish, mainly due to being young and having shopped around for a mortgage in the past 2 years.  
 * I have good car insurance, home insurance, and umbrella policy.  
 * I have life insurance through work (~700k worth) along with short term and long term disability.  

I live pretty frugally. I've been saving since elementary school (lemonade stand etc) and getting a paycheck since high school, and contributing to retirement since I earned a paycheck. I worked full time in college, and graduated early. I couldn't justify staying in school when I could be making at least 100k working full time. I max out my 401k and get a 50% match. I do the mega backdoor roth conversion for my after tax 401k, also maxed. I also contribute to my ira (max) and convert to roth each year. All of the funding happens in the beginning of the year. That amounts to around 60k saved to retirement accounts per year. My IRA is funded partially from rolling over an old 401k. I also was incredibly fortunate in my stock picks when I was younger where I made ~1000+% very early on which has compounded since. I got really lucky and I've since convinced myself of the low cost ETF ways. 

I recognize that I'm really fortunate and in a good spot financially. What I've done so far has basically been in lock step with what is suggested for the 18-25 and 25-30 guide. Except for the HSA (see below). What I'm trying to figure out is whats next. 

Do I just keep doing exactly the same thing or are there additional opportunities to take advantage of? I understand at this point I may not be able to take advantage of some (Ex I need more $ to play) but I'm hoping to at least know what I may be able to do in the future. I'm willing to trade risk at some rate for reward (as long as I can understand the real risk tradeoffs) as I'm in a pretty stable place. 

I don't really understand what options if any are available to me. I feel like everyone around me is just obsessed with buying bitcoin which I'm unconvinced about. I'm looking for less gambling-esque options. For example I've been looking into buying real estate to rent but the only way that seems manageable is buying out of state basically because real estate here is so expensive. I've played around with p2p lending but found that I received really poor returns 3-4% vs the market.

Does moving everything into an IRA and going the self directed route make sense etc?

What would you do / what did you do?

Things I've considered:  
HSA contributions: I personally have higher than average medical expenses in a year. I find that kind of erases the benefit of the HSA vs my company's very comprehensive (and very subsidized) PPO.

Contributing and eventually maxing out multiple state's 529's. California where I live offers no tax benefit to a 529 however I would consider it eventually. I'm still not sure if I want to have a child and so I'm limiting my 529 contribution.

Keeping balanced traditional 401 and roth. I'm trying to stay around 50/50 for those contributions. When I made less $ I put it in traditional. Now I put it in in equal parts.",finance

Car:

13,000 left on a 60 month 0.9%

Household income is 200k per year. Just got a 20k bonus and I'm considering using that to pay off the car, although the interest is so little I'm not sure if I'd be better served leaving that alone and investing the money. I really just wanted to get rid of the monthly payment. 

Another thing is I'm not sure how aggressively I should pursue paying off the house vs investing. I'm definitely going to refinance to a 15 year (but interest rates aren't all that great right now). It kills me seeing how much interest we are paying each month as we're just ~4 years into the loan. 

It should be noted, we do have two children and very stable jobs. Currently we have about a 4-5 month buffer sitting in savings should anything happen. Could put that money into savings to bump it closer to that 6 month. Also, we are both doing employer match 6% 401k match per month.

2. Does Amy have to change her W4 to reduce allowances to 0 or can Joe just fill his with 0 allowances and a higher additional amount than IRS calculator suggests (by the amount of his allowances translated to $)?
3. Do either Amy or Joe (or both) need to do anything about state taxes' withholding?
4. If yes under 3:
4.1. Is this filed with the employer or directly with the states?
4.2. Does it need to be filed with both states in question?
4.3. Does Amy need to file anything even though her working situation stays the same?
4.4. Are there official calculators for state taxes?
5. What is the procedure to check if the withholdings (fed and state) have been applied correctly and in the sufficient amounts?

To his credit, John is hilarious and an excellent speaker. But this is DEF brought by you to the big banks. Plants the seeds for centralized, state controlled blockchain. Hits some solid points on avoiding scamcoins but classifies all crypto as scamcoins. Doesn't talk about evolving economic systems. Doesn't critique debt backed fiat at all. Doesn't address institutionally stiffed innovation. Doesn't talk about any of bitcoins strengths or resiliency. Selectively chooses information without setting the context and is guilty by lies of omission. Completely classifies bitcoin and all cryptos as a joke and a waste of time. Tries to make it right by throwing in a sentence, like oh ok maybe not all cryptos are scams (that's literally the only sentence about that) Doesn't compare them accurately or at all. Other positives: Does explain all main terms though and clowns bitconnect which was a known scam that some of us literally begged others not to be a part of, but alas the FOMO is real.

Just seems like a real pain in the ass.

Does it depend on the policy of the credit union? Or is there some universal balance transfer thing I can do that wouldn't create some crazy interest rate on another, newer credit card?",finance
personalfinance,Does credit score impact just your mortage interest rate or does it also impact the amount you are approved for?,"Me and my wife are building our new home.  We are going to use the profit from selling our current home as the downpayment and maybe 5-10k more from our savings depending on what were approved for.

Long story short.... we both have car loans.  Mine was for 16k on a 2012 Lexus originated in 2015 and I owe $3300 on that.  My wifes started last year on a 2016 Maxda CX-5 for 19k and she owes 16k on that.  She has no other debt.  I have $24,425 in total credit  (multiple cards) and only $4265 of that is being used so my credit utilization is 17% which I know isnt bad.

Credit Karma has her credit score has 788 and mine as 708.  We make 105k combined.  

Basically my concern is we wont be approved for enough because they are going to take our averages on our credit scores frmo the 3 bureaus and then use mine since its the lower of the 2.  Will this effect how much we are going to be allowed to borrow?  Our builder has their own financing and we are using that instead of a bank or other lending agency.  Not sure if that matters


EDIT:  One more thing.  Would we be better off getting financing from Suncoast Credit Union (were in Florida) instead of the builder?  My wife has her auto loan through them.",finance
personalfinance,Ended a long-term relationship. Ex is paying off an upside-down car loan that's in my name. He has the car.,"Hi PF,


I left a relationship about four months ago. Several months before the relationship ended, I financed a car for my ex. The loan is in my name only, and the title to the car is in my name. I rolled ""his"" previous upside-down car loan (also in my name) into this loan. the loan term is 84 months. 10 payments have been made so far. The loan was originally for about $49,000, and there is currently about $44,000 outstanding. The interest rate is 4.2%. The car is probably only worth mid-20s if traded in.


My ex has continued to make payments since we broke up, but it's always a struggle. He is very bad with money, and I do not trust him to continue making this payments forever. Even if I did, I would rather not be tied to him for the next 6 years.


I'm trying to figure out what my options are in this situation. I understand what a stupid decision it was to take out this loan, and I'm not looking for that to be re-iterated twenty times. I've beat myself up over this already; now I want to find solutions.

So far, the options I can think of are:

1. Take the car back, trade it in, and try to get the remainder of the loan refinanced at a lower rate (I have very good credit). This will leave me paying down a $20,000 debt with nothing to show for it.

2. Refinance the car loan under both my name and my ex's name. Is this possible? His credit is not good enough to take over this loan himself, which is why it's in my name now. At least if the loan was in both of our names, he would also be hurting himself if he stops making payments. This is more complicated than option 1, but potentially much cheaper.


Are there better options that I'm missing? Are there any professionals that I could consult about this matter, like some type of lawyer or financial planner?


Thank you, awesome people of PF!",finance

personalfinance,Career advice needed.,"So I have worked for my current employer for nearly 6 years. I like what I do and the pay and benefits are nice enough.

My current boss just does not like me despite a couple years or so of working together and me trying to show her that I'm an asset. She has repeatedly told me that if I am so good at this job and know everything that I should leave and do something else but honestly promotions available to me at this company are absolutely worse. Similar to less pay and a lot more stress and an overload of work and people mad at you for not immediately responding.

In my current job I have little stress, I'm comfortable, I got rid of all of my debt, and I was able to purchase a house and make big dents in the mortgage.

Recently my boss apparently got fed up with me not leaving and told me if I called in sick again at any point for the rest of my career at my company she'd give me a final write up for too many absences. This is bullshit and entirely counter to the employee handbook.

So out of desperation I emailed her boss saying she had said this (and blamed him for the decision which she had, though I was fairly sure he didn't even know about it) and asked if there was some misunderstanding/miscommunication. I said this decision seems designed to make me quit, not help me/us succeed. This completely worked and now my boss is claiming to be interested in helping me now but obviously nobody likes to be coerced like that.

Before you all say it is just time to be looking for other jobs, I have, and similar positions at other companies here do not pay as well, I have had several job interviews recently.

personalfinance,Should I get a loan to pay off my loan?,"So heres my predicament: My family and I moved to the united states 7 years ago. My mom recieved her citizenship last year in may and I graduated highschool around the same time. I was supposed to have my permanent residency about 90 days after that because the children of citizens automatically recieve permanent residency. Because of this factor we couldn't file for any federal financial aid, scholarships or loans because a social security number is required to prove your eligibility. For this reason we decided that it would be best for me to start college a semester late so that once I got my SSN I could file for financial aid and work for a full sememster to save up some cash for college. My SSN never came. We've been working with a lawyer for the past couple months so it will be resolved eventually but this ended up with me wasting a semester sitting at home. I started college in January despite the fact that we didn't have a concrete plan of how I was to pay the remaining balance. Luckily the school worked with me as much as they could and although rent and tuition was due in january they have given me until this friday to figure it out. I have gotten word from one of the lawyers we know who believes that I will recieve my SSN within the next month or two, however, I will kicked out of my dorm this friday if I dont pay my outstanding balance. There are very few loan options for non-citizens without a social security options however I found ONE bank that would work with me. The loan details are as follows: 8.115% Interest Rate which is 3-Month LIBOR +6.490, Deferred payments until I graduate with a 15 year loan term and, if the $70 per month after graduation is abided by, the total amount of payments should amount to $12,593. Since I am getting my SSN soon I could apply for a federal loan instead, which has a 4-5% interest rate. Would it be a wise decision to get a federal loan in a month or two with less interest to pay off this one?",finance

personalfinance,"[Banking] I'm thinking about leaving Wells Fargo for an online Bank, but...","I used to be a Wells Fargo employee about 10 years ago.  I was a developer for them, and they just paid my bills, so I never had much of an interest in learning about the industry (they kept me so buried in work, I wouldn't have the time, anyway).  While I was employed with them, they gave all employees the ""Portfolio Management Account"" for free, which i guess is supposed to be their best investment-checking account they had(?).  While it awards interest, it's dismal - not even worth mentioning.  Which leads me to why I'm here, today.

I've been seeing these online banks interest rates that are over 30 times better than what I'm getting at Wells.  I'd love to see an extra $1k a year or more go into my account.  However, I use my account to pay ALL of my bills.  Whatever isn't auto-debited, I've set up on Bill Pay.  I also have partitioned my money into seperate accounts in my portfolio: (1) my main account which is where most of my paychecks go, where I have all my bills taken out from, and where I do my daily spending, (2) my escrow account that I pay my own property tax and insurance from, and (3) my main savings account where all my leftover money goes.

I have scheduled transfers from my main account to feed into my escrow and savings account each month.  The escrow account only gets enough to pay my T&amp;I, and my investment gets about $1,000 a month, plus any surplus I have left over from my main after bills, food, and fun.  While I'm not set on keeping it this way, I like it like this as it helps me save while still allowing for enough money to handle what life throws at me without having to dip into savings.

My main concern with online banks is the restrictiveness of moving money around.  I hardly ever use ATMs, and I use mobile (photo) deposit for the rare paper checks I receive.  But I like to transfer money to my various savings account and back with regularity. I use paypal linked to a checking for many online purchase, and a good percentage of my purchases are online.  Can I still have the setup I'm used to and take advantage of these completely superior rates?  Which bank would you guys recommend for my situation, or which of my habits will I need to compromise on?

(Can't hurt to have a plan.).

The main problem I'm coming across is budget; figuring out what's covered by state and federal agencies (how much I'm likely to get in food stamp money), section 8, et cetera, and adjusting for it with a budget based on cost of living where I live is kind of hard. It's a lot of stuff to pull together and all I can make is an educated guess on how much I'll receive for certain benefits.

But my main problem is with budgeting for stuff I don't have (but everyone with their own places does). Stuff like furniture, dishes, cutlery, cooking implements (pots, pans, measuring stuff). Nowhere seems to talk about how to figure that out or estimate how much I'll need to spend. I'm assuming a lot of stuff can be bought secondhand or at goodwill-style places, but that just makes estimating costs a bit harder (since there aren't exactly standard prices for that stuff).

Car - payment 180 per month 
Owe 6k on the original 11k loan -  way ahead of schedule on this loan - bought the car a 2 years ago 

Credit card -  owe 11k on the card - not a bad interest rate though - payments are about 200

Bout 1000$ in a Robinhood account 


My original idea was to refinance the house and pull some equity - not sure how that works -  but was thinking I can refinance at 110k pull 30k in equity -  pay off debts and have a nice 10k cushion - with monthly bill obly going up 50-80$ -  not sure how easy that is -  but I used a couple different “mortgage calculator” and it said my bill would be 50-80$ higher depending On which one I used 

However my girlfriend is completely against this idea -  and she’s extremely stubborn 

Was also thinking about simply asking my creditors to defer payments -  but am curious as to how that works 
Does it affect your credit score
Can it be done with any type of account ?  Does the internet get deffered as well ? How long do creditors usually allow people to deffer? 1 payment ? 3? 6? 12? 
Anyone with experience in this ?

I really want that credit card to go away as fast as possible -  waiting   On the first of my big clients to place their order though

Currently,As of next month it will mark my one year of starting to pay off my student loans (paid off other debt first), Currently I have ~12,000 USD left (original amount was ~33K) at ~3.5 % interest rate.

My Current situation is that I am tired of driving!! Just plain tired of it...I have kept track of my commute stats as some sort of sanity check...not sure why.

Commute| Stats
---|---
Total Miles Driven so Far| 32,340
Total Hours Commuted| 764
Total Money Spent| $ $5,271.50 

This is since the start of my decision to start seriously tackling on my debt and doing the new commute.



However, my main reason to write this update is should I just chill and slow down the debt payments and start paying 250 a month on remaining student loans, move out and pay ~1,750 rent for a 1 Bdr on a 80,000 yearly salary?  

Lately, I have been finding myself wanting to enjoy my 20's (24), want to buy a car that I know I really shouldn't (35,000 car with 25,000 down, but would mean I have to start saving now...while commuting).

I guess what I am asking for here is financial wise I know it is best to keep paying down the debt, but sanity wise (reaching out here) what would you recommend I do?

CryptoCurrency,Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Just Published A Report On Central Bank Digital Currencies,"Just found a tweet about a report publication that just came out by the BIS. Thought I'd share it with everyone.


Link To Full Report: https://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d174.pdf

Introduction Page / TL;DR: https://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d174.htm

&gt;Central bank digital currencies
March 2018
Report submitted by a Working Group established by the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures and the Markets Committee. The group was chaired by Klaus Löber (European Central Bank) and Aerdt Houben (Netherlands Bank). Central banks must carefully weigh the implications for financial stability and monetary policy of issuing digital currencies, according to a report from the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) and the Markets Committee. The report considers a wholesale CBDC (for use in financial markets), and a general purpose CBDC (for use by the general public) and their implications for payments, monetary policy and financial stability. It finds that wholesale CBDCs might be useful for payments but more work is needed to assess the full potential. Although a CBDC would not alter the basic mechanics of monetary policy implementation, its transmission could be affected. A general purpose CBDC could have wide-ranging implications for banks and the financial system. Commercial banks' reliance on customer deposits may become less stable, as deposits could more easily take flight to the central bank in times of stress. Besides consequences for financial stability, effects on the efficiency of financial intermediation need to be carefully considered. The report concludes that each jurisdiction considering the launch of a CBDC should carefully and thoroughly consider the implications before making any decision.

MachineLearning,[D] MANN paper: why no convolutions?,"In the 2016 paper about memory augmented neural networks, https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06065 , the main results are presented using the Omniglot dataset. However, the model in that paper apparently doesn't use any convolutions: ""The image is then flattened into a vector, concatenated with a randomly chosen, episode-specific label, and fed as input to the network controller.""

To me it seems clear that a CNN can process such images much better. Just compare the performance of a fully connected network to that of a CNN on MNIST, for example. Does anybody know, or have an idea, why didn't they add a convolutional layer or two to preprocess the image before feeding it into the controller?",technology

personalfinance,Student loans,"I am currently on my third year of a 5yr program at Drexel University for civil engineering and will need to take out another loan for the upcoming school terms (spring and summer terms, Drexel works on a quarter system).

My first year I took out a 12,000 dollar  private loan at 11.875% which I already paid off through working two six month co-ops. Second year I took out 4,000 at 9.875%. Both of which are through Sallie Mae.

My question is this, financial aid and scholarships covered all but about 150$ in terms of actual dues to the school but I will still need a loan for spending money and rent/utilities as I pretty much spent all my money I earned from an internship on paying off the 12k loan.

Should I go back to Sallie Mae for another small approx. $4000 loan or should I look into getting one from a private bank or even through the school itself?
I am primarily just trying to get the lowest interest rate and only have used Sallie Mae so far so I was wondering if anyone out there shopped around and if so what was the best route. 

I will probably need to take another loan or two for the upcoming years as well so I want to make sure I'm getting the best interest rate because of course it will just fester and grow in interest for the next 2-3 years.

personalfinance,"Virgin america card closed, credit score dropped","Need advice on what to do here. After the recent Virgin America and Alaska Air merger, Commenity Bank decided to close all Virgin American Visa cards (understandable considering Alaska already had a card through another bank). This was my only credit card for a long long time, so i had well over $10k in available credit, a low utilization (balance at closing was under $1k) and perfect payment history with the account. My credit score at the end of 2017 was 771, but after the account was closed my score dropped to 736. Since then i've signed up for the Chase Sapphire card as my main travel rewards card and was given the same credit limit amount that i lost. After not seeing any improvement in my score, i decided to open another card account through AmEx, which also gave me a high credit limit, and i financed my new Samsung phone through their financing through TD Bank. They gave me a $9k credit line and I've already paid the cost spent on the phone back in full to avoid the interest rate for the purchase (you get 6 months to pay back or they charge high interest. This seemed better than paying for the phone in full on a credit card or through my cell company.) This account, along with the Chase and AmEx accounts are all being reported on my credit reports as in good standing and under 30% utilization. 

Anyway, long story short, 3 months into 2018 and my score is still in the 730's. This week it went up to 738 (yay...) I thought that the loss of my credit card and its limit is what knocked my score so much, and figured that by making up the difference with new lines of credit, it would put my score back up. I'm still paying down the Virgin America Visa balance and Credit Karma still shows my account with them in good standing with perfect payment history, although the account says closed at lenders request. I dont know if this is what is causing such a bad drop in my score, but since it's my oldest line of credit, i'm hesitant to pay off the balance and have it taken off my reports. 

Would it be worth it, or even possible, to transfer the remaining balance to another 0% interest card offer? 

Sorry for the long post. I'm starting to do the house buying thing, and was counting on my great credit history to carry me here.",finance

I apologize for the last minute tax return question, but this has been making me really frustrated. 

My mom went to an accountant to submit our family's taxes and the accountant there recommended that I file my taxed myself, as he would have to charge too much. Fortunately, he laid everything out for my mom and explained to her how I should fill out my form. 

I was going through TurboTax's filing service and after finishing the 'Federal' section, I noticed that it did not qualify the $1,000 credit that I should receive due to the American Opportunity credit (Form 8863). I filled the information out exactly as the accountant showed my mom but it only asked if we had accepted the credit last year and how many years had we accepted the credit. Last year was my first year accepting the credit, so I should have another three years.

The accountant my family used gave us his contact info for me if I needed any help but I don't think he would be familiar with TurboTax's service and the format/UI that they use, compared to the standard form.

Payments are $207/month. I'm currently an independent contractor that makes approx. 24K, I am paid hourly and do not receive benefits/401K. I also dog-sit, which provides a substantial amount of side income as well. This is temporary and barely related to my fields of interest.

I use Mint to track my spending, live at home and have virtually no expenses right now (don't pay rent/insurance/phone/or own a car). I've invested $1370 in Acorns (moderately aggressive profile) and plan to make it a total of 5K, and aspire to save 20K in checking to move out. I also want to be wary of what I'll need to save for taxes next year, assuming it will be $4,800 before any potential deductibles.

I'm interested in establishing my own metal shop to make and sell lamps on Etsy and would like to get that going by mid-summer this year, the rest of the equipment will cost $1700 total (refurbished items). I'd like to establish myself as a lighting designer as soon as possible to get that income pillar going and growing (tis my passion).

I am entitled to 30K this year from my mother's estate since her death, my total share is about 107K, give or take, (it's invested in various stocks and mirrored ETFs), but I plan to take out only 5-6K to buy a new Wacom Cintiq Pro drawing tablet in order to be on par with industry standards, with designs on creating a graphic novel to release on Kickstarter down the line and also pivot into the Animation Industry as a career ASAP. Outside of this, I will not be touching my inheritance as it is intended to be a downpayment for a house in my future, which I obviously agree with. If possible, I'd put money back into this as well in the future.

Other pertinent information: My father is wealthy and I have a trust fund set up for myself and my sisters, the details of which are totally unknown to me, but for now I'm putting that out of my mind and focusing on my own real world finances and goals, and it is not relevant to me at this time.

I'm assuming that I can afford to keep making minimum payments on my student loans and not worry about it, however, if I ever want to rent and live with friends, I'll need a salary to afford the minimum $900-1000/month. To do this, I want to establish another income area (Etsy), and talented as I believe I am, I'll need the modern tools to enter the Animation Industry and also develop (hopefully lucrative) projects on my own time.

BlockChain,Understanding The Gold Rush of Scalable and Validated Data powered by Blockchain and Decentralized AI?,"Trustless through decentralization
Recently, there is a worldwide huge, i mean HUGE hype for the Blockchain technology, but how does this technology create value and for what use cases does it make sense?
If we ask this question to a huge fan of Satoshi Nakamoto, he’ll reply:
For the first time in human history, the Blockchain technology, allows to transact values from A to B, without having to trust institutions but trusting a democratic network, which is self-controlled through open-source algorithms.
Which makes perfect sense and is proven by its market capitalization of ~$200 billion, sorry $250 Billion, OPS now $150 Billion. BTW, regardless price fluctuations, the Market Cap is huge, but, the purpose of this article is about what’s next!
To understand the exponential growth in terms of values that this technology is making, we don’t have to focus our attention on the technological factor of the blockchain itself, but on the values added by the decentralization.

Decentralization means that every information is validated not by trusting to an entity, but through open source algorithms. Bitcoin for example is validating transactions with the “Proof Of Work”, introducing the concept of transactions blocks replicated and shared by the entire network, without the possibility of editing or deleting the ledger.

The challenge to validate data
The Blockchain technology makes sense for decentralize and validate informations thanks to its “Trustless” core. The main use case in the next years will be to move from decentralizing financial data [transactions] to decentralizing and validate the most valuable asset of this century, data.
Today, even if the hype is huge, the technology is in “Early Stage.” During this technological wave, Blockchain technology makes sense for reinventing what the centralized technology has not disrupted yet, everything that has to be redesigned not only with frictionless ecosystems, big data or AI but with universally validated pieces of information, without the possibility of human manipulation.
In the Blockchain market, every centralized approach that we use today are not useful; this is why next unicorns of this technology will be driven by reinventing how we store values without intermediaries. This new technological era is called “Internet 3.0” or “Internet of values.”
To decentralize data, unlike financial transactions, it is not only necessary to store every piece of information, but also to validate how we track and execute data. For example, when Vitalik Buterin started to build Ethereum, the challenge, was to develop a new Blockchain designed like an operating system.

On the Ethereum Network, like every OS, developers can run applications; each Application has to be decentralized into the Blockchain through Smart-Contracts where to execute functions every transaction have to call the entire Smart-Contract, the request, who made the call and the result.

With Blockchain technology currently it is impossible to create a high scalable application and at the same time obtain the added value of decentralization, due to several technological limits, the most important are:
Transactions per second: Bitcoin on average can sustain 3–7 transactions/s, Ethereum can support 12–20 transactions/s. To make a comparison a visa circuit needs 1,200 transactions/s and an application like Facebook more than 1,000,000 transactions/s
Transaction costs: A Bitcoin transaction costs roughly $ 2/7, an Ethereum transaction without running a smart contract costs about $ 0.3 / 0.8, these costs are unsustainable for an application that needs millions of transactions per second.

Network congestion: A fundamental problem is that all applications run on the same network, this leads to periods of congestion where transactions can increase tenfold as costs or even fail… Do you remember Crypto-Kitties?

Specific cases of use: Ethereum was designed to become a decentralized operating system for applications with general purposes, without focusing on particular functions, something like the state-of-the-art network in terms of decentralization and security, excluding a lot of use cases.

The first generation of Decentralized Applications
A lot of excellent teams are developing technologies to solve these problems and make possible the development of complex decentralized applications in the near future. The challenge to solve these problems is to scale the technology to the mass adoption and at the same time maintaining the “Trustless” standard.
The most adopted solution in last years is the DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), like the Blockchain technology, DAG is a distributed ledger technology (DLT). In DAG networks, users that make transactions also manage the consensus, usually based on a quorum to reach 51% of participants.

This technology, even if infinitely scalable, is dangerous, because it ’s manipulable, and the consensus is based the trust in the participants. What make Blockchain “Trustless”, is the unique value of validating information through algorithms, with anonymous validators and a safety circuit based on economic disincentives to cheating the network.
Non-Blockchain DLT systems, such as DAGs, do not have validation through an algorithm, the problem is that in this early stage of Blockchain technology, people and organizations have a lot of friction to understand the Trustless Concept.
This misunderstanding is becoming more confusing, because a lot of companies, is speculating, driven by “the blockchain trend.” In fact, a lot of Companies are selling non-Trustless solutions, like Private Blockchains (a confusing name for a shared database) or some DLT solutions, wrongly as Trustless Blockchains.

This trend is dangerous because if an organization start trusting something manipulable, the result could be a catastrophe in the long run.
Solutions like Raiden Network for Ethereum and Lighting Network for Bitcoin were born to solve network limits related to transactions per second and transactions costs without losing the security of a Blockchain network. Basically, these solutions are hybrid from Blockchain transactions and a DLT private network.

Protocols like Raiden, allows users to open a private distributed connection, where they could validate on the blockchain only the first and last transaction. The risks of fraud compared to a DAG are limited, but every middle transaction is not validated. 
This solution can be useful for micro-payments and to scale manipulable and dynamic data.
A non-hybrid solution, to solve the problem of scalability, promoted by Ethereum is Plasma, a protocol for decentralizing federated blockchains. Federated Blockchains, used mainly in internal company protocols, are infinitely scalable but at the same time centralized, since they rely on a limited number of selected and non-anonymous validators.

Plasma offers developers the ability to create and customize their private Blockchain, through Smart Contract, with or without issuing a new Cryptocurrency and with or without federated validators. The Ethereum’s Public Blockchain controls the Trustless in this solution, as parallelism: Ethereum is the “Supreme Court” and a private blockchain a “State.”

From a vertical Blockchain model to the Interoperability
The demand for the development of the first generation of decentralized applications is growing exponentially, this started a race to develop a scalable and Trustless technology.
In the last two years, a lot of innovative projects start to build technologies for testing new methods of Trustless validation, such as Casper, NEO or EOS, and new Blockchain technologies focused on specific use cases, such as IOT, Big Data, Hosting, etc.
This race has generated the concept of the third generation of Blockchain technology, focussed on the idea of “Interoperability.”

The Interoperability concept, developed by projects such as AION, Polkadot and ICON, opens a new smart way to solve tech limits in Blockchain technology, introducing the idea of unstoppable applications that spoke through multiple Blockchains.
This solution is opening the way to the first real generation of complex decentralized applications, which can use the most performing blockchain technology for each function based on every kind of uses case. At the same time, this new approach can mitigate risks like being at the mercy of the congestion of a network or destroy an entire business due to a network defect.
The Interoperability infrastructure allows developers to create Decentralized Applications in a new smart way that I like to call “Blockchain as a Microservice.”

The “BAAM” concept is similar to the way in which we create modern centralized applications with microservices based on dedicated and replaceable APIs for each function. In Dapp we will use many dedicated and replaceable Blockchains focused on specific needs to perform each task. This type of infrastructure will create an exponential research on the evolution of this technology, especially in new Blockchains focused on specific use cases, without loosing the Trustless validation.

personalfinance,Is buying a house a feasible option for me?,"So currently I'm renting an apartment with a roommate and I've been contemplating my options once the lease is up. One of those options that I've been seriously considering is looking into buying a house, but I'm uncertain if it's something that I can manage currently so I need some advice.

Some relevant information:
-My annual income is unfortunately not fixed but across the previous 3 years I've averaged about 40k
-The only debt I have is my student loans which are 60k at a 6% interest rate which I've maintained a 600$ payment each month on
-I currently have about 20k in my savings account which I contribute to monthly

I've done some looking around online and figure my intended range is 60-80k and have found some decent looking places in that range (it's just me moving so I don't need anything too big or expensive). I've also looked into preapproval for a loan back when I first started considering this which resulted in a suggested target price of 75k, which is where I got my rage, and a 67.5k loan.

So any advice? Information I'm missing? Just want to get a sense of things from people who know better than me. The other path I would take is renting an apartment on my own and in this area i'd be looking at 800-900.",finance

personalfinance,Im 25 Making 73k a year and I want to Invest and Be More Prepared. Advice needed!,"Im making 73k right now. I just finished college about a year and a half ago. Luckily I have no loans. I am trying to find efficient ways to save more. Im not that great financially but my parents have guided me along the way. Im currently am a government employee and on the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) which I match 5% but the tax is still too high so I end up putting something like 15% in even though the max matching is 5%. I have a Roth IRA account with Edward Jones that I put in $50 a month thats sitting currently $1.6k that I began in Aug of 2017. I forgot the reason but I recall someone stating Roth having an annual cap which is why I just let it auto to $50. Lastly I have 2 Certificate Deposits within navy fed: 15 month at 2.23% which I put $12k/50k and 12 month at 2.96% which I maxed out 3k. Theres no more reasonable CDs offered during this time.

At this point I can just keep putting money in the 50k CD put truly is there anything else I should look into? I have about 10k lose cash in my checking that I honestly dont know what to do with but want to do something. I turly feel like the CDs are a waste of time but I guess its better than sitting at a lower rate in my bank.

As for expenses I rent a room at $550 a month with everything included. Since college Ive cut down to mainly yogurt and salad. Most of my expenses are gas and dinner when I visit my parents or friends for the weekends. This results to a total monthly expensive $650-$1000. Most is due to the gas driving from LA to SD on the weekends. If I dont go home to SD itll usually be $650 a month.

Somethings on my mind.. My little sister is just starting college. I am also considering grad school. My parents are old. Dad is 60ish and mom is 50ish. I feel I should also prepare taking her under my wing sometime soon. What are you guy's thoughts? What are your words of wisdom and advice? Anything would be much appreciated (:",finance
stocks,Trading has screwed my life over and there's no escape.,"When I first started trading on my 18th birthday, my positions were (in comparison) tiny to what I trade now. I still vividly remember the first time I lost $1k in a day, and being absolutely annoyed/angry. Looking back, it was like an architect reminiscing about his childhood Lego house.

In the past year or so, I've been gradually increasing my position size. Needless to say, it's been quite rough in terms of P&amp;L, and I wish I hadn't taken such large risks with such a stubborn, confident attitude. But quite honestly, the market action is unprecedented, breaking all sorts of ""historical firsts"", in terms of prices, valuations, and dozens of indicators. I am, by far, not the only guy losing money hand over fist in this Trump/FED/BOJ/ECB induced mega-bubble/low-rates experiment of the century. As one recent HF manager said in his farewell letter to clients, ""it wasn't supposed to be this way."" [Right before his multi-billion dollar fund closed this summer after multiple double-digit monthly losses.]

The point of this thread is to say that, for me, making/losing 5 figures on a daily basis really impedes my ability to comprehend the utility of money. It completely warps my sense of price/value, and the input (typically time) required to acquire money. I could never see myself holding a salaried position again in my life, having seen how quickly I can ""make money appear"" (or in my case, ""disappear""). ""That money takes people year(s) to make"", goes my thinking. I still appreciate and ""love"" money very much, however, the effort I'm willing to expend to obtain it is much, much lower than compared to before.

I honestly believe if the working class found out the about trading and it's ease of value creation/destruction, society would cease to function and capitalism (ironically) would collapse. As my trading friend recently said, ""it fucks with the way you think about money.""",finance
personalfinance,(CAN) Best advice for paying off partner's debts while immigrating,"## The story

I like to think I'm pretty good with my personal finances. Healthy savings, great credit rating, and always paying off my credit card in full every month. 

My now-spouse had a rough spot where she had issues with employment and racked up a bit of debt (which I guess is now also my debt?). I was always fully aware of this when dating and when I married her. I'm not worried that it'll happen to her again and she's taken steps in ensuring that. I'm looking for advice in paying this off, especially since I'm not used to even having much debt at all.

One complication is that she is immigrating from the US to my country of Canada. We want to prioritize being together, so she's coming on a visitor's visa. But this means she can't really work while we wait for permanent residency to go through (there does seem to be some options, like remotely working for an American business, although I struggle to get ""straight answers"" and don't want to risk anything that could endanger her immigration application).

As a result, I expect to be the sole income earner for several months. One area that I'm unsure of is how much I want to touch my savings (~12k CAD). My post-tax take home is about $3500/mo. An area of concern is that her debts are naturally in USD and the exchange rate is less than ideal.

## The debt

Her biggest and probably most worrying bit of debt is her credit card (which is closed). She owes about $3500 USD there. She's not sure what the interest rate is, but my math based on the interest owed on the statement puts it at 9.1% APR. It seems to have gone to collections and she mentions that she talked to the debt collector and worked out an agreement to pay it off at $100/mo. I assume that's how the interest is so relatively low for a credit card.

The next biggest debt she has (and more ""regular"") is student loan. $2150 USD left at 6.8% interest and normally monthly payment of about $50. That's 75% paid off.

Finally, she has medical bills from a car accident (certainly one thing I'm glad to be getting her out of the US for). These total $700 USD and I believe are also in collections. 11 months old and nothing paid towards it. She says they've never contacted her about it yet either (she mentions having called them about it in the past, but they never returned the call). I'm not too familiar with how hospital bills work (specifically from going to emergency).

In total that comes to approximately $8150 CAD, so I could afford to completely wipe them out if I used my savings. However, I don't feel that is necessarily for the best since I like my savings very well padded and do have worries about what the like 6-12 months on just my income (but with the expenses of a couple) will be like. I'm still waiting for a last piece of paperwork to go through before I can submit the spousal sponsorship application, too, and that application will cost roughly $1k CAD.

What is ideal to pay for and how much? Should I try and pay everything off quickly? Or keep it more gradual (say, spread across a year or two)? Should some things be handled differently (my wife was initially intending to ignore the medical bill for as long as possible, for example)? I would like to be able to help her rather terrible credit score recover, so that should we decide we want a house in upcoming years, that might be an option.

## My own expenses

$1k/mo rent (utilities included), $43/mo cellphone, $80/mo student loan, $75/mo car insurance. Maybe $50/mo fuel. $10/mo ea for Netflix and Google Play Music. I admit I struggle to say how much I spend on groceries and eating out. I don't usually bother budgeting because I always earn consistently more than I spend (even with money automatically transferred into a RRSP and TFSA). Mint says I spent $270 on groceries and just under $300 on food places last month. Food is definitely my guilty pleasure, spending almost nothing on anything else.

I expect food expenses to become a little more reasonable actually, since we want to cook in more (and she's gonna be at home more, so that works). Rent and utilities won't change. I'll probably have to take over her phone and car expenses.

personalfinance,Are there any options for borrowing $77K USD per year (for two years) to attend Harvard's Graduate School of Design? (CAN),"Hi personalfinance community, thanks in advance for your help! 

For the longest time, I hoped to become an Urban Planner/Designer, and after starting my first ""full time job"" for under a year, I applied and was accepted into my dream school(s), Harvard's Graduate School of Design (GSD) and the City and Regional Planning program at Berkeley. However, as an international student, I was told that financial aid is limited, and did not receive any funding for either program.

I believe that part of the reason for not qualifying for aid is that in the financial applications, I declared that my parents own a home in Vancouver (their primary residence and my childhood home). I thought this would not be a factor in eliminating me from aid on account of it being their primary residence, but I do think it did play a part.
 
My parents are unable to offer me much financial assistance as my mother is not employed, and my father is and has been self-employed since 2008. Their only asset is their house in Vancouver, which they own but would be dependent on as their only possible source of retirement income. I have also lived independently of them for almost a decade now, and it would be difficult for me to ask them to support me (nor could I ask them to, as I would never want them to jeopardize their financial security or re-mortgage their home for their fully grown 26-year-old daughter). 

I have written to Harvard's financial aid office asking about loan options, and I was told that the only loan available without an American co-signer is through the Harvard University Credit Union, where students can borrow up to $12,000 USD per year without a cosigner. Other than that, I believe that the Canadian Federal and Provincial student loans combined will be another source to borrow around $10K Canadian per year. However, the estimated cost of attendance is $77K/year for Harvard (including tuition, living expenses, etc.), and only marginally less for UC Berkeley. 

I already hold a masters from a Canadian university in a different field (International Affairs), which I completed with a remainder of ~$13K of Federal/Provincial student loans and ~$650 left to pay off on a TD Student Line of Credit.

The most I was able to borrow from a student line of credit without a co-signer (for my first masters) was $16K (which I mostly did not touch, but took out as a contingency plan). I have also a dependent (my common-law partner) who has been unemployed and living with me for over a year. 

Switching fields and attending the GSD (or Berkeley, as I've yet to attend their Open House) is something I want with all my heart. I'd honestly sell an organ! However, I was wondering what my options were to borrow the funds required (ideally without a co-signer or without having my parents use their house as collateral).

Of course, there is the question of whether or not it'd even be a good idea to do so... and if the investment is ""risky"" or ""worth it"" (something I'd also love opinions on if anyone has any insight). 

Unfortunately, deferrals are not available in either program :( I could work a year and re-apply but that opens up a whole other can of worms... I'd really like to try and enroll this year if possible! 

Urban planning is truly the intersection of public policy, economics, and design that is the ideal trifecta of fields relating to my interests. I don't know how I can make my dream of attending one of these schools a reality! Thanks for reading!!

*edit: I am aware this could be a horrible, awful decision (financially), but I'd like to know the feasibility. Also, out of curiosity, does anyone have anecdotal advice into taking out loans to attend an ivy or field-leading graduate school in terms of longer-term pains vs. gains?",finance
personalfinance,"(CAN) I am 26 yrs old, and have had about 5-6K of debt hanging over my head for way too long.","Typical young kid with a credit card type situation. I got my first credit card with a $500.00 limit when I was 18. And somehow learned rather quickly that credit was not my forte. I always made payments but once I made the payments, I used the credit card. And this cycle continued. And then I went to college and needed another credit card to help carry some of the cost of supplies and books until my student loan came in, but the student loan did not come in how it was supposed to, and I was stuck with a lot more debt than I was expecting. The credit mistakes do not end there. I also had some computer problems and put them on a Future Shop card, and had the card essentially paid off when the company went under, and the card was overtaken by another credit company. BUT because I move all the time, I never got the new card and eventually it went to collections over $30.00. This did a number on my credit score and took a long time to fix since I had to track down all the credit card info when I didn't even know who owned it. As it was the only blip on my credit and I've never had any issues as far as payments go since, my credit score is fair leaning to good.

The only issue with more interest free accounts for one year promo cards is that with my current credit score the limit I get doesn't help me in such a way that I feel makes a huge difference to my overall debt, and I end up making several payments on several cards. 

I really just want to get this out of the way as quickly as I can, so I can finally save money and invest in a future that is not completely controlled by credit card payments. Help me!",finance

Background:

I'm 27, and just received and income bump from $42,000 to $64,000/year. With this, I'm beginning to aggressively pay down $19,000 of student debt by paying $1,000 per month, one loan at a time (various federal subsidized loans). 

I work for a state government and contribute 8% to a pension plan, and I contribute another 7% to a Roth IRA Vanguard Target 2055 fund, and $50 pre-tax a month to a 457 (b). I also automatically send $200/mo to Ally Savings account.

I usually have a little ""extra"" cash ($100-200) after fixed expenses, variable expenses (fun/hobbies etc.) and my retirement contributions. With all of my deductions is it okay to only have $100 in cash remaining at the end of the month? As long as after my contributions I'm net positive I feel like that is okay.. right?

Does anyone have advice or another avenue for calculating withholdings? It's really tricky since commission is not commonly accounted for in any online calculators, and unlike bonuses it's always taxed at the highest amount automatically so I'm having a hard time find a clear answer. 

Thanks in advance for any help.

My wife and I just sold our first house (well it is under contract so I don't want to count my chickens just yet, but our closing date is fast approaching) and after closing costs we are looking at clearing $35000-$45000. I know typically most people would just turn around and use that as a down payment on their next house but we stumbled into an opportunity to house sit for some friends until around July of 2019. I plan on looking for our next house around this time of next year to give us plenty of time to find what we like, close, and move.

We both have auto loans but both have rates under 1 percent (and my whole payment gets taken care of by my work in the form of an automobile reimbursement that is not taxes)

We also both have student loans, mine is around 17k but I have been paying tripple the min payment the last 6months since my new job and am on track to have it payed off in about 12 months (and have payed off all loans that have an interest rate above 5)
Hers is still around 30k and we do pay a bit more than the minimum but wanted to get rid of mine first so we could really attack hers since mine are older, I will probably put a big chunk of what used to be our mortgage payment towards hers over then next 14 months to try and cut it under 20k. But that is all of our debt.

So my question is what would be the best thing to do with what we clear on selling our house? Keeping in mind I will need it as a down payment on a house in a year or so. Would just a standard savings account be the best option to at least get some interest on it?",finance

investing,Purchasing first investment property (duplex) through FHA loan and a friend - need advice,"I have plans to move to a new state where purchasing a home is too expensive for me right now (I am 24). I plan on renting in this new state. However, I would like to purchase an investment property in my original state so this where my idea comes into play. 

In the original state (maybe all states?) if you purchase a duplex and live in it for a year you are eligible for an FHA loan which consists of 3.5-5% downpayment and interest rates around 3.25%. 

I have a friend living at home who would be interested in investing together, however, there is one issue. He does not have any capital to invest for the down payment and I need someone to live in the home to receive these discounted rates. Is it a good idea for me to provide the down payment so that he could live in this investment property and we could build equity together? 

I would like to use this scenario:

$200k duplex 
Mortgage, taxes and insurance $1500
Rental income for both sides $2000

Does anyone have experience doing this? Ideally I would like to recoup my principle investment as soon as possible which I expect to be around $10k from the example listed above.

personalfinance,Credit Card Advice,"I know that many here are fans of churning and think that many of us make more of our credit scores than we need to.  

*Current Situation*

I currently hold two primary basic cards (a MasterCard and a Visa). No cash back or really anything beyond some of the basic amenities like extended warranties and rental car insurance coverage stuff.  

The Visa is my oldest account, at 19 years, and has the highest limit so I don't want to close it lest I lose account longevity and available credit which would, I understand, have a fairly large impact on my credit score (currently excellent).  

The MasterCard is also fairly old, at 13 years, with a modest credit line.

I also hold a couple of other specialized credit cards to take advantage of promo 0% interest rates.

Semi-related, I currently use an envelope method with cash for groceries weekly, which I did when grocery spending was getting out of control. It's in control now, and I almost never sit in the store with the calculator figuring out whether or not an item is within my budget.  

I am pretty good with my credit cards, so I'm not worried about going overboard with general spending.

*Question*

Do credit card companies ever add benefits (like cashback) to an existing card that does not have those benefits without closing the original and opening a new one? 

Is it worth it to open a new/different cashback card to use primarily for groceries (rather than the current cash)? Obviously, I'd also need to periodically use the other two cards to keep them active (and pay everything off every month).",finance

Also, what happens when I do taxes next year, given that I changed my exemptions during the year? What do I put as my exemptions, and does changing during the year complicate the process?

Is there any reason why I shouldn't change my # of exemptions? If I get the same money earlier, that means I can pay my debt off before interest is accrued. Is there any benefit to get the tax withholding later?

datascience,Data science internship offer: should I take it or not?,"I’ve received an internship offer as a summer student researcher with the federal government. The offer is very vague, but it is biology based and located in the Midwest. I applied for a position in DC and was offered this one at a branch office instead. They wouldn’t discuss pay until I “verbally accept” the position and gave me 48 hours. From Glassdoor, my best guess would be $13-14/hr. I would have to make the initial two day drive and a 30 minute commute each day.

However, I’m also in the interviewing stage for two other positions: a non profit which works with my favorite type of data (crime reports, my dream job essentially) and a high paying ($5,000/month) consulting firm that are both in NYC and are strictly data science rather than being partially biology. Would it be overreaching if I emailed these two companies and informed them that I received an offer and ask where I stand in the hiring process? I really have no clue about what is “proper.” 

I’ve put in close to 50 hours creating thorough applications for 50+ firms and expect to be offered interviews for at least two more. In terms of summer internships, some don’t even close applications until the end of March. I feel like I could really be missing out on opportunities by accepting this one. I see myself as a person with a lot of follow through, so I would never want to accept a position and then back out; however, is that at all common in the job industry?

I'm on a contract at work that ends July 13th. I'll probably get a full time contract or at least get it extended, but I'm not 100% sure yet. The way everything is going I should have roughly $10,000 in savings not including my retirement by the time my contract is up. My student loans are:

* Federal - $6,750 @ 5.95%  Payment: $141/mo
* Provincial - $7,850 @ 3.45% Payment: $59/mo

I'm paying the minimum on the provincial loan and bumped up my federal loan to round the total to $200/mo. A 3 month emergency fund for me would be about $4,800, 6 months $9,600. Those numbers aren't including the student loan payment. So closer to $5,400 and $10,800 with the payments.

personalfinance,[USA] There's no point in paying off the mortgage early in my case right?,"Hello! 

I purchased a home a year ago and have an interest rate of 3.875%. I've been paying an extra $1000 in principle every month, but I just realized that my real interest rate is even less because I can deduct mortgage interest.

With that said, is it even worth paying it off early? My goal *is* to pay it off as quickly as possible, hence why I've been doing that. But really my goal is simply to be financially independent in resilient in case of catastrophe. 

So my question is, if my effective interest rate is about 2.75% and I have a savings account that gives me 1.5% and inflation is around 2% what do these numbers do in terms of helping me make a decision? 

I'm thinking that since inflation is so close to my interest rate there's no point of even paying it off early. Is this decision rooted in correct logic?

Another thing I've been considering is finding a CD that offers about the same interest rate as my effective interest rate. Then, what I could do is save the $12K I normally put every year towards principle and put it in a CD. Since it matches the effective interest rate it's essentially equivalent to just paying it off early, except the money is even more liquid.

The other thing I was interested about is raising federal interest rates. With the fed rate rising, won't that mean CD's and other financial instruments will give me more money? If so, isn't that even less reason to pay it off early? 

EDIT: Just to clarify, I don't have any PMI -- 25% of the loan is paid off.",finance
personalfinance,Advice needed: major tax refund/bank issues 😣,"If this is the wrong place to post this question, I’m apologize, and if anyone can point me in the right direction, I’d be grateful. For now, buckle up kids, because this is a long one, kids. I’m stuck between a rock and a hard place, and I don’t know the ins and outs of the banking world or how to navigate it. Please, bear with me. I know it’s long but I genuinely need some words of wisdom. 

Basically, I fucked up. I gave the IRS the wrong account number to deposit my federal refund into. I own that, I don’t know how it happened, but I fucked up. Now, I’ve been told that, if that happens, there are 2 things that can happen: 1) it’s not a real account, and the bank will just send the money back to the IRS which will then send a check; 2) it’s an active account, but the bank sees that the name on the account and the name on the deposit don’t match and the bank will just send the money back to the IRS which will then send a check; in my case, neither of these things happened. Instead, the bank just deposited my refund into someone else’s account. The end. 

But not really. 

I end up having to check the IRS site to track my refund and I see that it was deposited a full 5 days earlier. 
The site tells me to call my bank. I call my bank. 
My bank tells me to call the IRS. I call the IRS. 
The IRS tells me to call my bank. I call my bank. 
My bank tells me to call the IRS. I call the IRS. 
The IRS tells me to call my bank. I call my bank. 
My bank tells me to call the IRS. I call the IRS. 
The IRS is closed for the day. 
Well shit. 

So, the following day, I call the IRS, and the lady who I tell all of this to literally laughs at me and says there’s nothing she can do and to call my bank. I call the bank, defeated, and explain everything again, in great detail, because they can’t seem to take notes for the next person I speak to so that they understand what’s going on. Finally, I get transferred to a woman who actually sounds like she knows what she’s doing - I get a reference number! Holy shit, I’m relieved as all getout and she tells me that it’s with the Claims/Adjustments department and to call back in 5 days to check in if I haven’t heard anything. 

I go all weekend thinking that yes, YES! this shit’s gonna get DONE. The bank will reverse the transaction, send the money back to the IRS, and I’ll get a check in ~5 weeks!

Then we get to today. The day that will live in infamy as the day I asked to speak with a supervisor for the first time in my life. I’m usually pretty chill on the phone. But I was told today that the Claims/Adjustments department decided, sometime within the past 5 days, that the IRS had to initiate the claim and that the bank couldn’t do it on my behalf. Now, this contradicts everything that I was told last week AND, by the way, no one bothered to notify me of this. I was blissfully unaware that my money is still in someone’s account, missing me more day by day.  

I asked to speak to her supervisor who proceeds to put me on hold for roughly 30 minutes, presumably to review my account and see what’s up. It’s all good, I get that, I just need some GD help. Then she comes on the line and said *“Thank you for our patience, I’m going to need to call you back before 5 to dig deeper.”*

I just don’t know what to do. Do I call a lawyer? Do I go to a physical bank and park myself there until this gets figured out? Do I switch banks once this ordeal is over?

personalfinance,Will savings accounts / money markets continue to increase in interest for the rest of the year? How should that affect my saving strategy?,"A few years ago, I remember Ally's online savings was notable for returning 1% (it's higher now).

Basically, I'm interested in:  
1) Will we see this trend continue?  
2) What factors affect this?

I've seen claims about a number of factors affecting savings interest rates, but it seems to mostly be affected by the strength of the economy and the Fed's interest rate. Assuming the economy continues to grow, will savings rates grow with it? The Fed raised interest rates multiple times in 2017, and savings account interest rates grew as well. I've seen a number of articles speculating the Fed will continue to raise rates, especially if unemployment stays so low.

Should we expect this trend to continue, possibly breaking 2% this year? If so, does it make sense to wait on moving my money, or should I invest at a 1.85% rate now? Most of my money is currently sitting in a low interest checking account. I suppose I can always put it in a 1.85% account now and move it later if it breaks 2%, but that seems like a hassle to constantly chase the highest rate.",finance

I currently pay $150.00 a month. I have gotten some raises this year so that would likely jump no matter what by $50.00 to $100.00. But with no income based repayment, it will be about $350.00 a month. 

I can pay that easy, and sometimes it is very useful for my budgeting and will power to have a mandatory bill. Additionally, the money is going to debt so it feels good too. But my school loans are now all federal loans with pretty decent interest rates. So I am wondering if it is more beneficial to continue the income based repayment and save the money or invest it once I have a hefty emergency fund?

personalfinance,(CAN) Student Debt (LOC / govt loans) - $50K+,"First time poster, long time reader. First time posting on any sub reddit actually. 24 y/o. 

I graduated university in Canada in December of 2015. I had both a government student loan (provincial &amp; federal) as well as a student line of credit from Scotia Bank. 

I currently make just over $38,000 annually and have been making all min. payments + some extra depending on the month. 

I have had a Repayment Assistance Plan for my goverment loans for the last 6 months. I probably, well didn't need to, apply for repayment assistance (I could have kept making payments) but I thought why not since since this would mean the gov't would cover the interest, so my monthly payments were only going on the principal. 

I am trying to decide is it worth re-applying for repayment assistance again, as my 6 month repayment assistance plan just ended, for another 6 months? I'm thinking yes, solely cause I wouldn't have to pay any interest on the loans which allows me to save up more $ for the time being to pay off a larger chunk at once / pay more than the min payment on my LOC. 

My current breakdown of my student debt as of March 1 is:

Federal loan - $22473.81 - 5.95%, 
Provincial loan - $3319.23 - 3.95%, 
- repayment assistance applies to both of the gov't loans. , 
ScotiaBank Student LOC - $26661.42 - 5.45%

Total of $52454.46. 

I am working on paying this off as quick as possible - long way to go but I am confident. So, do you guys think it makes since to keep leveraging repayment assistance (as long as they provide me with it) while making greater than min. payments on my LOC? With repayment assistance, I could likely keep making 2x my min payment on my LOC. 

Curious to hear what you guys think. Really appreciate it!

personalfinance,House Price vs Salary,"I've seen two somewhat conflicting rules of thumb about how to calculate a house price/mortgage payment based on your salary.

Method 1: 
2.5x-3x your salary is the max you should spend on your home. So if someone made $67k, the max they should purchase would be a $200k home.

Method 2:
Spend around 28% of your pre-tax income on a mortgage payment. I've also seen ~33% as a rule of thumb a fair amount (I'm not sure if this is pre or post tax). Looking at Zillow's mortgage estimate calculator, that same $67k salary could afford a $375k home using the 28% method, assuming a 30 year mortgage and 20% down. 

Is this difference maybe due to the relatively low interest rates in today's market? Is Zillow's calculator garbage?

Any insight would be much appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,26 Snowball or kind of snowball,"So I have 1400 saved in addition to some extra emergency cash. I'm going to put the 1400 into my student loans (17k) but I have the choice between a few different loans all through the same servicer.

I know the snowball method is great and that's what I'm thinking of but the problem is that I have 2 similar loans (1400 versus 1600) The 1400 is at 3.55% and the 1600 is at 6.55%. 

My question is should I do the traditional snowball of 1400 or pay off the 1600 since it's close enough and has a higher interest rate.

personalfinance,Don't forget that you can refinance your refinanced loans,"I refinanced my student loans about a year ago, and ended up with one big loan through a private lender, and a smaller loan I kept through federal financing due to the lower interest rate. My loans had previously been spread out from 8%-6.5%, but through the refinance, I got the big loan at a fixed 6%.

Today I was scrolling through [The Great Flow Chart](https://i.imgur.com/lSoUQr2.png), and thought I should revisit my 401k contributions. Currently, my employer doesn't offer a matching contribution, so I thought it would make sense to take the 6% of my salary I'd been setting aside for that and instead apply it to the student loans. I thought it'd be a good idea to see if I could get a lower interest rate as well.

It turns out I can consolidate and refinance both my loans through the current lender I am using, and drop the interest rate down on my big loan from 6% to 4.75%, and on my smaller loan from 5.41% to the same 4.75%. **If I continue the same payment** it knocks about a half a year on my total repayment plan, and saves over $8,000. **If I add my 6% salary contribution** it saves me a grand total of $14,000.

I'm now thinking about liquidating my general trading stocks (about $13,000 that have generally been underperforming, stagnating for about 5 years), and help knock out a bit more of the debt.

There's still several years' of work left to do, but I'm thankful this sub is here, otherwise this is the sort of thing I'd have ended up making minimal monthly payments on without a second thought. Thanks for saving me money, r/personalfinance !",finance

This is my first time posting here but I've been a long time lurker and y'all have helped me tremendously with getting my finances in order. I have a question for you guys regarding a home purchase.

I am purchasing a home in AZ and relocating there very soon. I have made it through all the hoops of home buying, and was supposed to close escrow today. At the last minute their underwriter requested a custom employment verification letter from my employer that, to make a long story short, is going to take them way too long to complete (huge corporation, impossibly difficult to get past red tape). The deal is now in jeopardy and I am running out of options.

Today my lender called and said that he can get around the letter requirement if we switch the loan to ""second home"" instead of primary residence. My immediate thought was that it would impact my taxes, and likely cause my interest rate to increase, but he assured me that neither of those are true. I have done a ton of research and I am getting a ton of different (conflicting) answers.

It seems that for a second home, the mortgage interest can be deducted as normal but the points have to be deducted over the life of the loan versus all together the following tax year. It also seems like the interest rate should almost certainly increase, but again he assured me that is not the case.

I plan to try and track down a CPA tomorrow morning that I can get professional advice from, but I wanted to get your thoughts as well to hopefully put my mind at ease (or at least level set me).

investing,Does anyone have a good summary of the book Timing the Market?,"https://www.amazon.com/Timing-Market-Technical-Analysis-Indicators/dp/0471708984/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1520995775&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=timing+the+market

This is the book I'm asking about.

As straight forward as the book seems to try to be, some things just aren't very clear imo. 

Here's the summary of Part I on yield curve.

Buy stocks when:

• The federal funds rate is declining.

• And the money market yield curve is positive.

• And bond quality spreads are shrinking.

• And the 10-year note, three-month bill spread is positive.


Sell stocks when:

• The federal funds rate is rising.

• And the 10-year, three-month spread is negative.

• And bond quality spreads are expanding.

• Or the yield on the 10-year note is greater than 10 percent.

How do you define the federal funds rate rising or declining? Over what period do you calculate? ex) Is the federal funds rate higher today than it was 3, 6, 9 months ago? etc.

Money market yields has 1 month, 3 month, 6 month and 1 year yields. How do you define the curve being positive? 1mth &lt; 3mth &lt; 6mth &lt; 1yr? Or do you just look at two numbers like 3 mth vs 1 yr? That is what the author seemingly does to determine whether the mid to long term yield is positive or inverted. She uses 10 year - 3 month. So what exactly do you use for the money market?

How do you define bond quality spreads shrinking? Over what period and by how much?

Also, there is a chapter she talks about long term yields inverting as a sign of upcoming decline. I think in one example she uses 20 yr vs 30 yr but then in the summary talks about 10 yr vs the longest dated treasury (which I assume she means 30 yr). So which is it? 20 vs 30 or 10 vs 30?



Does anyone have good answers for these? What are you opinions on this market timing strategy?",finance
personalfinance,Paying off CC Debt vs. 401k contributions,"Last year I found out that I deal with being unhappy and stressed by buying things for my hobbies. This equated to 15k of CC Debt.

I used unbury.us to develop a plan going forward and sought help to make sure I don't make this mistake again.

I am 23, I make 48k a year. I am currently contributing 15% pre tax into a 401k. I am then putting an additional 5% post tax into an Ally Savings account to build my emergency fund that is currently only $500. I have been prioritizing my debt over building an emergency fund and savings.

If I were to reduce my 401k to 4%, the amount required to get my company's match, I believe I could pay off my debt at least a few months earlier (debt free in October 2019 instead of January 2020).

My question is, which do I prioritize? Is being debt free a few months earlier worth the 11% loss in my 401k until then?

investing,Debt is creeping back up in sub-Saharan Africa,"This is for anyone that's interested in investing in frontier markets, especially in the countries that the article mentions.

https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21738410-unfortunately-keenest-borrowers-are-also-feckless-spenders-increasing-debt

&gt; Today the median debt level is over 50% of GDP. That is low by international standards, but interest rates are generally higher for African countries, which collect relatively little tax.

&gt; Borrowing makes sense for poor countries if it finances things like roads, schools and hospitals, which improve welfare and support economic growth. But the keenest borrowers in Africa are also feckless spenders. Take Ghana, which racked up debt as it ran an average annual budget deficit of 10% from 2012 to 2016. When a new government entered office last year, it found a $1.6bn “hole” in the budget. The new chairman of the state cocoa board found that a $1.8bn loan meant to fund cocoa production in 2017 was “all gone”.

&gt;  In Mozambique, three state-owned companies borrowed $2bn in deals arranged by European banks. Most of this was done in secret. The proceeds were squandered on overpriced security gear and a bogus fleet of trawlers. An audit could not trace $500m. The once-buoyant economy sank and Mozambique defaulted on its debt last year.

&gt; A study of 39 African countries from 1970 to 2010 found that for every dollar borrowed, up to 63 cents left the continent within five years. The money is often siphoned out as private assets, suggests Léonce Ndikumana, one of the researchers, based at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst

&gt; As it is, the costs of bad borrowing rarely fall on leaders or their lenders, which often makes politicians borrow (and steal) more. “It’s the common man that actually bears the brunt,” says Bernard Anaba of the Integrated Social Development Centre, a Ghanaian advocacy group.

This has caused no end of headaches over the years trying to get our withholding settings even vaguely in the right ballpark.  Shortly after she started working again, we used the calculators from the IRS to figure out what to set our withholding values to. We ended up owing over 10k that year. The next year we used the calculator our employer's payroll processor offered, we ended up closer, but still owed several thousand dollars. So using that I just pushed it a little higher on my withholding the next couple years until we just about broke even.

There were then a couple ""odd years"" that involved significantly different than normal taxes. Sales and purchases of houses, sales of stock shares, inheritances. 

Last year, while the withholding values were set the same as it's been for several years, we're looking at a rather sizable refund. Like big enough that it would have been rather helpful to have had that money in the bank last fall when I needed it, rather than loaned to the government at a much lower interest rate than I'm now paying on a loan I could have not taken out.

Jan - I finally get geico and AAA on a conference call. Turns out the other party has not responded to any calls/emails/letters etc and they are not going to pay without evidence. I try to dig up photos but my gallery auto deletes photos after 45 days! no backup.

Feb - AAA notifies me they have dropped case bc the other guy won't respond. They will not pay. They tell me lying is a crime.

Right now it seems my only option is to pay the 501$ and hope I win arb (I won't, right?)

personalfinance,"Marine Officer w/ 60k in debt, but looking to invest.","Just commissioned in December in the Marine Corps. 23 years old. Have about 30k through federal loans (3.5% average) and 30k in private (3.2% average). Marine Corps does NOT have a forgiveness program for student debt, only branch not to have one. 

Making about 3100 a month after TSP contribution (10% and government matches first 5%). All other areas of life are paid off, costs for food/entertainment are only real costs, or I dont have to pay (barracks is free to live in obviously).

Main thing I am getting at is student debt is relatively low on the interest side, and about 10k of that 60k is in military status is not even getting interest accrued. How would you go about setting your percentages in your budget? Main areas:
Student Debt
TSP
Investments
Rest of life

Last question, outside the matching TSP, is it worth opening up an IRA with this much student debt outstanding?

personalfinance,Discussing salary with coworkers.,"Just wondering if anyone had any experience with this - suggestions on how to broach the subject, anecdotes about their experience trying or having someone try with them. Or response from employers.


Overall I'm an advocate for sharing salary information with people with a practical interest (IE other people in the same/similar role). My general worldview being that the transparency can only help us all. Generally I find I get rebuffed when I offer to have a casual conversation about it - seems to make people uncomfortable.


Came to mind recently because my team was pulled into a managers office the other day and scolded because someone had been discussing salary on the floor. Some people in another department heard and we apparently had some anger. The meeting was ostensibly ""don't discuss this on the floor,"" but in my mind was definitely an attempt to suppress the entire discussion.",finance

personalfinance,Should I refinance my student loans because I can no longer deduct the interest?,"I have about $18,000 in student loans outstanding.  .  They are DL Stafford subsidized and unsubsidized loans with interest rates at the lowest 5.6% but most commonly 6.8%.  I make about $95,000 / year and have a stable career and I have no fear of losing my job.  I am 6 years post graduation and started with approximately $45,000 in student loans.  My current loan payment is about $400 per month on the graduate repayment plan.

When doing my taxes this year I recently learned that I can no longer deduct federal student loan interest because of my income which makes me think I should refinance.  Is this a good idea? Is there something I am missing? Is there any benefit to holding onto the loans as Stafford loans?

personalfinance,What to mail IRS when amending taxes for IRA contribution deduction?,"Hello,

I filed my 2017 taxes with Turbotax already and then I made an IRA contribution for 2017 but didn't include that in my original return so I am in the process of amending my 2017 taxes. I used Turbotax to amend the 2017 taxes. I just answered some questions about the IRA contribution and I got a new PDF from Turbotax with my forms. It includes everything from my 2017 taxes as well as a 1040X. I am assuming I only need to send the 1040X and nothing else like state taxes and the like? I did notice my 1040 shows a different AGI so do I also need to include the 1040? As far as I can tell my Schedule A, Schedule D, 8949, 8863 are not different from before. Again the only change I am making is deducting my IRA contribution from my 2017 federal taxes.

personalfinance,Can we afford this house? We love it and are ready to pull the trigger.,"r/personalfinance, we need your input!:) We have found a house that we love, and the asking price is $570,000.  We are prepared to offer $550,000.  

We are both 35 year old attorneys and have steady jobs in State government.  We have 2 very young children (ages 3 and 1), and plan to have another child in the immediate future.  H doesn't have room for job growth at the minute, as he has to stay at current job for PSLF (massive student loan on track to be forgiven in August 2022). W will likely have the opportunity to get a job at a big firm next year that would probably pay $150,000+/yr.  Even if offered though (which is somewhat likely), we do not know if it would be a good fit for our family and therefore she may choose not accept it.

&amp;nbsp;

**Here are our financial details:**

- W's gross annual income: $85,750  
- H's gross annual income: $69,250

Our combined take home pay is $6,900/mo.  This number seems low, but it is correct.  We both max out our 457(b) plans (18.5k each), and have a number of other deductions such as a health insurance, mandatory pension contributions, flex spending account, commuter train pass, etc.

According to Zillow, our current house is worth $367,000, but I think that estimate is high.  Based on recent sales, I think our home is worth closer to $350,000.  We still owe $222,000 at 3.5% on it, meaning we have roughly $128,000 in home equity.

Our only other debt is our auto loan, of which we owe $8,000 at 0% interest. 

We put all our daily spend on credit cards (for the points!!  Shoutout to r/churning!), and we pay the balance off in full each month.  This month's credit card bills total $4,500.  

&amp;nbsp;

**Our current liquid assets are as follows (which total $49,500):**

- Emergency Fund: $21,200
- Savings: $21,300
- Checking:  $7,000   
*note: These figures are not as high as they could have been because we aggressively paid off W's law school loans ($80k) last year.  It was a 10 year loan that we paid off in 7 years)

&amp;nbsp;

**Investment/Retirement accounts (which total approx: $225,000):**

- W's 457(b): $70,000
- H's 457(b): $70,000
- W's 401(k) from old employer: $52,200
- H's IRA: $11,400
- Child A 529 college fund: $13,000
- Child B 529 college fund: $5,400
- Vanguard Index fund: $4,600
- Brokerage account: $600

&amp;nbsp;

**Misc. assets:**

- Cryptocurrency: $7,000
- Credit card points: $3,000

We also have about $25,000 worth of pension contributions that we could withdraw in the event we left our jobs and opted out of collecting the pensions at retirement. 


&amp;nbsp;


**Our current rough monthly budget/expenditures (Total is approx. $4,850)**

- Mortgage: $1,170
- Extra principle payment on mortgage: $330
- Home insurance: $70
- Property taxes: $600
- Utilities: $230
- Groceries: $600 
- Restaurants: $200
- Car payment: $445
- Car insurance: $90
- Gas for car: $150
- Car maintenance: $90
- Tolls: $50
- Cell phone: $60
- Internet/streaming services/subscriptions: $90
- Gym membership: $13
- Kids swim class: $80
- Investment in kids' 529 college funds: $400
- Investment in Vanguard Index fund: $100 
- Student loan payment: $76 (H is in PSLF, and law school loans (which are north of $200,000) are on track for forgiveness in August 2022)  

*Note that many of the above expenditures are voluntary, such as the extra payment on mortgage principal, 529 college contributions, index fund investments, and even our retirement contributions.  If we ever wanted to hit the pause button on all of those (which I don't see us doing), it would increase our take home pay by $4,000/mo.    

Also note that we currently do not pay for daycare, as grandma watches the kids at her home day care for free.  Once the kids start school, I assume we will have to start paying at least something in child care to tide us over until the earliest parent gets home.  

Sorry for this wall of information.  I cant decide if I provided too many details or too few.  I can update the post to include any info that may be helpful to this community in evaluating our prospects of buying this house.  So r/personalfinance, what do you think?  I appreciate any input that you all can give me!  

*edit 1: Included more info as requested in the comments
*edit 2: I had a typo in what I think my current home is worth.  Thus, I think home equity is $128,000 rather than $113,000
*edit 3: added interest rates of loans",finance

personalfinance,What to do about getting a credit card with “fair” credit?,"Hi Everybody,

I am in my early 20s. My credit used to be in the high “good” range, but I was late on 2 student loan payments by 60 days because they had the wrong contact info for me (I disputed it for this reason but didn’t win), and it dropped my score 140 points down to the low “fair” range. I am devastated. Credit Karma says I have 9 accounts, and need 11 to boost my score, since my credit history is young. I have never missed a car payment or cc payment before. I was hoping to get another credit card (I have a student cc now with a $2500 limit that is about half used, I’m not sure what the interest rate is) I will be moving cross country for work and will likely be using up the rest of the card and need more credit. I work part time as a server right now but will have a full time job in my career field when I move. I applied for a Capital One card but got denied. 
Any advice on what to do or any cards I can apply for? I can’t risk hurting my score any further, but I’m fresh out of college and have no savings and am getting concerned.",finance
financialindependence,"FI, Cancer and Dying Young. My Story...","Let me just start off by saying everything is going to be OK. I am going to try and make this short and sweet. I am not the best at writing, it was never my strong suit. I have been going back and forth if I should post this or not, but I think it will help a few.

When I was 27 years old I was diagnosed with colon cancer. I spent the next 3 years in and out of hospitals, had about 10 surgeries, lots of complications from said surgeries. I could have a rolodex of doctors and surgeons names that somehow have been involved in trying to fix me. I had sepsis twice (one time very severe), 12 months in a hospital bed being fed and hydrated through tubes (seriously never got to taste or drink anything for about 7 months), blood clots from my PICC lines and all sorts of the weirdest, gruesomest shit happen to me. I was about 170 pounds when I started, down to 115 in the hospital.

Anyways, after those awful 3 years I am finally home for good. It was hell but it is past me. I go in for my annual scan and my lungs lit up like a Christmas tree. Given my medical history and how late the cancer was when removed they assumed the worst.  I was given a year to live, or a year and half with chemo. They decided to a biopsy on my lungs, more as formality to confirm the cancer. I had about a 30 days before the biopsy. 30 days to start picturing how I want to live the rest of my short life.

This is where I want to relate with the rest of my financial independent people. I know some might feel nervous about never getting to experience the life you worked so hard for due to dying before reaching your goal.

I want to say that not once did I ever regret saving and building a nest egg for my future. I still felt like I lived a good life even though I saved a good portion of my money. In fact, I was relieved that I did. Knowing that I had a decent size portfolio that my wife would take over was such a relief. Knowing that she would still be taken care of, at least financially, when I was gone was a huge weight off my shoulder. I would not have changed anything in my past, even knowing I could have took bigger vacations, nicer cars and a bigger house. I was very content with the life I had. I seriously had not one ounce of regret that I saved so much of my income.

Just like I said though at the very top, everything is OK. The biopsy came back and it was negative for cancer. I have another condition named Sarcoidosis, which will look like lung cancer under a CT. Myself, the doctors, my wife, and family were all shocked. If it was in fact lung cancer, as of right now, I would probably be close to dead.

I am sure some of you on your way to financial independence considered the possibility of not surviving before reaching your goal. At least I know I did. What happens if you die young? What happens if you don't get to enjoy your nestegg that you worked so hard for? Now I know what it feels like. I had a nice, little townhouse, a wonderful wife, a little bratty dog, and took nice vacations with family and friends. Life was and is still very good. Just make sure you still live a good life on your journey to FI and I assure you will have no regrets.

Edit: I just want to thank all of you for the nice comments, stories, inspirations and of course the gold! You guys brightened up my day. Seriously, thank you, it is greatly appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,Desperately need help with student financing (US),"I am a non traditional student in the US who has been attending a community college since 2015, and I have just been accepted to a university where I will be able to complete my degree in Meteorology. I will begin classes at the University this fall, and graduate by 2020. If I stick to this plan, I will be 32 when I graduate. Better late than never I suppose, but I should still have plenty of time to get settled into a fulfilling career, pay off any student loans, and set myself up for retirement.

As of today, I am working over 50 hours/week at an office job while taking 10 credit hours at my community college. I get about 5 hours of sleep/night, I haven't seen my friends in months, I haven't done laundry in weeks, and eat almost exclusively in my car driving between home/work/school. I’ve been doing this for three years, and I feel like I’m going mad. Working full time and going to school is no longer sustainable for me. It’s impacting my health -- physically, mentally, and spiritually. 

My goal is to quit my job at the end of the year (December, 2018) and attend school full time at the university. The classes I need to complete my degree are all higher science and math classes, some of which require labs or field work, so these aren't offered online or during the evening. I planned on living off grants and scholarships, and supplementing the additional costs of living with student loans over the following two years (2019-2020) while I finish my degree.

I met with a financial aid adviser on 03/09 at the university to discuss my options, and I was advised that all financial aid has annual limits. The maximum grant/scholarship/federal loan/private loan combination I could get as an unemployed, single, independent student would not be enough to cover my cost of living with tuition plus school related expenses. My limit is approximately $26.5k/year, with tuition and school fees adding up to approximately $11k/year. Additionally, if I work part time, my reported income will lower this limit further. I have made some drastic adjustments to my lifestyle to lower my cost of living (ie. getting a roommate &amp; cutting out unnecessary spending). I also calculated my minimum CoL plus the approximate annual tuition, books, fees, and university health care, which will come to roughly $35k/year. 

I don't have any debt, and I have excellent credit. I have a 9 month emergency fund and a 401k, but due to a traumatic life event in 2016, I don't have any additional savings.

I've asked the university if there is any way to have the limit raised through an appeal or some kind of special consideration, but they said this limit is determined by the department of education. Their suggestions included moving in with my parents (who live on the other side of the country), making early withdrawals from my 401k, or getting married and making a spouse support me (I'm hopelessly single). I have no idea how to cover the difference, and I am worried this might be the end of my academic career. 

I also hate my job. I've been with my employer for 10 years in various roles, currently doing fiber construction project management. I'm unfulfilled and it's weighing heavily on me. The bottom line is this: I’m burned out. I can’t keep doing 18-19 hour days of non-stop work. I’ve come to a point where I either have to quit my job or quit school. I am an “A” student and I don’t want to throw away all my hard work or give up on my life's dream and be stuck in my shit job due to a lack of financing. 

I’ve been researching options and asking both schools for help with this, but I am getting nowhere. I’m desperate and frustrated at this point, so I’m really hoping reddit can point me in the right direction.

personalfinance,How does 4.875 mortgage interest rate sound right now?,"Broker quoted us 4.875 for a traditional 30 year fixed.  Our income is good, the quoted payment (including tax and insurance) is about 18% of our our gross monthly income, all other debt payments are another 5-6% of our monthly income.  5% down payment (gift from family) and I think we may be borrowing for additional closing costs. Credit is 770.

It sucks that we don't have more cash to put down right now, but we finally took over a business last year (after struggling for a while), and with the income increase in 2017, should make plenty of money going forward to afford the house in the long term. 

4.875 doesn't sound like the lowest out there, but we have hardly any cash to put down, so maybe it's ok.

investing,[Question] Should you use debt/loan interest rates for calculating the Sharpe Ratio versus US Treasury Bills?,"Currently I am learning about the [Sharpe Ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sharperatio.asp). The Sharpe Ratio is usually tied to the value of US Treasury Bills as they are defined as an almost risk free investment. 

Typically rates of return on things like Student Loans and Mortgages have been higher than US Treasury Bills in recent years. So, for a personal investment strategy when evaluating your reward/volatility, it would seem that you should use the highest risk free rate you have at your disposal. 

When creating a personal investment portfolio would it make sense to use Student Loans or a Mortgage Rate as the risk free rate instead of US Treasury Bills due to those being guaranteed returns on investments? When constructing a portfolio do you ignore debt payoff?",finance

1) How much debt did you pay off with the consolidation?

2) How much of an improvement was the consolidated payment compared to the individual bills prior?

3) How much did (or didn’t) your credit score affect the amount you borrowed and your interest rate?

4) What was your monthly payment per thousand dollars borrowed?

5) If you had it to do over again, would you instead open a 0% credit card and use that to transfer balances?

6) Was it ultimately a good choice for you to do the consolidation?

personalfinance,"I'm trying to form a plan to move out of my parent's house. Looking for advice on my budget, time frame, and anything I may be missing.","Hello all, I'm putting together a plan with the goal of getting my own place. I'm 22F, still in college. I've learned a lot about finance but I still feel like I've only scratched the surface, especially because I'm so inexperienced.               

I'm familiar with the general advice, which is to stay with your parents as long as they generously let you, because you can save up a lot and not have to deal with a multitude of costly things. However, I want to move out for a few reasons which at this point I think are valid:               

- **Ideological differences:** I'm getting tired of lying about my political/religious beliefs, and sexual orientation. I don't know if they would even want me around if I voiced my true beliefs. It doesn't seem too crazy to me to pay money to be able to live somewhere where I don't need to constantly censor myself and lie. I've been doing this for so many years and I'm pretty done.               

- **Comfort:** I don't have air conditioning in my room, and the average summer temperature here is 106F, and it can get way higher. Even with fans summer nights are horrible. In the same vein, I don't have heating. This one isn't as bad because layering, as well as winter nights rarely going below freezing, but I still hate the cold during the winter.                    

- **Space:** This one is much less valid than the previous two, as plenty of people get by on even less space than I have. That said, I feel trapped in my tiny room and I crave space of my own. At least enough room for a real bed.                  

-----------------------                     

**GAME PLAN**                

Now that I've shared my justifications (which I still am not sure are good reasons, fiscally, to move out), here is my plan for doing it, as well as my projected budget.                   

1. Start new position in May, bringing my monthly gross income to ~$2000.               

2. Pay off my $1700 student loan asap. Low interest rate federal loan, and the only debt I have.

3. After expenses, keep budget tight and save as much as I can.                 

4. Once I save up a 6 month emergency fund + first&amp;last rent, move into a $700/month apartment. Ideally this would probably happen by January 2019.                     

**BUDGET**                

Here is what my monthly budget would look like once I move out. I'm being very liberal with my numbers here.                 

- Rent + Renter's insurance: $780               

- Food + Supplies: $150 (probably less, I've been eating for $100/month, I've gotten good at cooking tasty shit for cheap)                 

- Utilities: $177                  

- Internet: $50                  

- Cell Phone: $30                   

- Gasoline: $100                   

- Car Insurance: $100                     

- Vehicle maintenance: $50                  

- Gym: $40 (may eliminate this by investing in a budget home gym setup)                 

- Social: $100 (I try to keep this cost down, but relationships are expensive)                  

This comes to $1577, leaving me $423/month to put directly into savings and investments.                     
I don't have a car payment, and school is paid for through a program with my job.                 

---------------------                

This is far from a permanent setup, as I'll be working a lot to support it as well as finishing my online classes. Ideally I'll finish my bachelor's in less than two years and get a job paying more than $10/hour.                     

What do you think? Is this feasible, and is it worth it? I'm not happy how I'm living now, and I want to change that. However I don't want to make a stupid decision that I'll regret later. Most of all I just feel trapped, and I want a plan for getting out. My target above is January 2019, but I'm willing to move that date as far out as it needs to be, I just need a plan.

At the advice of my friends, I took most of my savings and bought 8 bitcoins back in early 2017 for about $7200. You can imagine how I felt when it went up. Around December 2017, I got caught up in the altcoins frenzy and sold most of my bitcoins (about $120k worth) to buy a bunch of different coins. I didn't know this back then but it looks like I owe income taxes on those trades, which adds up to about $50k if I add up state (California) and federal. But with the crash that happened recently, I added up my altcoins and I only have like $30k worth. I only have about $5k in other savings.

How do I pay this? Do I have to sell my altcoins, and give them what I can? Or is there some workaround?

I recently opened an account with Chase and it works for my life now, but I've always been told that credit unions are better. Plus, this is my oldest account, so I'm worried closing it will hurt my credit score. But I moved to another state, so anything I'd need to go to a branch for isn't possible anymore (depositing checks, getting a loan, notary service). They don't have useful mobile tech like Chase does such as depositing a check through the app. And I've had issues with the union before, like when I signed papers clearing my card for international use and they assured me my card would work only to get stranded overseas and forced to use western union. Then the time they froze my account because I spent outside my normal budget, so my card was declined during a client lunch (very awkward). When Chase saw an unusual charge, they texted me and asked if it was ok, I texted yes, no problem. The last straw was when my mortgage checked my bank history and found overdraft charges totalling $200 for amounts that never even hit my account that the union had been charging without notifying me (I am against overdraft protection, would not have approved that).

personalfinance,Which debt to tackle first...,"I had a credit account that my parents managed while I was in college. To not much surprise this was a bad idea. I thought that my balance was pretty low and manageable until now that I have accessed the account. I thought it would be around $2.5k but it actually turned out to be $5.8k. I know I made a huge mistake by not looking into my building credit card debt until now but hindsight is 20/20. Upon accessing the account I found out that my interest rate is 30.8%. Yikes.

I have been making payments of $200 a month but the interest alone has been $80-$100. So Ive made barely a dent into my principal. On top of this debt I have $23k in student loan debt and $10k in car financing until next April. I also have $3.5 is debt on a second card with a furniture purchase with no APR for 12 months (2 months in at minimum payment $150) I just recently got a job out of college that is paying $84k base with an estimated $6k year end bonus and $2.3k in additional overtime pay. Note that this is all pre tax in NJ as a single male with no kids or property (I rent).

My estimate monthly expenses of rent, utilities, and neccesities are $2.15k and my take home after taxes is $5.2k (not including OT and bonuses).

My plan as I have been calculating is to tackle the high interest credit card at $5.8k with all my OT dollars this month $2.3k (~$1.8k after tax) and to snowball it from $300 to $600 over the rest of the year. Then close the account and search for a low interest card or credit union or renegotiate the rate. Make minimun payments on the furniture account and student loans for the next 3 months then double them. I plan on dedicating my year end bonus entirely to the student loan. The APR on the furniture account isn't crazy (&gt;25%) especially after 12 months without it sp the principal should be &gt;$1.5k by the end of the no interesst period. I should recieve a 6% minimum raise in June 2019 (although I expect a 10-20% increase given corporate structure and typical advancements).

I wanna eliminate debt ASAP so I can help my parents with their expenses but I also don't desire an entirely frugal life style. I grew up in the most frugalist of lifestyles and ended up in this position by living beyond my means in college (my parents wanted me to not worry about money in school so they opened up my credit but now it's come back to bite me). In my current situation and plan I have calculated a repayment time on my credit card and furniture account of 1.5 years. The student loans are more flexible and lower interest (6%-12%, some subsidized sone not) so I dont mind stretching it out over 5 or so years.

Am I being realistic? I have considering seeing if Wells Fargo or TD Bank will transfer my credit card balance and give me a lower rate. Is that idea realistic or will it provide a meager benefit (considering I went from $0k a year in the credit account creation to $83k when working). 

This seems pretty complicated to me and Im not very confident in my planning so should I consult a professional accountant or financial planner? My friend at Mass Mutual can help me out with planning but Im not sure about helping my current finances.

gaming,Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain's Awful Story (SPOILERS),"MGSV:TPP has an incomplete ending.  I felt hollow inside upon learning that my character was a fake the entire time, and he dies pretty much in vain in Metal Gear.  The story also ends very abruptly, with no real in-game conclusion, just a flashback.  And the flashback is just something you've already seen, but with truth sprinkled on it.  It's very boring and unfulfilling.  A very improper ending.  If you want an actual epilogue, you need to look in other games.  The story does not resolve itself within itself, which is a horrible flaw that was completely ignored.

Basically:

- Eli is Liquid Snake
- The Third Boy is Psycho Mantis
- You die in Metal Gear

Eli being Liquid Snake and your death are explained in fast, scrolling text, which is fucking lazy, while The Third Boy being Psycho Mantis is essentially force-fed to you with the ""Mantis"" emblem decal.  Also, may I ask, WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED TO SAHELANTHROPUS?! It just peaced out! After doing some research, I found out that it had been renamed ST-84 and was in another Metal Gear game.  Still, it should be fully explained in MGSV:TPP! It was also incredibly unsatisfying when Sahelanthropus, the children, and Eli left suddenly, all of which you worked incredibly hard to attain! I can see why people hate this game's story.  It has so much potential and yet it fucks up in so many areas! So disappointing too, since the gameplay is awesome.  If you want to play the game, please, for your own sake, ignore the story, it is hot garbage.

I'd like to add some other details at the bottom here.  First of all, this is my first Metal Gear game, most of my research is from in-game and from Wiki articles.  I'm probably wrong about some of these things, so please feel free to correct me.  Second, this is essentially me reposting a bunch of Twitter posts I made.  I spent a while forming my ideas and I didn't really want nobody to see them, so I hope you don't mind me sharing them here.  Finally, I'd like to say that I do not hate MGSV:TPP as a whole, I just really despise its story.  If you don't agree with my opinion, please leave a comment telling me why I'm wrong.

What can I do?","Quick summary: now that I've seemingly reached something resembling financial independence after years of slogging through my 20-something years, I'm now turning my sights toward something that I really shouldn't have put off: my student loans. 5-10 years of interest accumulation have turned them into real monsters, especially given my currently modest income.

After coming across a variety of compelling-looking posts here on personal finance, I figured the time is now to spin up an alt account and get some more advice on top of that which I've already solicited. Anyone have thoughts on how I make it so I can conceivably both pay off this debt and have more than a thousand dollars saved up for, say, living a potentially comfortable life after I'm 40?

* Domestic situation: Living in Los Angeles with girlfriend and paying very affordable rent for LA. Stable, we've navigated some tough waters in our relationship already and come out better, and she's already told me that short of DV (which I'd die before committing), she's not going to throw me on the street if we were to break up. Rent and living is expected to remain consistent. We have no plans to have children, nor to own a house in the next ten years.

* Primary Job situation: After having temped on and off for over a year, I've very recently landed a stable 32-hour/wk office job for a non-profit that pays $21.25/hr with good benefits. The company itself is quite stable and reputable, but I also have no idea yet what kind of mobility I have at the company. This is job-to-keep-the-lights-on type work for me.

* Secondary Job situation: My main career interest and field of study is in freelance soundtrack music composition, but suffice it to say I still have  developmental and networking hurdles to clear before I can make that my full time work (I tried half-heartedly for 6 years on parental handouts, thus the present predicament). I'm great at the work but god awful at finding it. I plan on seeking out that income on weekends once the job settles and I can start creating again, but in the meantime, I've also told my old temp agency to contact me if weekend opportunities come up. I'm treating this work as windfall income.

* Transportation: I drive a 95 previa in fair condition, while my girlfriend drives a prius in great condition. Since my work pays for my bus fare, my minivan barely sees any use. With my recent change of address, I expect to be paying somewhere between $1800-2600 a year in insurance, registration, gas, and maintenance.

 Accounts: If all goes well, will have $1400 in checking and $1400 in savings at the end of March. I have no credit cards or non-student-loan debt and a credit score around 725.

 Monthly Revenue:
 Job: Roughly $2126.14/mo after taxes and benefits (Assuming 128 hours in a month), paid semi-monthly
 Freelance: varies wildly, treating as windfalls for the time being.

 Monthly Expenses:
 Rent: $500/mo
 Utilities: ~$40/mo (billed every two months)
 Internet: $23/mo
 Groceries: $200/mo
 Sundries/Laundry: $60/mo
 Gas and Parking: $40/mo (I rarely have to get gas for my minivan, but I split my girlfriend's gas and help with parking when we drive together in her prius)
 No Gym fees nor mass transit expenses (both provided by employer)
 Leisure, Lunch, and Dine Out: $150/mo. I'd like for this to be lower and groceries higher.
 Medical/Dental/Vision contingency: $50/mo after benefit deductions (going from medi-cal to Kaiser High, have no prescriptions nor major medical conditions but cannot risk a disaster on a low or medium plan with current savings).
 Web Subscriptions: $6/mo
 General Contingency (5% of other nonloan expenses rounded up to nearest 10: $70

 Car Maintenance: $50/quarter (old car with gasket issues needs more frequent oil changes).

 Car Insurance: Either $1500/yr or $2000/yr depending on how my mid-period address change interacts with my policy.

 Car Registration/Smogging: $200/yr.

 **And now, the big monster student loan debt (minimum monthly payments all rounded up to a 10):**

 Actively being paid off after 5 years of forbearance and 1 year unemployment deferment):
 * Utah SBR Undergrad - $5017, 6.8% Fixed Rate, $70 MMP. This one's capitalized once already.
 * EFS Undergrad - $6220, 6.8% Fixed Rate, $80 MMP. This one's also capitalized once already.

 Coming off deferment at the end of March after 5 years of forbearance and 2 years unemployment deferment to date):
 * Federal Subsidized Grad - $8009.25 + $1656 accrued interest, 6.8% Fixed Rate, $120 MMP. This one will likely capitalize once deferment ends.
 * Federal Unsubsidized Grad - $12108.89 + $3544.01 accrued interest, 6.8% Fixed Rate, $200 MMP. This one will likely capitalize once deferment ends.
 * Federal Unsubsidized Grad (HUGE) - $28185.07 + 9571.02 accrued interest, 7.9% Fixed Rate, $490 MMP. This one will likely capitalize once deferment ends.

Lastly they can manipulate the price of kyber by adjusting the burn rate. It's genius but not free market.

I owe a total of almost $17,000 in debt. I really don't know a lot about finance so I need advice on what specifically to do with my money.

Back in 2015 I started my first year at college. I was in a really bad mental place in a very bad home situation. My mother told me she would handle tuition then never helped me financially at all when bills for tuition payments came in. The dorm I was required to live in costed $10k for the year, tuition was $12k. I aced my first semester at school, but faced with the huge looming financial situation with no family to turn to, I completely failed my second semester while entering a massive depression. I ended the school year in May 2016 homeless, and having failed all my second semester courses, and also in $22,000 in debt.

I thought all was lost but a friend helped me get my act together. I got a payment plan set up with my school. I moved to another state where cost of living is much cheaper. I've been working restaurant jobs for nearly 2 years, starting from minimum wage. I currently make $12/hr. I have now saved my way up to $12,700. I have remaining $12,400 in payments owed directly to my old school. I also owe about $3,800 for federal loan payments. I have payment plans in place where I pay my old school $300/month, and I pay $50/month towards the federal loans. The school payment has no interest, while the federal loan has 4.29% interest.

I am planning to return to school at a local university, starting January 2019. The tuition is 2.5k/semester, so $5k per year. I know I will be accepted (low bar of admission).

Despite being estranged from my parents, and being a financial independent, I am considered a dependent for FAFSA purposes since I am only 20 years old. My father makes somewhere in the ballpark of $200,000 per year. So I get 0 financial assistance even though I am basically living alone in poverty paying for school out of pocket in a different part of the country.

My questions are thus:

1. When should I pay off my debt? Should I just pay off my old school in full immediately or wait until I have more saved up to have a greater emergency fund in the meantime?

2. Should I just pay off the federal loan immediately since it has interest on it?

3. If I hold off on paying my debt in full for another half year, what should I do with my money in the meantime? Just have it sitting in the bank?

4. Is there any way to change my independent status for FAFSA purposes or get any kind of financial aid for being low income since I don't get anything from my parents?

What is on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/stocks?

personalfinance,My interest rate is 6% on a RLOC. My monthly payment is $100. $76.35 goes towards principle and $23.65 goes towards interest. How is my interest rate 6% and not 23.65%?,[deleted],finance
CryptoCurrency,PSA for my fellow Crypto Noobs,"Take this entire post with a grain of salt- I'm an amateur. The idiot that bought the TRON bags off whales from $0.16 on down. The guy that didn't even know what an alt pairing was, much less a market cycle. Almost everyone in the market including me has been in panic, because what comes next after the shitshow being painted on the charts? After a 60-90% loss since most coins ATH's, you start to wonder if it's even worth it anymore. Makes you wanna give up doesn't it? Makes you want to **sell for a loss, and try to get back in when things pick back up, right? That is the point.**
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

You were *meant* to be scared, to finish this quarters cycle. It's natural and only human. But you were tricked. Very wealthy people manipulated your emotions, just like they did mine. But I've learned. This market runs in cycles, and right now is no reason to suspect otherwise. In fact, it only reinforces the principle. Anyone who has been in Crypto long enough has probably been trying to tell you that, either directly or indirectly. For those of us noobs who have consistently panic sold, we were told to #HODL by the vets for a reason. Too many of us take the TRUE definition of that acronym a little too lightly I think. We didn't/don't quite know how to properly trade yet. We didn't/don't know how to spot a cycle. Had we of held instead of sold like we were told, yes, we would be at a 'huge loss'. HOWEVER, you *do not lose* until you *sell*. If I still had alllllllll the crypto I'd lost due to panic selling, my portfolio would be insane to look at in about 1 month. So would yours. But we helped finish this cycle, and because of that, the whales were fed.
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

So, we have panic selling all the way down now to the monthly ATL; $7,666.00. I want to point something out to everyone. Remember back when we had first busted through $10k and everyone including me was celebrating, meanwhile the much smarter bears were constantly warning people it wasn't over yet? They were right. They spotted the **cycle** a mile away. Idiots like me were happily scooping up bags of crypto off the bulls thinkin we were about to get rich quick. I was a bear myself and didn't even know it, and very likely, so were you. Problem was, we were the bears buying alts at their monthly highs (then) instead of their monthly lows(now). This of course caused you and me to panic-sell now numerous times, for numerous losses. However, I've gotten a little smarter. And so should you.
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Nobody is going to hand you a moonshot. You have to work for it. Analyze charts, learn to spot patterns and read indicators. ONLY invest money, if you could take that money right now and legitimately throw it in the toilet and flush it, and it won't affect you or make you regret doing it. You were told this for a reason. Yet most of us didn't listen, and look where the market is now? READ. READ READ READ AND READ. Then, MORE READ. The more reading you do the more you learn the fundamentals of the market, what drives it, and what drives it **into a fucking wall.**.
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

If you want to actually make any kind of substantial wealth, you need to invest TIME. Take the time to learn about the Cryptos you are investing in. Don't just blindly follow moonshots like I did. For example, I'm not a fan of Neo, but I agree when people say it's gonna be huge this year. Little known fact of NEO to new investors, you get paid in an alt called GAS, just to hold it. That means you're getting MORE money, for getting MORE money. I only know this because I saw the hype for it on this sub and decided to see what it was all about. For that very reason alone, I know NEO will be huge. How many cryptos do you know of that pay you for holding their token? I'll give you a hint - there aren't many. Do your research. Go on TradingView every day, get a general idea of the sentiment in the market for that day in BTC and the cryptos you hold. Visit the subreddits for each of your cryptos and see if there is any news. Sometimes, every now and again, a Crypto puts out huge news in their sub and then it pumps HARD. But you missed free profit because you were too lazy to invest 2 minutes to check the front page of their sub. The more information you have on any given day, is more information you didn't have yesterday. On days like today, you could of possibly seen this coming just due to due diligence.
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Smart money is rolling in, dumb money is rolling out. That is what the entire point of market cycles are, and why I truly believe Crypto will thrive FAR MORE this year than last. We made it to $800B market cap this past year. I suspect 10 Trillion or more by 2018's end. What do you think will happen when Joe Schmoe (The general public) who bought BTC at $19k and sold it at $10k is gonna do when he sees Bitcoin skyrocket past $20k again? FOMO. Then, the cycle starts all over again for another quarter, and so on. I believe that as these cycles continue, it will consistently kick dumb money out of the market. It will also kick shitcoins, scamcoins, and anything worth less than a deflated hookers nipple right out of the market.
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

I don't believe that we are truly yet in a bubble, just because of the cycles. They unfortunately have to happen, but they weed out a lot of negative fundamentals for the market, thus preventing the 'bubble' from popping.  
Every year, at about the same time.
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

In closing, I'd like to say that I am personally plugging BTC. This is not advice, DYOR. However, I truly believe that by mid April, we will be at or near the previous ATH's. By Mid/end of July, BTC will be at $30,000 - $40,000. By September/October, $50,000 - $70,000. By the end of the bull run, December 31st, 2018? I believe we will see a 6 figure BTC. Possibly 1/4 to 1/2 of a million dollars.   
Call me crazy, but leave a !RemindMe comment, wait and watch. Again, this is not financial advice, just my prediction.  
Guys, lets smarten up and stop letting the whales beat us down.

As far as I know, my credit score is fine, I haven’t checked it in a while though. My friends keep telling me I should refinance my car loan but, how do I go about that? I’ve been doing google searches but all the information I’m coming to is vague and leaves me more confused than before.

Edit: I just checked my credit score, it’s 670",finance
personalfinance,Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund (Settlement fund),"I had an old 401k with a company when I was a teenager I worked at for a few years. Didn't take right steps, forgot about it, it was transferred to a holding company until I claimed it which I did recently. Now, I have it transferred from there to vanguard in a ""settlement fund"". I just wanted to make sure I was doing this right.

What option applies to my account? sell to buy or just buy funds? I just realized I am still in a 7 day wait period where the shares are unavailable so that's is actually probably why I am not able to invest right now. Just to make sure though, I am ready to go as far as investing in VFIFX retirement funds without any more conversions? Never had an IRA through Vanguard before and can't really find too much specifically about settlement funds. and search is down right now. Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Best way to go about financing a car?,"Thank you for the help in advance.

My husband and I are in dire need of purchasing a new vehicle. We currently have a gas guzzler (tahoe) and a nissan (which is not running) between working full time and being a mom having one running car is a bit stressful. 

My credit is non existent since my father always taught me that credit cards were the devils product and debt was very bad. (he has no credit cards [to my knowledge] but somehow has amazing credit.. dont know he managed but I somehow can't do the same) my husband is working on his credit and its at 650-671 

We are trying to buy a new honda civic to avoid using our gas guzzler. 

What would be the best way to go about financing a car? I have looked and read that going in with a financing option is always helpful. I wanted to see if anyone could give me advise. 

Since my credit is non existent should my husband and I apply for a car loan together or should he apply alone?

We have calculated our expenses and our income and can pay for the car and full coverage insurance and still have a few hundred to put towards our savings. 
I do not want to get raped by interest rates since our credit isn't perfect.

We will be trading in the nissan to get some credit and also be putting some of our savings as a down payment for the honda. 
I've been speaking with a sales rep and the original ticket price for the 2017 honda is $19850 but I got them to lower it to $17500. 
The nissan is a 2010 and have calculated the trade vaule to be $1500-$2000 and we are ready to drop $2000 from our savings. 

Any idea how it will be easier for us? 

I apologize if this doesn't make sense. I wanted a different input than my car goggle thoughts (me wanting a new car thoughts)

Thank you",finance
personalfinance,Unexpectedly received my tax refund,"Ill try to keep this short and sweet. I owe back taxes from when i was working 1099 (around $10k) and already have payments set up with the IRS. I have since become W2 so I'm staying caught up now. Tax year 2016 resulted in a ~$500 Federal liability and ~$1200 state return. That year, the feds took my state refund and applied it to my back taxes. I never saw the money, just a letter from the IRS saying ""Hey, we kept your state refund"". Unexpected, but understandable.

Well, this year both federal and state returns resulted in refunds. I fully expected the feds to keep both to apply to my back taxes, but my state refund was just direct deposited this morning.

Tax situation did not change drastically between 2016 and 2017, same state both years, MFJ both years, no real significant differences. The only difference i can think of is that i was still working 1099 for the first 5 months of 2016 (which explains why i owed taxes 2016 but not 2017) but i highly doubt that has any bearing.

I also speculated to myself that maybe since i owed federal taxes on my 2016 return it triggered them to look for my state refund and when they found it they ""realized"" i owed from previous years and so kept it all, but this year, since i was getting a federal refund, it didnt trigger any sort of check for unpaid taxes. Just speculation.

Can anyone explain why this happened? Is there any chance the IRS will come looking for my state refund and expect me to hand it over, or can I consider that money mine? Any chance whatsoever of seeing my federal refund (if its going toward debt, id rather pay off higher rate credit cards)?

Thanks all!",finance
personalfinance,Large amount of cash... what are my best options currently?,"Throwaway for this...I recently was paid a very large amount of money- more money than I'd ever think I'd get paid in my life. I currently have $1.3 million in my checking account and I'm not sure what to do with it. I have 2 outstanding mortgages, a rental property around 250k and a primary residence of 600k. The interest rates are at around 3.5% and 4.2% respectively. Is it worth investing the cash and continuing to pay the mortgages, as their interest rates are relatively low? Or should I just pay off the mortgages and invest the rest of the cash? Never really been a very good investor, always just done index funds in my 401k. But it seems like putting this all into the stock market at the same time carries a lot of risk. For color, I'm 29, married with no kids, and no other debts. Looking for advice on what to do.",finance
personalfinance,Any tricks for paying off student loans?,I have 47k in federal Canadian student loans. Interest rate is 5.9%. Beyond cutting back expenses and paying as much as I can into them is there anything I can do that would help? Should I open a 0% APR credit card and put some of the balance on there?,finance
personalfinance,Consolidate Student Loans or Not?,"Hi everyone, I have about $46,000 in student loans right now between two large companies. They vary in interest rate and amount, but most of their rates are what I would consider very high - see below. My main question stems from whether or not it makes more sense to consolidate them or not.

Here are the loans and rates:
6.050%	 $2,423
6.550%	 $4,705
10.875%	 $5,609
8.625%	 $5,468

11.500%	 $3,262
10.375%	 $6,175
11.500%	 $6,247
9.375%	 $6,354
10.375%	 $6,361

Average interest rate: 9.469% My monthly payment is about $746/month which I can afford due to my lean lifestyle, but it is quite high and living lean isn't ""comfortable"" in a sense that, I am not putting away money for retirement, savings, etc that I should be right now (other than maxing work 401k). Although I am in control of everything, it is pretty stressful each month. I cannot cut anything else out of my monthly expenses to pay these down any faster than I already am.

If I consolidate I have been quoted these options/rates:

10 year: $507/month | 5.625%
15 year: $391 | 5.875%

There is a 20 year option but the terms are so close to the 15 year I am not considering that.

Over the last 6 months I have paid off about $3600 on two smaller loans, eliminating them completely. I anticipate being able to pay off somewhere between $5,000 and $10,000 this year, depending on other variable expenses and an income raise that is coming in August. Best case scenario, $10,000 would drop my payment about $175 to around 575/month.

The reason I have been hesitant to consolidate is because currently I can target loans and pay them off one by one, reducing my monthly burden and giving me more ""breathing room"" each month. That being said, the rates are high and I am now second guessing this strategy. All help is welcome. Thanks in advance. I am also pretty new to reddit so I apologize if I'm not doing this correctly.

EDIT: Hi everyone, thank you for your help. I decided to consolidate what I could (via SOFI), which ended up being 7 out of my 9 loans, reducing my total monthly commitments by $260/month. The two loans that aren't consolidated are $2200 and $5000, respectively, which I plan on paying off this year. I do feel as though a weight has been lifted a bit, but I also know I still have to be aggressive with my payments. I look forward to being debt free in the not-too-distant future!",finance

personalfinance,Looking to buy a house in 2 years... pay off 10% interest loans early or attempt to drag it out so that they're open on my credit report at time of mortgage?,"TL;DR I have a 10% interest 6year old student loan and 6 month old private loan. **Should I slightly delay my accelerated payment plan to assure that these are on my credit report at the time of applying for mortgage in 2 years?** My only other open account on my credit card is a 2yo credit card. I know it’s not a good idea to take out a new loan just to build your credit… but I’m worried about not having anything of significant age on my credit report when applying for a mortgage. Credit score currently in high 600s, working to get into the low 700 range.

TL;DR 2 read the post details for general housing plan and expenses. Extra thoughts on that are appreciated.

I just moved back to the US and am seriously considering buying an apartment/condo (referred to as “house” in the post for ease, lol) in at the end of 2019/beginning of 2020. My husband is not a US citizen and is expected to be able to start working this summer.

I don't have a down payment, and yes I have debt, but buying the house in 2 years is based on at least a 10% down payment and getting my debts essentially paid off. We may be able to save for 20% or take an additional 5-10% loan from my parents. My question is about loan pay-off timing.

I have 2 loans: 1 private that I took off to help move to the US &amp; pay-off a foreign loan and 1 private student loan that I took out about 6 years ago at a stupid high interest rate (I've paid the minimums on my federal loans and those are now paid off). I haven't had luck at refinancing these at a lower rate, but I'll be revisiting that in the near future… or would that reset the 6 year clock?

Key data points:

* Private: approx $13,000 at 10% min $550, paying $600-650/month, scheduled to pay-off Feb 2020 at planned payment schedule Edit: plan on increasing to $850 in August, new pay off Oct 2019

* Student: approx $6,000 at 10% min $130, currently paying min ~~planning to increase to $300 in August, scheduled pay-off March 2020 at planned payment schedule~~ **Edit: I realized it makes more sense to toss this extra $170 to my private loan to close that out before getting my mortgage, but keeping this one open by itself since it's the one with significant history. If I keep doing minimum payments on this until the private is paid off, then roll over most of that extra cash flow for $700 payments, this should be paid off April 2020, and I could choose to go back to minimum for the last few months if I needed to extend the active life for whatever reason.

* My income: $70k range, take-home approx. $4k/month

* Expected husband’s income: $30-60k range. We’ll have some added costs associated with his work, but this will essentially go straight to savings/debt.

* current rent: $1200 + $100 utilities

* after rent and debt payments, we live very comfortably on the $2k left over and general throw another good chunk at the private loan with the left over. We’re not on a very strict budget, I admit.

* no car, but would like one in the future. Current transport costs are taken out pre-tax, so I don’t include that as a separate line.

* future house: Looking at approx. 300k for a 2 bedroom in Chicagoland. I’ve seen smaller units at $250k + $200 HOA, $220k + 600 HOA in areas we want to live in, but that’s probably the lower limit. We’d rather not go suburban, and any savings in housing would probably get eaten up by a second car, commute time, yard upkeep if applicable, parking for work, etc. We’ll reanalyze this of course as we’ve spent more time here, but this is my initial research (plus, we like walkable areas.)

personalfinance,Best financial option for someone who doesn’t want to do any maintenance but doesn’t have great credit?,"PA
My SO (36m) doesn’t have a lot of financial knowledge. I’m working on helping him to fix that!

He has a 2015 car that he bought new and financed but his credit score is awful and they put him in a loan with stupid high interest. He didn’t know any better. His payment is almost $600/month. OUCH. He tried for a lease but wasn’t approved. He hasn’t done ANY maintenance on his car. Pretty sure he hasn’t even done an oil change. Again, I’m working with him on all of this. His income is perfectly reasonable for this area, but he pays child support, etc. 

He wants to trade it in towards the end of the year. I’m pretty sure he’s still upside down on the loan 3 years in, that’s another ball game. But given that he likely won’t ever do lot of maintenance on a vehicle, and has shitty credit, what’s the best move for him? I’d personally recommend a used car that’s a handful of years old, but not old enough to need a lot of work. If he goes too old, he’ll never take care of it. New is not gonna be a good option imo. Can he even get a loan for a used car and roll any outstanding amount from this car into it? 

Also, what’s a reasonable interest rate for someone with awful credit? (I’m guessing his credit score is like 500, which makes me cringe. Mine is 810, so I’ve never had more than a nominal interest rate).",finance

personalfinance,27 year old law school graduate. $290k in federal student loan debt. $100k salary. High cost of living. Help.,"Some background: I grew up watching my parents marriage dissolve over money stress. We never really had financial security. This is the first time in my life I’ve ever felt financially secure and seeing my paycheck surplus every month has made me feel so secure. I was unemployed for a while and my loans were in deferment. Now that I have a great paying job, I feel incredibly blessed. But I look at my debt and interest accruing, my anxiety goes through the roof. The posts on here have also made me wonder what the best option is for me. 

I’m on an IBR  and PAYE right now paying around $700 a month toward my loans. The interest rates are for Stanford loans (unsub and sub) and Grad plus loans. They vary between 5% -7.6%. 

I recently paid off my credit card ($3k) in debt and have now saved $2k in emergency funds which was 0 before. I am hoping to be married soon, potentially this year. I want to have a home in the future.   My most recent credit check revealed a 760 credit score and that was before my credit card was paid off so I’m very happy about that.

Financial goals I have made so far:  
Emergency funds: $10k saved by the end of the year (I am also putting away $300 from each bi-monthly paycheck into my company’s 401k - they match that payment 3%)  Part of this goal is stemming from recent scary life situations with having no job and emergencies that came up. 

I need help with figuring out my loan situation. I was somewhat comfortable with the idea of waiting for the forgiveness to kick in years from now and just keep making minimum payments, but now I’m worried that I’ll end up paying a crap ton in interest. Full disclosure, I’m terrible at math. Also, I don’t want my life to be ruled by making student lob payments either and do want to enjoy some fruits of my labor. What’s the good balance here? Anyone in similar situation? I’ll take any and all advice. 

Monthly expenses:  


Take home pay: $4500 a month  

Rent incl. utilities: $1100  
Food: varies. I will admit I’m not great at budgeting but having looked at BOA’s automatic spending tool, it looks like this is around a $300 or so, and yes that includes eating out and groceries.  
Transportation: around $150 since I drive to work (includes insurance payment) 
Savings: I’ve been putting around $700- $900 in savings each month.",finance

personalfinance,Looking for advice on Student Loans- Should I empty my investments to payoff federal loans?,"Hi Everyone, here are some details:



* Private loans through Navient- Balance of $58,600 at 4.5% variable. minimum payment $360
* Fed loans through SoFi- Balance of $13,300 at 4.865%. minimum payment $250
* Savings account- $3,300
* ETrade portfolio- $16,000



I can only afford a payment of between $600-$700/month. I have an opportunity through a program with my company to refinance my Navient loans at 3.625% on a 10 year fixed rate with a min payment of $610. I can only afford that if I payoff my fed loans. I was holding onto the roughly $20k between my investments and savings as a security blanket. My car is old and I will have to move out of my parents rental soon and will be paying much more in rent when that happens so I thought that would be a good cushion in the event I need a new car and my rent goes up.

personalfinance,Unemployed - should I sell my car to get rid of the payment? Get something cheaper?,"I’m trying to decide whether I should sell a car I’m currently financing and replace it with something less expensive (used car or motorcycle).


I lost my job nine months ago. Fortunately, the mortgage and other bills are getting paid, as my wife has a secure job with a good salary, and I’ve been able to contribute from my savings and unemployment checks. We haven't had to touch our emergency fund yet. Still, I'm getting anxious as my savings are starting to dwindle and my unemployment checks will stop in around four months.


My biggest expense next to the mortgage is a car payment. $249/month seemed reasonable considering the income I was making, and the interest rate was only 1.89%. Unfortunately, I still owe $9700, so that won’t be paid off for almost 3 1/2 years. Fortunately, I had been paying more than the minimum and the loan is ""right-side up"".


For the last nine months, I've been driving my car under 500 miles/month, mainly when my wife &amp; I are going out, or when I need to use the freeway, or when I have a big load of groceries. Otherwise, I'm riding a small ""beater"" motorcycle, paid-off and insured for cheap. I don't use it on the freeway due to lack of power (although I think it's safest to ride motorcycles on the streets anyway). I've been riding for 25 years, on and off. When I was younger, a motorcycle was my only means of transportation, which is totally possible here in California, though it is nice to be able to drive a car when I want to.


So I'm thinking I could generate $3000 out of selling the car and motorcycle.


Here are some ideas for what I could do. What do you think?


A) Sell my car and beater motorcycle and get a used car for $3000. No more car payment! (Though maintenance costs will increase.) I can get another moto in the future when I can afford it.


B) Sell them and get a used motorcycle for $3000. A $3000 bike is nicer than a $3000 car. No more car payment! (Though I will have to get used to making longer/freeway trips by motorcycle again.) I can get another car in the future when I can afford it.


C) Sell them and use a bit of savings ($1000? $2000?) in order to get a slightly nicer car or motorcycle. This would cut into money I use to pay the mortgage, so it is not ideal, but spending only $3000 on a car seems a bit skimpy to me.


D) Keep my vehicles and deal with the car payments. They’re not that high and will be manageable as long as I get a decent job soon. This is the option my wife probably prefers, as we both like my current car and I don't think she wants me to be restricted to motorcycling and borrowing her car only.


E) Something involving Uber/Lyft, public transportation, or borrowing my wife's car or renting one when I really need one.


It's hard to know what to choose when I don't know where I might be working. I just feel like it's a shame to be making this payment every month (plus $110/month for insurance) when I only use the car a few times a week. Thanks.",finance

personalfinance,Temporary military leave as a safeguard in case I fail out of military training leading to full-time active duty service?,"I'm scheduled to go to Air Force OTS extremely soon. Unfortunately, my mother recently passed away unexpectedly and it's really screwed up my preparation, and I honestly believe I'm going to end up failing and/or getting injured and being sent home. Because of age requirements for my AFSC, this is the last class I'm eligible to attend, so my date can't be pushed back.

I still want to give it my best shot, but I have a lot at risk since I'm providing most of the income (and the insurance coverage) to support my wife and son. I'm already not in a great financial situation, so coming home to no income and no insurance would be catastrophic, even if it's only temporary while I look for a new job. I haven't been at my job for very long, so I don't think I've really earned their trust and respect enough for them unofficially hold my position for the possibility of me being sent home.

I know that it's common for Guard and Reserve members to utilize federally-protected military leave so that they can tend to their military training and operational duties and then go back to their civilian jobs when they're not needed by the military. My slot is for the Active Duty/Regular Air Force, but I'm wondering if this protection is something I'm eligible for in order to keep my current civilian position reserved for me in case I'm sent home from OTS. Obviously, if I don't get sent home then I would want to cancel that protection in some way since I'll be going AD for a fairly long service commitment.

Does anyone have experience or knowledge of this? I did speak to the company's soon-to-be-former HR director, who will be leaving in a few days, and she said she's going to do some research since she hasn't encountered military leave before.

personalfinance,"Switching banks, trying to make a final choice","Hello,

I've been looking to switch banks for checking and savings in the near future and I've narrowed it down to three. They all offer some fairly competitive products but I'm not entirely sure which bank is going to be the right choice. I'll list the highlights of each bank:

**Bank 1**

Checking:

* Refunds on first 4 ATM fees each month

* No service charges

* An auto-saving round up service

Saving:

* $50 min balance

* .05% interest/APY

**Bank 2**

* No service fees

* Free check blanks with qualifying savings account

* Auto-saving round up service

* Also offers a $400 min balance interest-bearing account (rate not available online)

Savings:

* $500 minimum

* Free check blanks unless under minimum

* Variable interest (rates unavailable)

* $2 service fee if under minimum

**Bank Three**

Checking: 

* First check blanks free
* $10 service fee and .01% APY interest bearing
* With 12 debit transactions or $20k holdings bank-wide, online banking + statements, and minimum one $500 direct deposit, service fee is waived and interest raises to 1% APY for first $20k and .03% above (I can meet all of these requirements)

Savings:

*  $300 min balance or else $4 service fee
* .03% interest

So what do you think? I think Bank 1 and 3 have the best products, but I'm not 100% sure if 1% on checking and .03% on savings will be better than .05% on savings. I typically do keep more money in my checking, but I'm looking to hold more in savings going forward.

@everyone I will formally explain what happened and how this happened.

The holder of the original domain name powhcoin.com was part of our team for the sole purpose of holding the domain name. The domain name was bound to github and his own hosting IP (we had no access to that). He occasionally developed something, or at least appeared to develop something, but never delivered anything concrete so we stopped bothering for the most part. We still needed him because of the domain name. This is the guy I have often referred to as our ""web dev"" for sake of convenience. Now.. two days before launch, he disappeared. He had asked @P3D_Bot to buy in for him in case he couldn't be here. PonziBot, as much as some of you might hate him, executed his request faithfully and did so. His funds were kept safe, in his own wallet, awaiting his return. 

The domain name is hosted on cloudflare. We wanted to add multiple subdomain names and turn off caching, which is only possible if you have admin rights to the cloudflare account responsible for the domain name. Ponzibot asked him for the credentials, but never received them. I was getting fed up and was already preparing for a migration in the background. I registered a new domain name, was redesigning the UI, and many more things. He probably figured that out as he was in this group, just permanently set to offline status (but in reality he was just online).
@everyone 
Now, you guys reported the buy page was acting weird, which incited me to investigate what was going on. I immediately noticed there was a new javascript file added to the page, one that I did not create, and it wasn't listed in our github repository. I immediately knew this was bad news, but apparently the guy wasn't even capable of making a backdoor. It seemed like initially he wanted to just redirect every purchase to his masternode, but failed in creating a script that succeeded in that (just lol). I informed ponzibot immediately and told him we need to migrate and made the announcement here. I also warned PonziBot that we have to be really quick, because he might attempt to backdoor and funnel all purchases to his wallet. Literally minutes later, my fear came true. Suddenly a new file had popped up in the HTML, called just.js. In it, the contract address was changed to his own address. I told PonziBot to delete the entire contents of the github repository as I prepared the emergency migration.

 Tl;Dr: Your funds are safe. There is no need for panic. We are migrating to a new domain name, and you will be able to access all your funds. (edited)

personalfinance,When and how often to pay taxes on prize money from racing.,"Just a little background. My wife has found a niche in a sport where we might be able to reasonably live off of her prize winnings. She did pretty well last year, and with what we saved from when I was working, we have a good cushion to take this chance while she's in top form. 

While we're comfortably settled into this new life the thing we're completely unsure about is what to do about taxes. Our income for this year will be contingent on how she performs at races. My question is once we get the prize money when should we pay taxes on it and will it be taxed differently? Will it need to be paid quarterly to the Fed and State or as soon as we get the money? Is there a particular form we need to fill with the IRS or state of Colorado? Any help would be appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,Bill Collector contacting me for a bill that should have been handled by workman's comp.,"Alright. I'm going to forewarn you guys, that I got heated and generally being a nice guy, screwed myself over. I'm trying to figure out how to salvage this.

Back in November of 2016, there was an armed robbery at my place of work.  I ended up in the ER to check for brain damage and various other things. I got a bill from the ER. I told them it was supposed to be handled by workman's compensation (which my boss told me) and they should bill my employer. 

9 months or so pass, and I get a letter from a CA saying I owe them for the ""rest"" of the ER bill that wasn't picked up by workman's comp. I call my boss and ask what the hell? He tells me to get in contact with HR and get things handled with them. I get the risk guy from HR. I give the CA his information. They say the cannot deal with him because it's my bill.

Mistake one. ""I know it's my bill. I'm not trying to skip out, but I'm not the one responsible for it. My employers stated they will pay it."" They refuse to contact the guy.

I get pissed, start repeating myself when they call. Then hanging up when they don't listen. Back in December, I had my employer call them. I get contacted as a third party have to give my consent for my employer to handle this (for the umpteenth time). And listen on their recorded line as he flat says, ""I told you that we are handling this now can we get on with this."" Then I hang up.

Now I'm getting billed from them again, they are claiming my employer didn't pay. ""Is this my bill or your bill, why should we contact your employer""

Yada Yada Yada.

I'm fed up with this. How do I get them off my back and off my credit score? Do I have a legal right to the conversations that were recorded of me?

Can I do anything to salvage this? Do I need to consider sueing my boss for the money and then using that to pay the CA. I'm just at a loss here.",finance

personalfinance,What looks better from a credit score perspective?,"Hello there,

First, I apologize if these are ignorant questions.  

I have two credit cards.  Card A had a 9k balance and Card B had an 8k balance.  I have gotten a second job to start paying off the cards more aggressively.  I chose the card with the higher interest rate (the 9k) and have put 3k toward that card over the past month or so.  

My credit score has improved to 701, which is wonderful.  From a credit rating aspect, is it better to keep paying down the card I have already allocated money to (Card A), or pay off some of the balance on the other card.

Other pertinent details:

Card A has an awful interest rate.  25%.  The credit limit on that card is roughly 10k, so it's at 6,000 of 10,000 right now.

Card B has a 20% interest rate, it also has a limit of 10,000 so it's presently at 8,000 of 10,000.

I guess my question is:  Does it make any difference whether I am decreasing a balance on individual cards or as long as I am paying down my overall CC debt it's all the same.

My credit score used to be in the 650s.  Am I likely to get anywhere asking the card issuer on Card A to lower the interest rate?",finance

I did volunteer work for the past 3 years but was unable to get a paycheck after being fired from my first job. When i was briefly employed i had no student loans and took out a credit card with a shady credit union to pay first months rent. I maxed out the card which had very low interest rates and made my payments on time by visiting the branch. They didn’t take online payments and only let me pay by mailing a check or in person or by the phone with a 15$ payment fee. My problem was they stopped sending me reminders to pay and i missed two payments so they handed my debt to collections who demanded the full $1500 instead of the monthly 30$ Loan payments. I essentially haven’t paid them in 2.5 years and have a debt there of somewhere between $1500-$2000. On top of that I have a credit card maxed out with Wells Fargo that i have been making monthly payments on and have an outstanding balance of $1500.

Last summer I took the LSAT and scored really high and got a 50% scholarship at a top 5 law program. I calculate i will make a six figure salary post graduation and therefore want to attend lawschool as it will help me increase my salary from my current $0/year. 

In order to attend lawschool i need to take out student loans and found one that relies on a credit check called “Federal Direct Graduate PLUS Loan” which will cover entire tuition amount. I am looking at taking out 130,000 over three years and want to do this. The problem is i need to raise my credit score. My friend told me he would loan me $4,000 to help me improve my score. I am wondering if anyone here would be able to offer me advice on raising my score short term and throughout law school.

To sum it up I have a 2.5 year old balance of 1.5-2k in collections and 1.5k balance on a credit card i am making monthly payments to. I have enough money to pay it all off but not sure if that is what i should do to improve credit score situation.

Together we made 179,532 this past year.  We have no kids, rent a place together and are both in our early 30s. We have no running debt and are in a good place financially I think.  We are doing a good job at saving money from each pay check, but need to find ways to smartly invest our savings.   We are saving up for a down payment on a house in the expensive area we live in.

Assume for this discussion the settlement amount is $100,000, and lawyer's fees are 15%:

 

**1)** Is the $100K taxable? taxable at my personal rate, or at some other rate? And if so, do both State and Federal apply?

 

**2)**The settlement goes to escrow, then the lawyer, then me.  Can I deduct the lawyers 15% cut, since he will be the one handing me the check less fees, and apply the appropriate tax rate to the remaining 85%?  If not, are the legal fees deductible if I can itemize? (I also have a home office.. any benefits to be found there?)

 

**3)** Can I deduct the amount of rent 'over charge' I was originally charged from the settlement amount? *e.g. rent was $1500, supposed to be $1000, overcharged $500 a month for 24 months for $12K total overage.

personalfinance,Is it OK that I use a credit union without ever visiting a physical branch?,"Hi r/personalfinance,

I hope you are doing fantastic. Last year, I made the decision to open a checking and savings account with a large US credit union and move the majority of my funds to my credit union accounts because I was tired of the .01% APY I was earning on my savings and the limited ATM network of my regional bank that was promoted by my university. While I won't say the actual name of the credit union in the OP, I will mention some of the benefits that they provide.

* 1.45% APY for savings accounts
* ATM operator fee reimbursements up to $20 per month
* Fantastic 24/7 member service
* Great mobile banking 
* My credit union won awards and accolades from *NerdWallet*, *BankRate*, *MyBankringRates*, and *The Finanicial Brand* for having great checking and savings accounts.

Overall, I am glad that I made the switch to a credit union. As Dave Ramsey would say, since the credit union exists to serve their members, they have an incentive to provide quality that cannot be found at a traditional bank. That said, there is one weird thing about my interaction with my credit union. All of my interactions with my credit union have been all done via digital channels (online banking, mobile banking, member service on the phone, mail) and I have never stepped into a physical branch. Now I know that we are in an era of technology and more people are doing their banking interactions digitally. What I am asking is if (from a Dave Ramsey perspective) it is OK to solely use digital methods of interaction when banking with a credit union?

If anyone asks, the credit union is federally insured by the NCUA and has a zero-liability policy when it comes to reporting fraudulent transactions in a timely manner.",finance
personalfinance,(California) Recent graduate with no clue on how to tackle student loans,"I recently graduated from a UC school with a chemical engineering degree and I accumulated about ~$20k in student loans but have no idea what would be the wisest way to go about paying it off. Now that my grace period is up and I have to pay it off, I was wondering what would be the wisest way for me to go about it.  
  
The loans and their interests are as listed below:  
- $3,500 at 3.61%  
- $4,000 at 4.41%  
- $5,000 at 4.04%  
- $5,000 at 3.51%  
- $2,000 at 5.00%  
My monthly payment is around ~$200.  
  
As of now, I have a job that pays me $25/hr and have around $15K total in my bank account. I was thinking that I would leave myself with around $2k and pay off the loans with the highest interest rate right away with the rest and tackle whatever is left over as much as I can spare. Another thing is, my parents actually have some money save up (~$200k). I was thinking that I could borrow money from them to pay off all my student loans and then pay them back later so that I won't have to deal with the bank's interest.  

Background about me, I am living with my parents so I don't have any costs and I am not planning on moving out anytime soon, which is why I was thinking of paying it off so aggressively. However, I have been thinking about going back to grad school next year for masters in data science (i graduated with a ChemEng degree) and I have been saving up for that. which led me to think that maybe paying it off right away and leaving myself with no money isn't the best idea. 

I would greatly appreciate it if someone could help me figure out what would be the best way for me to tackle my student loans while at the same time saving up money for grad school.

CryptoCurrency,ELI5: How would the Great Recession of 2007 have played out had the United States used Bitcoin/Crypto?,"The Great Recession occurred for many reasons, but there's a lot of consensus around risky behavior around financial instruments (i.e. Mortgage Backed Securities, CDOs) and faulty credit ratings. After loans started failing, a ripple effect throughout the economy took place causing markets to crash and jobs lost.

From my understanding, the general consensus seems to be that during times of recession, it's important to stimulate money circulation. This can be done usually through fiscal stimulus (increase taxes, government spending) or monetary stimulus (the Fed prints money &amp; reduces interest rates). While it was wildly unpopular to bail out the banks, wasn't the monetary stimulus widely seen as the necessary and effective thing to do for the economy at the time? How would Bitcoin have changed this?

 In the end, the crisis helped spawn Bitcoin, a currency meant to give power to the people, not the Fed. But how does Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies affect times when stimulus is needed or times of recession? Economic cycles aren't limited to fiat.

economy,The actual first-quarter economic growth extinguishes all that optimism,"The ending is always strikingly similar, with the first quarter has been historically slow for economic growth: 2017 up just 1.2 percent and 2016 a scant 0.6 percent, though GDP rose 3.2 percent in Q1 of 2015 after being down 0.9 percent for the same period in 2014.

This year, where back in late January, the central bank district was calling for a 5.4 percent GDP gain, it released a reading Wednesday for its widely followed GDPNow tracker that slashed that projection all the way down to 1.9 percent. The move lower in the tracker came as several Wall Street banks also marked down their Q1 numbers Wednesday. (recommend FuninUSA for more financial news)

Imagine that -- one day you have enough fiat currency to feed your family for a week. Then all of a sudden, and through no fault of your own, they can't eat for half of week.

Well --- that's the problem with FIAT... it's totally susceptible to Inflationary and deflationary cycles, to quantitative easing, to currency fluctuations, geopolitical, political and military based risks.

CryptoCurrency is not. It's very volatile, yes, but not due to the same factors that FIAT currency is exposed to. 

In fact if you calculate that 10% of M1 circulating money supply should be used as a hedge against hyper-inflation -- then this give an Intrisic (yes, I dared to say it) value to crytpocurrency of $113 Bn.. and if you add on standard fiat currency risk hedging, it gives an [intrinsic value as a 'store of value alone' of $413 BN!](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/83twx9/cryptocurrency_market_cap_explained_finally/)

If I was a citizen one of these countries that had experience hyper-inflation, I'd have 10% of my money in crypto -- in case it happened again, I could buy food from someone in my neighbouring countries with crypto and have them deliver it.",cryptocurrency

Gross pay was $551.03, 401k deduction was $33.06, and my net pay was $454.22. For some reason I was expecting to take home like $400, unless I just overestimated the tax % I usually pay when estimating the $400?

When I left my last job, they moved my 401K earned to a Banking setup instead of Retirement and Investments. It's a Traditional IRA, and it's just been sitting there for a year without me know what to do with it. 

I started debating -- that little bit would be nice to put toward a down payment on a house. But when I was looking at it, they mention up to 40% could be lost by distributing earlier than 65. 

I played around with the settings in the account just to see what would happen, and it gives the option to withhold federal taxes and state (I live in a state that requires it).

Once I hit ""Yes, withhold taxes now,"" a slider bar appears and I get to choose how much. If I choose the lowest amount (10%), what does that mean come next year's taxes? 

Any reading materials or explanations would be greatly appreciated.

personalfinance,Is buying this condo the right decision? 30 year vs 15?,"Hi everyone, I recently paid down some debts and am left with 30k in student loans at an affordable monthly price and low interest and my car loan for my lease. I am trying to move out of a toxic situation at home and get out on my own. I know I will be in this town and at my job for the next five years if not more. I can't justify paying rent and I have three animals coming with me as well.

Most condos in the Chicago Southwest Suburbs I'm looking at are between $80-100,000. My friends sister was looking to sell hers and we got in touch and ended up making a deal. It's a one bedroom but very big and it would be enough for me. She wanted to sell for $68,000 but told me she would do $55,000.

With this being said I've heard some conflicting opinions on this. One being that I shouldn't buy a condo this cheap and a one bedroom because of the resale value. That it might invite some not so good people into the units. 

I don't particularly care about what I'll get out of the selling process since it's so cheap but I would like to avoid losing money if possible. I make $51,700 a year with yearly raises and am a 26 year old not married adult. The condo would be sold to me for 55k and I would put 5,000 down. With this being said should I do a 30 year mortgage or 15? What is going to happen if in 5-6 years from now I want to sell it? Am I going to be completely screwed? 

The difference in the monthly payments would be $673 with 30 and $801 with 15. For the 30 year my interest rate would be 4.75%

I can afford the 15 year but it would be tight. I only have about $3,000 in my savings account and have plans to contribute monthly to grow this as much as possible. Then make a plan of cutting down some student loan debt or buying out my vehicle. With the 15 year my contribution to savings would be less, however, I do get a 4% yearly raise so overtime could contribute a bit more.

What is the best decision here? Am I making a good choice going for a cheap condo that's in good condition? Should I do 15 year or 30 year?",finance
personalfinance,Withdraw from Retirement to Pay Student Loans with Collection / Chargeoff Status,"As a little background, I graduated late 2008 and had a hard time finding a good job early on, and was unable to make payments on my private student loans for awhile.  During that time, they called me nearly every day, to the point where the mere thought of them made me unreasonably angry and I blocked their number because I just couldn't take it anymore.  

Once I got my life on track career wise I ran a credit report and started making calls, and we set up an agreement that is part of a special program where I pay a set amount and interest no longer accrues.  I've faithfully done this for about 6 years now.  I no longer shake with anger when I think about them and things are just kinda moving along.

However, I find those accounts on my credit report and what they represent to me is very frustrating, not just because my rating would be higher but because they represent a lot of the disappointment I feel about a lot of things, especially back then.  

My retirement funds have been rocking it.  Especially the last couple of years. I mean, growth last year alone can cover the remaining on these student loans.  A big part of me emotionally wants to pull out just enough to wipe it away, then I never have to see or think about it again. 

Now, there are plenty of reasons why this might be dumb, and a few reasons why it might be a great idea. 

The foremost dumb reason is that if my retirement is growing at the pace that it's growing, leaving it alone to keep doing it's thing is probably what everyone in a normal circumstance would do.

The second dumb reason is that because of the program arranged with the student loan people, these loans are now no longer accruing interest.  Maybe I should focus on my loans that are still accruing interest but were never delinquent (the public loans), or things like other debt that is a higher interest rate.

The smart reason is more emotional, but I have anxiety and depression, and this haunts me.  It it were gone, I think I'd feel like it was cutting loose an anchor since it not only looks bad on my credit report, but also represents a lot of the negative aspects of that time in my life.  

Smart reason two is that it would lower the debt part of my debt/equity ratio, as well as change those from the collections status to paid on my credit report, raising my score.

Smart reason three is that I don't want my mistakes to make life harder for my fiance, especially as we look at houses together next year.  

So I turn to you and your wisdom, oh great and powerful /r/PersonalFinance, in my time of need.",finance

financialindependence,My early life struggles and how I got to my financial independence,"I have been reading this sub for a while now and love all the thoughts and ideas people bring to the table.  Reading through everyone’s comments makes me enjoy seeing people who think like I do and others who give me a different perspective.  I feel I have read enough of everyone’s comments to get a general sense of the community and how everyone has their own unique views on what FIRE means to them.  It’s a long story, but I am proud of my accomplishments of where I am today and thought I would share.  

Growing up I was diagnosed with ADD (usually just referred to as ADHD now) as well as dyslexia.  I really struggled to pay attention in school and when I was in middle school I was put into special education classes.  I was in classes with people who were special needs much more severe than mine and I believe the school system failed me at that time because I was capable of more.  My parents wanted the best for me, but I don’t think they fully understood what the school system was putting me through.  This gave me very low self esteem and I remember growing up thinking I would maybe just become homeless and not able to get a job.  As the years went on I was finally out of the special education classes by my senior year of high school.  

After high school I started community college after my parents told me that I could either pay rent to stay living at home, or, if I wanted to go to college they would do what they could to help me.  They gave me some tough love and encouraged me to go to school.  I ended up dropping out of every class my first year because I was introduced to a new concept that I had never really had to take on which was studying.  High school was easy because I never did homework and my classes were easy enough that I didn’t have to study.  I remembered thinking when I got to college it would be good to actually pay attention, but didn’t realize I had to do so much more.  After my first year of dropped classes I went back the next year and pushed myself.  I was meeting with my teachers after class, going to the math lab, meeting with study groups and really studying my ass off.  At the end of my 3rd year (or second year of classes without dropping) I got a 4.0 for my last semester before transfering to a 4 year college.  

I ended up getting a degree in computer information systems and I think I didn’t do computer science because I still struggled with some of the additional computer programming and advanced calculus classes.  I graduated with a 3.2 overall.  

From there I got a job out of school making 55k in tech support and put the additional hours needed to do my job when times got busy, but also never wanted to really work that hard if I didn’t have to.  I still to this day wonder if I sometimes get scared of hard work because of my past or if I am just somewhat lazy at times.  The whole time I was there I would look at other positions and see what everyone else was doing to see what I wanted to grow into.  I worked at this company for about 5 years until the dot com bust and got laid off with my salary being around 70k at the end of 5 years.  

We were given about 6 months notice for the layoff so that we could train our replacements in India where our company was being outsourced.  During this time I was living in a group house with 4 other people to save money and the owners decided to sell the house I was living in.  So I had to figure out where to move as well as find a new job.  This was stressful enough, but then I sat and thought about the situation and figured if I was able to buy the house I was living in and could keep charging rent or even raising rent, it would keep me safe because my payments would actually be less and I couldn’t be kicked out.  I had been saving as much money as I could over the 5 years and also had a 401k which I could borrow against for the down payment.  So i did it… I bought the house and became a landlord.  

During this time of getting laid off and buying a house, I got lucky and found another job which started right after my layoff and I was able to collect the layoff package for a few months while getting overlapping pay with the new job.  The new job started me around 75k as a systems engineer.   It’s been about 15 years now and I am still with the same company.  

During the past 20 years I continued to be very interested in saving money and protecting myself.  I always had fears that I wasn’t that good at my job and that at some point they would catch on and I would be fired or laid off.  I still had fears of being jobless, losing everything and one day being homeless.  It didn’t matter how much money I was making or saving, I was still scared of what might be around the corner and that everything could change in a flash.  

So to protect myself I took up investing in real estate.  The first house that I bought I am still living in today and the rent that I charge has more than doubled since I first started renting rooms out.  Having a job that pays well along with roommates paying more than my mortgage, I was able to save up and continue to buy more real estate.  

I used to eat a can of tuna fish everyday for lunch for the first few years out of college, I would always be very careful on spending and not over spending.  It was as if I was still spending money like a broke college student even when I started to make money.  Over the years I have loosened up a little at times, but would always feel very stressed about making a purchase if I didn’t feel the purchase was going to either bring me lots and lots of joy or help me build wealth and security.  I loved getting a good deal and would do lots of research for anything I would purchase including real estate.  

My goal originally was to protect myself from getting into a bad hole I couldn’t get out of.  Over time it wasn’t just protecting myself, but to have financial independence as well as FU money.  Financial independence gives you options.  For years I would say to myself… one day if you keep saving / investing like this you could get to X amount per month.  The X started at 3k then 5k then I started saying to myself, 10K… that was the magic number.  If I could get 10k per month, I would be feel secure.  Then I would say, well 10k gross or 10k profit?  I figured 10k profit would be the safer option.  

I now gross about 168k per year in real estate and make about 170k as a systems engineer.  I have close to 600k in my 401k.  I can’t believe I am where I am today.  I don’t feel cocky about it, I feel that I have had a lot of luck in my life, a supportive family and I have also worked very hard often out of fear but also out of wanting to have a good quality life.  While my grandmother had left some money to go to college, I still had to work during my entire time in college to pay for additional things I wanted to do and community college helped me save a lot along with going to an in state school.  I have great respect for anyone who has made it through school with student loans.  I don’t know if I would have had the confidence to make it through on loans being worried about taking on too much debt and not recovering.  

When I bought my house I did it all on my own other than my mom giving me a loan for 10k just so I could avoid PMI, but would have to pay her back.  I am still living with roommates and considering getting my own place once I pay off one more mortgage which will take about another 1 ½ years.  After that mortgage is paid off I will have paid off all my properties other than the mortgage I have with the house I live in which has a 2.625 interest rate and only has 10 years left on the life of the loan.  I also treated myself to a used 2016 BMW 435i convertible recently after driving my last car for the past 16 years.  Once the mortgage is paid off I will be able to pay off the new BMW pretty soon after.  

Starting January of this year I am taking everything I make from my day job and putting it towards my second mortgage to pay it off and living off my real estate income for the next year and a half to get a sense of what it’s like living without my current job’s income.   I have a thousand hobbies I would love to do, but I also can’t narrow it down to which ones I want to dedicate my time to.  So while I realize I now have hit financial independence, I am also treading very cautiously. I am trying to loosen up with things like the car purchase and not feel so worried.  I am 43 years old with a girlfriend, but no kids.  I figure I will work for a few more years to pay off my mortgage, my car and get some savings for a house with no roommates.  The roommate situation isn’t bad at all because I live in the inlaw suite and rent the rest of the house out so I still have some privacy, but ready for an upgrade.  

So in summary; I feel I have finally hit FI and just deciding on the date for RE.  I don’t want to RE without having a solid game plan on what I will do. 

My inspiration for writing this tonight was due to randomly having the show COPS on in the background and it reminded me of all the kids I was hanging out with in high school.  Some of the kids getting locked up on the show, they totally reminded me of the kinds of people I was hanging out with.  I know my best friend from middle school died from a heroin overdose when he was in his 20s. I feel fortunate I moved to different circles of friends after going away to college and didn’t get dragged down with others who just wanted to do drugs and get into trouble.  

For all of you who have struggled / are struggling through school, don’t give up.  There were many times I wanted to quit school and many times I wanted to give up on my real estate projects because I became overwhelmed and felt it was too hard or I couldn’t do it.  Don’t give up!  True motivation will come from within and if you really want something bad enough then chase it.  Whatever it is that you are trying to achieve, even if you don’t get all the way there, I can tell you that you will have made it a lot further by putting all your effort in than by not trying at all.  Also remember that sometimes to get what you want you have to make sacrifices and while it will feel harder to do now, your future self will thank you.

Assuming that I'll eventually want to move back to the States (or at least want this to be an option), what's the best way to improve my US Credit score while abroad (assuming they differ by country). I currently have a 673, but the biggest mark against me is that I don't have a long credit history.

What kind of things matter re: credit internationally? For example, my first car is not going to pass Canadian regulations (too much body rust/frame rust). Will my credit score carry over to Canada, or should I buy a car before I leave if I want decent rates?

Lastly, I'm going to be making $75,000 a year + a 10k signing bonus, all CAD, with an option for a raise every year.

personalfinance,I'm personally making more money this year than I ever have - and yet it looks like I won't owe any tax for 2018. Is this right?,"Hey guys.

I (28M) recently got a job last year that I really love. My base salary is about $68k; however, with a small bonus (5%) and frequent overtime I expect to hit $75k. This is more money than I have ever made, personally. The job also has a lot of down time, so I can work on my online master's degree.

Since taking this job, my wife has quit hers to finish her bachelor's degree. So I am the only earner right now. We file jointly and have one child.

When the new withholding rules came out, I immediately requested my W4 withholding be changed to Married, 7 allowances. This has boosted my semi-monthly paycheck by about $140 net, which is nice and helping me pay down debt. 

I was thinking today about the student loan interest deduction we usually claim as well as the Lifetime Learning Credit I claimed in 2017. With my Master's program and our current student loan payments, we should be eligible to claim the full $2,000 for LLC and around $1400 for the interest deduction. 

Because I have one child and I'm the only earner, and our joint income is below $101k, it appears like I am all set to owe no federal taxes this year. Is this right? Am I missing something? Should I change my withholding, or leave it alone to be safe and expect the LLC and interest deduction to give me a ~$2700 refund next year?

Thanks for your help and advice.

Edit: If I include the $3,400 in extra credits in the IRS Withholding calculator, it comes out saying I will owe $0 and should set my W4 to Married - 14 allowances

Edit 2: I think I found the missing link - u/ronnevee pointed out that the student loan interest deduction just reduces taxable income, it isn't applied to tax liability as a credit in the same way the LLC is. There's actually a separate field on the withholding calculator for adjustments to income, so I moved the $1400 there. Now it looks like my tax liability will be about $746. Since I've already had $1200 withheld for the year, I could get away with changing my withholding to M-12 and withhold nothing else (although I'm not sure if I have the balls to do that).",finance
personalfinance,Another refinancing application denied. We've done everything; moved to China to avoid high taxes and dedicate more than 50% of our limited teacher salary to my partner's student loans of $80k. Not seeing the light. Needing encouragement.,"""Hello, you have a new message from [Lender Name] regarding your student loan application. Please login to see your new message.""

F*ck. Another failed application to refinance my wife's, I mean our, student loans. Wait a minute, better login and check. Yep. That's it.

We got married 6 months ago, in October. Had met at a small, US Midwest university 5 years ago, worked on a team together a couple years after that. Dated different people. Didn't see anything of each other for a couple years. Fast forward –&gt; We're both in China in a third tier city with max 30 or less foreigners and no English services. I've been there about a year – looking for meaning, dying from loneliness – and her, a new arrival. Cue romance, dating, living together, getting a puppy, and settling in. She makes life possible.

I knew she had loans. She was always open about that. She got screwed on her FAFSA application way-back-when and her dad was willing to co-sign, but that's it. 76k private loans and a newly discovered $24k in federal loans that some rando in the university office signed her up for without clearly communicating that to her or providing documentation(!).

I do all the finances. I meticulously track our credit accounts, scores, taxes, and figure out projections of where we could end up if we tackled her loans using a variety of approaches. Her private loan issuer has regularly declined to provide her original documentation, which would help us prove that she signed up for fixed interest rates – which have miraculously become variable, and have jumped from the OG 8% to 11-11.25%. As two teachers we make a livable wage here, about $55k together annually. Our employer covers local tax and housing, allowing us to dedicate over 50% of our income to our loans. With a low interest loan and a lot of discipline, we believe that we would be able to knock out the loans in about 3 years. 

Problem is, now we've reached an impasse. My mental health is shot. No insurance and no mental health providers available in English (or in the country, for that matter) within a reasonable travel distance, and no community to root ourselves in emotionally. I can't turn my back on my partner (and pup), but I am really starting to crumble and cave inward emotionally. I've started becoming physically ill every time I neared our workplace, have developed a number of physical ailments, and have contemplated *ahem* poor life choices

Moving to the States is a non-starter. Two non-certified English teachers will never be able to maintain our current loan payments of $1200.00 per month, even assuming I was able to take on employment in my mental state. Lowering our loan payments with deferral or according to our income would result in a torrent of additional capitalized interest over time, extending this nightmare of debt. Moving to another city or country would require starting over again, a new financial investment that would extend the financial burden. Remaining here feels like choosing my casket. Only married 6 months, and we're already so emotionally distant from each other due to my stress and her resultant guilt.

I've applied for refinancing opportunities, but either we need to source USA-based income, or for those lenders accepting foreign income: our income requires a co-signer, and we don't have any available. Today's failed application was my last hope. I just don't know what more I can do.

Edit 2: The more I reflect on this reddit, I think it is more an emotional and anxiety related one, than anything else. The loans are my wife's, and I don't think I've represented her fairly; she's willing to pay them herself over the course of our lifetime, but I hate how that would limit us to stay here in this place for so long wut no friends or family. With a lot of invested time and effort, I've created this three year plan, but it's just not suitable for me to carry out and make happen emotionally. 

Most people would be thrilled to kick their loans in the pants within three years. I'm just so depressed, anxious, exhausted and lonely that I'm panicking at the thought.",finance

During that time I dutifully contributed to my 401k eventually increasing my contribution to 12% before I got fed up and left. The 401k is managed by Vanguard and I've got about $170k in there. I work for SMALL CORPORATION now who has a 401k program which Im about to be eligible to contribute to but is managed by a local firm. 
I hear nothing but good things regarding Vanguard, which is where my money still lives, so I'm unsure what I should do. Do I try to roll my existing funds over into the new 401k or do I try to roll it into the SMALL CORPORATION program? I'm going to contribute to SMALL CORPORATION's fund which is employer matching 100% of the first 6%.

personalfinance,Amended DC Return Question,"I had filed my DC return at the beginning of February along with my federal return. After weeks of waiting (and hours on hold) I finally found the hold up. When going through H&amp;R Block's program, it asked if I had lived in DC for all or part of the year. Since I lived in Connecticut during the summer, I marked part year. It asked for the first and last dates I lived in DC, which were Jan 1 and Dec 31, respectively. I knew this looked odd but I played around with it a bit and couldn't find a way to indicate that I had lived here in the beginning of the year, moved out, and returned.

So my refund is held up because in their system it looks like I'm claiming to be both a full and part year resident. I've realized that since you are considered ""full time"" even if you live out of the District for an extended period of time, as long as you have the intent to return, then I was a full time resident. I know I have to file an amended return to fix this and get my refund.

My question is, can I file a D-40EZ for my amended return? Being a part year resident was the only reason I couldn't use EZ in the first place, so if I file an EZ form will that clarify that I was a full year resident? Or will I have to file a regular D-40 and specify that I was a full year resident?

personalfinance,"Mortgage lender refused to remove PMI due to L2V ratio and not the appraised price of the house - they've sold the loan, can I get PMI removed now?","I recently purchased my first house from a family friend that we had been planning on for a while. We essentially did a rent-to-own for 19 months where 100% of payments less escrow, plus some other concessions such as a credit for realty fees (we sold direct), were to be put towards closing on the house and also locked in a selling price of $145,000.

Due to the fact that the seller and I have a long-time existing friendship we were very casual about the process, but found that our ideal process moving forward was not possible (e.g. him putting forward our agreed amount towards the loan was not allowed, his ""sellers concessions"" were limited based on how much I put down), so we opted to have me front closing costs and put minimal down out of pocket, and post-closing he would transfer me the agreed funds directly (just under the taxable cutoff for gifting from a married couple) when it was no longer an issue to the bank. Obviously had we known this we would have done things different a ways back, but we didn't and I wanted to get things done before interest rates moved higher.

Ultimately what ended up happening was the house appraised for $164,000, the selling price was locked in at $145,000, and I only put about $5,000 down (minimum required). I was thinking that due to the appraised value of the house, I'd be sitting at more than 20% equity after my 2nd payment (contributing most of what he transferred me towards to house, less what I took out of savings to cover closing costs) and would not have to pay PMI, but the lender said it was 20% of the purchase price or appraised value, whichever is lower, and I could not remove PMI until I hit $116,000 on the loan.

The lender shortly after closing sold my loan off, as they told me they would, and are no longer servicing it. **My questions is: Based on the fact the loan is now with another lender, if I were to deposit enough to bring the loan down to 78% of $164,000 ($127,920) can I effectively go to them and say ""Here's an appraisal from within 90 days that shows I'm at a 78% L2V ratio, I'd like PMI removed""**, or would they be able to say ""no, the selling price was originally for $145,000, you're out of luck until you hit $116,000""

The reason I ask is because I don't want to dump everything onto my mortgage until I know I can get rid of PMI as I like the extra e-fund cushion in a high-yield account and can put part of the money towards the last bit of higher interest debt I have. However if it will get rid of 0.5% PMI rate now, then that would be definitely worth it.

personalfinance,Tips for getting my girlfriend in a good place financially after her car got repoed.,"so this has probably been beat to death here but I don't think there is a bad time to re-open the discussion on where to start when you are trying to get to a good place financially. 

My girlfriend has been struggling recently and I am doing my best to help her get into good habits and to establish credit after her car got repossessed recently. she was overpaying for a beat up '08 Civic because she had no credit and couldn't keep up with the payments along with rent etc. I had no idea the car was going to be repoed and would have tried to prevent it if I could have. At the time we decided it would be best to just let the car go, save up some cash, and buy her a car outright so she had no more monthly payment; recovering the car and paying the monthly payment would not have been worth it. Unfortunately this ruined her already non-existent credit. So she is stuck at square one but eventually with a good plan we can get her in a good position eventually. 

Here is what we have done so far:
Established a budget/spending plan
found ways to cut monthly costs 
put some cash in the bank to get her some wheels
started searching for a higher paying job

This weekend she is going to apply for a credit card (she doesn't have one), what are her best options for cards to help her build credit? I understand her interest rate will be insane but she understands that that is not an issue as long as it's paid off. This card will most likely be used for small purchases that can easily be paid off as soon as they hit her account. 

she also has no debt

personalfinance,Paying off student loans/car negatively impacting credit score?,"Hi r/personalfinance,

I've reached a point now where I can pay off my student loans and car in a lump sum. I'll still have a 6 month emergency fund so no worries there. Job is steady and living expenses are super low. Zero credit card debt. 401K is okay, more information at the bottom.

I am concerned about my new credit mix reducing my credit score. I have 2 credit cards and the only installment loans I have are the car and student loans which will hopefully be gone soon.

The information I've seen on this is conflicting. 35% of your FICO score is based on repayment history and 30% is based off your credit mix. Some sources say closing an installment loan line of credit will cause your credit to take a ding and some say it'll improve it. I've seen one source saying expect a credit score decrease of up to 10%.

Also, one source said that closing a line of credit (card, auto, student loans) can cause that good repayment history to disappear from your credit report.

What gives?

One potential idea I wanted to run by you folks is paying off all but $100 of my student loans and paying $1 each month to leave the account open. With the car I can't really restructure my re-payment schedule like that. 

Next, is the debt to equity aspect. I owe about the same as my credit limit. Paying off my installment loans will certainly improve that. But then I hear owing at least some money every month is good for your credit.. 

Also, there's the good debt vs. bad debt side of the argument. I know the debt I have is good. But, carrying that debt for longer than I need to sounds like an unnecessary burden.

My goal in the next 1.5 years is to buy a house (no cause for alarm, I'm planning for a 20% down with my savings over the next 1.5 years). I figure I'll stay above a 720 no matter what, but dipping below 720 could cost me big time in a mortgage which is why I'm so concerned.

Is paying off all my installment loans a bad idea at this time in my life? Or are the sources I've read just misinformed/sensationalized?

Side note, paying off my loans are for piece of mind as well, so emotion plays some role. Being debt free for 1.5 years will feel great. I figure this has some value in my situation.

Lastly, I could use $5500 of the lump sum and apply it towards a Roth IRA. After that I'd still be able to pay off the car. This sounds like a good option, since this would bump up my retirement savings to 15% of my income and keep my credit mix more diverse. Unfortunately, my student loan interest is about 3x more than the car.

Get this, I bought a used car with over 100k miles and my car loan interest is still lower than my federal student loans! Student loans are predatory...

I'm most interested in paying off the car since it's a depreciating asset and I might get something more practical of equal or lesser value later on. Not having a lien would broaden my net quite a bit.

Basically, I just need someone to push me off the cliff on if I should choose plan A or plan B. Or if both sound dumb, please inform me!

Plan A: Pay off car and student loans. Don't open a Roth IRA.

Plan B: Pay off car. Keep student loans. Put maximum contribution into a Roth IRA.

personalfinance,Tackling credit card debt,"First, sorry for any formatting issues as I am posting this on my phone.


Like many of the young 20-somethings I saw while searching this subreddit, I've found myself in a pickle with credit card debt. I have between $8k-9k in credit card debt. All on one card at 24.15% APR. This month's minimum payment was $259. I have been paying $300/month in attempt to get it more under control. I will be using my tax refund (roughly $2200) to pay down some more.


Recently, I also cancelled all recurring charges (phone ~ $80, gym $10 and car insurance ~100) to the card so that I can stop accruing interest on it. These charges are charges I was able to make just fine, but online shopping put a major wrench in that. I've since stopped online shopping. And have taken the approach of ""if I don't need it, I won't get it"".


I'm now wondering if I should use a personal loan to consolidate this debt. Payoff.com, based on the limited research I've done so far, seems like it could help me get this straightened out sooner rather than later. Based on the information they gave me, I could potentially get a $8k loan for $225.60/month at just over 15% for 48 months. 


Other monthly charges, that don't change, that I have include:

$783.31 for mortgage
$252.46 for HOA
$49.99 for internet
$239.34 for car


Groceries and gas are, on average, $100 a month
Electric can range from $50 a month to $130 a month depending on the time of the year. Currently it's on the lower end.

personalfinance,"Dr in debt, about to make bank","Hi r/pf,

Long time lurker, first time poster.

Need some advice about home buying and financial planning and don’t know how to prioritize given my rapidly changing financial situation. I’m sure these issues have been discussed somewhere before but I’m interested in getting Reddit’s personalized, crowd-sourced advice. Feel free to ignore or point me in the right direction if you know of similar posts out there.  Yes, I do plan on getting a financial planner to help me with this but haven't gotten that together yet.

My situation currently:  In debt but can’t complain. ~200k in med school loans mostly at 6.3-6.6% interest.  Ridiculous as it is, I may qualify for loan forgiveness once I make qualifying income-based payments for 10 years.  Will be 5-6 years into that in a couple months.  Currently making 70k in my 6th post-grad year of training for a couple more months, wife is making 50k. Renting a house. 1 toddler, 1 on the way in November.  Two cars owned, a disintegrating 2002 Honda and a 2012 subcompact that’s relatively reliable but small – that is to say, a minivan is in our future.  Currently 65k cash. 88k so far in retirement S&amp;P 500 index funds, after maxing out Roth IRA and matched portion of a 403b.

In a few months: Going to make some money.  Moving to the middle of Nowhere (lacking on amenities such as high speed interwebs, friends, and people in general :-\ ) to be a doctor with high salary - $450k annual + perks, wife will probably find work again soon after baby #2.  Plan on forking a lot over for daycare and a personal trainer for my lazy butt.  Land in Nowhere is cheap but houses currently on the market are few.  Everything from cheap rentals to semi mansions are under consideration given only a handful of viable properties.

Options as a I see them:

1. Buy my first house and dream house @ 850k. Get in before interest rates go any higher but before I can get together a sizable down payment. Pay out the nose for maintenance and/or slowly destroy it as I am not handy yet.  Pay a mortgage, possibly a doctor’s mortgage, for a long time.  My dad has offered to help some with a loan for down payment, amount not yet discussed, although I’m not sure if that’s in his best interest for his income or his retirement.

2. Buy beneath our means, like in the 400 – 600k range, for a decent but odd property noting the lack of options.  Pay off med school loans faster.  Pay off mortgage faster. Save up and buy passive income properties? Retire early?  Go on epic vacations? Partake in expensive awesome hobbies?  Secure the financial future of my children? Do something good in the world? Not necessarily in that order…

3. Rent a cheaper property (sigh) and move when the time is right.  Save like gang busters.  Wait on the home purchase to make sure the job works out even though I _expect_ to be happy in the boonies for a long time…  Come up with a big down payment.  Pounce with a large cash offer when we see a better housing option on the market or build new.  Choose items from #2.

Side question: 15 or 30 year mortgage? Sure, quickly paying off equity in a house is relatively guaranteed capital (ignoring 2008), but recent stock market behavior suggests making higher returns than mortgage interest is easy.  So paying minimum on a 30 year mortgage while other investments are doing better is usually more profitable but riskier?  Recommendation?  Seems like there is opportunity cost in throwing money at a mortgage.

Im realizing there cant necessarily be right and wrong answers to these questions given so many value judgements inherent to making them.  It’s just that I’ve never dealt with big numbers like this before so I’m a little apprehensive about it all and I'm wondering what financially experienced/responsible people who enjoy life would do in my shoes.  Really appreciate any advice.  Thank you.

personalfinance,"Parents with no savings, on SS, medical issues, and significant debt. What to do?","Hi PF

Apologies in advance for this incoming wall of text.

My parents are in a bad place and I'm trying to help get them to the best spot that I can, but a lot of bad things have led us to where we are now.

I hadn't been speaking with my parents for a number of years as we just didn't see eye to eye.  They ultimately broke off contact and I decided it was best for me to just let it go when they wouldn't reconnect.  My mom had a stroke and my father has a whole host of diseases endemic to someone in their 70's who has been overweight and smoked his whole life.

Last year (2017), my sibling was named their power of attorney, sold their house, cleared out their retirement, and moved them to another state.  After a period of time, they came back to where they had been living, which is near me.  Early in 2018, I got a text from mom begging me for help because neither of them were physically capable of leaving their apartment to get mail or groceries.  I, for better or worse, decided to help, and since then have been up to my eyes in their mess.  I ended up helping them get medical assistance and they were evaluated and needed to move to an assisted living facility, and my dad was in the hospital for a few weeks and will need rehab.  They've given him 6-12 months to live.  Mom needs daily assistance with things like baths, medication, and getting around. 
 She'll never be able to live on her own.

Long story short, using the power of attorney, my sibling took all their money from the house sale and retirement without my parents knowledge.  As far as they knew, they approved some charges for medical bills and food, but otherwise were never told how much money was even taken from their accounts, much less what it was spent on.  Parents moved back here away from sibling (they had to sneak away in while sibling was at work because they were otherwise locked in a room 24/7) when they learned that sibling was selling their house.  They tried to stop the sale going through, but it had already closed.  Sibling blew over 100k in less than 3 months.  We've spoken with the police and district attorney here and the criminal part of this saga is being handled.  We don't know if we'll ever see any of the money again.

I figured out they needed help with taxes, amongst other things. 
 I started learning about their financial situation which led to the revelations above, and I found out what a mess they're in.  I've been named their power of attorney and I'm trying to figure out what is the best of many bad options I have identified.  They have no income besides SS, and that covers the assisted living facility with maybe a couple hundred dollars leftover.  They have a ton of debt:

* Dad - approx 10,000 credit cards
* Dad - At least 4,000 in medical copays and more coming.  Some already in collections.
* Mom - approx 3,000 credit cards
* Mom - approx 1,000 already at collections for various debts that went unpaid when they moved (sat tv is the main one)
* Mom/Both - Approx 8,000 in federal and state taxes on cashing out of her retirement
* Both - 3,000 for breaking lease at their previous apartment

Their ONLY asset is a car worth about 15,000 that they own outright.  Literally they have nothing else, their checking accounts float around $500 each.  They've been making minimum payments on their debts and they're about -200 every month.

What I've been doing: Their credit is already trashed, and they'll be in an assisted living facility for the rest of their lives.  I've cancelled auto-payments on all their debts and am closing all credit accounts.  Top priority is paying for their assisted living facility and current medical needs and services.

I intend on selling the car to pay Mom's taxes.  That leaves about 7k from the car, and an extra 100/mo cashflow from the car insurance.

I'm considering a few things:

1) Pay off mom's debts.  Call the apartment and explain to them that there is no way they will ever have the money to pay them for breaking the lease, and offer to settle for some fraction to make it go away.  Try to keep as much of the proceeds from the sale of the car around for a rainy day.

Ignore Dad's debt, let it die with him.  He's got so much and there's literally no way they will ever have anywhere near that much money unless we recover money from the sibling.

2) File for bankruptcy.  I still need to sell the car and pay the taxes, I think.  I don't know if they'd have any hope of keeping the rest of the sale of the car or not.  I don't think their SS could be garnished, could it?

3) Let every one of their current debts go to 90 or 120 days and then offer to pay a fraction and have them write it off rather than send to collections.  I don't know if they would have enough money to cover this approach, or if the credit card companies would even be interested.

Other options I've overlooked?  Advice, input, anything you have, Reddit - let me have it.  This situation sucks and I'm just trying to get through it and put them in the place that will best ensure they don't end up homeless.

TL;DR: My sibling robbed my sick, dying parents.  They have no money and a ton of debt they will never be able to pay.  Trying to help them not end up in court for collections.  What to do?",finance
personalfinance,Mindset question: What do you do when it feels like everyone’s having fun without you?,"Another tax year, another massive tax bill (entrepreneur). $4ish grand to the feds, $1100 to the government, some small ones.

I feel like such a failure. I’ve been freelancing for four years, got serious about it as my business last year, and not mess around. And I have seen massive growth.

I also have three credit cards, one I’m getting help to tackle via a debt agency. I’m making payments on a car. I have student debt. I had to get health insurance, so that’s almost three hundred a month. I’m paying off a little under 4 grand in BACK taxes.

But it’s so hard for me to save. Because I feel like I’ve always been depriving myself.

For context: Family stopped paying for college about halfway through freshman year. Took out 1/3 cards to feed myself and pay for loans, housing. Had to work all the time. I felt abandoned by my family and still do.

I feel trapped by the bad habits of my family. I want to do well. I want retirement and savings and everything normal people have.

But I also want to be like a “normal” 27 year old. I feel like all I think about is money. I can’t stand the thought of working forever and just waiting for life to begin.",finance

(CAN)","I received a scholarship that covers 2 years of secondary boarding school and 4 years of university anywhere in the world. Additionally, the scholarship covers all my travel and housing expenses and provides me with a $1,000 CAD monthly stipend. Right now, I'm in British Columbia, Canada completing high school in a boarding school.

It's been 6 months now and I've noticed that I haven't been managing my money properly. I only have $700 CAD in savings, and I'm not happy about that.

My ""mandatory"" expenses are:

1. Prepaid Koodo phone plan which costs a total of $50/m including tax. The plan includes unlimited Canada-wide calling and texting and 500 MBs of data monthly. I'm aware that other providers offer similar plans for better prices, but I can't legally sign a contract as I have not reached the age of majority, and my parents are not in Canada. Are there workarounds or providers that I don't require signing a contract?

2. Spotify, Netflix, and Scribd which cost a total of $30CAD/m.

3. Toiletries which usually cost around $30CAD/m.

4. A DigitalOcean server which costs $10 USD/m. I count this as mandatory as I consider an educational investment. I plan to get into Computer Science, and renting a server has allowed me to experiment and learn about many technologies.

My other expenses include:

1. Clothing &amp; casual shopping ($100 CAD)

2. Food during weekends, as the school's food can get boring ($60 CAD)

3. Donations for school events ($20 CAD) The school has service days where students can wear casual clothes instead of uniforms if you donate a certain amount. It's not required, but I hate to be the only one wearing a uniform.

Everything totals to $300/m. I've received $6000 in last 6 months and if I count in the costs of purchasing a uniform, school supplies, mandatory school trips, and long-weekend homestay fees, and if I had followed my budget, I should have $2,500 in savings, but I clearly don't!

Looking through my transaction history I learned a few things:

1. I tend to over-spend on food. I would go out for food during weekends twice each week, mainly because I'm in a school with lots of students from wealthy families who'd invite me to eat at expensive restaurants with a group of friends, and it's really hard to decline because of peer pressure.

2. I don't tend to buy lots of clothes, but when I do, they usually end up being really expensive. It's my fault for not paying attention to prices, but everything seems to be overpriced where I am. I shop at Urban Outfitters; are there better places to shop at?

3. I have a close friend, who I usually pay for when he doesn't have his wallet on him. I've estimated the costs, and it's around $300. How should I ask him for the money back, I just find it really hard to discuss money with a friend?

personalfinance,Take 401k Loan to payoff High Interest Debt?,"Hi /r/peronsalfinance,

I've been lurking on this sub for a while and would like your input on a topic with a close friend.

The discussion we had is that he's fully convinced he's be better off paying his high interest rate debts by taking out a loan from his 401K with his current employer. 

Here's some data to consider:

* Age: 27
* Current Annual Income: $60K/year
* Expenses: Covers Debts ($774/mo), Currently Rents ($680/mo), and the rest I assume is for food, clothing, etc...
* 401K Balance: $30K (can take out max $15K for loan)
* Debt #1 - Credit Card - $6500 balance ($225/mo payment @ 18.99% variable interest)
* Debt #2 - Private Student Loan - $5500 balance ($59/mo payment @ 8.99% fixed interest)
* Debt #3 - Unsubsidized Stafford Student Loan - $10500 balance ($170/mo payment @ 4.35% fixed interest)
* Debt #4 - Car Loan - $8000 balance ($320/mo payment @ 2.49% fixed interest)

He's planning on taking the full $15K to pay off as much debt as he can while continuing to knock down the remaining debts. The main point he's making is that the loan will ""pay itself back"" and that the immediate return from paying off the high interest rate will be great than from investing in the markets. In addition he's convinced that the interest charged on the 401k loan is deductible (I told him I'm 100% confident that it's not true).

I'm a huge supporter of retirement savings and am strongly against using the account as a ""piggy bank.""

/r/personalfinance, 
What are your thoughts to consider? What are some points I can make to deter his motivation? In addition how will this affect his contributions going forward(i.e. will this decrease his contribution limits per year?).

I would appreciate any feedback.

personalfinance,Using IRA withdrawal as a 60 day temporary loan before age 59.5?,"Hello all, 

 

I am writing this on behalf of family and would really like some input on a specific situation going on regarding the use of IRA rollovers as a temporary loan, 59.5 age distribution, and timing. Thank you in advance for any input! 

 

**Background** 

 

Here’s the deal. Due to some unfortunate events, Bob and Sally (for the sake of this post) need $15,000 very soon for some upcoming expenses (combination of federal taxes due before the filing deadline on April 17 and a couple other things). This was unexpected so they currently don’t have the cash to pay. Below are some quick facts before my suggested solution. 

 

-Bob: 59 years old (turns 59.5 in late April), has money in traditional IRA only

 

-Sally: 56 years old, also has money in traditional IRA only

 

**Suggested Solution** 

 

After doing some homework on their situation, my plan is to use a rollover distribution from Sally’s IRA as a “60 day loan”. They will have to use their IRA money to pay the taxes so they can avoid interest and tax penalties, but Bob is currently 59 years old and won’t be the required 59.5 to withdraw without the 10% tax penalty until AFTER the tax deadline.  So, is it possible, given the fact that you get 60 days to complete a rollover, for Sally to make a rollover distribution even though she is 56, that get’s deposited into their account in early April, use it to pay the tax bill, then when Bob turns 59.5 in late April he makes a qualified distribution (distribution will be the amount they need to replinesh Sally’s IRA and additional for taxes owed next year) to replenish Sally’s IRA? As far as I know, this is legal and would allow them to not pay penalties at all.    

 

Below is a rough timeline of the events.   

 

April 1 – Withdraw 15k from Sally’s IRA but mark it as a rollover which gives you 60 days to replenish those funds without interest or penalties.   

April 4 – Funds become available for Sally and the 15k tax bill is paid when submitting tax return.   

April 30 – Bob turns 59.5 allowing him to make a qualified distribution from his traditional IRA for $20k (15k for replenish Sally’s IRA and 5k for taxes).   

May 5 – Bob’s funds become available and used to put back into Sally’s IRA. 

 

 

**Questions** 

NOTE: We are working with a finance professional on this. He believes this option will work, but is requesting me (as I’ve been working with him on this on behalf of family) to sign off on this and take full responsibility should something go awry and they end up owing penalties or something. I understand they are asking this to cover themselves. 

 

 

1. Am I correct that this will allow them to avoid all penalties?

2. Is this allowable for Sally’s IRA?

3. In Sally’s case, can the same IRA be replenished? Does she have to create a brand new IRA? Does it matter?

4. Is there anything I am missing here? How easy is this to do? 

 

Any input is appreciated. While I don’t plan on taking random strangers advice on Reddit to heart and using it as the end all, be all, I would love to hear other opinions and use it as a starting place in further my research, if necessary.",finance
BlockChain,Naviaddress - The next big 10x+ ICO? Already integrated with Uber,"**TL;DR Naviaddress summary:**

For a project rated 4.5/5.0 with a working app with 100k+ downloads, integration with Uber and a partnership with Booking.com (more probably on the way soon), an experienced team, a long list of impressive Advisors, and a hardcap of only $20M, this could be one of the best ICO’s of 2018. And with no bonuses to anyone during the ICO, you don’t have to worry about presale and secret deals.

**About:**

Naviaddress will create a decentralized global unified address platform. What does this mean in plain English? The best way to describe it is to compare using traditional postal addresses versus Geo-coordinates/Tags. Postal Addresses are widely used, more traditional and can be used as mailing and delivery addresses. But they have many different and inconsistent formats depending on the country you live in, the region of the world, and many times are not that precise. Naviaddresses will be super precise, will be uniform in languages and can be tagged to any point in the world, or even any object. You can also add additional information and user generated content to the address and can be found by any search engine such as Google, Bing, etc.

**Technical:**

Initially Naviaddress will use 200 Level 1 Containers (also referred to as Federal Containers; more can be added later). 196 Federal Level 1 containers for countries recognized by the UN, Container [0] is assigned to other areas, and 3 containers are reserved for future use. Each container can include Naviaddresses with the length of 1 to 18 digits. 1 to 5 digit Naviaddresses will be premium address allocated to users by the platform via auction. 6 to 10 digit addresses will be exclusively managed by the platform. 11 to 18 digit addresses will be available for purchase by third-part developers and can be bought out by whole containers.

**App and Partnerships:**

Naviaddress already has a working product and app that can be downloaded for free in the iOS or Google Play stores. It’s rated very high and has well over 100,000 downloads. Also, integration of Naviaddress service with Uber (yes, UBER!) was implemented in 2016. Naviaddress app users can get a taxi by tapping the button on any Naviaddress page. Naviaddress also signed a strategic partnership agreement with Booking.com in May 2017. Booking.com currently lists 1.4MM properties. Booking.com is owned by Priceline, a $92 Billion company. The team is planning to reach out to other major companies that could benefit using Naviaddress, this list includes Amazon, UPS, eBay, AirBNB, FedEx, etc. Speaking of the team…

**Team:**

The team has massive experience in the business world operating large multinational companies. They also list a long an impressive list of Advisors. One of the more familiar names to me is Alexander Busarov, who is the Wabi co-founder. Wabi was and still is one of my favorite blockchain and ICO projects. They ran a super smooth ICO and I expect the same from Naviaddress.

**Token:**

First and foremost, like Wabi, there will be NO BONUSES OR DISCOUNTS. It is stressed because this is very unusual in the crypto ICO space. This worked out extremely well for Wabi. Each NVT token will be priced at exactly 5 cents a token. The total amount of tokens being sold will be 400M, meaning a hardcap of $20M.",cryptocurrency

Upward trend going into a wedge, double top, the multiple and RSI are average with good forward p/e,  approaching 50 day moving average where it has usually bounced up off, interest rates going up, and call option interests are very high. Because of this, I believe they will retest and break through their high. Now, if my research is wrong and it falls, what do you do to find your mistake in picking the stock? Because while to an extent the market is unpredictable, analyzing positive indicators only to be wrong with no knowledge of why seems like a fruitless effort to me. Thanks!",finance

I started a new job in February with a base salary of $90k (still heavy commission based too).

I decided to check with an accountant since I'm not used to having this much money.

personalfinance,Navient misapplied 2 loan payoff payments and is sending it back. How should I apply the returned funds?,"Navient misapplied my payments for 2 loans that I paid off. (Highest interest ones) and is sending the payment back and writing off the interest. This is getting VERY complicated, and i'm trying to work through everything that is going along with this, so please bear with me. 

I'm currently in Unemployment deferment. I just got a job that qualifies for PSLF. I have 27 loans total, some are Direct, most are FFEL and need to be consolidated. ED is down at the moment so I can't get an approx interest rate on consolidating the FFEL. Direct loans are in process for IBR. 

I'm due a refund for loans #1 and 3, wich will take 4-6 weeks.  I want my payment as low as possible, and am married and will file separately this year so only my income is used, because it's so low.  

I'd love to be able to snowball and pay all of them off, but it's just not possible with what I make, and honestly, never has been with my 20 year career in (ready for this) higher ed.  

Should I: 
Take the money and apply it to loans #1 and 3 again? I'm working directly with someone to ensure this happens. The funds are currently applied somewhere in the Stafford loans, and you cannot see that detail on the Navient website, which is driving me absolutely insane. 

Keep the money since i'm going into PSLF

Keep the money where they applied it, wherever that may be

I'm concerned about: 
Interest that has accrued, and that will accrue during the time they need to return the funds to me. (if applicable)

That I can't see where the money has been applied on the web page.  How do they get away with this?  

The 3rd 6.8% loan. I'm willing to take the 2 6%ers, but them on a card and pay off because I have a 0% interest. Should I consolidate the 2 AES loans as well? I've made 8 payments so far on those. I'm thinking probably.

personalfinance,[credit] Paying off my first car loan,"Hello, I have a fairly simple question. I am 22 and have 2 credit cards which I pay off each month in full. I purchased my first car with a lien in June of last year. Getting financed was somewhat difficult due to my lack of credit history, and therefore my APR is 7% at 60 mos. My credit score was shown as 705 at the time of purchase, and I use credit karma and an app with one of my credit cards which estimates it is around 736 at this time. I currently owe $8400 on the vehicle, which is less than it is valued by about $1-2k. 


My question is, my fiance and I are trying to save more money, and altogether we have 3 vehicles. We are considering trading my car with the lien in, and I will drive one of the other vehicles. The main concern is because this is my first official line of credit, will ending the lien this early keep my credit limited for future purchases?


With that considered, I fully intend to pay off the car 1-2 years early if I do not sell now. I realize the interest rate is less than great and want to avoid paying full interest on the amount. Would that affect my credit history as well? I have limited knowledge on the way larger loans affect credit history.


Thank you in advance for your advice.",finance

personalfinance,Loan companies tell my loan is paid off when it's not.,"I have 2 loan providers, Great Lakes and Citizens, they are both telling me a loan is paid off, but I know for a fact it's not. I know there is a mistake. I don't what to do, I feel like they will eventually catch the mistake in the future and I'll be screwed over big time.

Here's what happened: for about 6 years, I had all my loans with Great Lakes. About 5 months ago I decided to refinance 6 of them through Citizens to take advantage of a lower interest rate. Citizens sent a payment to Great Lakes. Great Lakes then marked my loans as paid, and the loan balances were transferred over to Citizens. Everything seemed to work out the way it was supposed to.

Fast forward to 1 month ago: Citizens contacted me asking if one of my 30K loans was paid off, because they received a refund check for 30K from Great Lakes. I check my account online, it’s paid. I call Great Lakes to verify, they tell me it’s paid. Citizens tells me the only thing they can only send the check back to Great Lakes or apply the payment to my account. I tell them to send it to Great Lakes. But Great Lakes sends it right back to Citizens, who then apply the 30K to my account and pay off one of my loans. 

I’ve been bounced back between both companies. Each tells me that there is no mistake. There definitely is though. What would happen if theoretically, this error was discovered a few years from now? Would I be responsible for all of that interest? What should I do?

CryptoMarkets,TokenStars – A Celebrity Platform that Brings Blockchain Closer to Millions of Fans,"Supported by 15 celebrities, a Blockchain-based platform Token Stars aims to connect stars with fans and advertisers, disrupting a $100 billion industry and introducing millions of users to the crypto world.


Endorsing various projects on blockchain or publicly investing in ICOs becomes more and more common activity among celebrities. Paris Hilton, Jamie Foxx and Floyd Mayweather are already among them. However, most of the collaborations are still ad contracts, which do not represent the actual involvement and don’t explore the whole potential of the $500+ billion crypto market.

By using blockchain to interact with fan communities, stars can bring millions of new users to the crypto industry and push the technology adoption further. It is the aim of TokenStars, a decentralized platform built on the blockchain, to bring celebrities, fans and advertisers under the same roof – and it already has 15 stars onboard.

TokenStars is being supported by such celebrity ambassadors as Hollywood photographer Rico Torres, tennis legend Tommy Haas, NHL top-scorer Nikita Kucherov as well as world football champions Lothar Matthäus and Gianluca Zambrotta. Many stars already raise money via a blockchain-based charity auction powered by the first platform module.

Among them are Redfoo (LMFAO), a popular American DJ, hockey star Pavel Datsyuk and Bitcoin evangelist Roger Ver. The startup targets a global celebrity management market topping $100+ billion and aims to disrupt the monopoly of the top 10 talent management agencies controlling over $25B in contracts.

All-in-One Platform for Celebrities
TEAM by TokenStars is built on Ethereum celebrity management platform powered by the Blockchain. It will directly connect stars with fans and advertisers without using pricy agents’ services. The platform has a potential to revolutionize the way all these groups communicate with each other.

The collaboration format could vary: from a partnership, a fan contest or a merchandise shopping, to something exceptionally creative, never seen before in the industry. The goal could differ too. TokenStars can help a rising star to get money for career progress by an exclusive ad proposal or to gather funds from supporters. While a well known celebrity can use it for exclusive and personalized communication with fan community, such as a contest or a charity project.

In return, TokenStars requires a commission from deals and prize money, which is paid in tokens bought on exchanges. So it makes a token value growth a good incentive for their holders. Additional benefits will be made for those who search and support rising stars. TokenStars purpose is to become all-in-one celebrity management solution.

A Decentralized Ecosystem in Action
The TEAM platform integrates 12 major modules divided into 4 layers by function. Blockchain technology ensures TokenStars transparency and scalability as well as it reassures that it can successfully compete in lucrative talent management industry.

Crowdfunding layer is already live. It includes the modules targeted at fans that want to become part of the TEAM ecosystem and at celebrities who are interested in raising funds from passionate supporters, attracting advertisers, or participating in charity activities.

Two arranged brand contracts showcase the platform in action. The Contests &amp; Charity module,  launched in December 2017, is currently powering the Charity Crypto Auction, for which celebrities have donated their personal things. Memorabilia items from Redfoo (ex-LMFAO), the skiis of biathlon Olympic champion Tarjei Boe and Lothar Matthaus’ World Cup jersey have already gone. Another lot, a T-shirt from Wimbledon champion Martina Hingis, was sold for a whopping $987 – a 20x from the actual price.

The auction is not finished yet and fans still have a chance to bid for exclusive stars’ items. Among the available lots are Gucci shoes of Vinny Lingham, a South African Internet entrepreneur, and the co-founder and CEO of Civic, which he worn at Shark Tank South Africa. Italian football star Gianluca Zambrotta, who now assists Fabio Capello in Jiangsu Suning, has given his signed jersey for the auction. For hockey admirers Sergei Fedorov, one of 100 NHL greatest players and 3x Stanley Cup Winner, has donated a signed hockey stick.

As well as a T-shirt signed by Roger Ver, a Bitcoin evangelist and early investor, is being sold. Bidding on it helps to raise money for Mises Institute which promotes teaching and research in the Austrian School of Economics, and individual freedom, honest history, and international peace.

“One of my favorite things about cryptocurrencies is that they can really make a change in the world. Whether it’s business, arts, sports or now non-profits, they attract the attention of people all over the world to the things that matter. That’s the reason I’m happy to support Crypto Charity Auction by TokenStars,” says Ver.

Two more modules of TokenStars platform will be out in Q1 2018.

Token as the Ecosystem Fuel
TEAM by TokenStars is the utility token that powers all the activities on the platform. Such as agency commission from advertisers and stars, exclusive benefits for fans, and rewarding users for scouting new celebrities.

TokenStars leverages the perks of blockchain technology to reassure all activities performed on the platform are verifiable. The decentralized model allows lower transfer costs and fast transactions, middleman elimination and empowering the global community to participate.

More Celebrities Who Support TEAM by TokenStars
TokenStars has successfully raised $4.9+ mln in the ACE token sale for tennis, and now focuses on TEAM; a decentralized blockchain-based platform which combines sports and showbiz into an ecosystem that connects world-known celebrities with fans and advertisers.

TokenStars TEAM has an impressive advisory board, it includes over 15 international celebrities in such fields as football (Lothar Matthäus, Gianluca Zambrotta), tennis (Tommy Haas, Cedric Pioline, Robin Soderling), hockey (Nikita Kucherov), Hollywood (Rico Torres), poker (Alexander Anter), and more.

The TokenStars TEAM pre-sale started on Feb. 5 and it will last until Feb. 12. For a minimum contribution of 1,000 TEAM tokens estimated at 0.1 BTC, those who participate in the sale get a 10 percent early bird bonus until Feb. 12. The token sale will run from Jan, 27 to Feb.28.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,"Student Tax Filing Trouble, what do I do?","Throwaway because reasons. I'm 20, male


Over the course of 2017, I made less than $2,000 working two part time jobs as a student in two states. In one, I made $135 with a federal deduction of $0.15, and a state deduction of seemingly nothing (my W2 form is blank in that section). In the other, I made $1771 and have a $124 state refund. Federally, I should have a $135 refund. 


I dabbled a little in short term stock trading and ended up with a loss of $48. I shouldn't have to pay taxes or (I believe) file. Bank interest was around $1 over the year, so I'm not sure if I need to file for that either.


I'm trying to use TurboTax to file and it's extremely frustrating. Part of me says report every little thing, which leads me to get railroaded down to their ""Deluxe Services"" page with no hope of actually receiving my refund without paying a significant chunk of cash to continue. Part of me says to solely report the largest income, despite having that $0.15 federal deduction from my other.


This is the second year I'm filing, and unlike last year where I only needed to report one state and federally, I don't know what to do. At this point I'm just thinking of holding off and going back to it tomorrow but I was on such a roll with getting things done. 


Edit: Currently on my third attempt to file. God help me",finance
personalfinance,I’m 24. My dad says I should pay down my mortgage. I think I should save for retirement.,"I’m a new homeowner (bought back in September). I just got a job making $60k (up from my previous job making $40k), and I want to know how to allocate about $900 extra per month.

My realtor dad is pressuring me to pay down my mortgage early. 

I think it’s a better idea to contribute up to the employer match on my Roth 401k (which I’m already doing), build up my emergency savings, start trying to max out my Roth IRA every year, then maybe pay down the rest of my student loan debt before I even think about tackling the mortgage. 

Am I right?

Details:
-I make $60k and share expenses with my boyfriend, who makes $40k
-6% employer 401k match (40% of my contribution)
-$8k in a Roth IRA (rollover from my previous job’s Roth 401k)
-$6k in emergency savings (goal is to bring this up to $15k for 6 months of living expenses)
-$260k owed on 30-year mortgage at 3.99% interest rate
-$12k left in student loan debt (at about 3-4% interest rate). Boyfriend is still in school, but will graduate with about $30k in loan debt.
-No credit card debt or car loan. Boyfriend has a small amount of credit card debt (under $5k) that he’s working on paying down.

Also, I’m young! I try to make good financial choices, but I want to prioritize saving for travel and little upgrades for the house before we settle down and start thinking about kids.

Any advice/talking points to tell my dad why I’m right (if I’m right!) would be greatly appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,First credit card for someone with decent credit,"I'm just out of college, living at home, and trying to build credit. From student loans and such, my mint.com credit score says I'm in the good range in the mid-high 600s.

I don't really travel much, though I wish I did. Ultimately I think it's wishful thinking to think I'd use miles much, so I'm not really looking at miles cards.

I'm thinking cash back is probably the best option. I don't have spending issues and I plan on just using it for everyday purchases, food, gas, etc. and I'll pay it off every month. So the interest rate won't matter for me.

I've heard that the Amazon card is pretty good, and I do have prime. But I haven't seen much on if it's a good card for starting out or if I'd even be likely to get accepted with very little credit history.

So I'm looking for both opinions on the Amazon card for someone starting off along with what other cards I should look into.

Thanks in advance.

Edit: The other option I'm thinking about is that I've been planning on changing banks (I got my original one because it could attach to my school's card, but where I live now has exactly 0 branches anywhere nearby) so I might switch to a Credit Union and get a card with them.",finance
Banking,Tracking bank account from 1960 [US],"Hi all,

I'm writing this because I need kind of help to see how feasible is to withdraw/track money from ~1960 that belonged to my mother's husband. In order to make some context, here is the story:

My mother was married with a Venezuelan air-force military (She is also Venezuelan). He participated in some special missions during the WW2. The guy died in eighties and he had some business in civil aviation. He told my mother about some money that he had in the US that was intended to help him in his medical treatment. At the end he died before going back to the US and use it. After his death my mother didn't have the possibility to go there and ask for information about the money (he didn't leave everything in place before dying).  My mother of course is still alive. She never had confidence that she could claim that money since she never left the country before and of course had problems with the language. Now, she is considering the possibility of getting that money back since I'm older and speak english.  We found a sort of a handwritten bankbook with the name of ""International Bank of Dallas"" (but without any kind of account number on it) with some significant amount of money. Actually, when I was little I remember to play with the bank checkbooks together with old aircraft relics while exploring the boxes with his belonging.

My mother tried in 1990 to get the money through some lawyers in Venezuela but she didn't trust them (and I was too little) and at the end she stopped the procedure. They told her that money was in possession of the Federal Reserve Bank (of Dallas?) but I'm not sure if this information if true. I would like to confirm this, but I'm not sure where to start since it is bit of difficult to find information about this ""International Bank of Dallas"".

Do you think that it is possible to track and get that money back? we have the death and married certificates and we found a diplomatic passport that belonged to him.

I'm not familiar with the US laws, so I'm not sure for how long the government can keep the money and if actually they keep it at all, especially in the cases where the bank doesn't exist anymore. (I think that the bank was absorbed or something like that but again, I'm not sure.)

Any ideas/help on how to track this?",finance

personalfinance,"Getting Paid Per Diem as Substitute Teacher, Wages haven't increased to reflect minimum wage/cost of living increases.","For the past four years I've been getting paid $75/day (~10.71/hour) working as a substitute teacher in my hometown while I build up my endurance for a better paying job. I have some limiting medical issues, making the flexibility of my schedule a huge reason why I've stayed so long. I feel like I'm totally being taken advantage of, and I want to ask for a raise without jeopardizing my job. Subs are treated as rather disposable.

I am a preferred substitute and my services are in high demand, many teachers request me specifically -especially in the special education department.  Since starting I have obtained a degree and gotten experience working as a ""real"" SpEd instructional aide in summer programs. Minimum wage in my state has since increased to $11/hour. The local McDonalds pays their employees better than the town pays us.

I was lucky enough to be hired as a long-term substitute in an ABA (severe special needs) class for which I've filled in weekly for about two years.  I'm the only substitute willing to work in that classroom. For two months I was getting paid 15.63/hour, the union rate. I am now back to per-diem subbing, but I am in that classroom at least once a week and getting paid $75/day for doing the **exact same work**. I'm effectively getting paid ~33% less money.

Per diem subs are only allowed to work 4 days a week because the town doesn't want to pay for benefits. There used to be a $5/day pay raise after you've subbed for a whole school year, but they eliminated that.  This is attracting subpar candidates with a high turnover rate and leaving the schools consistently understaffed on Fridays. They want us to come in for training so that we can perform some of the extra duties that regular teachers perform, without the increase in pay.

We aren't allowed to be part of the union, so we don't have anybody advocating for us.

Oh, and something that pisses me off more, I found some old public documents and saw that substitute teachers were being paid $65/day in 1999. 

I've run the issue by others teachers and they say, ""oh, you don't want to be a troublemaker, they'll just fire you."" I've also been told that it may not be possible because if they increase my pay, they'd have to increase the pay of all subs.

I'd like to be hired as an instructional aide in the ABA class next year, but in the meantime, I can't cover my bills. I don't want to hurt my chances of being hired for the position that will be opening up in the fall even though the lead teacher specifically wants me.",finance

personalfinance,Please help: Massachusetts tax penalty after 6 years?,"This happened yesterday: I got a notification from my BoFA that there was a $3300 charge from the Mass Tax Levy's office. I followed up with them and they said that the federal gov sent them a notice of how I filed wrongly in 2011 for which they are penalizing me now.

What happened in 2011 was, I was a student in Boston for 6 months of the calendar year. For the rest 6 (189 days to be precise), I did an internship in California and earned about $40k. When filing taxes in 2012 for 2011, I filed as a part-time resident in CA and paid my share of taxes on the 40k, which is correct, but due to lack of proper knowledge, I filed as a full-time resident for Mass and did not disclose my CA income there. So, the thing that went wrong here; I filed as a full-time resident of Mass but it should have been part-time resident in Mass. Now, the federal government sent this to Mass and told them that I filed as a full-time resident, but my full salary (including the 40k I earned in CA) was not disclosed properly. So they (Mass) charged me the extra $3200 thinking I haven't paid taxes on them. Now, I have paid taxes on that income, but in CA. 

After 6 years of filing, they are now asking for a proof that I have paid my CA taxes on that income and to amend my Mass filing. Isn't it past the time that I can file amendments? According to the lady on the phone, federal gov told Mass about this in 2015 and they did not reach out to me until now because they did not have an updated address on file. How is this possible? Doesn't the federal gov give them the updated address (considering I have filed my taxes for all the years until now?)

So with all this, I have so many questions; what can I do about this? There was no communication about this and they just took out money from my bank. I don't have my W2's handy from 2011. I do not even have the return papers from 2011 to prove that I did pay taxes on that income. How can I proceed? Please help.",finance

currently minimum monthly payment is at $115.00 per month. total owed is right at $24,000. i have four loans currently in grace (though this will change by year's end, so minimum payment will more than likely double to $230.00 monthly), and am making monthly payments on the other four. interest rate on these vary from 3.4% to 4.45%.

Forex,"Stock market, political volatility, and safe havens","I read many from here and in other subs that people have really been sick of the political volatility we have all around the world, US being the capital of it. I don't care about your views but I started asking what happened in a time when things were ""similar"" to what we are having today. The closest thing I found was Nixon &gt; Watergate time when he ""was forced"" to resign. 

Watergate started in ~1972 and ended in 1974 &gt; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watergate_scandal 

During that time NASDAQ started to drop fast &gt; https://imgur.com/a/e1rT8 The vertical line is the date when Nixon resigns. 

Nasdaq's fall resulted many investors to fly to safe haven places. I assume that many flew to CHF and JPY - I'd love to put their charts for confirmation here but couldn't find any data of those pairs' index values for that time. But many people from that era told me that people moved away from us stock market to safe haven assets. 

If you compare nasdaq/sp/dow to a safe haven pair like GBPJPY, they sort of ""play with each other"". You can do this free on tradingview.com. Feel free to do for AJ, NJ, UJ and others as well. Weird CHF was not the choice for investors this time!

If you look at what Donnie is dealing with, how Nasdaq/SP/Dow and JPY pairs are behaving, you will find similar moves and stories happening in the markets. Unfortunately, we have even worse conditions like having to deal with NAFTA issue (CAD being hammered), and the ""great"" BREXIT.

Nasdaq started to repair itself after Nixon resigned as money started to get back in. So I have to question, are we going to see Nasdaq/SP/Dow and xxxJPY pairs falling until Donnie resigns? 

This week we will get a glimpse of Brexit's future - I personally believe that they do not have any credible agreement which will push xxxJPY pairs to sink further unless they offer fixing the Irish border issue among other many things. We also have fomc and IR decisions. This is a scary week for me and looking forward to seeing what is going to happen.",finance

personalfinance,"Gonna be evicted from my old apartment and I don't know what my options are (Texas, USA)","Hi, everyone. 

I just moved to California from Texas and received my first paycheck. My plan for this was to: move here, pay rent in my old apartment in Texas until my lease ends in May, and go back for the rest of my things once I saved a bit of money.

I thought I had done all of the math properly. I lived comfortably in Texas and I received a job offer in San Francisco. The job offer was for more money, and I even had a $5,000 bonus for relocating. My math had me earning $2,000-$3,000 more every month, and I was so happy about this. I've of course got credit card debt that I want to pay off, and a medical bill that I pay monthly on. I figured I'd work here and pay everything off in no time.

What I didn't factor in was: 

- The first month's deposit.
- Taxes taking 40% of my income.

The first part screwed me over A LOT. I paid $500 for my deposit in Texas and of course I was expecing it to be higher here in SF but not at almost $4,000. So right away I was very low on money.

The second part really, really messed me up. Out of the relocation bonus, I only ended up getting $2,950 because the rest was eaten up by state, federal, social security, and medicare taxes.

And then to make matters doubly worse, I received my first paycheck. It, too, is eaten away by 40% in taxes. I'm earning a lot less than I was expecting to, and paying more in rent.

So now I can't pay my Austin rent, which is already two weeks late, and I can't fly back and get my things. I have a furnished apartment still in Texas, with a lot of my actual things, and I don't know what will happen at this point.

Do I have any options? What happens if I get evicted from my old apartment? My bank account already went in the negatives last week for the first time in years for me. I am so unbelievably depressed at this point because I really thought I was making a great decision. I was super proud of myself. And now I'm at the lowest point in my life. 

I forgot to mention that I had already relocated to Austin, Texas, and the company there also provided me with a relocation bonus. It wasn't taxed immediately so I received all of it. That's what I was expecting here, as well. I'm still in complete shock from how small my recent paycheck was.",finance

**1**- Pay off truck and put that 200 monthly to the 2018 IRA? drops my bank savings to 19,500 and with the 10k liquid in brokerage acct that is still over a years emergency funds

**2**- Keep paying truck, and drop another 212$ monthly on the 2018 IRA, (which i can afford to do), which keeps more liquid in my savings

**3**- Pay off truck, put 212$ to IRA's monthly, and 100-200 monthly to a brokerage acct

**4**- step 4 is basically step 3 but fund the 2017 ROTH from brokerage liquid, pay off truck from brokerage liquid leaving my bank savings basically untouched at 30k. 

This got a little lengthy i apologize. any point in the right direction would be helpful.

personalfinance,Advice Moving Forward with Adulthood Financially,"I am 28 years old, work 90+ hours a week as a field engineer in the oilfield, work 2/3 of the year, always traveling, and am looking for advice. Obviously single as no woman would ever put up with this lifestyle nor should they have to.

I've averaged about $130k yearly since graduating college in 2013 in civil engineering. My lifestyle sucks, but I've been able to pay off my $100k in student loans (took me five years to graduate), own a car, and fully vested both Roth IRA and Roth 401k every year.

I want to acquire some equity with a house purchase. I'm sick of renting and only being there a third of the year. Currently I split my rent with roommates, so I pay only $6k a year.

Should I keep money I'm saving for a 20% home down payment in a savings account? How do I proceed in saving for a home payment when I could probably have better returns investing this money? I know I can use up to $10k of a Roth IRA towards my first home purchase if needed but would rather avoid that. (The Roth accounts are over 5 years old).

Also should note I'm maybe looking to change my career path to an engineering desk job that pays around $75k a year and is local working 40-50 hours a week on salary in the upcoming months. Interviewed a few months ago and once the position becomes active, I have the opportunity to take it this summer. Maybe I should hold off on any rash purchases a few more years until I feel a sense of job security IF I make the jump? Thinking happiness over money here.

$6k a year on housing expenses isn't too much to swing while saving for a higher principle payment, and I don't want to just purchase a home for saving money, I should enjoy it as well and actually want to own it. I'd probably purchase a small starter home under $200k (hopefully sooner than later with such low interest rates), so I'd need atleast a $40k down payment to avoid PMI and I already have $20k towards that as well as a $10k emergency fund. My roommates would live with me and take care of the house if I should stay in the oilfield.

personalfinance,Recent college grad and curious about investment goals,"Hi guys, 

I am a 21 yr/ old who just graduated college and lives in the US. I've accrued about $13k in student loan debt at a 4% interest rate. 

I also just started working for a company paying me $65,000 a year, and matches 100% of my contributions towards a traditional 401k or a Roth 401k, up to 5% of my salary.

I'm currently living in a relatively low-cost apartment, and my next living arrangements are up to me in terms of how cheap I wanna go. There's plenty of cheap ($400-600 /month)  apartments in the area I could live in. 

I am comfortable with investing a large amount of my salary into a 401k and living frugally, but I was curious whether you guys think I should invest in the traditional, roth, or split both. Target %'s would also be helpful, I know I should at least match the employer contributions, but how much more?

personalfinance,Moving to start new jobs. Bigger down payment or pay off student loans?,"We're selling our current home and moving (midwest to midwest-ish locations. Similar cost of living) a couple states over. My wife got a great job and we couldn't pass up the opportunity. We're looking at homes that are affordable on just her salary as I haven't found work yet. We've also got 1 pre-K aged child with another due in August. My question is, what do you all think is the best route for us to go in terms of managing debt. The proceeds from our existing house sale will be used for one of the two scenarios as follows:

&amp;nbsp;

1. Rolled  into new house in the form of down payment. Will give us 20% down. This leaves us with a significant ($850) monthly student loan obligation, which we're currently paying of ahead of schedule. The interest on most of the student loans is higher than the interest rate on the mortgage will be.


2. Used to pay off student loans, and doing a smaller down payment on the new house (probably around 10%). We would have to pay a couple hundred dollars in PMI each month, but that drops off much quicker than we could otherwise pay off the student loans. Also seems like we're trading non-dischargable debt for something that's easier to rid ourselves of down the line, if need be (certainly hope we don't ever need to, but you never know).

personalfinance,Hypothetical - interest rate arbitrage,"The concept of leveraging borrowed money for investing in the stock market came to me a couple of months ago.  I've since decided this is a TERRIBLE idea.  It's way, way too risky.

But let's say I hypothetically found an FDIC(or equivalent)-insured place to park $20k-50k with a 4.5% interest rate.  And let's say I could either borrow money for an effective 3.5% rate or use credit cards with an introductory 0% rate (at the cost of tanking my credit score for a few months to a year).  

(So basically I could get a 1% profit with no credit damage, or 4.5% profit with substantial credit utilization.  Either $200-500 or $900-2250 a year profit.)

Again, assuming I found all of these magical unicorns, am I missing any potential risks?  An extra 1k-2k a year would be nice.  If I used credit cards, I would have to get myself in a place where I wouldn't need to apply for anything requiring a credit check (it would be after I purchase my next car, at the earliest).

There also seem to be enough cards out there with first 12 months free balance transfers that I could keep 20k-50k of credit card money invested for 2 or 3 years at least.",finance
personalfinance,Student Loans: Are there decent options other than the government?,"Hi all. I'm starting four years of veterinary school in the fall, and I'm working on figuring out the financing now.

I'm a married 32 y/o, combined income ~150k gross, zero debt, excellent credit (both high-700s)

The government loan options available are the Direct Loan Unsubsidized, guaranteed for $40,500 per year. Rate changes yearly, but last year was 6.00% with a 1.073% origination fee. 

That would cover pretty much all my yearly costs (tuition + fees is about $45k per year), but there's also the GradPLUS loan, which is credit-based, with a rate of 7.00% and origination fee of 4.276%.

I figured that with our income and credit history, we might be able to get a loan with better terms through a private lender, but that doesn't seem to be the case. Most of the banks and such that I've looked at have rates from 6-8% fixed, or starting variable rates from ~3-11%. In the current rising interest rate environment, I'm not thrilled with the idea of a variable rate loan.

So, does anyone know of other options out there, or is the government loan the best that we're likely to find?

personalfinance,(US)Looking for advice on a large loan,"This is my first post in PF. Please be kind and let me know how/if I can improve my post.

My wife and I are looking at consolidating all of our debt. Looking for advice on finding a loaner in California that might lend 65-85k with well off cosigners in addition to my wife and myself.
 I have many thousands of dollars in stupid student loans, plus our combined credit card debt. We are currently treading water, making all of our payments and have good-great credit for both of us.
We think that with her parents help as cosigners (well off, 50+, multiple properties) we could hopefully secure a loan for $85k. Our criteria is that amount, a monthly of about $1500 to stay cohesive with our current budget (still looking for a better job for me, and upcoming raises for her) and a hopeful interest rate of 6% or lower if possible. We projected out to be paid off in about 6.5-7.0 years using credit karmas calculator. 

Alternatively we could look for a loan for 65k and search separately for CC with free balance transfers and 0%APR. We could pay those off over maybe 3 years or sooner, transferring each time before the 0 APR runs out, if we could find a card that would allow for a transfer of about 20k to get us started.

Looking for recommendations on any lenders that might go for something like that or how to find them. Thank you.",finance

personalfinance,Financing a new car. Seeing 4+ % APR. What's considered a good interest rate today?,"I've applied both through the dealer and Chase. The offers I'm receiving are 4.1-4.9% APR interest rate for 72 month term on a $31,000 loan. I can pay ""cash"", but I will probably make much more keeping that money in the stock market and taking the loan. If the stock market crashes, then I can attempt to refinance or pay off. I've also been told by some dealers that their auto loan rates are pretty bad now, and I should check with credit union.

Seems pretty high to me, but kind of makes sense based on how well the stock market has been doing over the last year. Some of my colleagues are up 50% in their stocks. My first loan that I took out four years ago was for around $30,000, 72 months, 1.9% APR, but it was a manufacturer special discount to move units. I also helped cofinanced for my aunt around two years ago and it was 2% as well.

I pay $1000/month rent and make $130,000 a year. My Experian FICO score is 775. In the FICO score app, they estimate 3.879% for 720+ FICO score on 60 month loan. Changing to 36 month loan has basically no effect, it goes to 3.807%.

So that seems to be pretty consistent with a ~4% APR loan offered by my bank.

Looking at their (dealer trade-in) Kelly Blue Book and NADA values, they are worth 11k each. 

They both have 7k in negative equity. Their 30 day pay-off quote is at 18k each.

I purchased the Outlander out of stupidity, I know.

My credit is at 703. No savings to pay off negative equity. Just married, moved across state and aggressively paying off other debts (~$3k left)

I’d like to get rid of both of them and finance one vehicle. I drive a motorcycle so the car will be for my wife and she doesn’t mind driving a beater as long as it’s an AWD. We live in a rural area so commuting is obligatory since there isn’t public transportation for several miles. 


My Plan: (Please tell me if it’s possible or not) 
Go find a car worth $10k, trade in the two vehicles, the $14k of total negative equity adds it up to a total of 24k financed and the two cars are paid off. Realistic interest rate @ 9% brings the total cost of the loan to ~$29k @ $498 mo. Which saves me $200 from my current monthly car loans.

Law School A is ranked in the 90s, not a good national school but strong in the state. I got a full scholarship from them to go, but I'd lose three years of income and still borrow like 45k total for living expenses.

Law School B is ranked in the 70s, in a mid sized city with more law firms and networking. They offered me a 20k scholarship, so I'd probably borrow 90k total to go there.

Law School C is in the D.C. Area and is a T50 school. I'd probably need to borrow 125k to go there but my job prospects may be better.

Law School D is not in DC, but is T40 and has a huge alumni network. It would probably cost 115k to go there.

I am starting a federal internship in a few weeks, assuming my background check clears. It's around DC, for like 45k starting if I get a job offer but up to 75k in two years.

Or, I could keep broadening my job search and see if I can land an opportunity. I have a disability and qualify for federal job assistance. The internship experience will definitely help.

1. Are we saving enough? Should we have another vehicle other than the 401ks, IRAs, and 529. 
2. Is the $600/mo sufficient for 529 savings given we now have a third child? We are not of the mindset that we plan to pay for their entire education, but we also don’t want them crippled with debt when they leave. I know that (at least when I was in school) financial aid factored in the number of children attending college or pursuing higher education. However, we don’t want to count on that as a savings approach.
3. Would it make sense to borrow from the HELOC to max out the IRAs. Sure we are going to pay interest on the HELOC, but the interest rate is so low, it seems like the growth rate of that $11k would be much higher than whatever interest we would pay.  I plan to put our $11k tax return towards the HELOC, so it is essentially a wash. 
4. Following on to that, our biggest issue is month-to-month liquidity. Is there a good place that has recommendations for monthly budgets by category for a family of five? I’m struggling to come up with a common sense budget for a family of our size. 
5. Generally, are we doing enough?",finance

personalfinance,(Taxes) Advice needed: Healthcare hit my taxes hard. Free software doesn't provide any leads on exemptions for my mildly special situation.,"Hi Y'all, first time poster here, 25-Female so this is a whole new wild world. Please don't interpret any humor below as a dismissal of the situation, I'd rather laugh now (and later when it's over with) than cry and die mad about it. Regardless, I've spent far too long typing this to sift through and remove the potentially whiny bits so I'll just drop one of these here for ya:

**TL;DR: The nature of 2017 and my health made actual healthcare coverage for that time straight up impossible despite my every effort. The nature of my income, then and now, and the healthcare tax are incompatible. Out of a long list of exemptions, my situation (even disregarding my whining about my poor pitiful health) doesn't fit the bill on anything and I want to know if I either missed something, or there is yet something I can do to avoid the fact that hitting ""complete"" on H&amp;R Block requires immediate payments of x amount monthly on the debt which can't be made immediately or saved for quickly.**

Specifically: I had partial health coverage, which was good enough, until I was laid off on January 30th last year (and an argument could be made for some of February since the ""severance"" was another paycheck with no changes that pretended I was totally still working there for the rest of that week). Following was unemployment (Hey side question: unemployment doesn't exactly get a W2, do I have to account for it on taxes and if so, how? I hear vague rumors of it being untaxed, but I'm already flying too close to the sun to be operating on rumor), next up was minimum wage with a little unemployment sprinkled on top, then minimum wage after calling off the unemployment hounds, and in July a position that started me at the better-than-minimum-wage pay but didn't offer coverage that I'm still at.

Details and tidbits: 2017 was a rough year for me during which, despite extensive efforts, definitely didn't result in Healthcare coverage. I am the breadwinner, my fiance (for reasons that are his own, are legitimate, and have already been addressed into a lesser version of the monster they were when we got together) covers one of the lesser bills regularly and completely and chips in when he can on the rest (and on occasion does some sell/trade voodoo on valuables to take care of unexpected big expenses that would otherwise pull us under), thus it's my paycheck that is devoted solely to household bills and keeping things just out of reach of disconnection on the day to day. Besides that, he was double digits above the poverty line and his taxes managed to break even. Basically what I'm saying is we're paycheck to paycheck and regularly eating hotdogs already, so I can't even swing the payment plan on what I owe for the no-coverage fee (and the fee to set up the payment plan for the fee, because even fees need fees) especially considering my next point on health that I reduced from mini-novella version for your easy consumption. This is not something I've actively neglected; I'm furiously researching appeal processes in regards to affordable healthcare with suspiciously rigid thresholds, but as for the fees I need to address now? My taxes are saved a couple clicks away from completion on the H&amp;R Block web because there's nothing in their hefty list of exemptions that really capture ""Indiana has the highest and fastest growing wage gap of any state, so sue me if I belatedly found a place that keeps me above the federal definition of poverty and I shouldn't keep high hopes for more out of a sense of maintaining a vaguely good mood about life.""

My health concern is one that for my entire life has effected my ability to function in a way that allows me to utilize narrow application windows (bye bye ACA web, two years running). It was a miracle back then if I could look at two utility bills at once and prevent my brain from performing a hard reset, and I'm actually astounded that I'm able to assess this whole tax mess right now thanks to medication. A little more than a month ago, I utilized every trick I could find to cut some of the edge off the prices and get myself set up with the medication I'll be on for the rest of my life, plus the regular appointments due to the nature of the meds. Now that those are on my list of expenses, Fiance and I could decide to never eat another meal forever and still not save enough money from it to put away a dollar for a rainy day. I'll happily break down my budget below or in its own thread if someone wants to throw me advice on that, too. I've run the numbers every way I can think of, and I've got nothing. Trust me, I don't want to be shelling out more than half of my paycheck for a shack with swiss cheese for walls, but somehow despite the price it's still cheaper than the apartment complex for the impoverished that I barely don't qualify for. 

So there it is. I'm in a corner. I'll take some punches to get some affordable healthcare rolling right now for myself if I can have it, but I need to be able to make it clear to our tax lords and saviors that it wasn't an option last year. The only resources I know of to consult are: Here (you beautiful crossroads-of-the-internet people, you), and the local library that recently held a ""Seniors helping Seniors on Taxes"" event because they may know a guy who will *not* laugh when I ask for free advice on how to take care of this myself.",finance

personalfinance,Federal Student Loans and MPN,"Hello all!

I will be starting medical school this summer/fall and will be borrowing money using Federal Student Loans; both the direct un-subsidized and direct PLUS loans. I was fortunate enough to have paid for my undergraduate schooling without loans, so I have several questions/concerns regarding borrowing (as I am a first time borrower): 

1. I have been accepted to one school (lets call it school A), and am waiting to hear back from another school (school B). School B sends out decisions on 4/30 but tuition is due at school A on 4/16. After contacting school A, I was told if I am taking out loans, I just have to accept them from the school portal/go through counseling/etc and that will satisfy the need for tuition to be paid on the 4/16 date given. Apparently the actual money will not be disbursed until later (after the official start date). Will this cause a problem with my loans if I get into school B and withdraw from school A?

2. I just finished the financial counseling through studentloans.gov and the next step is to fill out the Master Promissory Note (MPN) for each of the loans I will be taking out. This note only has available space for one school, therefore if I fill this out with information about school A, will this cause a problem if I end up withdrawing prior to school starting and attending school B?

I'm Active Duty in the Air Force as an E-3. Make $23,100 a year before taxes. I have $17,662 in four federal student loans with APRs ranging from 4.41% to 3.51%. 

 * $6620 @ 4.41%
 * $7507 @ 4.04%
 * $2572 @ 3.51%
 * $963 @ 3.51%

I'm paying just above the minimum at $220 a month using the Snowball method. (The avalanche method only saves me &lt;$100, and doesn't change payment length.)

My assests are:

 * $1000 in an emergency savings
 * $1000 in a 2 yr CD (For a Secured CC that I pay in full every month) (edited)
 * Another $3600 in savings (I'm planning on using $2500 as a down payment for the car.)
 * $251/month (13%) into the Roth TSP (I'm planning on lowering to 10%, but with a new 5% match, It'll still be a 2% increase) (edited)
 * $175/month (9%) into a Trad IRA w/ Vanguard
 * $100/month in a savings account

I'm estimating the total monthly ownership of this car to be $460 a month

 * $290 car loan payment at 1.9% for 60 months (parents will cosign, so I'll be able to get HFS' 1.9% @ 60 months)
 * $97 Insurance (Already have a policy with Gieco for 100/300/100 and uninsured matching w/ 500 deductible both compressive and collision plus others) (pretty good price for a 23M)
 * $70 Gas I only see my self driving to the city on some weekends. Everything else is close by, and it's a Civic.
 * $5 Maintenance/Repair It's a brand new Civic.

I've done a budget, and with the total monthly cost of ownership, I'll still have $280 to myself after all the bills have been paid for eating out/fun/shopping etc...
In addition to my $2500, my parents will also put down $1500. And being military, HFS will take off another $500. In addition to my parents cosigning, my mom is friends with one of the sales person at out local Honda dealer. Also I found another Honda dealer in the same city selling their LX Civics at $17000.

personalfinance,Setting up an emergency account for parents,"Hello,

&amp;nbsp;
I want to help my parents stay afloat, and hopefully recover from massive debt, but am unsure how to do so without putting myself at risk. Let me explain their situation and recent developments first, and then I will go into the options I have considered. I apologize in advance for the length, but rest assured there is a lot of useful content.

&amp;nbsp;
My parents got in debt by overextending themselves at a time when my father was making a lot of money ($200-300k, variable depending on business). The field he works in underwent massive changes and became far less lucrative. Their income was more than cut in half in under a few years, and at the same time their credit card provider raised interest rates. This all happened at a time of financial turmoil for the nation (US), meaning that my father's clients often did not pay him in time. Many were six months late. If he were to sue these clients to get money, then he would not be able to obtain new clients as easily.

&amp;nbsp;
My parents have enough credit card debt and loans taken out against their house that they may be sued and may lose their house. I have provided help to them over the past few years, but this has not made an impact as far as I can tell. I provided them with $15,000 and took over a few remaining loans--$12,286.30 worth at the time I took the loan over--that they took out to pay for my schooling, since they did it for my sake. I believe that their debt is large enough that anything I do to help short of paying off a large chunk of it in one go just prolongs the issue. They told me they owe $7,500/mo. Of course this increases with interest, as much of their debt is in credit cards. They will not provide me their financials. (Why? Good question. I cannot get them to provide an answer aside from ""It doesn't matter.""). 

&amp;nbsp;
My parents need more help from me, but I am unsure how I can help in a way that truly does help their situation rather than perpetuate it. My mother called me recently and wanted me to cosign a loan, which I refused to do. She then wanted me to add her as an authorized user to a credit card she can use in emergencies. I refused to do this, as well. I do not believe she would use the card for non-emergency situations, but I cannot take the chance that she does and as a result compromise my credit.

&amp;nbsp;
I offered to fund a prepaid debit card for her, which she said she will think about. I researched more about prepaid debit cards and their fee schedules, which leads me to conclude that it is better she open a separate bank account that I dump $2,500 into. The intent is still to use this account for emergencies. If she empties it out for any other reason, I would not refill it. If she really does have an emergency and needs to use it, I would refill it.

&amp;nbsp;
I am conflicted. On the one hand, I want to do all that is in my power to help my parents. They have done a lot for me over the years and have raised me well. They do love me. I did not have a bad childhood. They have been nothing but good parents to me. Further, they have made efforts to address their debt. They saw a bankruptcy lawyer, who told them to refinance their house [again]. They were denied. They live with almost no food in the house, and do not make extravagant purchases. (As for their income, my father is self-employed and works incredibly hard in a profession that is not doing nearly as well as it once had been. Still, he makes anywhere from $70-130k per year, pre-tax. Again, variable income because of the industry and the fact he is self-employed. My mother is over 70, and she is not in any condition to work. I am not sure what else they can do given their age.)  

&amp;nbsp;
On the other hand, I am concerned that my mother is becoming desperate and believes that I can solve all her problems. She as much as stated this when she told me that had I co-signed the loan for her then she would have been able to pay off her existing debts, and the new loan would be low enough interest that they could pay it off. Maybe this is true, but maybe something goes wrong that makes me responsible for the loan. Then I would not have anything extra to help them with, as I would be paying off a loan they could not pay, and they would still be in the exact same situation prior to the loan unless they managed to pay off enough high-interest accounts to make their debt manageable.

&amp;nbsp;
I do not know what to do here. I am willing to give her $2,500 in a separate account that she manages, but I am just not sure if there is a point. What emergency situation that necessitates using the account would be an emergency that is &lt;= $2,500? At their age I would think most emergencies would be medical in nature, and $2,500 is often not enough to pay for medical care in the U.S. Perhaps if they get stranded while driving and need to be towed... I could see that as a good use of the account. Still, I am doubtful that this money will be of much help to them, which is why I am here.

&amp;nbsp;
Do you here on personalfinance believe an emergency account, pre-funded with $2,500, would be critically important to my parents' well-being? Is there more I can do without putting my own finances at risk? I am all ears, and I am happy to provide any additional information that you need.

personalfinance,Seriously overwhelmed with student loans..,"So.. backstory in two sentences: I graduated college with zero student loans, worked and paid cash each semester as I went. After college, engaged to spouse whom has ~$72k in student loan debt, where spouse is managing to pay monthly, but their projected savings is zilch.

Now, I’m looking at all the options for making the most economical decision regarding these loans moving forward. Pay as you earn, income based repayment, revised pay as you earn, consolidation, refinance, strategic default, etc.. but every option might as well just direct me to a site called urfuckedregardless.com. My problem is, all of these options seem so similar that I’m having a hard time figuring out which is the most ideal. I knew when marrying the love of my life that it came with the student loans but I didn’t know how much of a headache setting up a repayment strategy would be. I will give some personal details below and ask that if anyone has any kind of advice, PLEASE post a comment that could potentially help us or someone in a similar situation.

State: MN
My income: $63k
Spouse’s income: $49k

Student loan balance: ~$72k

~2/3 of which are direct federal subsidized and unsubsidized loans, 1/3 is a parent PLUS private loan through Wells Fargo in parent’s name.

Average interest rate: ~10%

We do not work in fields that gain us any special treatment (public service, lawyer, doctor, etc..) Current payment plan is on whatever the standard payment plan is.

I work in a professional field where I could see a pay bump from 10-20% increase and spouse is in sales maybe seeing a 5-10% increase, each within a couple years.

Bottom line, we are looking for the lowest cost option. Currently the loans do not have my name attached. Do we refinance with me as a co-signer? Is it a bad idea to co-sign given my higher income? Are one of the repayment options much better given our situation? Does getting married in 7 months affect any of this. Should we be contacting someone specialized to get advice?

Cash available as of now is ~$25k. We are looking to buy a house as early as possible while interest rates are low, but the student loans will guide our timing more than anything else. Is there something I’m missing here? idk. Am I a heated mess over this? Yes. Do I need help? Rhetorical. I have no clue what I’m doing as I paid cash for my loans while working through college. I’m financially literate, but not when it comes to student loan options! Sort of feeling dumb and overwhelmed, so any advice is greatly appreciated..

Stripping out one fat tail situation, our $BTC flows were surprisingly balanced heading into the weekend as the markets digested a $1k swing. $ETH was where most of the knife catching took place so when it dropped to early December lows without so much as a fight, understandably accounts weren't exactly eager to double down.

4. I understand it doesn't apply to hospital bills or student loans. What other forms of debt does it not apply to if any?

5. Is there any way to determine what debt I have and what has washed away?

CryptoMarkets,More than 70% of all the projects are scams,"This is now the buzzword in r/cryptocurency. I do get, that a lot of people entered the market to be millionaire in a fortnight like say CryptoNick or Trevon James (Yeah, these people have damaged the credibility of the millennials who invest in Crypto), but to be so salty as to call the entire space an outright scam is actually Self Denial. DYOR is the most ""stated"" and least ""used"" term in cryptocurrency. Rightfully, with just a bit of common sense, people wont even spend a penny on bitconnect.

I do agree that &gt;1000 projects wont even come to fruition. But apart from a few, if we look at the top 50, well, I can say, atleast 20 of them are pretty massive projects. In an entirely new ecosystem, thats developing, even if we end up getting 10 projects that serve the world some good, would that not be awesome? 

The Bears are ruling the market, but they wont rule forever. The boom continued from November to say, mid January, and it seemed never ending. This too will end. 

Here I would try to lay down some of my opinions for all the doubts and FUD that media propagate:

1. NOT BACKED : Fiat, you will find is essentially backed by IMFs Currency Basket. The Currency Basket in itself is backed by Fiat. Thus, ultimately it pegs the whole concept of Fiat down to single entity, Trust. USD has major stronghold on the basket. This ultimately leads to a situation wherein the Currencies of other countries too, are to an extent pegged to USD, which we know is prone to whims of the FED.

Bitcoins underlying value is in the used Protocol. Bitcoin as such is just a protocol, using a distributed, decentralized ledger and a POW based consensus mechanism for its existence. Same for ethereum, the ether protocol. While people might argue, whats the REAL asset underlying , remember its the same logic used by Brick and Mortar shops against Amazon.

2. NOT GREEN : Lets calculate the entire energy spent by the Banking corporations, plus the energy consumption for Fiat printing, and the energy consumption for maintaining the security , and add to that the devaluation impact of fiat, and devise a parameter. Now lets compute the entire energy required for maintaining the Cryptosphere, and subtract the deflationary impact of a fixed total supply. I think Green Bankers will wet their pants in fear if such a study is conducted. 

If you hate POW, Crypto communities are working their ass out for POS, which if proven secure like POW, will end this debate forever.

3. High Transaction Fees and Lack of scalability : This is a problem. To have utmost  decentralization, low transaction fees, and high scalability all at the same time seems impossible. An optimum solution will be there. Probably we will have to do away some decentralization and security for purpose of efficiency. We are already seeing solutions like Nano, Cardano, Lightning Network. Its interesting  to find out where we end.

4. Terrorism : Bitcoin is used for Drugs and Terror Funding. Internet is used for Porn. Sound synonymous? You decide.

5. Lack of faith in the technology : When i see most of the cryptocurrency subs, its all about ""when will we break even"" Or ""Am selling all this since its going to zero"". Try speaking logic, they will spew Venom. As if buying Bitcoin at 20k dollars and keeping it in Bitconnect was the collective fault of the crypto community. Although am just over 7-8 months in this market, i can tell the only secret to make some money here, is your Conviction. Read the whitepaper, check the team, think about it, rate it. If you cant rate it DONT invest in it. Just like I dont keep Monero, simply because i fear regulatory crackdown might come hard on it. I might be completely wrong. But then, as long as you dont have the Conviction, you will end up losing. Always, yes always, dollar cost average while buying, and take profits, if you have doubled or tripled. Set the goalposts, and dont keep on changing them. Never buy all at a time. Never sell all at a time.",cryptocurrency

Working an event for two weeks next month, and I've never filled out an expense report. What should I include in it? I don't want to include stupid things that make me look like I'm milking them for everything I can, and on the other hand, I want to get reimbursed for the quasi-necessary expenses I'm incurring to travel.

For the record, my flight, hotel, rental car, transportation to and from my hotel from the destination airport are already paid for, so I'm obviously not including that.

Things I'm on the fence about:

* Dry cleaning for my uniform (chef's clothes)
* Gas getting to the airport (it's an hour and a half away)
* Mileage at the federal rate for getting to the airport (its about 96 miles one way)

Things I'm NOT on the fence about:

* Airport parking cost
* Checked bag fee and any other airline associated fees (I have to bring my chef knives and therefore must check a bag)
* Meals I pay for while traveling to and from the event

Am I missing anything? Any advice from career traveling businessmen/women?

They quickly started getting the paperwork together, gathering my information, etc. But first i told them i wanted to take it to my uncle to make sure it was a good car. as im gone they call me and say everything went through they just need my signature. I go back and sign and thats it. (at first i thought this was a little fishy but payed no mind because i was so excited about having my first car) So fast forward to now, my payment is coming up... they didnt even tell me how much i would be paying a month or any details of the car loan. I had to call them and ask. I make an account with the car loan company online to see how much i need to pay back.

When we put my income into our Married Filing Jointly I owe $8,200. If I fill out filing single in a separate return for comparison purposes I owe $8,300. My question is where did her $1,890 federal and $333 state refund go? 

Am I wrong in assuming that her federal and state refund would satisfy part of my tax debt and I should owe $5,977 ($8,200-$1,890-$333=$5,977)? I feel like the $2,223 is disappearing somewhere and I can't find it.

hardware,"The FCC will Hold a Vote on March 22nd Aimed at Speeding the Development of 5G Networks, Which Could Reduce the Cost of Deployment by as Much as 26%, and Regulatory Costs by 80%","[Source] (https://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2018/db0301/DOC-349528A1.pdf)

The Federal Communications Commission will hold its monthly open meeting on March 22. At the top of the agenda is an order aimed at speeding the deployment of next-generation 5G networks by streamlining the federal review process for certain infrastructure deployments. The order specifically focuses on deployments that are subject to review under the the National Historic Preservation Act and and National Environmental Policy Act, two U.S. laws designed to preserve historical and archaeological sites, as well as the environment.

The FCC's order would exempt small wireless facilities, or small cells, from the environmental and historic review procedures required under the two laws. Republican FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr, who has championed the order in recent weeks, has noted the legal requirements under the NHPA and NEPA were originally designed for large, macrocell towers. Small cells are cellular base stations and antennas that are frequently the size of pizza boxes, though technically, the size of these cells can vary greatly. According to the commission, its revised approach to small cells stands to ""cut the regulatory costs of deployment by 80 percent, trim months off of deployment timelines, and incentivize thousands of new wireless deployments.""

Among other things, the FCC's order would also adopt a shot clock for the commission's processing of Environmental Assessments, directly addressing complaints the commission received from wireless operators. In particular, T-Mobile US Inc. said that because Environmental Assessments required by the FCC were not subject to any processing timelines or dispute resolution procedures, ""this lack of structure can cause new facility proposals to languish for extended periods of time.""

&gt;The Commission last considered this question in 2004,
when “virtually every outdoor wireless facility deployed was a ‘macro’ facility consisting of large arrays
of panel antennas mounted on towers, roof tops, or other structures at heights of 100-200 feet or more
above ground level.” Today, by contrast, small wireless facility deployments represent a large and
increasing share of wireless communications facility deployments. For example, “[i]n 2017,
approximately 62 percent of Verizon’s wireless deployments were small cells, a figure that will only grow
larger as we deploy 5G in 2018 and beyond.”

&gt;To be able to meet current and future needs, including
deployment of advanced 4G and 5G networks, providers will need to deploy tens of thousands of small
wireless facilities across the country over the coming years. As noted above, Verizon states that next
generation networks will require 10 to 100 times more antenna locations than previous 3G and 4G
networks, while AT&amp;T represents that carriers will deploy more small wireless facilities in the next three
and a half years than the number of macro facilities deployed in the last 35 years.

[Network Densification] (https://www.rcrwireless.com/20161109/fundamentals/network-densification-5g-tag31-tag99)

&gt; Verizon and AT&amp;T reported similar burdens. Verizon examined its small wireless
facility deployments in 2017 in five urban markets across the United States and found that completing
NEPA and NHPA reviews comprised, on average, 26 percent of the total cost for these deployments.^^107
In the five markets Verizon examined, the costs of completing NEPA and NHPA (including tribal)
reviews comprised, on average, 26 percent of the total cost of deployment of small cells, including
equipment.^^108 AT&amp;T offered similar figures, stating that 17 percent of its costs to deploy each small
wireless facility is directed to NEPA and NHPA compliance. ^^109 AT&amp;T further represented that it expects
to spend $45 million on NEPA and NHPA compliance for thousands of small wireless facilities in 2018
and that its current NEPA and NHPA costs have direct effects on its broadband deployment initiatives by
funneling money away from new small wireless facility projects or the expansion of existing projects.^^110
By contrast, AT&amp;T estimates that a Commission decision that such deployments are not major federal
actions or undertakings would reduce small cell NEPA/NHPA compliance costs by up to 80 percent,
which would fund over 1,000 additional small cell nodes annually, and reduce the small cell deployment
timeline by 60-90 days.^^111

^^108 Id. Verizon does not identify the five urban markets in which it conducted this study, and it acknowledges that it
made this calculation using sample sizes of 5-19 sites (depending on the availability of data) involving collocations
on existing structures (although Verizon notes that approximately 20 percent of its small cell deployments involve
construction of new structures).

I've been trying to figure this out on my own all day and I keep getting lost here:

http://www.filelater.com/resources/income-tax-extensions-payments-and-penalties-explained

&gt;The IRS also charges interest on any outstanding tax balance. Interest is compounded daily and accrues starting on the due date of your tax return until the day you pay your taxes. The interest rate is determined on a quarterly basis. Currently, the interest rate is equivalent to the Federal short-term rate plus 3%.

Can any kind soul please explain to me what total amount I would owe the IRS (roughly) if I go this route? I guess I don't understand how daily compounding interest works and it's confusing the hell out of me and sounds like a nightmare.

I'd be filing the extension ASAP and paying it in either 6 or 12 divided payments. I understand everything else for the most part, but if someone could run the numbers for me I'd be eternally grateful.

This is a true emergency fund. The idea is that we will _never_ touch the money unless an emergency comes up.

I've looked into a lot of high yield savings accounts recently and they all seem extremely similar between Ally, Discover, AmEx, etc.

I've read mixed reviews about CIT, but most of the concerns seem to involve things I'm not worried about. I don't care if their mobile app is lackluster. I'm aware that they're not going to automatically adjust my interest rate if rates go up and instead I'll have to contact them and most likely close one account and open another.

We figured out how a small home improvement loan we took out and her car loan would go to her and I would take the credit card debt and whatnot.  Very amicable and understanding.  I was the main signer when we opened the account.  We both live in northern Wisconsin and make modest means.  We also recently had to take a credit card out for our dogs healthcare last year that we recently paid off but dinged our credit with a hard inquiry. 

The original idea was to have her create her own account at the bank and get the car loan and home improvement loan moved over to it and leave the rest where it's at and take her name off my account.  The bank informed us however that they would have to rehit us with another hard credit inquiry to transfer the debt to her account which would lower her score more and once for me too.  Basically we are reapplying for our respective loans without the others credit but they have all out financials and no that even just one of us could pay off all of what's owed monthly without much issue.  

My question is is there anything that we can do here beyond claling the bank again?  They are a credit union and the personal rep we are dealing with doesn't always seem on it.

personalfinance,Best Book for Partner New at Managing Finances,"Hi All,

TLDR: what are the best personal finance books for a natural spender who wants to learn about PF with little prior knowledge. 

Long time lurker first time poster. So I am in a relationship with a wonderful women and we are on the way to getting engaged. We live together now and are lives are starting to converge. 

I am fortunate enough to make a very health salary (250k +range) and pay most of our joint bills and save for our future. No debt. She works full time at a major company but at a more entry level and just started her professional career after graduating from college. She was smart about it and went to community college before a 4-year and has minimal federal loans. 

I was raised in a household where we were good at budgeting and my parents were able to put myself and my sister through college and retire at 65. 

My partner had a more tumultuous upbringing and told me she was never taught about personal finance. Her family lived more paycheck to paycheck and spent their money. I've noticed some of those tendencies  (being more of a spender), but within limits as per above. 

We've taken several good steps already to be on the right path: 

-Budget created monthly with 33% of gross income going into various savings 

-We talk each month about the budget, upcoming expenses and medium term financial goals 

-6-month or more emergency fund (45K) saved

That said, we need to get on the same page in terms of budgeting together, working on joint priorities, etc. I want to make sure we continue to save enough as our lives gets more complicated. We are also not saving quite as much as I would like, but I know its a compromise and we can afford the luxuries we have keeping a decent savings rate. 

During our last chat, she asked what book she should read to get started on PF. I think it would need to meet the following requirements: 

- Provide a good primer on PF overall

- Given context on helping with impulse purchasing etc.

Well the start of 2017 I got a job at this company and when completing my hiring paperwork, some how my parents address got filled in for my taxes. Most likely my mistake but I'm not 100% sure. I didn't catch it because I'm salary and my checks are always the exact same. When I got my W-2 for 2017 thats when I caught it. My employer has fixed it going forward for this tax year so this won't be an issue next year (hopefully).

So I took my taxes to a tax pro this year because of this little mess. Filed everything and I got my federal back super fast. But Missouri proposed changes to my return and refunded me $5 (They owe me almost 3k). Now I can't get a straight answer out of MO for what I need to do to get my money back.

personalfinance,IRS Magically Issued a Release of Tax Liens - Too good to be true?,"This situation has held me back many years but I recieved an official document stating no specific reason 3 years worth of Tax Liens...GONE! Too good to be true?

I had someone perpetrate a fraud against me unknowningly out of pure ignorance in my youth. 

2005 = $2K DEBT
My buddy and his tax secrets set me up for a $2K debt. The secret was that he overstated my federal witholding prompting a refund. I then received a $2k bill which I couldnt pay at that time. I was 18/19 years old and should have known better. Lesson learned.

2006 = $2K + $8,500 + $1,700 = $12,200
I was recruited and offered a $65K Salary at 19/20 years old for a forclosure company. My new entrepreneur boss had me grab supplies for the office weekly. Always losing things, he'd write me a check, I cashed it, purchased the items and gave him the change and the receipt. It sounds odd now but at the time he was starting up and paying me way more than anyone else, saying NO or questioning the boss wasn't something I wanted to do. 
I filed my taxes and recieved a refund of $1,700. About 1 year later, I get a tax bill for approx $8,500. It turns out all the checks I cash to get supplies, he issued a 1099 to me without ever making me aware of it. The 1099 was for over $25,000.  At this point I left the firm, too chaotic and tough enviroment with no structure. 

2008 $14,200
I went back to school and I got another 1099 for 2008 from him for money I never earned.

I had about $14 grand in taxes due and left it like that until this year. I had money taken from my accounts twice so I couldn't do that anymore but no one at the IRS cared about what was happening to me. I joined the military having no way out of this situation. I now lived 2,500 miles away and he would never answer me. 

2011 - HE WAS ARRESTED
The guy who did this to me was arrested for fraud and sentenced t0 25 years in Jail with restitution of over $350 MILLION DOLLARS. 

2012 - 
I PLEAD to IRS for help and explain. I request that a case be opened up and they said it could take a year to get a response. 

2013 - 
No response. I had to file something again.

2016
I refiled 2 packets of information supporting my case with all the information regarding his case, his charachter, and to demonstrate what he did. I recieved a letter acknowledging that they recieved my packet and never heard about it again. 

2018
I recieved a letter stating that I would be released of all liens on me. Free and clear.

There is no reason that the liens were released. Does it matter? (not rhetorical)

Bitcoin,How is LN going to be used for mass adoption if every LN user is supposed to be remain online?,"A couple of things, I am confused with.

The eClair wallet which is BTC/LN compatible, is only a pay wallet. Here is a quote,

&gt; https://medium.com/@ACINQ/announcing-eclair-wallet-a8d8c136fc7e
Which leads to our second design decision: you can only pay with this wallet on LN, not receive funds. We think it is acceptable because the main use case for a mobile app is for paying anyway.

Of course, in the future, we will be able to remove this limitation using the upcoming trustless third-party watchers, but we don’t have them now.
It does not allow users to receive funds into their LN wallet because that requires running a full node in order to be sure you are not being fed fake transactions. There is supposedly a third party watchers coming out? What is that?

The solution, seems to be that anyone who wants to use the LN will need to run a full node as well as the LN software on top of it on a server/computer. There can be mobile wallets that act as remote controllers for the LN wallet that is on the server/computer. 

What do you guys think about this? I can't imagine the average person going and setting up a bitcoin full node and LN on top and always leaving their PC on. There is a device called Litbox from Vertcoin team coming out that is plug and play but I also can't imagine average people purposefully spending on a box so they can send/receive money, they will just use their credit card?",cryptocurrency
Forex,I expect 4 rate hikes,"Jerome Powell will make his first big mark. If Trump keeps his antics up I'm all for sticking to 3 rate hikes, BUT if we have a decent presidency that actually listened to the advisors I would love to see 4 rates and mid-2019 interest rates at 2% which would set it equal to inflation.

Although the Phillips curve has been discredited it is still useful for short-term inflation expectations. We know unemployment continues to fall so inflation should be expected to rise. We saw this happen in our last core PCE survey. *PCE = consumer price index which excludes energy and food

Taylor Rule (John Taylor was my preferred fed chairman after Janet Yellen) suggests that the Fed raise interest rates during above-average growth and stay neutral during steady growth.

Will we see an increase to 4 rate hikes? We can interpret after our next core PCE and employment survey. March survey will be released on April 11th. Another indicator for job growth is the S&amp;P 500. I think despite the recent correction a higher S&amp;P could bring us our 2.0% inflation rate.

Wednesday will end the 2 day meeting and we will have clear indication on which direction the Fed chooses to go, but my speculation is on 4 rate hikes this year. I am long the Dollar Index this week.

personalfinance,What to do with 50k? Invest? Hold on to?,"Hi guys,

Opening this up again about a month later as I didn't get many responses in my previous thread.

Recently sold my home (was very tough decision, especially considering how hot the LA market is......but long story short, had a fair amount of debt with super high interest rates, totaling about 80k,  I could barely afford to pay minimum payments on, and my personal loan options to consolidate all of this were around 11-15%.....so this was the best option. also, not married). After paying everything off and now being 100% debt free for the first time in life, I have about 70k left. I'm wondering how best to either hold onto it/invest. Keep in mind, I already have a 401k with about 40k in it and a 6% company match, so feel I'm safe there with my age (31). I leaning toward putting 50k of it into an investment account, but I feel there's a significant chance I may want to buy a home again within the next 5 years if I decide to start a family. 

Any recommended, easy to manage index fund mix with low/marginal risk, that gives me decent exposure (international funds not a must), and looking at, on average, 5-10% returns a year? Or, should I be safe and just not invest at all......simply plop it in a CD or something.  If it helps, my salary is 145k a year.",finance
personalfinance,What to do with inheritance. Please help!,"So my dad has just passed away and in these early days im trying to get a plan together about what to do with the things ive inherited, ive previously done a post about this and was asked to give more data to allow people to help hopefully the following is enough.

This is in Australia FYI

One house which im living in worth around 1mil last time it was evaluated the current market in the area this house is located is still going strong due to the close proximity to the city as well as being a little bit country. The house itself is modernish and I was planning to maybe live in it into the future tho this might change depending on what advice I get.

 

Mortgage on this house is currently $300k

A second house with no mortgage pretty far away from my current job so no possible way to move into this house it was bought before 1986 so it wouldn’t have any capital gains tax if I did sell it.

Its in an area which isn’t too pricy and is a bit of an older house could go for anywhere between $300k and $400k tho it hasn’t been appraised in many years so this is all speculation.

He also had a number of cars and motor bikes all together worth around 46k if I sold them immediately which is what I plan to do.

Money inherited is around 20k tho this is probably have to cover his expenses funeral mortgage payments rates etc over the next 3 months while probate period is going through.

 

Im 27 with a 30k car payments and a 6k credit card maxed out tho my own personal finance was in order before this event

 

I just really need any advice I can get to put my mind a little bit at ease over the next few months as im currently not in the state to completely think all this through myself.

 Also to add my super funds at 40k no idea on interest rates when it comes to the mortgage as I can't access that information yet but the monthly payments seem like their around $1500 a month. And I need around 50k to live on per year but my current job covers that as I said my own personal finances where in order

personalfinance,Roth IRA as a long term savings account,"Is there any downside to using a Roth IRA as a sortof long term savings account that gets a pretty great interest rate over a 10+ year period?

Let's assume I am already contributing to a 401k and Traditional IRA and I have deemed that for my retirement goals, that is enough.

Now, using a mega backdoor Roth, I can convert a significant (10s of Ks) amount of money into a Roth IRA. I can withdraw any *contributions* out of that Roth IRA tax-free, any time. If you keep the money in there long enough, then the way I see it, you are earning ~6-7% interest on that money and can take it out any time (without touching the earnings) with no penalty.

I know this is susceptible to market downturns but assuming the market always goes up over a long enough period of time, then there will always be a portion of that money that is ""safe"". By that, I mean that there will always be some portion of the contributions you can eventually take out whether you are in a downturn or not because they have been in there long enough and earned enough investment income to offset losses.

Is there a downside I am not seeing to this view point? I am genuinely interested in hearing what I am missing because it definitely sounds too good to be true.",finance
Forex,Would any experienced traders (or inexperienced) share some insight please.,"Good day to all you experienced and inexperienced traders alike.. Pardon me for this extremely long post, and i thank you in advance for spending the time to read this.

Basically.. I'm really passionate about Forex, not because of getting rich. But because i just love what Forex is and the ability to be well informed and stuff. For example.. it interests me how banks work, how monetary policy affects currencies and stuff.. I love the idea of being able to predict what is going to happen to a country/currency in the coming months and i love the thought of being informed about such stuff..

I come from a country where everyday is a 9-5 office job for majority of the country, in fact, Forex seems to be non-existent here (maybe its just me), its hard to find a mentor (because i know that it is important that one must learn live trading from a mentor to see his/her perspectives), but because only a minority (if it exists) does Forex.. its extremely hard to find a mentor.. Not only that.. There are 'courses' here that charge 4000USD for a single course which im pretty sure is just basic TA and FA that can be found on Youtube.

The only thing i can teach myself is stuff that can be found online.. Mostly TA, i have spent time and time over again to practice, buying at supports, selling at resistance. Candlesticks pattern etc and never going against a trend.. I started demo trading last October and i just started live trading on January this year. In my first week, i started with a live account of 200USD and with TA alone, i made 310 USD in a week. I felt unstoppable, i felt confident and that i know Forex in and out. I figured that i could trade my lifetime relying on TA alone. The 2nd and 3rd week were all profits without a single loss, earning and earning, i grew my account from 200 to 850 in a matter of 3 weeks. Then, it went downhill.

There was a week i cant remember, where i traded USD pairs and on that week, it was a really hectic week for USD as there were alot of news revolving it. (correct me if im wrong, which i think i am, it was the week where there was Trump's testimony or something like that, and then there was Theresa May's meeting with Trump and strengthening the pound) I took quite a hit of -120 dollars in total and because i didnt keep a journal then, i started to panic. Over the next few weeks, i tried to develop new TA analysis, usage of Bollinger Bands, MACD etc.. When i had profit, i was happy and thought 'this is the analysis that i will stick to', but when i had losing trades, i went on to tweak my methods.

I think it was the ending of Feburary where i was lying on my bed and thinking, why dont i just trade like how i did on the first few weeks, since it ended in many correct trades. So i began using my method of trading in week 1-3. During that week, i had a little bit more profit than i had over the last couple of losing weeks. (my account was at 400 balance at this point in time)

However, i was confused and sceptical to trade as i was really unsure.. Everytime i look at the charts, it was already either oversold or overbought on the RSI, and on the charts, a huge trend just took place and it was nearing either support or resis. I would trade against the trend when it was nearing resis/support and i got screwed really badly.

Today, i just blew my account trading EURJPY and EURUSD sell. I entered EURJPY at 129.626 and EURUSD at 1.22624. I kept holding even when my trades were going against me because i stubbornly refused to close, believing that my analysis was right. I kept holding as i thought 'its already overbought, surely it'll retrace soon' but it didnt. Its even worst because during the first few weeks where i was confident in my trades, i wanted to do my part to be a filial son, ( i come from an average family) and i told my mom and dad that i wanted to make money for them. They invested in me 1k USD which i am close to blowing it all, its sitting at 450USD now.. all due to my ignorance.

I was disappointed, frustrated that i blew my account. It is of course naive and stupid to think thoughts like ' i should have closed earlier when my losses could have been minimized' but what if it went to profit instead?? I was stupid and ignorant and i regret it. It was today that i realize that i have to pair fundamentals with technicals, but im just berating myself because i dont know where to start learning fundamentals, or actually, Forex as a whole.. I've been using indicators, such as RSI, automated trendlines and atuomated support/resistance.. I know that plain naked chart with self drawn S/R lines are best.. but i just dont know how to do it..

I do know that i shouldn't harp on the fact that i blew my account because everyone goes through it at least once, but i cant help it, the feeling sucks.

So that brings me to the question.. Would any experienced traders out there share where they learnt Fundamentals with TA?? It will be even better if a link or a book/course could be provided alongside it. I have always wanted to learn Fundamentals but because it is so broad, i don't know where to start. The only thing i know is that high impact news on the economic calender usually affects a currency long term, like FOMC/ interest rates etc.. I just dont know where and how to start learning it... Would appreciate if i could get a little help.. Be it in recommendations of books or links/courses.

Sorry guys for this extremely lengthy post, would really appreciate it if i can get any insight at all..

Thank you guys so much..

In 2014 I joined a gym, my credit card on file expired and I never updated it because I stopped going and it slipped my mind. In 2016 I got a letter from a collection agency informing me that I owe $1222. At this time I was a poor college student. I emailed them asking how I had racked up this debt, and they advised me to call them to discuss it (I didn't, which I know is my problem but it gave me anxiety and I was broke, so I figured future me will deal with that).

Today, I am in considerably better financial circumstances. I called the agency and was told my debt is now over $1500, so I asked if they were able to maybe meet me in the middle somewhere, also I have no idea how to go about paying this debt (I wanted to know if I pay it to them or the original debtor). I was told no, it's not their problem I was unemployed, and to pay my debts (with the rudest tone imaginable).

personalfinance,Elderly father withdrew everything from a traditional IRA - omg,"Hello all - you have all been so helpful with other cases maybe someone out that there can help me out with mine. 

This year I convinced Dad to let me help him do his taxes.  I am going to take them over one day anyway, so why not start now. My elderly father, bless his heart, wanted to withdraw money from his accounts to, you know, afford life.  Instead of withdrawing it from his tax-free non-retirement vehicles, he withdrew everything from his traditional IRA (to the tune of $170K) by mistake 6 months ago.  While reviewing his 1099 DIVs, I noticed this massive withdrawal. He didn't even notice his mistake until I pointed it out to him. He's still reeling over his mistake made in 2017.

He's OK financially, he can afford the tax hit on it (OMG!!) from that withdrawal no less, however, the more I read, the more I realize that we might be able to salvage this situation. I am looking for advice because I love my dad and I'd rather see his hard earned scrimped together money stay in his pocket than go to the IRS.  
As I said, he is elderly, so his memory is not what it was, but this is what I can gather. 

1. The contributions to the traditional IRA started eons ago, and were taken directly from his paycheck.  He does not remember if it was pre-tax or post-tax.  I am looking for an old paystub to confirm. 

2. He did not declare his contributions on any 1040s. He only ever declared his wages, but not his contributions to this IRA. 

3. it was a federal money market fund that either started in 2008 or was rolled over into this vehicle in 2008.  As far as I can tell, he earned realtively little interest on it. Meaning his cost basis may be very very high. 

So my questions are, from what I can gather:

a. From when do I calculate the cost basis?  It looks as if this IRA is rolled over from something else in 2008 and as such was carrying a big starting balance, and then he continued to contribute to it. Do I count the starting balance or only what he contributed after the start of the account?

b. as I said, I do not know if the contributions were pre-or post-tax, but I thought that pre-tax deductions were a relatively recent thing.  He was working for decades. Could this be a hint?  Because it would be good if they were post-tax contributions, right?

c. Are there any other details/questions I should be asking!? HALP.

Thank you so much in advance.  I really want to turn his frown upside down.

- 10,800 @ 5.88%

- 10,500 @ 5.63%

- 27,000 @ 4.36%

I have 3 Credit Cards I use liberally and completely paid off twice a month.


I have a 2007 Trailblazer in ""immaculate"" condition completely paid off.


And my bank account should be sitting at 8-9,000 at graduation.


My Idea/Plan is to move up to Alaska and move in with a co-worker until I have time on my own to look around and find an apartment I like and fits in my budget (&lt;1,300/mo). Playing around with a Debt Avalanche Payment Excel Calculator ensuring minimum payments are met and then additional payments are made on the highest interest rates, it seems to me that I could have all loans paid off in 3 years.

So far this plan sounds pretty solid to me. (Correct me if I am wrong)

Idea is to buy a Duplex/Triplex/Quadplex and live in one while renting out the others until I felt comfortable purchasing another and doing the same until it got to the point where I would need a management company. I still need to do a lot of research on this and it wouldn't be until my student loans are paid off(leaving 3400 possibly for housing), but I figured thinking about it early would prepare me better for when I take the big bite and buy. Are there books or in depth forums on starting rental/real estate property?",finance

personalfinance,About to graduate with 100k in debt,"I'm here because I think its about time I enter the real world before I enter the real world.  I'm about to graduate with an aerospace engineering degree from an accredited public university this May.  My family is in one of those situations where I could not get any aid to pay for my degree. I am in about 100K worth of student loan debt.  Roughly 70k is from sallie mae, the one I'm worried about, and 30k are from the federal direct loan program.  The sallie mae is at a pretty reasonable 10% interest /s.  My parents thankfully have been paying the interest as I have been in school, there is about 7k left on the interest in total.  I want to know what my best course of action is.  I do not have a job set up yet, my priority is graduating right now and that is taking literally all of my time and energy at the moment.  I'm both worried about getting a job, but assured simultaneously because I have a very marketable degree and skill set.  The payments will start kicking in by Christmas, so I am trying to make a plan now to execute it for when the time comes.  I know it was stupid to get a loan for this much money at this age, but I wasn't emotionally prepared to make such a huge decision when I was 17 years old and signed the papers.  I'm beyond the depression and the anxiety this has caused me for years; when an animal gets backed into a cave there is a point when it realizes the only thing it can do is push forward even if a small step at a time.  I have always been interested in investing and saving, so my question is, do I completely put these wishes aside and pay off as much as I can as fast as I can? I always try to have some sort of emergency fund, but I'm scared I won't be able to have that luxury until I've paid this thing off.  And the thing that worries me the most is that my parents and my uncle are my cosigners for the sallie maes, I want to do everything in my power to at least get them out of this, too.

I have been trying to resolve a situation where Dell Perkins federal loan has gone to collections.  Original amount was $1200.  With interest and late fees etc.. the collection agency is telling me I need to pay $3300.  I emailed them last week with the intent of settling, offered $1200 as a starting point in negotiations, received the following response:
 ""I fully understand this is a dated balance. Yes, the original amount was $1,200, but under the Promissory note you signed, you agreed to pay any interest, default fees and late fees that may be assessed. Also under Federal guidelines, the Department of Education can not entertain any type of settlement. We can certainly take the $1,200.00 as a down payment, but the remaining amount will still be due. Keep in mind it is still accruing interest at 5.00% which affects not only the current interest amount but also the default fee. Please let me know your intent to resolve this""
Do I have any options here or do I have to pay the full $3300?  Tried contacting school and they told me I had to deal with collection agency.  Is it true that Dept. of Education won't settle a debt?  This loan has never shown up on my credit report, doesn't seem to be affecting credit at all which surprises me.

The system: I believe it's 27 325kw panels. 8.775kw system that's supposed to produce 11,600mw.

The concerns: 

1. Financing this system over 20 years will end up costing me 57k.

2. Srecs might be coming to an end as new jersey is already about to hit its caps for them this year. New legislation is being worked on but the future of these credits is in the air. Without them, I don't see how solar is worth it at all.

3. My estimated monthly current electric bill is ~$150. My loan payments would be $170 plus 18 for the remaining electricity. Right now srecs (11) of them would cover me but not if they disappear or drop significantly.

In February I got a raise to 45K. I was able to make ends meet with the 40K salary, so I’m thinking that most of the raise can go to my retirement (while also saving some aside for fun things).

personalfinance,Extra money: Roth or Mortgage overpayment,"Quick background: My wife and I (both 27) are fortunate to have some side money coming in as well as fairly good salaries (147,000 total + about 13K pre-tax self employment money).  

We have no interest bearing debt other than our mortgage.  Our interest rate on the mortgage is 3.75 but we pay PMI of about 180 per month.

We have an established emergency fund that would cover 6 months if needed. 

We both contribute 15% to our employer provided retirement programs (401k and she has a pension that she contributes to as well)

Question: Should we dump our extra money into aggressively overpaying the mortgage to work toward eliminating PMI or try to max out a Roth?

personalfinance,(US) First time homebuyers with a potential move in date of September 1. Current landlord wants to sell our rental before then.,"Hey guys, not sure if this is the best place for this but I feel I'll get the best advice here. 

My wife and I have been pre-qualified for a new build in a great location with a great school district and all kinds of new retail/restaurants being built. With all the options we want, we'll be building for just shy of $200k. The builder offered us a quality lot for half off the premium and is giving us $6k towards our closing costs. We've been pre-approved for an FHA 30 year with 3.5% down and a 4.75% interest rate. We've got about a third of our down payment already (we weren't exactly planning to buy this soon, but the market is hot in our area with inventory being low, rates going up and average sales price continuing to go up). We shouldn't have any issue meeting our down payment requirement but we've got a bit of a snafu before we move.

Our current landlord is the owner of our rental, a nicely upgraded 2004 build probably worth $175k in a great neighborhood. I work in real estate, and my realtor agrees with us that it'll likely sell within a month as it's well under the median sales price in our city of $207k. 

Our landlord is willing to let us break our lease through October, as long as she can sell the house. Right now, we've discussed that we'll put it on the market come May 1st and expect it to sell within the month. Our agreement is that we have at least 30 days to coordinate temporary housing and move out while the buyer closes. 

Our initial opportunity was to move into her parents home, a nice 5 bed 3 bath near our new home build site. Her parents are living elsewhere until winter, so it could work. However, her parents dogs would not get along with our dog and cat. So our best bet now is to find an apartment with either enough space to store all our furniture, or a cheaper apartment and rent out a storage unit for our stuff. Our best bet now is an apartment for $750 a month and then rent a storage unit for $150. We'd be saving $388 a month compared to our current rental rate of $1,288. 

The issue with an apartment is the rates change based on term and they need a 60 day notice of vacancy. Add in the inconvenience of a dog with no fenced yard and now we're hoping a house is available on a month to month basis within a reasonable rental rate. 

The question here, is there anything we should be looking into? Any programs we may not be aware of or suggestions to help us find temporary housing while we wait for our house to be built? All this has been a bit stressful and we'd like to have some certainty to ground us. Thanks all",finance

personalfinance,"[Debt] Fined for tax screw-up of 2014. Was approved payment plan, met payments on time, then received letter to pay full remaining balance 60 days?","Looking for any advice as well as input on the situation:

Fined $4,000 in tax penalties that I was notified in October 2017, but only saw the following reminder letter November 2017, stating total owed with listed tax corrections due by 12/30/2017 or agree to a payment plan.

I had gone in and logged into my account per the letter, crunched numbers of how much I had, how much I make, bills I pay monthly, and also looked at the interest rate of the selected payment plans which were intervals of 6 months up to a maximum of 36 months.

 Found the lowest interest rate, for whatever reason, was both 6 month and 24 month. Picked the 24 month, then I was prompted to make a down payment of my choice, which would then calculate the monthly payments per the months I selected. I chose $800 for the down payment with monthly payments calculated by plan at $137/month of the payment plan agreement.

Initial 800 + same month payment of $137 knocked off about 1/4. Received letter following week showing approved plan and listing the amount owed each month through the entire plan. The same fine print stating I'm required to pay at least the full agreed amount by the 28th of each month (set mine for 26th of each month). Monthly payments made on time automatically per the listed dates November, December, and January.

Then January 29th received a letter created on January 27th that was another certified letter from Department of Revenue ""Notice of Intent to Offset Federal Government Payments"" stating both the original amount of the fine/ claim (the $4k), what I had paid off at that time ($1,379.00), what was remaining ($2557.68), then stated I had 2 options to either submit the total by 03/31/18 or provide proof that all/part of the tax isn't owed (I do owe it).

So what the hell was with my picking and paying the payment agreement plans from the first certified letter, followed by confirmation + listed schedule of each month I'd owe for the next 24 months, then followed by this letter including what I had paid off, now telling me I have to pay the entire value??

It's a rough chunk, but I'm able to do it, but don't understand why this happened. I didn't dispute but agreed I owed after going through the numbers myself, followed the options provided, didn't miss any of the payments per the agreements, then this letter came basically acknowledging what I paid, but now basically saying ""ok we're not having do the payment plan from our offered options in the previous letter that was approved and met and telling you pay the entire balance by listed date"".",finance

personalfinance,Limiting the tax liability from a short sale and the accompanying 1099-C,"(This post is focused mainly on questions about filing taxes for 2017, so please let me know if it's better served to post in /r/tax or elsewhere)

Quick background: My wife and I sold our first home via short sale in mid-2017. Early this year, the lender sent a 1099-C for around $68k, which I knew was going to happen, but was still quite shocking to see in front of my face. Over the last few years, we've averaged a combined federal and state tax return of about $6500, but now we're looking at owing a combined $18k, which is quite a swing! My estimates of what we owe are based on inputting all the numbers into TurboTax, which is what I usually do to file.

However, this situation is certainly different than years past, so I think I need professional help, and that's why I'm posting the question here. I'm not sure WHAT kind of help I actually need. I think my situation goes a little beyond traditional tax prep services. So, should I be looking for a ""tax adviser"" or a ""tax attorney"" or something else?

Here's why I think this situation is complicated:
- During the negotiations for the short sale, I had to agree to pay $20k in cash ($6k up front, and $14k via a 5-year promissory note to the lender). The $6k up front was paid at closing, and is recorded in the HUD-1, but TurboTax never gave me a place to enter those funds, which I think would help to lessen the tax burden. Also, I have made six monthly payments towards the promissory note, but did not receive any accounting forms from the lender for those monies.
- Up until Dec 31st 2016, thanks to the Mortgage Debt Relief Act, forgiven mortgage debt was temporarily NOT treated as taxable income. Unfortunately, Congress did not authorize it's extension for the 2017 calendar. However, the interpretations that I've read about the law say that I may still be eligible to wave my tax liability on this forgiven debt if there was an agreement in place before the end of 2016. I haven't been able to determine what constitutes an agreement in relation to this legislation. We originally listed the home in mid-2016, and very quickly accepted an offer, but were stuck in long negotiations with the lender. We received a conditional approval before 2016 ended, but didn't have an actual contract in place until 2017, and it was with a different buyer after the first fell through. Point being, I'm just not sure how to interpret our situation.
- Assuming that I cannot lessen the tax burden, I may need to negotiation with the IRS on a payment plan.

In short, I will need professional help calculating my actual tax burden with respect to a couple of specific IRS rules regarding short sales/real estate, and possibly negotiating a payment plan. Who should I be looking to hire, and what's a reasonable cost for the services?


PS: If anyone feels like doing me a solid and lobbying their Congressional representatives for a retroactive extension of the Mortgage Debt Relief Act covering the 2017 tax year, that'd be very nice of you :)",finance

I currently live in Boston and am making 45k/year with my loans on graduated repayment just so I can afford them. I have already refinanced the private ones to a lower interest rate.

The art style and environmental objects look almost identical to Torchlight, a 10 year old game that runs great on my 10 year old laptop. The islands are tiny and have minimal variation.

Gameplay Loop

It's a FedEx game, but not for better gear to kill bigger and badder enemies. You only get cosmetic upgrades and they are ridiculously expensive. A chicken fetch quest yields 500 gold. A decent hat costs tens of thousands of gold. I kept expecting a different mechanic to arise, new enemies, but sadly the only variation was ""go kill this skeleton boss"" or ""go dig up a treasure chest which we have marked precisely on your map."" Appalling.

The Sailing

Probably the best part of the game, as you can't open a map while sailing so a crewmate needs to guide you from belowdeck via voicechat. Some will find this infuriating, but making basic navigation a challenge keeps the sailing authentic. If you hit something, you have to bail water and patch holes but this gets boring pretty quickly, so you'll want to avoid crashes. You can change the angle of the sails for higher efficiency, and you need a good crew to sail properly. Many will find this utterly boring, but it is simply not a high paced game. It defines ""chill game."" Well done Rare, I say - at least they did one thing right.

Sandbox Play and PvP

I played for 8 hours with a couple longtime Xbox Live friends. We were ready for anything. We found nothing but barren seas - good thing we had grog. We love sandbox games, but there was so little in the sandbox our creativity was limited. We found an extra cage and kept a pet chicken named Eddy in it. The most exciting thing to happen in the first 5 hours was Eddy falling off the bow and me diving in after him. Finally, after 6-7 hours of super basic, simple fetch quests and exploring caves only to find nothing, we see another vessel. Immediately we decide to attack, if just to break the monotony. We hunt down the smaller caravan and begin firing, and a cat and mouse battle ensues which at times felt like a true historical naval battle, with the smaller ship outmanuevering us and the tension rising and falling with each volley of canonballs. This went on for over 30minutes, mostly due to inexperience and the difficulty of getting enough consecutive Canon strikes to sink the enemy before they could bail and patch the ship to full health. At one point, our ships touched, and I jumped down onto the decks of the smaller ship, only to be greeted by a cutlass and promptly killed. A cool moment, to be sure.

Amazing Moment / SPOILER ALERT

Finally, something actually amazing happened. During the height of this tense naval battle, off the starboard side I see a giant tentacle rise up. ""IT'S THE KRAKEN!!!"" Our ship was seized and while my crewmates fought valiantly, they were picked up and tossed into the sea like breadcrumbs. Our ship was pulled under, and we all died. The end.

CONCLUSION

Despite the epic final 45 minutes or so, I had a hard time believing that Microsoft could A) release the game with so little content and B) charge $60 for it. The game feels like it is still in beta. It feels like a tiny, inexperienced dev team made it and then added some high priced water and lighting models and a kraken. The world is small and repetitive, the quests are worse than even a budget MMO would offer, and the PvE combat is insultingly bad with only a single enemy type and extremely crude mechanics. After experiencing the very best moments the game has to offer on my first play session, I can't see any reason to go back. That's a BIG problem.

How can this be acceptable for a $60 game from a major publisher? Sadly, the answer is that people will buy it anyway, because it will be very well marketed. I expect the game to get bad reviews, but still sell very well, because that is the world we live in now. It is a sad state of affairs, and Microsoft should be ashamed to be taking part in such shenanigans. Bait &amp; Switch is really scummy, but it is also really really profitable.",technology

personalfinance,Paying off student loans on an entry-level job budget ...while living in Silicon Valley,"Hey y'all, thanks in advance for reading! I just turned 24 and I'm a few months into my first full-time, salaried job. I'm looking for advice on how to best allocate what I have to pay off my student loans as quickly as possible to pave the way for bigger goals like saving for a house later on. Soooo, here goes!

BACKGROUND

Graduated with a B.S. in Chemistry from a small liberal arts-focused university in 2016. Graduated with a M.S. in Materials Science &amp; Engineering from a top U.S. public university in 2017. 

OCCUPATION

$60,000 salary as an entry-level Staff Scientist for a Silicon Valley startup, where I started working in November 2017. No other bonuses or retirement accounts. Health insurance is available through work, but I decided to stay on my parents' coverage. 

ASSETS

$2200 in checking, $17,000 in savings with a credit score of about 770 and no credit card debt. I drive a 12+ year-old pickup truck gifted to me by my dad that's paid off. I'm not looking to buy a new car anytime soon. 

Maybe it's worth noting that I also have a little over $15,000 in 30-year treasury savings bonds inherited from my grandmother. None of them are mature yet, though: the oldest ones are around 10 years away, and the newest still have about 20 to go. 

DEBTS

6 federal student loans administered by Navient. Everything's enrolled in autopay for the 0.25% interest rate reduction on a 10-year repayment plan. 

Loan 1: $2685 at 6.55%

Loan 2: $6844 at 3.61%

Loan 3: $7755 at 4.41%

Loan 4: $3469 at 4.04%

Loan 5: $1321 at 4.04%

Loan 6: $14,785 at 5.06%

TOTAL: $36,858

LIFESTYLE/ MONTHLY BUDGET

$3438.70 monthly income after withholdings.

Rent: $1250

Power, water, electricity: $100

Food: $200-250

Cable: $40

Netflix: $10.99

Renter's insurance: $14.13

Cell phone (my share of a family plan): $87.66

Car insurance: $150

Student loan minimum payment: $411.16

Gas/car maintenance: $150-200

Recurring charitable donations: $100

OCD Therapy: $660

I live in an apartment with a friend/roommate. For food, I make my own lunch to bring to work, and I eat out maaaaaaybe once per week if that. The gas expense varies month-to-month depending on if I visit my folks at all who live two hours away. The charitable donations are a non-negotiable item for various reasons, sorry! As for the therapy expense, it's for treatment of moderate to severe OCD that greatly impacted my quality of life back in December and January. I chose an out-of-network mental healthcare provider that uses a therapy route that typically takes 2-6 months to complete and shows high, lasting success rates for treating OCD. 

So here's my question: besides moving out of Silicon Valley (which, trust me, is a priority in a few years), where can I be more efficient in budgeting so I can pay off my student loans quicker? Sure, I can cancel Netflix and Amazon Prime, but are there any big areas here that I'm missing? Can those un-matured bonds be used in any way if I redeem them? Or do I just need to focus on my OCD treatment to get all that off my mind and off the books? I do realize that once that's done, I'll have a lot more breathing room and options to start paying down the loans aggressively. 

Thanks for all your help!",finance
personalfinance,"Balancing loans, emergency savings, and car fund","I was going to post this on /r/financialindependence, but realized it was more geared toward this sub instead. I'm looking for some advice on how to spread my money between the three things in the title. Any opinions are welcome!

I am a recent grad in IT with about $7.5k left in student loans. No consumer debt, car loans, etc. besides the credit cards I pay in full each month. After 401k contributions, health insurance, and taxes, I bring home a bit under $4k a month. I live with my fiance in a relatively LCOL area and my portion of our spending averages to $2,400 a month.

First I'll address emergency savings. I have enough in my account to pay off what's left of my loans (a great feeling!) but obviously don't want to cut myself short on other expenses. My health insurance has a $5k deductible and $6,250 OPM, so I figured having at least that much saved is a good idea in case of a medical emergency. Adding on 3 months of expenses gets to about $13,500 for emergency savings, is this a reasonable amount or am I being overly cautious?

Once I decide on a goal for that, I'm not sure where to split my money next. I have an aversion to loans so I've paid about half of my loans off less than a year out of college, but I think I'm being too obsessive. My interest rates on the remaining loans are 4.41% and 3.51%, which I believe is fairly low for student loans?

The other thing I need to allocate my money to is savings for a new car. My car from high school is still safe, but it's basically worth nothing and I don't want to put more money into it when other repairs inevitably pop up. I will be paying in cash for a 2014 model or newer so I'm looking at around $10 to $15k. What are your thoughts on how much I should put toward the loans vs. savings for a car? Should I throw all my money at loans, split evenly between the two, or some other combination?

I am very thankful to be in the financial position I'm in, and I want to take advantage of it the best I can so my fiance and I can be financially independent at a young age. I look forward to hearing your opinions on how I should move forward with these three immediate goals. Let me know if I should clarify anything. Thanks!

Edit: Okay I'm super smart and don't know how to read sidebars apparently. I looked through the common topics page and it seems like pretty standard advice. I'd still like to hear thoughts on my specific situation though if anyone cares to comment.",finance

I think I've got everything figured out, but I know there are far smarter minds on here that can correct anything I may have missed.

Married Filing Jointly with one child
Combined income in 2018-$88,500
401K contributions-$9350
Pretax deductions-medical/dental/vision-$6450
Leaves taxable income of $72,700

$72,700 income minus $24,000 standard deduction=$48,700
Effective tax on $48,700=10% bracket(19,050)-1905+ 12% bracket(29,650)-3558 for a total tax of $5463

$5463-$2000 child credit=$3463 total tax liability

Currently trending to have ~$3700 withheld for Federal tax this year which would leave a small approximately $240 refund.

Based on reading the wealth of knowledge on this sub, I think I have everything right but please feel free to confirm or deny that I figured things in the correct sequence and have the numbers right.

personalfinance,20 y/o college student who started a business and has never filed taxes before,"I started an online business (LLC) about a month or two ago and I’m not entirely sure of what federal taxes I have to file. My situation is different from a lot of other businesses so I can’t just go to the IRS website and easily point out what forms I needs to file. I tried calling the IRS both for business and individual taxes, but they kept forwarding me back and worth and no one has given me a clear answer.

Here’s my problem. I don’t know if I need to file quarterly taxes. I read it somewhere talking about having to file quarterly taxes, but I don’t know if I need to. I have a small business with no employees. I have not made any absolute profit yet, so I can’t pay myself and the money is being put back into my business constantly. As of right now, I am considered a dependent under my parents, but I don’t know if I have to start filing as an independent because I have a business. My parents are supporting me in paying for my college and everything, and I don’t have a job. When I was on the phone with the IRS different representatives were telling me about different forms like schedule c, 1040 es, estimated tax, and business tax and no one gave me a straight forward answer. All I know is that I have to file an annual report at the time of when I opened my business next year.

This process is very new to me and I just want to make sure I am doing the right things so my business is in good standings. I would hire a tax professional, but again I’m a college student and I’m trying to grow my business and handle all the finances by myself. Any input would be appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,"Massive raise from new job, moving, and a whole slew of things.","Going to try to format this as numbers then questions to make this easier for people, sorry if this seems terse:

31 years old, single, ~$2,000 CC debt, ~$21,000 auto loan (at insane 11% interest rate, I'm ditching this almost 100%), ~$19k student loans, ~$15k retirement accounts (401(k)).  Accepted a position paying $125,000 base pay, $25,000 signing bonus, and a share grant of Amazon shares (52 shares, vesting at 5% yr1, 15% yr2, 20% each 6 months thereafter).  Additionally about to get approximately $10,000 in ~~signing~~ relocation bonuses and due approximately $5,000 in compensation from old job.  Cash on hand: $7,500.  Cash flow in expected over 60d: ~$35-40k

**Summary of questions**: 

1 - I know I have to get rid of the SUV, the interest rate I am paying is insane, should I look at a downgrade or just not purchase a car and move somewhere walkable (which I may do anyway).

2 - With a base pay of $125,000, guarenteed bonus of $25,000, and shares of Amazon, would I be able to realistically afford a ~$2,500/mo apartment that puts me in walking distance of my work, shopping, etc.  If I do opt to downgrade parking is $250/mo at the building I am looking at as ""most desirable"" for mix of amenities, location, and layout.

3 - How much does it really cost to furnish a 1br + den apartment (approx 900sqft).  I want to have some ""nice"" stuff, but honestly I care more about a comfy bed and a nice desk than insane art/etc.

4 - Can I get some insight into RSUs?  General advice seems to be sell on the day they vest because they're taxed as income and that becomes the basis cost for calculating capital gains moving forward.  I generally tend to tie most of my retirement investments to S&amp;P500 backed index funds, would obviously need a vehicle that is not a 401(k) for when these vest and I just don't know what to do with them.

5 -- I guess as a sanity check does this plan make sense to the people here:  Pay off all CC debt immediately, hold onto accounts to allow credit score to improve. Relocate myself across country via my SUV (I don't own much, it will all fit comfortably along with a relative who is co-piloting). Stay at an airBnB or extended stay america for 45 days or so while I look at apartments (I will not sign a lease sight unseen).  Rent a 1br with a 92 walkscore 5 mins from work.  Sell the SUV and rent a car on weekend trips/long hauls or otherwise buy a beater outright since I won't need to drive it 30+ miles each way to/from work anymore *I expect with mileage and condition that the car is worth $19,000 so I can realistically expect a $2,000-$3,000 upside down/eat it fee.  I'd pay that to get out of this particular vehicle.* Once the high interest debt is gone begin aggressively paying off student loans (I was thinking double payments, one ""normal"" and one 100% principal).

Here are my anticipated monthly expenses without the SUV:


Item | Expense
---|---
Rent, 1BR SLU | $2,500
Student Loans | $400
Food | $400 [Allowing for some eating out]
Electricity/Gas/Heat | $90
Internet | $80
Entertainment | $400 [Netflix, Google Play Music, Going out evenings/weekends]
Transportation | $500 [Taxis, Rental Cars, Public Transit, etc]

I am expecting to spend somewhere around $7,500 to fully furnish the apartment (soup to nuts, literally everything. I am bringing my clothes and my computer, the rest isn't worth hauling.)

I just feel like I am either missing something, or I am going to have a large amount of unallocated income.  I think my biggest mental block here is that this is literally a 2x scalar on my income today, and I am planning on dropping a bad interest loan asset that costs me $1,000/mo. (*for clarity: ~540/mo payment, 250/mo insurance {i am a new driver}, and then the rest is gas, 1/12 of estimated annual maintenance and upkeep, etc)

Thanks if anyone can help me, sorry if I am missing any good information.

*EDIT*: Thanks for the responses so far, to answer some of the common questions:

My furnishing budget is coming from ""I have no fucking idea how much this stuff costs"", I have lived with family for the last 5 years and don't have much of anything as/far as furnishings go.  Where I am now I own a bed that I am not planning on taking (it's not all that great, got it at one of those pop up mattress stores), a credenza that is falling apart, a bookshelf that is falling apart, and a hand me down ikea dresser that is also falling apart.  Basically I'm going to be buying everything (electronics, kitchenware, cookware, linens, cleaning supplies, furniture, lighting, etc.) so the $7,500 is my absolute worst case scenario.  I'm not going out and buying a $2,500 super high end bed or anything, but I may splurge on black leather couches since it's one of those ""Man I always wanted a nice leather couch"" kind of things.

My student loan debts are entirely stafford loans, no private loans at all remain.  The reason I have them on the back burner is that they are, by a big margin, my absolute lowest interest debt.  So instead of being able to snowball them I just want to attack it as a monolithic ""thing"" to chip away at.

The high transit costs are baking in a one weekend per month car rental in the $50/day range, along with taxis and such if I do drop the car.  I'm probably still way overboard but I am trying to frame things in ""What's the worst possible scenario"".

I do have an emergency fund, but it will be inadequate for my next step.  It currently would cover all the bills I am obligated to pay for staying with my family, along with my car and insurance for the next 3 months.  I'm planning on increasing it to $10,000-$12,500 which would keep an apartment in the range I am looking at over my head and running for more than 3 months, without resorting to the ramen and knock-off soda diet.

**Additional car question**: My credit history is significantly better than when I first financed my car, would it be worth exploring a refinance to a sane interest rate and shorter term, I can afford the payments it's just that I believe (and everyone here would probably agree) that I am paying too much for the credit privlidge itself.  I know it's stupid but I did get into this with the intent of ""buying credit"" so-to-speak and it _has_ worked to this point in time, but I could easily save a $3,500-$5,000 in interest over the life of the vehicle.  What if I were to pay $10,000 of it and refinance the rest at a lower rate over 48 months?  I don't want to sink my entire signing bonus into the car with the other needs I have (buying everything I need to get started, then slowly adding more ""stuff"" as I get settled in.)",finance
personalfinance,(US) Keep federal student loans in deferment or pull them out - paying either way,"I work at a university and am taking advantage of my tuition benefit and working on a second bachelors (half for fun, half for more career options).

I have about $30,000 of undergrad loans with FedLoan Servicing that are currently on an IBR.  My IBR payment is about $75 less per month than the normal payment amount.  Half are subsidized and half are unsubbed.

Since I am taking classes and enrolled half-time, my loans went into deferment.  I called FedLoan servicing to pull them out and continue repayment but they recommended that I leave them in deferment and continue making the same monthly payment, focused specifically on the unsubsidized loans to work on paying those down fast.  Their basic recommendation was ""well, if the government is going to pay the interest on your subsidized loans you might as well let them!"" 

I would potentially qualify for public service forgiveness but based on my salary and yearly increases, I likely won't get many benefits from it.

With a defaulted federal student loan there's a 9 month rehabilitation process while you make on-time payments, at the end of which it's out of default. 

FHA guidelines say that you can't have delinquent federal loans to qualify, but it's unclear whether you have to COMPLETE rehab first, or just have a signed agreement for it and started the payments again. I've seen it both ways, and the FHA site isn't specific enough.

To be clear I'm not asking about credit score or anything here, just specifically when the blanket exclusion on federal student loan debt is lifted for FHA consideration.

So the lack of privacy protections in legislation federally (that would apply to Facebook, Google, Amazon, Snapchat, telcos, cable providers etc. is all he more significant. 

With biometrics set to become much more common in their use, there will soon be even more sensitive and personal data requiring privacy safeguards.",technology

stocks,Better short maturity bond ETF?,"Right now im trying to switch to very safe investments because things are looking up for me for paying off my house and then moving with job relocation. I plan to make a cash buy on my next house by doing this. My portfolio is about 70% bonds. I am trying to find the safest bonds possible that are ETF's with short maturity, so I can continue to get all the of benefits of BOA and Merrill Lynch. (30 free trades a month, 5.25% back on gas, free atm transactions at non BOA locations, ect) as opposed to just going into a high interest savings account, which is less risk. 

Ive done the math and if I went 100% savings as opposed to the MINT ETF with my benefits Id lose out on about $30-50 a month on my credit card alone since I use it for everything. This seems to offset the small risk. Im down $35 on MINT's value when I sell due to their price dropping, it moves a penny or two a day usually. However the yields continues to increase because of interest rates. Still 20k is only netting me $30 a month. Ive started to put some into SCHZ but am not liking the slight volatility for that extra 0.75% yield I am kinda hoping this Bond has bottomed but im new to bonds and have difficulty choosing a good one. 

Right now as I continue to make the switch, Im trying to find bonds that pay out monthly with low volatility. Something better than MINT. Or maybe there is another option that is low risk where I can diversify but not be exposed to stocks. I have a small amount in VNQ which is an ETF for REITS that pays a much higher dividend, however I realized that monthly payouts are preferred to quarterly since paying off my mortgage and selling my house could be in the near future. Also the volatility could offset or even lose me money with this investment. 

What are some suggestions as I move my money into 100% low risk assets as my income will reach my goal within the next 3-6 months. SCHZ seems to be alright, but im looking for something with a better risk/reward ratio. The 20k in MINT I have just doesnt do much of anything. I could go all in and maybe move another 10k from checking so I have 60k. This still only nets $90 a month. 

Im hoping for somthing slightly more exciting, if I can even use that word, that is better than SCHZ. 

Another idea I had to spice things up was to throw like $1k into junk bonds that yield like 8%. If it failed it would delay me almost a month. Then again why not just keep that money stocks if that the idea. 

I have a lot of ideas rattling through my head and wouldnt mind some help in sorting them out. Even throwing tickers at me to investigate would be alright with me, although the more effort and explanation the better.",finance

MachineLearning,"[P] DL Model Zoo 2.0: Share, discuss, and learn about DL applied to the world's problems","Hi reddit! My background is in academic research applying deep learning to a variety of problems in engineering, healthcare, fintech, etc. I've always wished for there to be an easy way for me to a) share my machine learning approaches with other individuals / experts interested in the problem domain, and b) publish result benchmarks (AUC metrics, etc.) for more transparency on state-of-the-art. 

The best alternatives I've found are caffe model zoo and Arxiv, both of which I haven't found to easily facilitate sharing, discussion, and experimentation. I think a buffed up ""DL model zoo"", with options for serving models, publishing results, and facilitating discussion could be useful. If this existed, I'm sure I would also constantly be scrolling through to read about new DL applications on interesting problems. Ideally this could be segmented into domains, where anyone interested in the field can contribute and create valuable discussion.

Rough translation : 
&gt; Instant payment, with transfers paid within the second, should make its appearance in Belgium in November, reports Le Soir Wednesday, which stresses however that the service will not necessarily be free for customers. By November 2018, several major banks in the country will apply instant transfer. The current delay stems from the use of bank to bank transactions in a ""clearing house"" to prevent fraud. But the clearing and exchange centre chose to work in collaboration with the main Belgian banks. The system will initially only apply to transactions within the country, whereas no other euro area country uses instant transfer. ""In Belgium, we want to be pioneers in this field,"" explains Rodolphe De Pierpont, spokesman for Febelfin, the financial sector federation. ""By November 2018, several major banks in the country will be able to offer this functionality. Concerning the possible free use of the system, ""we can imagine that the instantaneous function will be proposed in package and possibly invoiced"", observes the federation.

I would not be surprised to learn that this kind of ""instant bank to bank transfer"" is extended to other countries, and also that this has to do with some cryptocurrencies being able to do the same (albeit faster and for a smaller tag price).

personalfinance,House is in foreclosure and there aren’t too many options. Any advice will help.,"Title says it all but I’ll explain a little more into detail. I live with my parents and I have been since I was born (I am now 21).

Last year around the same time, our house was going into foreclosure - and when I say our I mean my parents. My mom decided to continue not paying the monthly mortgage for some god damn reason even though we have had enough to scrape by with internet, food, gas, etc. and so when my dad was working on the yard a guy came up and gave him a paper saying that our house was in foreclosure. (This is last year in January). He confronted my mom about it and there was a whole dispute about it and we were able to get $18,000 we owed to keep the house from my grandma (moms side). Now the same thing is happening again a year later but we’re not gonna ask her mom for money and we don’t have any money saved because my dad thought that the last time we’d been through this that she’d start making the payments. But she didn’t. 

Now my dad gets ANOTHER person coming to the door saying the house is being foreclosed again. Same exact thing happened. She didn’t make ANY payments since the last time we had this issue, and we are most likely going to need another $15,000 or so to keep the house again.

My dad is now fed up with my moms money management and he’s taking over (he works a lot and hard for being 64 years old making ~$3,500 a month with the mortgage being $1100 a month). He’s gonna start a new bank account and keep track of all of the money that is spent/made by the people who live in the house (Mom, Dad, my girlfriend and I). 

His idea is to try and ask his sister and her husband - who we are fairly close to - for the ~$15,000 - that we will need to pay again, and after that selling the house and finding somewhere else to live a that’s cheaper. 

I told him that we could try and get the money we need and I can help pay back the debt we owe to my mothers sister and her family. I make roughly $2400 a month with my new job and I don’t have a problem chipping in. I also thought about moving out now with my girlfriend since she makes around $1700 a month and that roughly $4100 a month for both us would be more than enough to live on our own being young adults. Not anything great but - enough to live comfortably I feel. 

I’m really depressed at the moment about this because ever since we went over this problem last year - I thought getting this new job and being able to pay for my own shit would make all of these problems go away and that they would have that extra money that I would be using from them for house payments, electric bills, etc. but it didn’t solve anything. 

This is the house I’ve lived in all my life and I can’t fathom leaving this place unless I absolutely have to leave. I’ll do what I can to help my dad keep the house. 

Thank you in advance to anyone who can help me out. It really does mean a lot. 

Edit: I’ve read your comments and a few are confused on some things that aren’t clear. I understand because I simply don’t know. My mom has kept all of this shit a secret because I feel like she felt like all of this was just gonna go away - like the payments would just disappear and they wouldn’t take the house. I don’t even feel like I know her anymore to be honest. Came home from work and I can’t even look at her. 

As for my gf and I, she was able to research some places for us to possibly live on while I was gone at work. And we’re deciding which one would be best for us and if we can afford to live in certain places.

Thanks you so much for the replies. I know there’s not much to go off of but I think just hearing that I need to move out and needing that extra mental note that “you’re 21, make enough to live away from home, and you should just create your own way instead of staying at home.”",finance

The law school I'm attending is in state so I will be living with my parents another year or two at least.

My current salary for my full time job is 35k per year gross. When I start school I will bump down to part time where I'll be making roughly $800/month (at first at least, I will bump up hours if possible with school schedule).

Currently I drive a car that is financed at a 1.9% interest rate with $12,500 left on the loan (it was financed at a 60 month term) at a monthly payment of 390. I do not enjoy driving the car, find it very uncomfortable, and it is starting to have some problems that are not under warranty.

I am considering trading in this car for a certified pre owned car. Roughly the one I'm looking at would be financed for 60 months at a 2.9% interest rate. The only way I will actually go through with it, is if the payment is under $400 a month, similar to my current payment. 

Am I being responsible or irresponsible here? Looking for outside opinions",finance

personalfinance,What to do with my tax refund?,"Hi all,


I’ve come to a decision point with what to do with the refund from my tax returns. A little backstory:


I’ve received a federal refund of $810, with an expected state refund of $137, so ~$950 (I plan on adjusting my withholding next time to dump these numbers down a bit). I currently have a personal unsecured loan with a balance of ~$1,070 with an interest rate of 13.99%. I make weekly payments of $32. It’s a 12 month loan. I currently have ~$900 in an emergency fund (still building it, first job out of college). I would like to keep one month of expenses in my bank savings for fast access and then put another 5 months in a high yield savings account like Marcus or Ally.


So, my decision points are:


A)	Pay off the balance of the personal loan with a one, lump sum payment. There are no fees for paying it off today. Or…


B)	Keep paying the $32 weekly payments and dump my tax refund into my emergency fund. The weekly loan payments are not hurting me financially (I’ve made every payment on time and will continue to do so). I believe the total amount of interest I would pay if I were to follow the payment schedule is roughly $106ish dollars.


I’m expecting to move sometime in June or July (in-state, have job lined up), so I’m leaning towards option B. Or should I go ahead and pay off the loan to get it off my shoulders? Thoughts?


As always, thank you all for your insight. It’s greatly appreciated!

personalfinance,"Trying to go back to school, all options exhausted?","Hello,

I have recently decided to pursue going back to school for an education degree. I currently have about a sophomores level of general education credits. I have been trying to find ways to finance going back to school but I am hitting dead ends at every turn. Have I missed something or am I really unable to go back to school?

* 29 year old male
* Live/work in NC
* Single, no dependants or claimants
* Work fulltime, annual income ~26k after tax
* One old student loan for ~2700, currently rehabilitating and loan is recently out of default
* No financial help from family
* Credit score low 600s, have made large strides in last year improving this

From what I've discovered, I make too much to qualify for any federal aid (per financial aid office at the college), I don't make nearly enough to pay out of pocket and my credit score isn't good enough for a private loan.

personalfinance,Refinancing Auto Loan,"Hey guys.. im looking for a little insight here and hoping you nice redditors can help me out. When I originally bought my car my credit wasnt as good as it is now and although I got a higher interest rate I needed the vehicle so I took it. I have been making all payments on time (on the vehicle and everything else) and my credit has gone up a good amount since. Anyway, I applied to capital one auto finance and was approved for a refi with an interest rate that is 5% lower with a shorter payoff. the payments would be the same which im comfortable with since Id be saving so much in the long run. After my approval they contacted me and told me that since my current loan isnt with a Federally Insured creditor (I had no idea when they sold me the loan) they cant actually work with them - therefor I cant refi with Cap One. 

So my question is this - does anyone have experience with this? Where else can I go to try and refinance? I was very excited and proud that my hard work of paying off debt was going to start paying off but now im feeling a bit discouraged with this roadblock. Anyway, any insight would be helpful... thank you!",finance

personalfinance,Home Mortgage: PMI vs. Higher Interest Rate,"We are in the process of purchasing a new house (our 2nd).  The first house was  a starter home that we have quickly outgrown.  

Our mortgage guy gave us a few different quotes for mortgage showing us the numbers for 5, 10, and 15% down.  We decided on 10% because it left us enough cash to handle the remodels and get situated in to our new home comfortably.  I asked why the quote for 10% did not include PMI and he stated that the PMI was factored into the rate rather than paying a monthly premium which comes out better long term.  I verified the math using an amortization calculator and the effective rate of paying our mortgage with a PMI of .5% and an interest rate of 4.375% vs. paying 4.5% for the life of the loan is 4.84% and 4.5% respectively.  The numbers get closer together when factoring in appreciation but the higher interest rate works out in the end up to 1%.  Also, PMI usually doesn't go away early due to appreciation and instead is linked to the original value of house at purchase.

This is fine and dandy and I understand we would be paying less overall if we just put 20% down but the house needs work that we can get done immediately by paying 10% instead of waiting a months or years to get it all complete.  

My question is, assuming rates are the same (or lower), could I refinance to get the lower conventional rate and at what point could I do this?",finance

personalfinance,Can you check my math? Buying my second house.,"Good afternoon PF, I am not the best with formatting here, so I hope I do this so that it is understandable. 

&amp;nbsp;



I just recently got married and my wife and I are looking to buy a forever home. I bought a house before we were married for myself, so that house is currently being sold while we look. 

&amp;nbsp;

**The information you need:**

&amp;nbsp;

* Combined TAKE HOME salary of 83,229.60 a year or $6,935.80 a month. 
* Current monthly expenses(Not including current mortgage and housing bills; electricity, cable water etc as we are only going to own one home) $1,968.14 a month. This number includes everything from gas/food/cars/student loans down to something as trivial as Netflix for cost. 
* We have about $25,000 in student loan debt between the both of us, $15,000 in car loans and no other debt.
* Left over every month: $4,967.66, this pays for random eat outs and keeps adding to our savings
* Cash in bank currently: $40,000
* Current equity on home we are selling: $15,000

&amp;nbsp;

We gave ourselves a budget of 300-400,000 for a house. aiming to go ideally for 350,000. We live in New England were property taxes and houses do not come cheap for what you get. 

&amp;nbsp;

We found a house that we are in love with for 400,000. Some important information about this house

&amp;nbsp;

* Property Taxes are $8,500 a year
* Estimated insurance a year $2,000
* Doing 5% down conventional loan with no PMI(Yes there is a thing). 
* Interest rate in the mid 4's. 
* 4 bed, 3 bath, 2,500 sq ft on a culde sac in a top town in the state

&amp;nbsp;

We are estimating our mortgage is going to be including taxes and insurance; $2,850 a month and estimating housing utilities; cable, electricity, heat, water will be $500 a month for a total spend of $3,350 for the house. 

&amp;nbsp;

Closing costs including Downpayment look to be at roughly $30,000(5% down + 10kish in closing costs). This will essentially leave us with +/- 10,000 in the bank and whatever we make on our current house sale to add to that number. 

&amp;nbsp;

All said and done, we should have, including every bill, a total monthly expense of $5,318, leaving us $1600 a month left over to go into savings and eventually some fun money once the emergency fun gets built up. 

&amp;nbsp;

I want to make sure I am making proper assumptions for the house and if I am not missing something. A quick note, I am expected to be promoted within the next 3-4 months and that will bump our take home to $140,000+ a year. 

&amp;nbsp;

Thanks again for reading this and I will do my best to answer all questions!

personalfinance,"Buying a vehicle with loan, but loan won't post until after sale?","Hi, I'm shopping for a used motorcycle in the $6-7k range. I secured a loan from DCU and was told I qualify for their best interest rates thanks to excellent credit.

And then they will deposit the loan amount into my account... But how can I pay the seller if I do not first have the funds in my account?

Does anyone have experience with this?

I guess another possible scenario is for me to pay the seller directly and then reimburse my account with the CU loan. I have just over $10k in my account.

Policy makers continued to project a total of three increases this year

EDIT:

The Fed kept interest rates near zero for seven years after the financial crisis. It began slowly raising rates in December 2015. The Fed has now raised rates six times since the crisis-era lows.

Full article from Bloomberg:

Federal Reserve officials, meeting for the first time under Chairman Jerome Powell, raised the benchmark lending rate a quarter-point and forecast a steeper path of hikes in 2019 and 2020, citing an improving economic outlook. Policy makers continued to project a total of three increases this year.

“The economic outlook has strengthened in recent months,” the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee said in a statement Wednesday in Washington. Officials repeated previous language that they anticipate “further gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy.”

The upward revision in their rate path suggests Fed officials are looking through soft first-quarter economic reports and expect a lift this year and next from tax cuts passed by Republicans in December. Financial conditions have tightened since late January as investors look for signs that the central bank might raise rates at a faster pace, while forecasters predict stronger U.S. growth and tight labor markets.

The vote to lift the federal funds rate target range to 1.5 percent to 1.75 percent was a unanimous 8-0.

The latest set of quarterly forecasts forecasts showed that policy makers were divided over the outlook for the benchmark interest rate in 2018. Seven officials projected at least four quarter-point hikes would be appropriate this year, while eight expected three or fewer increases to be warranted.

In the forecasts, U.S. central bankers projected a median federal funds rate of 2.9 percent by the end of 2019, implying three rate increases next year, compared with two 2019 moves seen in the last round of forecasts in December. They saw rates at 3.4 percent in 2020, up from 3.1 percent in December, according to the median estimate.

Inflation Pickup
In another change to the statement, the Fed said inflation on an annual basis is “expected to move up in coming months,” after saying “move up this year” in the January statement. Price gains are still expected to stabilize around the Fed’s 2 percent target over the medium term, the FOMC said.


The central bank’s preferred price gauge rose 1.7 percent in the 12 months through January and officials projected it to rise to 2 percent in 2019 and hit 2.1 percent the following year, the latest estimates showed. The estimates for inflation excluding food and energy, which officials see as a better way to gauge underlying price trends, rose to 2.1 percent in 2019 and 2020 from 2 percent seen in December.

“Job gains have been strong in recent months, and the unemployment rate has stayed low,” the FOMC said. The statement said that household spending and business investment “have moderated” from strong fourth-quarter readings.

The statement also repeated previous language that “near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced.”

Powell will hold his first post-FOMC press conference at 2:30 p.m. local time.

Supply, Demand
The Fed’s goal is to keep supply and demand in balance in the economy amid a tight labor market, without lifting borrowing costs so quickly that the economy stalls.

Officials have had to factor in the impact of fiscal stimulus signed by President Donald Trump since their previous projections.

The median estimate for economic growth this year rose to 2.7 percent from 2.5 percent in December, signaling confidence in U.S. consumers despite recent weak readings on retail sales that have pushed down tracking estimates of first-quarter activity. The 2019 estimate rose to 2.4 percent from 2.1 percent.

The committee’s forecast for the long-run sustainable growth rate of the economy was unchanged at 1.8 percent, suggesting policy makers are still skeptical of the effect of tax cuts on the economy’s capacity for growth. The 2020 gross domestic product growth median projection was also unchanged at 2 percent.

While U.S. unemployment of 4.1 percent is the lowest since 2000, wage growth has remained moderate and inflation has been below the Fed’s target for most of the last five years.

The median projection for the long-run fed funds rate ticked up to 2.9 percent from 2.8 percent in December. The Fed had been gradually reducing its estimate of the long-run neutral fed funds rate since it began publishing its calculations in January 2012.

Estimates for the long-run sustainable unemployment rate also declined, pushing the median down to 4.5 percent from 4.6 percent seen in December.",finance

personalfinance,How do you avoid feeling hopeless?,"I’m about to turn 31 and I feel like I’ll never get ahead.  How do you all not just give up?

Before taxes I make $77K/year at my day job, plus a few thousand extra freelancing.  My wife makes $50K/year.  I have 35K in student loans and my wife owes her parents 25K from grad school.
My loans:
- 20K federal at 3.75% interest, min payment $215/month
- 8K private at 4.5%, min payment $76/month
- 3K private at 4%, min payment $92/month

I pay $215 on my federal loan and $150 on each of the private loans every month.  I pay even more on the 3K loan when I have the money to.  It feels like I’ll never pay them off.  
My wife pays her parents $100/month and they charge her 1% interest.  
I look into refinancing the highest interest loan every 6 months but nobody has been able to beat my current interest rate. 

The only way to make more money at my current job (government researcher) is to get another degree but I’m hesitant to take on more debt.  My job will not pay for another degree.  Even with the cheapest degree, I’ll rack up another 10K or so in debt.  
I could get a different job and make more, but I really love my job.  I have flexible hours, a lot of freedom, and work on projects most researchers only dream of.  

I save about $700/month, but usually once a year something comes up that costs a few months worth of savings (a big tax bill, moving, unexpected traveling, etc).  So, I’m probably saving closer to 5K/year.  My wife saves nothing - maybe 1K/year.  
5% of my salary is paid into the pension system.  I put 1% into a TDA (government doesn’t do 401K).  If I get closer to vesting (10 years) I plan to contribute more.  My wife contributes 6% of her salary to her 401K, she gets a 50% match.

We live in a small, walk up apartment, with no amenities (not even a dishwasher or washer/dryer).  I pack lunch basically every day, I make my own coffee, I don’t buy myself new clothes or gadgets unless they’re necessary for freelancing work.  The only fun expense I have is my dog - which is still cheaper than having a kid.

I know my situation is really not as bad as others I’ve read about on here, but I just feel broke and stressed all the time and can’t see a way forward without significantly downgrading my quality of life (which is already mediocre) or resigning myself to just existing like this for the rest of my life.

Aside from these recurring expenses, other stuff always comes up.  My wife had 3 grandparents die in the past year - each of those required a trip out of state which means a rental car (cheaper to take the dog with us than to board her), gas, tolls.  

We live in the highest COL area in the US.  Basic things like food are extraordinarily expensive.  We don’t eat meat or buy lots of alcohol or other expensive grocery items - it’s mostly lots of fruits, veggies, beans, and grains plus regular stuff like coffee.  I eat toast and either a hard boiled egg or almond butter and honey for breakfast every day - sometimes an apple or banana. 

edit #2: our combined take home is $6,500/month.  If it sounds low, remember that 5% of my salary goes into a pension plan (I can't cut this - it's required because of my job), I also have union dues taken out of my check (over $100/month) - again, I wish I could drop the union but I have no control over that, plus another 1% into a TDA, and we live in a heavily taxed city/state.

Long story short, I was making a minimum of $150k a year in another state and have moved back with my parents with an offer on the table making $135k a year. I have student loan debt of $169k. I had been paying this off as much as possible when I was getting paid higher. My wife also makes around the same, with about the same in student loan debt.

We did some house hunting nearby our parents and came to the realization that we cannot afford a home in Nashville, TN on one person's salary. I'm concerned about this because I want to start a family soon since we are already both 30.

For instance...if I take this job, I'll make (135,000 ÷ 12) x (0.69) = $7,762 a month.  This is after federal taxes.

$7762
  2500 (my minimum student loan payment)
    600 (my car payment)
    300 (family's phone bill consisting of 6 lines)
    200 (average bills that I took over for parents)

That leaves $4,162 left over for potential mortgage, savings, expenses, spending, etc.

A mortgage where we live isn't going to cost us less than $2,500 - $2,800. And I hear having a baby is expensive, and my wife will most likely take a couple months off with a new baby.

The student loans make me extremely anxious because they are preventing me from being able to do what others seem to be doing at my age. And it just seems that I should be able to afford all of these things on one income because I know my income is not bad at all...

Ok, long form- so I started to transition to real estate in 2016 but got smacked hard with a divorce in 2017. I moved to a different state to land a pretty nice 9-5  that suits my Asperger's nicely. I kept the RE license as a fail safe, or if I get sick of the day job and get a good client list, make a go of it. Already landed a handful if connections here.

I received a commission from a referral fee, but since I already cut ties with Keller Williams, and it was my own house (already left the state when the ex and I agreed to sell), they put my referral fee in the closing check. The divorce covers any capital gains.

All the while I was still trying to find investors for side projects, ""business dinners"" etc. Of course I was unsuccessful in getting a deal done and recording any monies. I didn't put a lot of my free time into it. Maybe twice a month or so. 

I have receipts for meals, license fees, license renewal, transfer, required background checks and so on.

Can I write any of it off towards my schedule A? I always end up owing the fed money, and since I didn't add to my old IRA, nor adjust my withholding adequately for the salary boost, I'm sure I'll end up writing a check. I wrote off $500 of my 2016 expenses but I'm pushing it with meals etc and don't want to win an Audit.

My lease is up in January (2k to break, would come out of down payment), and I'll be taking out a 150k to 300k in debt.  The lower end mortgages would be condos with up to $300 a month HOA fee. I have good credit in the high 700's.",finance

personalfinance,"(USA) 25 y.o., $76k debt, $42k post-tax income — bankruptcy time?","Hi PF, 

Long-time lurker, first-time caller, and boy do we have a mess on our hands. I’ll spare you the story of how I got here — I wish I could regale you with stories of exotic vacations, brushes with the rich and famous, or even an honest failed-business attempt, but none of that happened. I just lived above my means for a few years in a row and have really screwed up. Here are the numbers:

CREDIT SCORES

* FICO = 699
* TU/Equifax = 611


ASSETS ($87,393)

* Checking/Savings = $200
* Coinbase = $3,300
* Roth IRA = $51,201
* 401(a) = $8,724
* 403(b) = $16,859
* Car = $6,000


LIABILITIES (-$75,888)

* Credit Card #1 = -$1,700 (charge card)
* Credit Card #2 = -$12,179 (19.49%)
* Credit Card #3 = -$4,031 (19.24%)
* Credit Card #4 = -$5,304 (9.25%)
* Credit Card #5 = -$3,891 (15.49%)
* Credit Card #6 = -$12,031 (17.24%)
* Credit Card #7 = -$4,463 (17.24%)
* Credit Card #8 = -$2,327 (15.24%)
* Upstart Consolidation Loan #1 = -$1,439 (8.85%)
* Upstart Consolidation Loan #2 = -$11,483 (13.40%)
* Navient Student Loan #1 = -$2,376.77 (3.61%)
* Navient Student Loan #2 = -$3,018.94 (3.61%)
* Private/Personal Loan, (0% APR, for car) = -$3,990
* Private/Personal Loan, (0% APR, for student loans) = -$7,650

INCOME

* Salary, post-tax = $3500

EXPENSES

* Rent + Utilities = $1000 (Chicago, living with roommate)
* Car + Renters Insurance = $80
* Gym = $65
* Digital services = $100 (DropBox, iCloud, Adobe Creative Cloud, etc.)
* Food (variable) = $500


Obviously, I’m pretty f#$%ed, and it’s 100% my doing. Making minimum payments, I’m basically short $1,500 for the next few months before upstart loan #1 drops off in June, then I’m $1000 short. I’m in survival mode. I have never ever missed a payment, have no derogatory marks, and would *really* like to keep it that way. I called Credit.org and they walked me through their process and told me they couldn’t set me up with DMP because I wouldn’t be able to afford it. 

I’m terrified of ruining my credit and of filing for bankruptcy, but it looks like bankruptcy might not even be an option in this situation. I have no idea if it’s possible to liquidate retirement accounts to escape debt, but with everything altogether, my net worth is amazingly still in the black. What do you think?

**TL:DR** - I’m forecasting a $1,500 monthly deficit while making minimum payments on all this debt. If you were ever so reckless as to be in this situation, what would you do?

personalfinance,Muni Money Market vs High Yield Savings vs Treasury Bills as Interest Rates Rise?,"I have $30k that I would like to leave fairly liquid.  It is currently in a Vanguard Municipal Money Market Fund (SEC yield of 1.10% with expense ratio of 0.15%). This was recommended to me as tax-free growth vs a high yield savings account.

I used to keep that amount in as American Express High Yield Savings at 1.45% currently and I anticipate rates will rise with today's federal rate hike.

At the 35% Federal tax rate, the Muni Money Market and AmEx are basically equal at an effective rate of 0.95% (correct me if I'm wrong with my math).

I'm not sure what happens to the Muni Money Market yield and to Treasury Bills as interest rates rise.

Would you expect the money market funds to go up with interest rate hikes or is it better to move the $30k into a high yield savings account OR buy 13 week treasury bills (currently at 1.78%) and renew them every 3 months?

Any other suggestions for holding liquid assets as rates rise for someone in a higher tax bracket?

He doesn’t have an official job, he works under the table doing tattoos for friends, also does side jobs (which pays him around 300 biweekly) and is a full time student for a bachelor degree in Criminal Justice. He has had only one credit card for almost a year now with decent credit score, 670. He said he would use his father as the co-signer because he has 740  credit score, but his father doesn’t have a social security so I’m not sure how that would work at a 2nd hand lot. 

Also, since he works under the table, wouldn’t it show his income being zero? 

I want to know if it’s in his best interest to just wait until he either gets a real job and/or finishes school? I’m scared that the interest rate will be high due to him not working, barely a year with his one credit card line, and his father not having a social security, but I honestly don’t know anything about finance and autos, and Jay is being stubborn so I would like outside advice.

personalfinance,"About to graduate from university next month with around $23.3k in student loans. Ready as hell to take them on and eliminate them as soon as I can, just need advice/insight.","First of all, thank you for taking the time to read this. Second of all, I'm not sure if this type of post is allowed or best suited for here. I read the rules just to make sure and there wasn't anything posted in regards to this but if so, could someone please link me to the appropriate subreddit for this. Anyways, thank you!

I'm about to graduate from university with a degree in French (yes, I know, French, why are you doing this?). Well, to make it short, I love French and I'm going to immigrate/in the process of immigrating to Québec/Canada from the United States.

Anyways, so yes, I have around $23.5k USD in student loans that I'd like to pay off as soon as I can. I don't have any other debts (thank goodness), and from the time I was 18 until now I've been disciplined at keeping my expenditures low. In retrospect, I should've worked in the summer and made money to help pay off my loans but I was young and naïve. I never have had credit card debt carried over from one cycle to another; I've always paid my card off in full every month. I've been using YNAB religiously since I was 19. I walk around with credit/debit cards in my wallet to deter me from purchasing anything. I make all of my own foods and pack foods for moments when I know I'll be weak. I've read Dave Ramsey's book and *fell in love with it*. This is just to illustrate the kind of person I am in terms of the financial side of my life. 

I have two unsubsidized loans:

* $1,716.47 @ 4.29% interest rate
* $1,836.69 @ 4.66% interest rate

and five subsidized loans:

* $3,500 @ 3.86% interest rate
* $4,500 @ 4.66% interest rate
* $5,216 @ 4.29% interest rate 
* $2,736 @ 3.76% interest rate
* $1,230 @ 4.45% interest rate

and a Federal Perkins Loan:

* $2,250 @ 5.00% interest rate

Anyways, what should I begin doing? The first thing that I think of is: of course, finding a job when I graduate, continuing to live below my means, reading books on money management, etc. However, I know that there are probably so many things that I'm not thinking about, and here I am trying to reach out to the community to see if there's any advice/insight that I can acquire from here.

**TL;DR** About to graduate, have around $23.5k in debt, want to know the best way to get rid of this.

I don't *have* to make payments on my student loans until 2023, but they accrue interest every day. I got ~$2300 back from my federal+state tax refund.

1) Should I put that money into my 2018 IRA so that monthly payments to reach $5500 are less, or should I put the money toward paying my loans off faster?

2) Is it worth it to pursue a more aggressive loan payment plan or even pay off the smallest one (~$3000 @ 3.86%) outright with my checking account (~$4000). I think the second choice is rash, but it's tempting because I have the money to get rid of that debt.

stocks,ScottyStellar's Insider Track- Week 2 Update,"Happy Interest Rate Hike Day to all, and welcome to the second weekly update on the Insider Track Portfolio.

It was a rough week for the market in general, as well as for the Insider Track stocks. The VTI from the time of last Wednesday's post was down 1.19%, beating the Insider Track which was down 1.52% or $39.45.

The good news is that we are still profitable, and still beating the VTI, giving back only $8.74- that's the amount we lost this week compared to if we had been in the VTI, so overall a small loss against our benchmark, and still up **$72.03** over the benchmark, or **2.88%**

[See the results and individual stocks here!](https://imgur.com/a/nGgN8)

Notable changes this week:

**3/15: Bought CRBP**. Dozens of insider buys over past few years, with some up to the $9 range, mostly $6-$7. Targeted under $7 and purchased at $6.85. 

**3/16: Bought BRS, WAAS, BRX**. 

* BRS- Two insider buys this month between $12.5-$13, with more insider buys over last couple years up to $15-16 range.

* WAAS- Stock declining but millions of dollars of insider purchases under $16 range, purchased at $13.2.

* BRX- Purchases last year up to $21, with recent purchases this year from $15-$15.5. Purchased at $15.24

**3/17: Sold KALA, SYRS**. Both had quick runs and were up above where the insiders had purchased lately, so I took quick profits to reinvest in others.

**3/19: Sold KFS, FGP, NURO**, upon further review did not look as strong as others, sold for new options.

**3/19: Bought NMFC, MTSC, INFU**

* NMFC- Lots of purchases and some options exercised, in $13-$14.2 range, purchased at $13.3

* MTSC- Some options plays and grants in $46-$54 range, purchased at $53.49, higher in range than I'd like but given the large value of investments by insiders, may be an ok play.

* INFU- Multiple insiders purchasing stock on its way up from the $1.8 range up to $2.4 most recently, looks like stock may be on a run up and insider expecting continued growth. Would've loved to get in the 1.8 range but taking a crack at $2.45 hoping for a continued run up.

The total gain on all sold stocks, including a quick $7 loss on CRVS due to mistaking my target price and purchasing far above target, comes to $34.83. Not bad for a quick turnover on some early stocks that I didn't do enough research on.

Now that I've reached my target of 25 stocks, I hope to be a bit more stable with the purchases/sales and not trading as frequently. Going to make sure I don't repeat past mistakes, and target stocks with large amounts of insider buys, preferably multiple purchasers, and target under the price of recent purchases, potentially missing some good ones but avoiding buying above where insiders are showing confidence.

As always, happy to hear comments and any suggestions for improvements to the spreadsheet, process of stock selection, or any additional information you'd like to see included in these reports.

I’m a stupid college student and I basically maxed out my first credit card. I read in another thread that you could ask for a lower APR, but when I called my bank (USAA) they said they couldn’t offer me a lower one. 
They recommended that I apply for and transfer the balance to a lower card (the lowest card they have is apparently only 11/12% APR. 

They also mentioned I should look into a debt consolidation loan, which they said would turn my debt into a loan which would have a smaller interest rate which would be simple rather than compounded interest, to be paid over a period of 3-4 years. They also mentioned that even applying for the loan would pull my credit score down because it’s a “hard pull” whatever that means. 

Should I turn my credit card debit into a debt consolidation loan?

investing,How do rising rates affect real estate prices in supply constrained markets?,"In supply constrained markets, people get approved for mortgages and make ""bids"" on houses.

How big the ""bid"" can be is set by how much they can borrow.  How much they can borrow is set by what monthly payment they can afford.  What total loan value this constitutes for a given monthly payment is determined by the interest rate.

If someone can only afford a 3500/month payment, that translates to a price of $770k at a 3.5% interest rate, $665k at 5%, $605k at 6% and $555k at 7%.

So, one would think, in places that are supply constrained where the majority of people finance their purchases with a mortgage (upper middle class neighborhoods in places like Los Angeles), real estate prices would decrease as interest rates rise.

I graduated school in May of 2015 with a degree in Supply Chain &amp; Operations management and a degree in marketing, so business in general. All the jobs I will mention here are supply chain jobs.  I started out immediately working for a national newspaper making $37k. Was okay with all that, I was just glad to have a job out of school, and I served on the side. About 6 months later that company got bought out, so I was at risk of losing my job and rather than wait around to find out and take severance pay, I found a job in a different state and started making $59k. Awesome! I worked on the side there too, as I had over $50k in student debt and a net worth of about -$52k in January of 2016. It was great experience and I learned a lot, however I didn’t like living there and decided to move back home in September of 2016. In November of 2016 I got a job offer from the company I am at now, a very large, global well known company that is #1 in terms of market share, and has a pretty good brand reputation. For the sake of this post, we’ll call my position that I got (and the one I am in now) as ‘associate’. Everyone in my group is titled ‘analysts’ or ‘Sr. Analyst’ and their bosses are ‘managers’. My boss(es) are managers as well, although technically, everyone is above me and I help out with a ton of stuff. The analysts all own commodities and do supply chain work. That job requires (or so the posting said) 3 years of experience. So that’s why I was brought on as an associate. I started out at $55k and it was rather slow to start. I have one large project I work on for six months that is a federal regulation and I am the only person who really works on this for the most part, and a couple other projects that sort of support my group if you will. If anyone needs help with anything, I’m their go to person. From day one, my boss said that the ‘intent of my position was to give me commodity responsibility and to make me an analyst’. Fair enough. I was excited. I like the work I do and the freedom that I have at work, and honestly the experience will be huge as it’ll undoubtedly look good on a resume and give me a great deal of experience. 

Fast forward to May of 2017. I was given responsibility for one commodity as one individual who was an analyst moved onto a different role. Around that same time period I was given a second commodity just to free up some bandwidth for one individual who has a lot on his plate. In November of 2017 I was given a third commodity, again to free up bandwidth for another individual. So now I am the owner of three commodities, one of them actually being very technically and has a lot of global regulatory requirements and where I am also required to make sourcing decisions over seven figures annually. I am responsible for about $25m in spend on an annual basis. I manage a relationship with I would say 15-20 suppliers globally, and I still retain my original ‘associate’ responsibly and have also taken on other processes that other people have owned that need to be monitored on a day to day basis. So I am doing associate work, and analyst work. 

The catch here is that Glassdoor is saying that analysts at my company have a salary range of $84-89k. Sr. Analysts make over six figures. This sort of pay disparity is something I do not understand. For reference, my annual review with my boss was absolutely flawless and I ‘meet’ all expectations. There was zero criticism in my annual review. The regulatory projects I run were doing their best they’ve ever done in five years, and I did it almost entirely alone. There was zero criticism in the review. I do have goals, and those *are* to be an analyst. I have asked my boss if there is room for an actual substantial raise without a title change, and he essentially said no. I have been told for about 14 months now that I will be an analyst when a person leaves, however about seven individuals have left my department and I remain an associate to my group. One individual just left this past Friday, and I do not know if they’re hiring someone in her place or not, but I did apply for a job posting (as I was instructed by my boss) that is no longer there. 

It is just very frustrating to me that there is such a delta in pay. For the record, I wouldn’t expect to be paid even $84k, I would be happy with a smaller increase or have a salary somewhere in between my current one and that of my peers. My company hasn’t been performing the best in the last couple quarters, but the entire market we are in is in a downturn, so it’s not unexpected or Job threatening, and other individuals have been promoted or moved around. I don’t know if this warrants circumventing my boss(es) and confronting HR? Literally everyone in my group appreciates the work I do, has told me many times, and I’ve been told occasionally that I do other people’s job, not in a bad way, but that I do work that would normally fall on others. 

Anyone experience this? I just feel like I’m hitting a ceiling that honestly shouldn’t be there or like there’s always an excuse as to why I can’t have my title changed. I’d like to close with saying that I **do not** want to leave my job and have my resume look like I cannot hold a job. If I was paid what I believe to be a fairer wage, I would absolutely love my job 100%. Thanks in advance.",finance

My partner: 29 y/o, went straight from college to medical school, and graduated last year with an MD (all tuition covered) and currently working as a resident with a salary of $65k. My partner is doing very well financially, largely due to part-time work and family generosity. Has had minimal expenses, due to living in a (*very* nice) high rise condo owned by his parents for the past 8 years. This has allowed my partner to put aside over $250k in savings.

The situation: We are getting married in 5 months and have been struggling with how to handle our personal finances, particular as we are looking at moving in together and signing a lease for an apartment (can’t stay in the family owned condo). My partner is adamant about wanting to keep our finances separate, aka not paying off my loans, and also adamant that we split all living expenses. The apartment we’re considering is sightly above the budget I’ve made for myself based on my expected $60k salary (when considering a 50/50 rent split), and will require the equivalent of 3 month’s rent (security deposit, first month’s rent, last month’s rent) to secure. We both really love this apartment, however I won’t have income for another few months and right now can’t afford the security deposit, rent, etc. My partner wants me to take out additional federal loans to cover this, adding to my financial strain, and meanwhile I’m frustrated by the fact that these expenses could easily be covered by my partner’s current earnings. 

The question: Should I be taking out additional loans to split our living expenses, given the fact that we aren’t married yet and won’t be for another 5 months? In general, how should we approach our situation in terms of combining our finances? 

I’m sorry for the long background, but I’d appreciate any and all advice here!",finance
personalfinance,Emergency Fund or Pay Down Student Loans?,"What is the school of thought on saving an emergency fund prior to attacking student loan debt? 

I just got myself out of a vicious cycle of using my credit cards to make ends meet, combined with over spending. For the first time in years I have no credit card debt and no personal loans. 

I have about $40k in student loans and would like to save $10k-$12k in an emergency fund. 

I have budgeted about $1k a month - which was going to debt. 

Would it best to save $500 a month and pay an additional $500 on my student loans? Or get my emergency fund where I want and then attack student loans. 

Student loans are through Navient and the interest rate is 5.875%. 

Savings Account is through Discover @ 1.50% APY.

personalfinance,[US - Federal] Tax amendment Question. Just realized I may have filed the wrong form for 2014,"I just realized that I may have actually filed the wrong 1040 form for the year 2014 and will likely have been owed a refund but I ended up paying more that year.

 I submitted my 2014  tax return on March 25th 2015. Does that mean technically I have 4 days to file an amendment (counting 3 years from date of submission)? I know this is super last minute but I just realized this as I was about to file my 2017 tax return. 

Edit : Sorry if the question sounds vague but I basically freaked out when I realized my mistake and want to confirm whether I have just four days to correct it.

personalfinance,"$200k student loan debt and charge-off's and new jobs, oh my!","This might be quite an interesting post, so I appreciate anyone that is willing to help.

Single male, currently living with my parents, graduated (undergrad) from a top-notch school in December and have been unemployed since, but we'll get around to the employment in a bit. The following summarizes my debt:


**Student Loans:**

Sallie Mae Loans: $156,000 at a weighted-average interest rate of 10.16% ($121,000 principal, $35,000 interest; something went terribly wrong here)

**Credit Card Debt:**

* Jewelry Store: $327 (65% utilization)
* Clothing Store: $0 (recently paid off)
* PayPal Credit: $722 (does not show up on credit reports)


**Charge-Offs:**

* BoA: $1,365 (limit was $1,000, remaining balance was interest and late fees)
* Department Store: $1,163 (limit was also $1,000, remaining balance was interest and late fees)

**Closed Account:**

* Clothing Store: $774 (closed and under a $20/mo payment plan for 48 months)

**Monthly Expenses:**

* Car Lease: $230/mo
* Car Insurance: $130/mo
* Spotify/Netflix: $20/mo total
* Necessary Computer Software (freelance work-related): $33/mo

**Total Current Monthly Expenses:** $413

Luckily for me, I got a bit of a lifeline with a new (first) job. I will be making $85,500/year with an $8,000 sign-on bonus paid in the 2nd or 3rd paycheck. 

Considering this, my monthly expenses expand to the following:

* Rent: $1,600/mo
* Utilities: $200/mo
* Food: $200/mo
* Room for Other Expenses: $200/mo

**New Total Monthly Expenses:** $2,813

Very conservatively, I'm estimating I will take home roughly $70,000 after taxes, which comes to around $5,800/month. Taking my new monthly expenses into account, I'm left with roughly $3000/month toward student loans and debt payments.

Since minimum payments for my student loans amount to just about $2000/month, I am left with $1000/month and I'm not sure how to manage it. I want to eventually be able to buy a house, but my credit currently sucks (551, was 710 when I leased my car 2 years ago..) and I have a lot of things to handle to try to get back on track. 

Looking for any advice on how I should go about fixing this! I read the wiki and FAQ but as with many things, each situation is different and I would appreciate any thoughts or opinions directed right at me.",finance
personalfinance,I have student loan debt and my partner no debt at all - will her cosigning on my refinancing affect our chances of one day getting a mortgage?,"Numbers-wise I have $33,000 in student loan debt. Because of the circumstances in which I took it on, my interest rate has gone through the roof (currently at 9%). So I'm refinancing. I worked for several years, but now I've gone back to school for a graduate program, which means I have an income but it's pitiful. So nobody will lend to me on my own. My partner, which puts it lightly, as we're getting married in the summer, is willing to cosign (also not much income, but impeccable credit and zero long-term debt). What we're wondering is whether or not, for a future mortgage (maybe 5-10 years from now, within the life of my refinanced loans), it would be better for her to STILL have no debt whatsoever, as opposed to having taken on some of mine? Or is this not likely to make a difference? Thanks in advance. 

Other details, if you'd like to know them - I have an offer to refinance all $33,000 at 4.7% fixed or 3.77% variable for ten years. I've had this debt for a while, but nothing else long term. We also churn credit cards, so have several open account and everything paid off (my Experian score came back 780).",finance

personalfinance,Consolidating student loans of a whopping mountain of 100k??,"Looking for some financial advice here. 

I am currently drowning in student loan debt. Younger me really wanted to go to a private, liberal arts school that cost $30k + a year and adult me is now trying to figure out how to consolidate loans, looking for any advice on how to do so. 

I am not very business oriented (graphic designer over here), but I want to understand and figure out the best option to take. 

I currently have right under $100,000 in personal loans and $10,000 in federal loans. I have been making monthly payments on I am pretty sure a 10 year plan of $1,650 since November 2014. $80k of those personal loans are cosigned by my father. I have been trying to get my parents to consolidate these loans to get lower interest rates since most of my loans are around 7%, but they always have a reason why they didn’t get around to it. 

I have always wanted to have all of my loans in my name, but now have the motivation to do so because I got divorced last year and to put it very sophistically, got boned by my lack of a tax return with the loss of deductions. I only get the 1098-E for about $20k of my loans and want the full amount to help with deductions next year. 

I started doing research on how to consolidate my loans, and so far my main concern is that I will not be able to do it on my own, since I have the cosigner. I have been incredibly responsible with my finances and building a solid credit score so I am not worried about that aspect. I only have looked into So-Fi and see a good plan for 7 years that will help me reduce my monthly payments $1200. I am apprehensive to just pull the trigger though, not looking into other options even though I don’t know of other websites to look at. 

It’s a lot of debt and I want to make sure I am making the right move here, any advice would be appreciated thank you!",finance

personalfinance,60k in loans... help!,"Hi! I’m looking to the reddit world with some guidance to a naive post grad girl. 

Breakdown: I’m working full time as a registered nurse in New York. I began working in July of this past year. My gross bi-weekly check ranges between 3500-3800. My typical take home after taxes is about 1900-2100. 

10% of each paycheck I put towards my 403b (my hospital does not match). 

One private loan payment is 255 a month with 6.000% interest the other is 280 a month with 8.375% interest. Neither of them are fixed loans.... 

My total federal is around 225 a month all with various degrees of interest. I have no problem paying this one off. 

I am not worried about the federal. My private loans are my issue. I have no other expenses besides 130 on a monthly phone bill and about 100 or so on transportation. 

I currently have enough to pay one of the 2 private loans off in full, but that would leave me with about 10,000 in my checkings account. 

What would you do? I am 25 and live at home and don’t pay rent. Ideally I’d love to my out and I plan on going back to school for my masters hopefully next summer. My hospital pays 12,000 annually for furthering my education. So I’ll be able to tap into that. 

My question is: 
If I have enough to pay the 19k private loan from Sallie Mae in full should I pay a single private loan off all at once? Should I pay a little bit of both off? Should I put less than 10% into my 403b? I really am torn. I have a few thousand in my 403b and a little bit in a fidelity fund invested as well that I don’t touch. 

Any and all advice is appreciated :)",finance
personalfinance,"In my situation, is it smarter to get a deferment on this loan or keep paying it?","So here's where I'm at. I flunked out of school after my 2nd year (and it was a good school too) so now I have no degree and probably around 35,000 or more in student loan debt. Right now I pay 480 dollars to Sallie Mae and 280 dollars a month to the federal loan people.

I'm 22 years old and live at home so I have no other expenses except gas and a 50 dollar monthly fee to the courts until May. So that's about 850 dollars a month on all that, plus I eat out a lot and take my gf out to eat a lot. 

My income is, I use to earn 13.20 an hour with 40 hours a week, time and a half for OT which I always had a fee hours. Came out to 420 a week. Now I got a promotion that lets me earn 16.50 an hour but I only get paid every 2 weeks (stupid rule right?)

I haven't got a paycheck from that yet but I expect after tax it should be 1000 every 2 weeks.

Now, I want to save up and get independence and move out on my own. My household is toxic, not a pleasant place to build up savings account. Should I get a deferment on the Sallie Mae loans and move out in May, or save up all summer and move out in the fall to continue school somewhere else to get my degree?",finance

personalfinance,Should I keep 13.5k in a savings account or move 5.5K into a Roth IRA?,"Hi PF, 

This is my first post ever on reddit and I hope the formatting is okay. I am 23 years old. I am currently getting my master's degree and will graduate in approximately 1.5 years. I will have no student loans or other debts when I graduate. 


I do not own or have a car, but I have had my license since I was 16. I didn't need one in college and I do not need one now (or for the next 1.5 years). My siblings and I used my parents' car in high school. I really enjoy biking and hope that in the future I can keep commuting by bike as I do now, but if I need to buy a car after I graduate I will buy one that is used and 4-6K, which seems like the general advice from here. 


My tuition and living expenses for these 1.5 years are thankfully covered mostly by scholarships, a little by parents and living very frugally. One month ago I started to track my expenses in excel. I do not like that my parents are helping me because I liked paying for my own rent and food when I had the internships and not feeling like a waste of money for my parents, but they do not want me to take money out of my savings account for expenses while studying (I have the coolest and nicest parents, I worry they are too nice and too helpful though). 


From previous internships, I have 13.5K in a savings account. From this subreddit I have learned that it is not a HY savings account and I plan on switching to another bank. I have had a CC for about half a year, always pay it off on time. 


Ever since discovering this subreddit, I have become very anxious about saving for retirement. Should I move 5.5k into a Roth IRA or keep all of the 13.5k in the savings account? I know that it is important to have an emergency fund, but is 8k enough? I have already filed and submitted my taxes, and received my federal refund. If I put 5.5k in now, I would not be able to put 5.5k in for the next year (2018), but I imagine I will be able to in 2019 since I will (hopefully) have started working immediately after graduating. If I do put 5.5k into a Roth before mid-April, do I need to amend my taxes? I filed using turbo tax. I could also put 5.5k in a Roth for 2018, not 2017, if that is a better idea. 


Thank you so much for any advice, I really appreciate it.

personalfinance,Unsure how much student loan interest I can deduct after refinancing,"My husband and I made $130K in 2017 before adjustments (so the phaseout doesn't apply, making things slightly easier). He consolidated his loans years ago, and paid $541 in interest in 2017. I just finished grad school in April 2017. When I graduated I had (A) Federal Loans with Navient and (B) a loan through NY State with Firstmark Services, both from undergrad. In August of 2017 I refinanced them with Elfi. 


My 1098-E from Elfi says I paid $387 in interest. Simple. I thought I knew what to do on my taxes. But then I got 1098-E's from Navient  and Firstmark Services that say I paid them $4,898 and $2,722 in interest, respectively. This is the interest that had accrued on my loans while I was in school. Elfi paid it off when I refinanced with them, and now I will pay them interest on my new principal (which is my original principal and the interest I had accrued with the original lenders). 


The way I see it, I have four options for how much interest to deduct:

1. $928 (Husband's $541 + my $387 to Elfi)

2. $2,500 (Deduction limit for **both** individuals?)

3. $3,041 (Husband's $541 + $2,500 limit for me)

4. $8,548 (Option 1 + $4,898 to Navient + $2,722 to Firstmark, AKA *all* of the interest)


I'm pretty sure that the most we can deduct is Option 2. Before I file I want to make sure of two things:

A. The $2,500 cap is for **both** of us, it is not per person (which would allow us to go with Option 3)

B. I can count the interest paid to Navient and Firstmark as tax deductible (otherwise we would have to go with Option 1)




I like to do my own taxes every year, so I don't have a professional I can ask. Luckily I have a community like [r/personalfinance](https://reddit.com/r/personalfinance) and I'm hoping you can help me out!",finance

personalfinance,"Possibly coming into a small lump of money, and wondering which debt(s) we should pay off first..","Hello all, I’m hoping to get some advice. I’m just wondering if we (husband and I) were to come into a lump of money ($8-10K after taxes), which debt(s) we should put it toward. We are currently doing the Dave Ramsey thing, and have 2 cards paid off (well, the 2nd will be paid off next month, so I haven’t included that here). I know it’s not the most beneficial as far as getting rid of debts that have the most interest, but psychologically, it’s really helping. I was thinking the highest student loan would be the most beneficial to put the money toward, since the payment right now is so low that even after paying every month, the balance keeps getting higher due to interest, but I wanted to get more opinions. At the rate we’re going, the plan is to have everything paid off within 3.5-4 years or so (not including this chunk of money), but we definitely want to speed that up. Here is the list of our current debt as far as the balance owed, monthly payments (if that even matters), and interest rates.

personalfinance,Medical Field Job Advice?,"I am currently looking for a new job because I can't stand factory work anymore. I need to get away from my current job as soon as possible because it's too physically demanding and my boss treats me like shit. I'm certified for some medical work, but not much because I can't afford college and can't get any scholarships or financial aid. I'm certified for medical office administration, but have no experience. I have also taken a nurse aid 1 class, but never took the state test to get certifed. I've taken several classes in medical terminology, childhood health/safety/nutrition, psychology/childhood psychology, anatomy and physiology, medical legal issues, and biomedical science, but really have nothing to show for it. My dream job would be working as an NP in an emergency room setting, but that's quite a way off. What types of jobs should I apply for? I'm considering dialysis PCT, nurse aid (if I can find one with a decent pay), pharmacy tech (since I heard certification isn't required), or medical office.

personalfinance,Help with offset Taxes,"Finished college in Dec. of 2015 but I just landed a job in July in my field of study, before that I held various under the table, odd jobs. Needless to say, those jobs did not generate enough revenue for me to pay my student loans. I finally applied for debt consolidation in Dec./Jan. to finally begin paying them off. I just was informed that my entire federal tax return, around $1800 was offset by the dept. of Education. I am still waiting for my state refund of about $700. Will my state refund be offset as well?

personalfinance,Well off people with credit cards,"I was wondering why well off people use credit cards. I make 48K a year and have 3 credit cards. WF I owe $260, Alaska Airlines I owe 200, AMEX Platinum I owe 0. (Side note the $550 annual fee for the AMEX Platinum is waived for  Active Duty and has a TON of benefits and feels like a metal card.) Anyway, I have had WF since I was a Teenager because of my parents so it would bad for my credit to get rid of it. My AA I use to get miles. My AMEX I just got and I think will payoff my AA and just leave the balance at 0 and use the AMEX. I use my Cards for perks and if a big unexpected expense comes up. Have a family of 3 soon to be 4, single income, so things come up. My wife and I are good about paying stuff off fast. Anyway, I learned AMEX has an even better card that you need to get invited to and has a like a 5K a year fee plus like a 2K activation fee (or so I heard). Why do people making like 150K a year and can afford that card need a CC? If I was making that My wife and I would still live with in our means (thanks dad for nailing that into my head growing up) and we would never have to take out a car loan or anything.   Do the benefits really help someone that well off? One more side note for Active Duty, Google SCRA. If you got your CC before you joined the military they have to lower your interest rate to below 6% (thats everything too, school loans or what ever, call and get your interest lowered.) Another perk of my WF CC. Also they back pay you any interest that you paid over 6% during your service. I got 5 years of worth of overpaid interest back when I did it. I am still active and they cannot raise my interest till I retire from the military. So at least for another 14 years.",finance

The vendor also informed me that I can amend returns up to two years previous to the install year to recoup the money more quickly.

personalfinance,"Not sure if I have to file GA state tax. I did some research, hoping for clarifications.","My taxes are very simple this year but I have a source of income I've never dealt with before and am VERY confused. I tried to keep this short and organized.  Please let me know if I was unclear and I will do my best to clarify.

The only income I had for 2017 was about $4500 I received when I broke a retirement account I still had money in from when I lived in Ohio  (I lived in ohio a few years ago).  (Form 1099R)

I did my federal taxes on turbo taxes and am getting a refund based on taxes I paid on that money when I broke the retirement account. 

To determine whether I need to file state taxes, I looked up GA guidlines on https://dor.georgia.gov/filing-requirements and it gives 3 bullet points:

&gt; You are required to file a Georgia income tax return if any of the following apply:

&gt; * You are required to file a Federal income tax return
&gt; * You have income subject to Georgia income tax but not subject to federal income tax
&gt; * Your income exceeds Georgia's standard deduction and personal exemptions

**First bullet-**  I'm not sure that this applies because the 4.5k income is beneath the 6,350 standard deduction for single people.  I *DID* file federal income taxes but I don't think I was *REQUIRED* to.  I did it because I knew I'd get a refund.

However, This PDF [""Tax Guide for Georgia""](https://dor.georgia.gov/sites/dor.georgia.gov/files/related_files/document/A%20Tax%20Guide%20for%20Georgia%20Citizens-2017.pdf) states: *All resident individuals, estates, and trusts who file a federal return or have income that exceeds the standard deduction and personal exemptions.*  (Page 4)
This makes it seem like I DO need to file state tax.

**Second bullet-** I don't think this applies because the income was already filed on the federal tax return. 

**Third bullet-** This is another one I'm not sure of.  I was talking to someone on here last night who said I don't need to file state taxes because *""your income does not exceed GA's standard deduction and personal exemption amount ($5,000)""*.  I cant figure out where he found that 5,000 figure.  I found this on the [""Tax Guide for Georgia""](https://dor.georgia.gov/sites/dor.georgia.gov/files/related_files/document/A%20Tax%20Guide%20for%20Georgia%20Citizens-2017.pdf) (page 5):

&gt; The standard deduction is $2,300 for singles and heads of household, $3,000 for married couples filing joint returns, and $1,500 for married couples filing separately. An additional amount of $1,300 is added to the standard deduction for taxpayers who are 65 or over and/or blind and who do not itemize deductions. An exemption of $7,400 shall be allowed as a deduction in computing Georgia taxable income of a taxpayer and spouse, but only if a joint return is filed. If a taxpayer and spouse file separately, $3,700 shall be allowed to each person as an exemption deduction. An exemption of $2,700 shall be allowed as a deduction in computing Georgia taxable income for all taxpayers other than the taxpayers cited above. Additionally, a $3,000 exemption is allowed for each dependent.

Obviously paying bills on time is step one. The debts are probably near the statute of limitations at this point (PA), so perhaps just keep ignoring that. What’s next? Would getting a credit card help the most? 

I could add him as an authorized user onto my accounts, but how much would that help? (15+ year solid credit history with never holding a balance). Is that a bad idea if I don’t even give him the actual card so he can’t use it? 

One of his most crippling payments is his car, because he foolishly bought a car that doesn’t hold value at a high interest rate, and he needs to do something about that.

At the actual price of 500usd per eth it is the amount of 5bn on stake. 

The 5% of this amount that has to be payed yearly as dividend to the staker is 250m.

So it means that  250m per year have to be generated in transaction fees in order to revenue the stakes and make them willing to stake at 500usd.

The actual number of transactions today is around 1m per day (I exagerate).

This makes 350m transactions per year. 

Let's suppose an arbitrary price of even 0,10usd per transaction (this number can be discussed, but the lower the price, the worse the effect), this amount is 35m.

This is far low than the amount required to stack that amount of ethereum from stakers.

Both the new economic advisor and the Treasury Secretary in Washington like a strong dollar.

The new tax law removes barriers for the repatriation of near a trillion dollars in foreign held US corporate assets which increases demand for dollars.

The fed has signalled a continued policy of rate increases which in turn drives up treasury yeilds and makes shorting the dollar more expensive.

The dollar index has lagged the libor ois by about 2-3 months for the last 4 years and the libor ois has been on a climb for the last 8 weeks or so which I am interpreting as a technical signal.

personalfinance,"What are the downsides to this situation, if any? (Personal Loan/Debt Consolidation)","Hey all. Been doing some research on consolidating some of my high-interest debt and wanted to get an outsiders opinion.

I'll start with a little background. I have a few credit cards that I opened fresh out of college, I racked up a ton of debt on both at very high interest rates (between 24.29% - 25.99%) when I was young and partying and just generally living way above my means. The total amount of the debt is around $16K. Fortunately I've always had (and have) jobs that pay pretty well and I have never missed a payment on either and have a strong credit history w/ zero derogatory marks and a FICO in the low 700s despite carrying such large balances relative to my limits. I use neither of these cards today for ANYTHING (I have my $9.99 monthly recurring Spotify subscription on one, and my $9.99 recurring monthly recurring XBox
Live subscription on the other). Those are the only charges on either in the last 6 months. Neither of them are in my wallet. Unfortunately, while I make pretty good money, I do have a lot of other expenses (namely rent which is extremely expensive in my city) so I am rarely able to pay over the minimum amount, and when I do, it's not by much.

As such, I've looked into some solutions (Lending Club) for consolidating this at a much lower interest rate and getting the revolving balances down. I checked my rate with Lending Club and have been approved for enough to pay off all of the revolving credit at a rate of 7.96% in 36 equal monthly installments. My monthly payment will be $148/month LESS than what I'm currently paying in monthly minimums on the credit cards combined. I'll be completely debt free in 36 months instead of god knows how long and pocketing an extra ~$150 a month.

We want to build a new, smaller, more efficient home in a brand new development with lots of features: planned community, community pool, nature, walking paths. The new build would be close to $400k. 

I had a small windfall recently that allowed us to payoff 90% of our credit card debt. We have a student loan for $30k that runs $550 per month. 

If we buy the new house, the monthly mortgage will be about $2600. But we will save on powerbill, lawn maintenance, the HOA includes high speed internet so we can cancel the att bill. Plus, we can payoff the student loan canceling the $450 per month and we are looking at a 4% interest rate on the mortgage.

Here’s the area of concern... I get absolutely 0 financial support from family, so when I went to the more expensive school, I received a full Pell Grant and federal loans and was therefore able to work to pay off the remaining semesterly balance without having to take out private loans. I was unable to commute to reduce the cost of school further, but now am. 

Now that I am going to be commuting, and will be at a cheaper school, with no financial support, can I expect the same amount of federal aid, or will I see a reduction and therefore have to get private loans/an accommodating job to get by?

litecoin,The ignorance we’re up against.,"Saw a guy get ripped up on a militaria collectibles forum promoting crypto currency technology. Here’s one of the replies from someone obviously bitter and ill informed.

“A crypto-pumper on WAF? Wow...just wow. 

If you're going to pump it here, at least be fair enough to state that this thread is about generating attention for cryptos here (aka ""Selling Something"").

BTC, like all cryptos, are not suitable for day to day commerce, due to price instability. What is a retailer supposed to do...adjust prices on their merchandise, everytime cryptos shoot up (because of a whale buyer, or good rumors), and crash down? 

It's not practical for anything, other than speculation. Again, in the interest of being fair, why not tell the readers on WAF about the fact that it often takes transactions a while to clear on the exchanges?

Anonymity in cryptocurrency is misleading - to get in or out, in local ""legacy-system fiat"", you're dealing with an exchange. The exchanges take TONS of information from account holders; why bother to learn ""a whole new system, which is dependent on computers"", when CASH (aka Fiat Fedbucks) have wide acceptance, and still provide better anonymity? 

How many competing cryptocurrencies are there now? 1,000+ ? How many will there be in another year, if anybody can create their own? 

There is no point in adopting a ""currency"" which leaves a permanent trail (blockchain ledger), if the goal is maintaining your privacy. 

The run-up in BTC, is largely due to demand from Asia, and the fact that most of the supply is held by less than 1,000 strong-handed people. 

As a speculative vehicle, I did well with it, but it's not a viable, long-term replacement for the system in place now (which is protected by crooked politicians and the militaries that take orders from them). 

The CB's will issue their own, and the governments will criminalize possession of the rest, as ""instruments of crime"", that only ""drug dealers and terrorists have"".

@ Everyone reading - don't take my word for it, do your own research. It's a Ponzi-scheme, ultimately, and while early adopters did well with it, they're also running out of ""sheep to shear"", if a militaria hobby forum is getting invaded with sales pitches”",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Questions about Home Equity Loan,"This is for my mother, not me. Her house is paid off in full and is worth about $250k in New Jersey.

1. Is the interest rate always the same fixed rate or does her credit score affect it at all? I assume it is a set rate, but she has really good credit, like 795+, so I figured I would ask.

2. Who do you get this loan through? Can she just get it through her bank (Credit Union), the mortgage company she had her mortgage through, or does she have to get it through some other source?

3. How long does it take to get the loan usually? Is it pretty fast once approved or could it take months and months?

4. How is the loan paid to you? Do you just get a cashiers check or something like that for the full amount or is it in installments?

That is about all the questions we have for now. I looked online real quick and it looked like the rate was 4.90% and if she were to get a $60k loan it would be about $240 a month. She is fine with this, as her car is paid off and in fine condition and she was paying like $300 a month for that up until late last year.

**Monthly Take-home:** $2700    
**Monthly expenses:** $1900 (includes short-term savings goals like vacations)    
**Bare bones, ICE budget:** $1100    
**Existing Savings:** ~$19,000 retirement, 12 months emergency ($13,200), additional $3000 life-happens, and $2800 for a future down payment    
**Currently Saving:** 15% retirement (but do not pay into SS); $800/m into down-payment    

I fear I'm behind on retirement and so am considering reducing the e-fund to 6 months and moving $5500 out of savings into an IRA, but am scared to lose that much liquidity (have diagnosed anxiety, am scared of a lot of things). Would like to own a house someday, but can't put a timeline on that as I don't want to settle where I am currently. Hope to move states (likely to a job that pays into SS) within the next 2-3 years, but who knows if I'd like to stay where I end up, either.

How should I distribute between my savings goals (retirement, future home)? Where should I keep my ""someday I want my own home"" fund when I honestly don't know if I'll be buying 4 years or 15 years from now? Obviously in the end this comes down to me and what I decide will give me the most peace of mind without being stupidly cautious or seeing the future, but in my situation what would you do?
 

**More details/brain dump for my venting pleasure:**

I work for a state university in Illinois, and thus don't pay into Social Security. Instead I am forced to put 8% of my salary into the state retirement system (I opted out of the pension plan, so at least I can self-manage). The state supposedly (snerk) matches 7%, but I doubt I'll stay long enough to be vested (2 out of 5 years still to go) and so won't see a penny of their match anyway. After paying off my car about two years ago I also opened a 403(b) which I put an additional 7% into. So I personally save a total of 15% for retirement and pretend the match doesn't exist. It's kind of hard to determine how much of the money in my accounts is ""mine"" and how much is the state's but I probably have about $18,000 total?

I received a VERY SMALL raise which should kick in soon, and I plan to funnel that and my small tax break into retirement, which combined will probably up my retirement savings rate to somewhere between 17-18%. I'm happy with the choices and fees in the 403(b) so I don't currently have an IRA.

I'm scared that this still isn't enough retirement saving because 1) I didn't start until I was 26 (current job is my first full-time job), 2) My job doesn't pay into SS and my previous low-paying, part time jobs will have little impact, 3) I barely have a year's living expenses which seems ridiculously low at almost 30, and 4) I'm a pessimist with anxiety and worry about everything.

That said, I do not plan on staying here much longer because I do not particularly like Illinois. My next job will likely pay into SS, and most universities (I plan to stay in higher ed) have fairly generous retirement benefits. However, I like the day-to-day of my job so I'm in a position where I can be fairly picky and will stay here until something better in a reasonably low COL area comes along. I've been considering leaving for over a year now, and, well, I'm still here.

Aside from retirement I've been socking between $700 and $800 a month in my credit union savings account. Right now I have ~$19,000 sitting there. I consider $3,000 my ""life happens"" fund, ~$14,000 my ""oh, crap I lost my job how will I survive"" fund, and whatever is left is my ""someday when I live somewhere I actually want to live I would like to buy a house, so maybe I should save for a down payment"" fund. I obviously need to move all of this somewhere with better interest rates, but I'm having trouble deciding exactly how much to put where. Probably an Ally account for whatever ends up being the e-fund, but should I put any in an IRA for additional retirement, or invest my future home fund?

It took about a year after grad school to start this job, so I like the idea of having about a full year EF, but I'm secure here and do not see them letting me go until I want to, so maybe 6 months would be enough? Since I'm worried about retirement I'm very tempted to take $5,500 out of the E-fund and put it into an IRA, which would leave me my $3000 life happens and 8 months of living expenses (or 6 months + a small down-payment fund, depending on how you look at it).

And going forward, should I reduce the amount I sock away and instead just pay more into retirement? I would like to buy a house someday, but as I don't live somewhere I want to settle yet, does it really make sense to keep funneling money there instead of retirement? On the other hand, I'm perpetually single (although not opposed to changing that) and any home-purchasing will likely be on my own. Because I don't earn much and can't realistically expect to earn much more in my line of work, I estimate it will take around 5 years to save a reasonable down payment for a modest home. From that viewpoint, the sooner I start saving the better, but since I don't have a timeline where should I keep that money?

If anyone read all of that, I apologize, but thanks for humoring me! :)

personalfinance,Home refinancing question in relation to the Fed interest rate hikes.,"With the Fed increasing interest rates, I am fielding a couple of assumptions: interest rates go up property values will come down and pulling out equity in the home prior to a housing slump is a good idea. By utilizing the value now, before the slump, I can utilize this money that would otherwise be trapped in the home as the economy recovers. Perhaps reddit can help me figure this out.

I purchased my southern California home in 2017 at 575K at 4% interest rate, with upgrades, I project my home value will be 680k by the summer. I currently have 43K in student loans (6 and 7% interest rate), and 30K in a retirement loan (My portfolio is making 9 to 12% yearly). No other interest debt to speak of.

My proposed scenario is this: I pull out the roughly 100K equity (less closing costs?), pay off both my student loans and my retirement loan, and then invest the rest. By doing so, I'm not being bled by my student loans, I regain my earning potential on my retirement fund, and the I trade my 1200 per month payment to both liabilities for 200 per month increase in mortgage payments and taxes.

Can anybody see a downside to this? Any thoughts?",finance

personalfinance,Should I look to refinance my parent's Parent PLUS Loans under my name?,"In college I needed more money. Was denied all private loans we applied for. Eventually my Parent's were approved to get a Parent PLUS loan for me, under the condition of I'm paying it off.

Now two years later, I have a job lined up after I graduate this May. My credit score now is pretty solid, 740 checking using Mint. 

Should I refinance their loans in my name or pay for the loans while they are under their name? The interest rate is around 6%-7%. Is it better for my credit? My parent's credit also now isn't so hot, I think I have a better score than theirs now. They had some issues with Bank of America screwing up their mortgage payments. So I think if I took refinanced it from them, it would help their debt to income ratio.",finance
MachineLearning,[D] Projection layer vs embedding reverse lookup in decoder for encoder-decoder RNN for seq2seq,"Hi everyone, I'm following the tutorial for training seq2seq models using encoder-decoder RNN, located here:
[https://github.com/ematvey/tensorflow-seq2seq-tutorials/blob/master/1-seq2seq.ipynb](https://github.com/ematvey/tensorflow-seq2seq-tutorials/blob/master/1-seq2seq.ipynb).

The encoder and the decoder both deal with inputs and outputs of size *embedding_size* after the original input is first fed through an embedding lookup table. My question regards the method for returning to the *vocabulary_size* world. In the tutorial, a linear layer is trained with softmax. However, this seems to me to be un-ideal for two reasons:

* 1) the decoder outputs now exist in a different vector space compared with the embedding vector space. While they share the same dimensions, the meanings of the space are not the same. E.g. point X means 'dog' in the embedding space ('dog' token has a value of X in the lookup table), but the same valued point X in the decoder output space no longer necessarily means 'dog'. This forces the decoder to learn a new meaning space rather than re-use the one learned by the embedding lookup, which seems like additional effort for the network.
* 2) the softmax will return weak gradients for a large *vocabulary_size*, making the learning more difficult.


Instead of the linear projection layer method, I was wondering if I could instead use a reverse embedding lookup. In terms of the method, I was thinking of something like this:

* the loss objective is the l2 distance between the decoder output and the embedding lookup of the ground truth
* to reduce the decoder output to the tokens, do an argmax to find the nearest point in the embedding lookup table.
* apply losses on the embedding variable to ensure that the distribution of the embeddings does not collapse
* at inference time, for each time step, feed in the embedding lookup of the reverse lookup of the decoder output in the previous step (collapse each decoder output to nearest point in the embedding lookup)

I've tried running this variation and the network doesn't seem to converge. I've looked through the steps and in my mind the gradients should flow through (the argmax steps are just for interpretation and are not involved in the loss computation so the gradients don't need to flow through those).

Can anyone point me in the right direction to understand why this method might not work? Thanks!",technology

personalfinance,Jumped brackets after taking a massive pay cut and now I’m screwed!,"Just did my taxes and I owe ~$4,000 federal and ~$1,000 state. 

I used to work full time at a law firm making $60k/year with benefits and bonuses. A year ago I decided to work towards leaving law to get back into hospitality (bartending as a step towards my goal of owning/opening a bar). I worked weekends in addition to my law job. I quit law the first week of July.

I knew I would need extra cash saved up to make the transition as I was going to take a MASSIVE pay cut returning to part time work. To save I increased my deductions at the law firm to 3 around March knowing I would have to pay when the time came. I considered my previous tax bracket and knew I’d owe about $500 total.

I kinda killed it once I got back into bartending and that combined with the 6 months working at the law firm with the weekend job kicked me up a bracket. I lost my EIC, my renters credit. I lost my health insurance and can’t appeal the $539 penalty for not having it because I made too much.

Right now my current income is half of what I was making this time last year. I’ll be at about $42k this next year. I have a $750 loan payment every month, $400 for my car and insurance, $1,100 rent. I don’t see much wiggle room for another large payment. 

I have $500 in savings (had more but my mom ran into health problems and I had to take off work).

I do not know what sort of payment plans are available but have heard the interest is high and they are very strict.

I am planning on budgeting hard, picking up a 3rd job (I am a bartender and bar manager), and possibly hooking (kidding).

Any advice would be much appreciated. Even anecdotal stories of support and understanding would be appreciated.

personalfinance,Could investing in someone's student loan be more lucrative than a retirement or savings account?,"I'm looking for any way to combat my own student loans, I have a Wells Fargo loan that's $75k at 6% variable and the amount of interest I pay exceeds the principal, every month. I know people who have wealthy family members who pay off their total student loan amount and receive monthly payments with low to no interest at all, which seems like a mutually beneficial situation that I wish I had access to. 

So, this makes me wonder- if someone was looking to help with the student loan crisis and also make an investment, would becoming someone's personal loan lender be a viable option? I'm aware there's risks as it would be an unsecured loan, but I guess I'm imagining the loan being more personal- perhaps the lender would want to award their help to someone they want to get to know who they believe will be the most relieved from the aid, or the person with the best credit score, or the person that can do the coolest magic tricks. Could the lender be making a decent investment if they asked for some ~1% interest rate?",finance

Unfortunately, I damaged the fender of the car by cutting my wheel too soon and scraping a pole, so that creates another problem. The dealership does not know about this yet. I understand this could forfeit the down payment due to damages.

personalfinance,Settling on a home in 63-77 days. Lock in rate and pay a lock fee or wait?,"Hi PF. My husband and I are purchasing a new construction home. Somehow the bank thinks we can afford it and our current home, so we're closing on new home and hoping to sell and settle on current home a couple weeks later so we can move over a period of a couple weeks (we have 3 kids and two dogs). I share this because we're trying to keep money in savings just in case we end up having both homes for a while.
Our interest rate right now is 5% which is higher by a good bit than it was when we started this process. (It's high because we're only putting down 5% to keep our cash from being tied up.)
Our settlement date is theoretically May 24 but the builder is telling us to lock 14 days after that date ""just in case"". My lender - who I've used on purchases in the past and trust immensely and isn't commission based - is saying rates are increasing and that we should consider either a 60 day lock (free) plus 7 day extension (.125 of a point) which only gets us to May 29, or 90 day lock which would cost .375% of a point or $1,609.39 up front.
Do we 
-keep holding our breath and hoping we don't end up going way high and wait it out until we can qualify for 60+7;
-do the former and be riskier until 60 days;
-get the 90 day lock and bleed cash for literally nothing but piece of mind;
-leave it to chance, risk a bad rate, and refinance some day if rates tank

personalfinance,Optimum repayment strategy for increasing credit score via installment loan?,"Howdy!  

This is a pretty unique question.  I'm hoping you wondrous folks here on r/personalfinance can help!  

My credit score is 720--all from responsible credit card use.  I wanted to add some installment loan history to boost my score, so I took out an $8k unsubsidized student loan at 6%.  I currently have about $40k in savings and investments, and I can afford to repay this loan at whatever speed will help my credit score the most.

If I repay within 120 days, the payments count as a ""Refund to directly reduce the amount of money you originally borrowed, and may reimburse a portion of the federal loan origination fees.""  My concern is if, say, I pay $5,000 back immediately, my credit history will make it look like I never borrowed that amount.

It seems the ideal strategy is this:  Wait 120 days.  Repay all but $1000.  Pay $50/mo for a couple years.

Looking for some feedback on what I can do to improve my current situation and hit some of my goals that I would like to as well as some weird situations that I have some questions about.

Currently, I'm 21 years old, finishing up my last semester of university, Live outside the NYC area and work in Manhattan doing Product &amp; Marketing Management making 52k a year after taxes, I also work as a freelance graphic designer and creative consultant and make an additional 14k after taxes from that (based off of this past tax year). So my after-tax take home is right around $5500 a month, from this is I'm usually able to save about $3000 a month after expenses such (Car, Insurance, Metrocard/NJT Bus Pass, etc.)

Luckily I'm able to save so much because I'm currently living at home while finishing up school and will most likely be staying home to save for another year post-graduation.

I have a small emergency fund of $6000 as well as 25k in a Marcus by Goldman Sachs high yield savings account where I have $1000 sent to every biweekly paycheck from my salaried job via direct deposit. (gets around $575~ a year via interest currently) then the remaining $1000 gets divided between an IRA through UBS and the remainder $500 being added to my emergency fund.

My current credit score is 770~ and I have 4 accounts on my history but the oldest is only 2 years old, any advice on how to improve my score would also be appreciated since in the upcoming years I would like to invest in property and have a higher score would allow me access to lower interest rates on loans if needed.

Where it gets weird is since this is my last semester and I will not have any schooling expenses upcoming. (Unless I decide to go to grad school in the future.) I have a 529 college savings plan via UBS that has been contributed to by family members (grandparents, mom, and dad) throughout my entire childhood. Post Graduation it will have a remaining balance of $34k~ that can essentially only be used for education or education related needs. if funds are not used for higher education, the earnings are subject to taxes and a 10% penalty. Would it be better for me to leave this money in the 529 account for a few years post graduation or remove it from the account and get taxed on it and the 10% penalty? Then invest the remaining amount or save it elsewhere.

Goals for the future:

- Buy a condo/duplex for investment purposes in 5 years time.

- Get more into stocks and investments.

- Decide what the hell to do with the 529 plan that's going to be sitting around.

personalfinance,I don't agree with Saving...,"Let me preface with I'm a little drunk, but I know what I'm talking about.

Why do people save money?
1. Emergency fund
2. Retire, save until you're rich. Right?

Now that would make sense at first sight. You need access to cash in case of an emergency, and you want to save until you're old and can retire with money in the bank. But let's consider a few things first...

Interest on savings accounts is less than 1%, CD's and mutual funds you're lucky to get 5% or 6%. The stock market is basically gambling unless you're Warren Buffet.

If you own a house, 200k mortgage, 6% interest, 30 years, 1.2k monthly payments. 1.2k * 360 payments = 432k you pay over 115% on your house in that 30 year period because it is amortized instead of simple interest.

If instead of saving money, you keep a line of credit as your emergency fund, and use all cash flow coming in toward paying principal on your mortgage, take off 20 years, and save 150k in interest paid, isn't that better than saving?

I said this way over simplified. Amortized loans pay off interest first, than principal. First payment is 1000 to interest, 200 to principal. second is 999 to interest, 201 to principal. 6 months in youve paid 6k to interest and you have 1.2k to principal. That's shit. If that first month you pay 1.2k to principal only, you save 6k in interest.

Now lets say you have 5k monthly income, 3k of expenses, and normally you put 2k to savings (way over simplified) a 15k line of credit and you use 12k toward your principal. Then you use all 5k of your income to pay down the line of credit. It goes down 5, then back up 3k over the course of the month because your expenses but now 2k of the credit card is paid off. You set up your line of credit as overdraft protection to your checking account and write checks to pay off your loans because why not? I called my bank, I have no penalties for doing that, no limit to doing that as long as their is credit on the line. You can live off it because it is revolving. Pay all bills that way. at any point I have at least 3k emergency fund because I'm only using at most 12k of my 15k limit. With this pattern it takes 6 months to pay off the line of credit. You pay $900 of credit card interest, conservatively. You save 51k worth of interest on the mortgage. You just saved 50k worth of interest and 52 months on your mortgage. Then do another 12k over and over. Bam paid off in 7 years assuming no emergencies. now that's an extra 1.2k a month you can not put towards your savings because there are more steps to do after this.

I fell asleep mid write and woke up more sober and less motivated to write this. If someone is interested I'm sure they will go out of their way to find out more.
Of course my numbers are weighted assuming someone saves this much and can even get a line of credit this large but even with smaller numbers the math always works out in favor of paying of mortgage rather than saving money.

Only works if you can budget, you know your cash flow and interest rates. There are diminishing returns the later into a loan you start. This can apply to car loans, students loans, loans. Anything amortized.

Prove me wrong. Tell me this is impractical.

personalfinance,Question about saving for college: contribute to 529 account all now or slowly over time?,"I'll be receiving a $240,000 bonus next year that I'm trying to figure out how to deal with.

My wife and I currently make $245k, we have a 3.5% mortgage, we max out our backdoor Roth IRAs and Roth 401ks, and we have zero other debt. My reasoning for using Roth accounts is I believe taxes in the future will be higher than they are now, I would prefer not to take RMD upon retirement, and I would like to pass our Roth IRAs onto our children who then would also not be required to take RMDs. I feel comfortable with our retirement savings plan so the next bucket money should flow into is tax advantaged college savings (529) since we don't have access to HSA accounts and already max out the dependent care FSAs.

We have a newborn and a 2 year old, and using the online calculators it looks like we'll need about $150,000 per child for college in ~18 years. If I put $75,000 into each child's 529 now and get between a 3-4% annual return, I should be around the right place when they're off to college. Is this a good idea? 

The other idea is to pay-down the mortgage, but at 3.5% interest that seems like a mistake if we expect interest rates to normalize over the next 5-10 years.

On the retirement front, I think I'll switch us over to pre-tax 401ks next year to help mitigate the tax sting from the bonus being taxed in the higher bracket. Any ideas/suggestions on how to reduce this tax burden?

Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,Should I pay off my van?,"My wife and I are members of a local credit union whose MM savings rate is 1%. Not as good as Ally but we'll take it for the convenience of having immediate transfers. Once March is over, we'll have about $14,700 available in our savings. Currently, the only thing standing between us and being completely debt-free is $3,210 on a minivan payment. The minimum payment on it is $334 but we've been putting $500/month toward it as well as our last two tax returns, so we should be able to pay it off 3 years early.

The interest rate is comparatively low (2.69%) but still more than the money in our savings account is earning. We had recently been entertaining the idea of buying our first house but we'll probably end up trying to save more. Our monthly expenses are around $3000, so even with paying off the van, we'll still have close to 4 months of emergency fund built up.

My wife is a SAHM who also cares for another girl 2 days a week. She makes close to $500/month from that, but will be stopping once summer rolls around. We were thinking it might be good to cut out the van payment before we lose that income.

We do not currently have any other financial goals. We'd like to own a house and adopt some children one day, which would be cash-needy ventures. I have a 403(b) from work in which they currently match and contribute 10% of my salary without any money going in from me, which has been fantastic. I don't qualify for matching yet, based on company rules. If my wife doesn't keep working, then the free money might just go to cover the drop in income from her income flow stopping.

Anyway, would this be a good plan? Should we go ahead and pay everything off now to gain the financial flexibility?",finance

personalfinance,How should I pay this off?,"I mainly use one credit card, an American Express Everyday card, and I’ve gotten the balance up to about $24K at the moment. For the past couple years, I’ve been putting money away into a high-yield savings account, with the intention of paying off that balance in one large payment. Currently, I have about $17K in that account, collecting interest. I’ve been paying above the minimum payment on the card every month, and then depositing whatever I have left over into the savings account, because the savings interest rate is really really good. So here’s my question:

Should I take out whatever I have now in the savings and pay down that balance to leave me with roughly $7K in debt on the card and then pay that smaller balance over time? Or should I keep going the way I’m going, letting the savings interest go up, until I have enough to knock out the full debt in one payment?

If it makes any difference, I’m also in the process of selling my condo and purchasing a house. Don’t know if those transactions would be affected by lowering that credit card debt.

personalfinance,Residual Value of Honda Civics - is leasing-to-buy worth it?,"Hello all,

I am currently leasing a 2015 Toyota Corolla. My payments are $250/mo. It is in okay condition (a few small scrapes/stains) but I am over my 36,000 milege by about 800 miles so far. The lease is up in June. Leasing was a good option for me as reliable transportation really helped stabilize my life and my income has since increased. I have had one late payment. 

I would like something a bit bigger and can afford a little bit more ($350/mo is ideal, $400/mo max) but really find the lower payment beneficial for my budget. I am thinking of switching to Honda. I don't think I can afford a new FIT or HRV (which I would love). I was referred to a salesman at a dealership who I spoke with yesterday, I am going to the dealership on Monday. I really would prefer to buy used, but on the phone he told me to consider leasing a 2018 Civic because they hold their residual value if I want to buy it at the end. I would definitely consider a hatchback Civic for cargo space. He said we could do payments similar to what I am paying now with nothing down. Does this sound like a good deal? Do they really hold the residual value that would make buying at the end worthwhile? Or should I just shop used?

My credit score is 651 Transunion and 641 Equifax. This is largely due to a near-limit $1500 Discover card I have that I have put off paying down (stupid, I know). My only other credit accts are my federal student loans (~$29,000) which I am hoping to have forgiven in about 8 yrs as I am a public employee, and my Toyota Financial Acct. I have two small medical bills in collections.

I have $1,300 from my tax returns and only a couple hundred in savings which I don't want to touch. I am tempted by the zero down so I can pay off Discover, but would also be willing to use it as a down payment. 

Any advice is appreciated!!!!",finance

investing,Thread to discuss gold / silver and correlating assets.,"Gold tends to be a touchy subject. Please keep civil.

The FED raised interest rates this week. The last few times the FED raised rates, gold sold off only to rise significantly after the weeks of the rate hike.

Here is a chart showing what I mean. I'm not affiliated with this website and I didn't check the content off the page. I just Googled ""fed rate hike gold chart"".

https://goldsurvivalguide.co.nz/all-golden-eyes-on-the-fed-stewart-thomson/

This time gold started to rise in anticipation of the rate hike and after the rate hike gold is still showing a lot of strength.

Personally I'm very bullish on gold. My expectation is that when the FED is starting to raise rates again, the cost of financing/doing business is going up and this will show up in consumer prices. As consumer prices rise, the FED will have to raise rates to keep inflation under control. Higher rates will bring back asset prices that have been profiting from low rates like the stock market and housing and people will start looking for a safe haven.

Personally I'm willing to bet quite heavily on this possible outcome and I'm interested to diversify my portfolio. Are there any other assets like gold that will perform well when gold performs well? I'm looking for assets that haven't been inflated because of low interest rates that are good in keeping value, like gold and silver.",finance
personalfinance,"Ways to avoid income tax on ""unwanted"" $22k lump sum payment to a 66 year old still actively working full-time","Asking this question for my dad. Long story short is that he's receiving a $22k lump sum disbursement payout from his 401k. He put about $24k away during 2017 pre-tax into his 401k. HR got a hold of him and told him, basically, our plan is regulated differently than some other 401ks, because of that we are audited every year, in 2017 we had too many ""high income"" members of the plan, and money is being sent back to employees (less ~10% for federal taxes, and they say this number was told to the HR team by IRS).

First off we're both skeptical of HR and their explanation, the 10% ""federal tax"" number, the rationale for kicking back money to employees, etc. Can anyone speak to this situation?

Second is what should he do with the $22k? He's receiving the payout in 2018 but earned and originally deposited the money into his 401k in 2017. He's looking to avoid paying taxes on it as it was money he planned to go into his 401k pre-tax. He files jointly with a household income of about $200k +/- ~$20k in bonus. He'd like to move it all somewhere in bulk, but would break it up into different vehicles/accounts/etc to avoid the taxes.

politics,"We’re political reporter Derrick Blakely and political producer, Ed Marshall, from WBBM-TV in Chicago. We’re following several gun safety bills currently making their way through the Illinois General Assembly. AMA!","** Thanks, everyone, for joining us. We're glad we could chat with you here. **

Illinois state senators made some headway in advancing comprehensive gun safety legislation. Last week, they approved three gun safety proposals, all of which were supported by Senate President, John Cullerton.
 
Here are the proposed bills:

House Bill 1465: Prohibits the sale or transfer of an assault weapon, .50 caliber rifle or other large capacity magazine to anyone under 21. This bill was approved by the state Senate 33-22 and was sent back to the Illinois House for final action on changes.
 
House Bill 1467: Ban on bump stocks and trigger cranks. This also restores local governments’ ability to enact local regulations and restrictions on assault weapons. The bill was approved by the state Senate 37-16 and returns to the Illinois house for final action on changes.
 
House Bill 1468: Increases the waiting period to receive an assault weapon after purchase to 72 hours, up from 24 hours. This now mirrors the existing waiting period for handguns. This was passed by the state Senate 43-15 and clears the way for it to go to the governor.
 
House Bill 772: This bill would allow families or law enforcement officers to alert the courts when a person with access to a firearm is displaying threatening or unsafe behavior that could lead to injury to themselves or the general public. If the court finds enough evidence that the person is a danger, a judge can require that person to temporarily turn over any firearm in their possession. This was passed by the Senate 40-14 and now heads to the Illinois house for a concurrence vote.
 
Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner had already vetoed an additional measure that would have required all gun dealers in Illinois to obtain licenses from the state. In his veto message, Rauner called the bill burdensome regulation on top of existing federal regulation.

CryptoCurrency,How to invest in blockchain for beginners,"*There are no referral links in this guide.*

This post originally [appeared on my blog](https://bloomshark.com/2018/03/22/how-to-invest-in-blockchain-for-beginners/). Although I would love the traffic, I wrote this as a resource, hence why I am posting this as a text post. If there is anything you don't agree with or think I should add, please let me know nicely in the comments and I'll sort it out if I agree! Thanks 

 

Before you start reading, I will reiterate what I always say in crypto investment posts. Wherever you can **please enable 2FA and back up your 2fa code**. This will make all your accounts much more secure. 2FA via an app is much better than using SMS – phone numbers can easily be spoofed. 

 

**Introduction**

There are a lot of things that you need to get your head around in order to safely invest in blockchain. This post will provide all the important information you need to make sure you are investing safely and in projects you truly believe in. 

It is important to understand that the cryptocurrency market is currently extremely volatile and unregulated. Regulations are impending, however.

When you are entering this space you need to understand the possible volatility. You can lose money in the short term. You could lose money in the long term. This is something you need to understand. It is always said ‘Don’t invest more than you can afford to lose’ – for crypto this is very true. The future growth of the market is so uncertain and therefore so is the increase in prices. If you aren’t comfortable with the risk of losing the money, don’t invest it. 

Market cap must be understood when entering this space. This is to avoid the thought that all coins could reach the price of Bitcoin. They can’t. This is due to market cap.

Market cap is the total value of all of the distributed coins. So, at the time of writing this, for NANO, for example, the market cap is:

 $7.75 (Price per coin) x 133,248,289 (The total amount of NANO circulating) = $1,033,007,362 USD.

https://i.imgur.com/8e7CSkI.jpg
 
Cryptocurrencies have different circulating and max supplies. A larger supply makes the market cap larger too. This matters because market cap better represents the valuation of the coin than price (but not the total amount of money invested). So, one coin can ‘cost’ $3 but the market cap can be the same as a coin that cost $300, just based on the difference in supplies.

 

The reason this is important to understand is that it prevents investments base solely off the price of the coin. It is thought that a lot of the interest in XRP at the start of 2018 was partially due to the thought that the coin could reach the price of Bitcoin. However, with the max supply of XRP being over 4700 times larger than the max supply of Bitcoin, this cannot happen. So please understand the concept of market cap before investing. If a coin has a lower market cap it is seen as having a larger room for growth. 


https://i.imgur.com/vO4UWzD.png
 

So, market cap is important to understand when investing because it shows the potential realistic growth of a coin. The price is not so relevant. 

Market cap is often misunderstood by people that know this though. This is because it is thought that a market cap represents the amount of money that is invested. However, this is not true. It represents the total valuation of all the coins in circulation at the current price. There is a distinction here – as not all coins have been bought at the current price, nor could they all be sold at the current price. Only a portion of the coins have been sold to increase the price to its current amount. The reason this matters is because it helps to show the power of a few investors falsely increasing the price of a coin. 

**What is blockchain?** 

Blockchain is a digital decentralised public ledger which logs transactions in chronological order. The appeal of it is that when a transaction is made between two parties it is recorded on the blockchain immutably. This means it cannot be altered. The decentalised nature of blockchain is the reason it cannot be altered – the data is stored and verified across a network of computers globally. There is no centralised entry point which prevents tampering. 

 

 

**How to buy**

*FIAT currency is legal tender backed by the government that issued it*

 

There are lots of different ways to change your FIAT currency into cryptocurrency. If you want some of the most popular coins such as BTC, ETH and LTC you can purchase these directly with FIAT very easily.

For most coins you will have to purchase a major cryptocurrency (ETH, BTC) from a FIAT on-ramp (a place that accepts FIAT for major cryptocurrencies) and then transfer it to an exchange. You can then use the exchange to change your major cryptocurrency into the coin you want. This will incur small fees – the fee of sending crypto to the exchange, the exchange fees for using the exchange, and also withdrawing. Less popular or newly released coins will also most likely not be available on larger reputable exchanges – so additional due diligence is required in these situations.  

I would recommend purchasing in small amounts the first time to ensure you master the process of buying, exchanging and storing before investing more. 

 

**FIAT On-ramps**

[Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/)  

[Gemini](https://gemini.com/) 

[Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/) 

[BitStamp](https://www.bitstamp.net/) 

[CoinMama](https://www.coinmama.com/) 

These are the most popular FIAT on-ramps. They all have positives and negatives of using them. It’s really up to you to decide which one you would like to use, so doing a bit of research about each one would be best. Some are better than others depending on where in the world you are from so keep that in mind.

Coinbase is the most well-known and also has an exchange that uses the same log in information called GDAX. GDAX can be used to purchase (with USD) and send BTC and LTC for no fees. This is a good thing to keep in mind for the future, but it may be slightly complicated for a first time user. 

 

**Exchanges**

The exchange you will be using will depend on the coin you would like to purchase. 

A general good rule to follow when deciding what exchange to use for a specific coin is to look at the volume traded on the available exchanges on [coinmarketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com/). This will give a good indication of which ones are most popular in the community and will help you decide which to use. Search for the coin you are interested in and click on the markets tab. You will be able to see the exchanges and their volume, like the picture. 

https://i.imgur.com/giG6k9W.png

 

When transferring to an exchange it is important to consider both the available trading pairs on the exchange and the transaction fees when sending currency to the exchange. Some exchanges may also have outrageous withdraw fees so watch out for that. Ethereum and Bitcoin pairs will probably be available for most coins – again this can be checked using coinmarketcap. 

https://i.imgur.com/YfTv4dR.png

In the picture you can see the main trading pair for this coin is ETH, whereas on the previous photo there was a larger variety of trading pairs.

 

Transfer fees can potentially be reduced by transferring to the exchange using a coin with a lower transaction fee (e.g. LTC instead of BTC) and then exchanging LTC to BTC on the exchange before using BTC to trade for the coin you want. This is just something that may be useful to consider in the future. At the moment transferring ETH is not expensive so I would recommend that. 

I am not afraid to recommend Binance as the best exchange to use if the coin you want is on it. They have had substantial growth over the past quarter and have handled it extremely well. They are very transparent and have dealt with a recent hacking attempt brilliantly. 

 

**Storing** 

Now you have your coins, you better store them properly.

There are so many ways to store your coins. Most of them are safe. If you are not planning on trading in the near future, don’t keep your coins on an exchange. Keep them in a personal wallet. This is because you do not control the private key of coins on an exchange – you pass the responsibility on to a third party. This defeats the point of crypto and also potentially puts your coins at risk. Exchanges have lost coins in the past. Using reputable exchanges provides you nothing to worry about in this regard as long as you withdraw your coins to a safe wallet when you are done. 

It is not possible to list all of the wallets you could use because there are so many. However, I can discuss a couple of popular options and tell you how to find the best wallet for your coins.

If you are putting a good amount of money into crypto, consider purchasing a hardware wallet, such as a Ledger Wallet or a Trezor, as these are viewed as the safest way to store your currency. 

One way I like to find out which wallet to use is using Reddit. Find the subreddit for your coin and there will be a recommended wallet on there, usually in the sidebar. If it is an ERC-20 token, use the most popular Ethereum wallets.

A lot of tokens are ERC-20 tokens, so they are based on the Ethereum blockchain and can all use the same wallet. There are a couple of popular ones are Myetherwallet and MetaMask.

If you aren’t sure about finding the correct wallet for your currency please comment and I can make a recommendation, unless someone else gets there first! 

 

**How to choose where to invest** 

So once you feel you know how to buy and store effectively you need to decide out of the thousands of options where to invest your hard earned money. 

Luckily, a lot of the thousands of options really aren’t any good. The best way to begin is to search around online using forums and social media and try to gain the general consensus of what coins are popular. This is a good place to start but is **not** a way to blindly invest based on popularity.

You need to understand and believe in the fundamentals of the coin you are investing in. The investment will only pay off if the coin serves a purpose and moves towards adoption on a large scale.

 

[Upfolio](https://www.upfolio.com/) is a good website that sums up the top 100 coins in a clear and concise way. It’s probably best to start your investing in crypto in the top 100 as these should be safer investments, if not the top 50 or even 10. You can use this website to further identify coins that you think sound interesting. I would say that the short descriptions often make the coins sound better than they might be, so keep that in mind. It is still a great resource. 

Now that you have a list of coins that you know are popular and you are interested in it’s time to do proper research. You want to check:

 

**Team**

Any good coin will have a great team behind it that are fully transparent. You should be able to see their social profiles and their job history. This will help you make a judgement based on the people behind the project. 

 

**White Paper**

Read the project white paper. This will tell you everything you need to know about the project and the plans for it. A white paper should be a very helpful resource and not using overly complicated language to insinuate they are working towards big things when they have nothing to base it on. Make sure you are happy with the white paper and it provides you clarity.

 

**Roadmap &amp; previous deadlines** 

The team should have a clear development roadmap of what they are working towards. However, ambitious roadmaps are not the only important thing. They should have a clear history of meeting targets in the past as well. 

 

**Partnerships** 

Does the company have partnerships with well-known companies that will be using their blockchain services? If there are good partnerships this could indicate future success – as it implies future adoption. Be sure to find concrete evidence of partnerships as fake ones have been announced in the past. Partnerships don’t guarantee anything but they do provide trust in projects.

 

**Supply**

Find out the circulating supply and the max supply. If they are different, you need to know how and why the extra tokens will be distributed.

It is also good to know the distribution of the supply. Coins where the developers hold a massive percentage of the tokens are viewed in quite a negative light. Rightly so, because large holders can have a large influence over the market.

 

 

**Reviews**

Read blog posts and watch reviews to get further understanding – be aware they are probably biased towards the coin. They can provide useful insight but take it with a grain of salt.

 

**Product**

Does the project currently have a working product or are they just working towards it? Having a working product is a good sign, but only being in the development stage is not an issue as long as the other parameters look promising. Refer to the roadmap and whether they are hitting targets in this case.

 

**Use cases**

Does the coin have a real world use? Can you see it being adopted? This is important for real world adoption – it needs to actually solve a problem or improve a current service for it to actually serve a purpose and be a good investment. A project may sound good but if you don’t think it’s going to provide value in the real world then don’t invest. You are in control of your money and you should invest in projects you believe will provide value and make a difference. 

 

**Community** 

I always like to see what the community of the coin is like throughout the web in terms of the level of discussion and friendliness, and also their perception of the coin and its development. Community interaction from the development team can be a telling sign. I love transparency from developers about what is happening so this can be something to look out for. Seeing developers that provide frequent updates about progress is great.

 

 

This is a list of things you should look for, but it is not exhaustive nor is it a must have list. When it comes down to it, some very promising cryptos don’t have a white paper or a roadmap, for example. In these cases you must do your due-diligence, place emphasis on other parameters such as a working product or great partnerships and developer transparency as these can outweigh the negatives of the missing parameters. It is ultimately up to you to research and see if you believe in the overall project with these things in mind. 

 

**When to buy**

Don’t buy coins at all-time high, and if you do it should be because the purchase was part of a dollar cost average system. This is when you invest a predetermined amount of money every X amount of days. So maybe you say you will invest $100 every week. This is a popular method with investors in order to reduce the impact of volatility on large purchases. 

Buying at all time high because the price is increasing and you want to join the party is fear of missing out – FOMO – and more often than not it will lead to you losing money as fast price increases that cause FOMO almost always take a decline shortly after. 

 

 

**Taxes**

You need to understand that for any money you earn from crypto you must pay tax, bar a few special countries. Make sure you understand what the tax requirements are for your particular country – whether you have to pay when you cash out or if you have to pay regardless of if your money is still in crypto. It is good to know before investing. 

 

**Volatility and HODL**

Lastly, I want to go back to my original sentiment about the volatility of the market. The cryptocurrency market is a new and exciting entity. No one really knows where it is going to be tomorrow – let alone in a year or two. If you truly believe in the projects you are investing in and don’t know how to trade just [HODL](https://bloomshark.com/2018/03/20/where-does-hodl-come-from/). Don’t try to trade, don’t sell when there is a dip. There will be times your portfolio decreases. This is normal. You have to accept this. You shouldn’t have invested more than you can lose anyway. So just buy what you believe in and wait. This is the safest method for investment in this space if you are new.

personalfinance,"What a headache! Gonna owe the IRS and state of MD $3600 this year, first time owing more than $200, but I can't afford more than $2000 right now. What's the cheapest way to pay this off?","First off I'm a freelancer and I've already written off as much as I can.  I'm going to owe ~$2700 and ~$900 federal and state respectively, I can pay around $2000 total now.  Because of my limited income, need to rebuilt my emergency savings and other expenses I need to pay the rest over time, something like $100-150 a month.  I got the flu this year so I had to dip into my tax/emergency savings.  This year I'm going to have 2 separate accounts for taxes and emergencies.  I have some things I've been meaning to sell totaling around $1500 that will make a nice cushion when done but that's going to take some time.

So getting back to taxes the fee structure is complex.  I was told by the IRS that if (in the worst case) I didn't pay anything on the $2700 in a year I'd have around $250 in fees and interest, that's not including the set up fee of $31 if I set up online.  OK fine, but I can put down a large chunk of it now and I'm going to make payments.  Am I better off just borrowing from one of my CC's, say if I have a 0% APR offer + 3-5% fee?  Or even a 6% APR offer with no fee?  And then there is the state tax.  There's too many variables.  I can't figure out how I should split things up in order to minimize my cost.

Or do I have a shot at compromise and settle?  I got sick and I recently had a root canal.  Also I'm burdened with credit card payments (long story) and I'm just now starting to rev up my career and save money.  Any advice is appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,Relocating to higher cost of living and wondering when to stop paying extra on student loans vs. saving for house.,"Hello PF, 

I read PF daily and have seen how helpful you have been for others.  I appreciate any and all advice! If more details are needed, let me know and I will gladly edit post. 

My husband and I (both late 20s) are currently interviewing for jobs that would require relocation to a higher cost of living area.  This is by choice.  Currently, we live in the midwest and are wanting to live in the Pacific Northwest (within 100 miles of Portland). We own our house and have no kids.  We have two larger dogs, so I don't think renting is an option for us when we move. In order to move into a comparable house to what we are in now, we would be looking at $300,000-$400,000. 401k's aren't maxed out, but I have a savings rate of 18% (HSA, 401k, 401k Roth) and husband has a savings rate of 6% (HSA).  Neither one of us take any out of our HSA, buts it's there if we need it. Debt is detailed below--car, house, student loans.

We are both in IT, I am hoping for a similar salary and husband should be able to increase his. 

* Salary (me) :  $87,000 
* Salary (husband):  $28,000
* Joint Savings Account:  $41,000
* House:  Owe $150,000 at 3.65%, recently (January) appraised at $237,000
* Cars:  Husband owns his car, I owe ~$17,000 at 2.54%
* Student loans 1 &amp; 3 belong to me, 2 &amp; 4 belong to husband.  I am a cosigner on student loan 2
* Currently paying an additional $1000 on student loans monthly

Loan | Interest Rate | Principal | Monthly Payment
---|---|----|----
Student Loan 1 | 4.09 | $7437.08 | $87.92
Student Loan 2 | 4.09 | $6442.89 | $67.54
Student Loan 3 | 3.15 | $2674.95 | $54.08
Student Loan 4 | 1.75 | $49596.03 | $455

Here are my questions: 

* The jump in housing increase makes me uncomfortable. Would we get a better mortgage rate if we only put my name on the future house loan since I have a higher income and less debt than husband?
* At what point should we stop paying the extra $1000 to student loans and add that to our house down payment? 
* Bonus and off topic:  Any tips on how to be a more attractive job candidate when you are applying from out of state? I've gotten a few phone interviews, but I can't even get a tech recruiter to call me back. Working on my interview skills, but feel like I am not even being considered due to my current address being out of area.


TLDR:  At what point should we stop paying extra on our student loans and focus on padding our savings with anticipation of moving to a higher cost of living area?",finance
personalfinance,How should I continue to invest my money? I'm 26 and I want to retire when I'm 55.,"I'm in my late 20s, living in the U.S., and just went from making 39k a year to 72k a year. For additional context, I am single and the only earner in my household. I do not support anyone else on my income as well.  

Luckily I have been saving money since I was in my mid-teens. Because of this, I have accumulated 10k in a brokerage account; this account is used to buy and trade equities exclusively. Typically with this account, I have heavy exposure to small and mid-cap U.S. stocks. I have an employer sponsored 401k as well, it is now at 22k. This account is primarily invested in moderate to high-risk international mutual funds with heavy small-cap and mid-cap exposure; I put 8% of my paycheck into this account. My employer matches 25% of my contributions on up to 4k a year. I also have an employer sponsored ROTH 401k with 4k in it that is invested similarly as the 401k listed above; I put 7% in that account and this has no employer match. Lastly, I have an emergency fund with 2k in it and an HSA with 2k as well.

On average, I pay $800 a month for rent (this includes utilities as well), $400 a month on food, $100 a month on car expenses and transportation, and roughly $400 a month in miscellaneous/entertainment related expenses. I also have 11k in student loan debt (I pay the $200 monthly minimum payment and it has an average interest rate of 5.2%), along with $1500 in credit card debt (19% APR). 

After taxes and 401k/ROTH contributions, my monthly take home income is about $3,200. After taking out my monthly expenses, on average I have $1,100-$1,400 a month to save and invest.

I am looking for advice on how I am doing for my age and how I should continue to invest and save money so that I can hit my retirement goal. I am very ambitious, and at the same time, frugal with my money, so I believe I can retire at 55 (especially if I take my retirement and move to another country!). What should I do with my extra money to continue to drive towards that goal?",finance
investing,So is MoviePass a Ponzi scheme?,"Checking out [this topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/86kwsw/moviepass_drops_monthly_price_to_695_in_bid_to/), people are saying that MoviePass lowered its prices a little bit, but has been forcing everyone onto an annual pass rate, so you have to pay up front.

Thing is, your annual payment is going to keep MoviePass alive a little longer while they bleed out and desperately try to build up enough subscribers to convince investors to keep pumping money in with fresh loans. If MoviePass bleeds out, everyone who paid for those annual passes most recently gets stiffed and loses their money, while people who signed up in the past got to abuse the unsustainable prices.

New people buying in to support the previous people buying in sounds a bit like a Ponzi scheme, and eventually when the music stops, the new people who have X months left will just get nothing.",finance
personalfinance,Expat filing taxes in the USA (CAN),"I am a Canadian/ US dual citizen living in Canada permanently. As I have a US citizen ship I know I have to file federal taxes.

personalfinance,Need Some Advice On Structure My Mortgage,"First post in this subreddit and was hoping to get some financial insight. So here is my current situation:

I am 24 yrs old and about to purchase a house with my girlfriend this summer. We currently make about $110k per year and live in NJ (where property is very expensive). We are planning to purchase a house from my father that is currently a rental income for him and me because I actually own about 20% equity in the house already (I invested the money left to me by my parents for college savings since I ended up getting a full ride).

So after speaking with a trusted realtor and accountant, my father came up with a price of $350,000 for the house due to fair comps in the area as well as minimizing taxes paid on capital gains if he increased the price much more than that. This would mean that I currently own $70,000 worth of equity that I can use as a downpayment before we structure the mortgage. My father said he would also hold the mortgage for me and give me a very generous 3% interest rate just so he can continue to save for his retirement. This would work out to a 30 yr rate of $1,180 per month. Property taxes cost another $600 per month (good old NJ taxes...) and insurance is about $100 per month raising my total monthly payment to about $1880 without even considering utilities/cable/garbage/car/other fees. This seems a little steep for our current budget but the good thing is that we do not have any student debts.

That brings me to my question... I have been saving diligently over the past 8 years and living home so not paying rent. Combine that with the rest of the money left to me for college and I have about $130,000 in savings (mostly invested currently in ETF's and money market accounts earning around 5-10%). I was wondering if it would benefit me in the long run by putting an additional $70,000 or so on top of the $70,000 towards the mortgage to lower our payment to a more manageable $885 per month? Or maybe even restructure to a 15 or 20 year mortgage?

Or am I better off investing that money and saving it in case we need to do renovations?

Thank you!

personalfinance,How does NFCU Roth IRA work?,"To preface, I know the advice around here is to open with Vanguard or somewhere other than NFCU but that isn't the point of my question, I will look into the possibility of rolling over the account another time.

When I turned 18 my grandmother opened a Roth IRA for me with navy federal, however when accessing the account I never see any options for investment like I read Roths would have. So how does a NFCU Roth IRA make money? Is it automatic? or is there something I'm missing from the process that I should be selecting and the 5.5k in there isn't actually growing at all?

personalfinance,"[US-CA,AZ] Making sure I have my bases covered when amending my tax return.","**Background**
I’m trying to amend my federal tax return after realizing that turbotax filed the wrong federal form for the year 2014. It filed the regular 1040 instead of the 1040NR-EZ.  I was on a student visa (F1) for that year.  During the year I moved from AZ to CA in June(2014) so, the software also went ahead and filed a  140PY for AZ and a 540NR for California


**State returns**
**AZ**
 Since AZ [mandates](https://www.efile.com/arizona-state-tax-amendment-form/) filing a revised state tax form if I amend the federal return, I'm going to file the 140X as well. 

Q) Looking at my 2013 return, I filed a 140NR, so now I’m wondering whether I should file my 140X amendment as 140NR or 140PY? I didnt seem to understand which form to choose after reading through the instructions for both. 

 **CA**
My understanding is that CA does not treat non residents and part year residents differently. Both are required to file the Form 540NR, based on [this](https://www.ftb.ca.gov/forms/Which-Form-Should-I-File.shtml) . The software seemed to have file the correct form 540NR and since CA does [not mandate](https://www.ftb.ca.gov/forms/2014/14_540xins.pdf) filing an amendment unless a federal amendment causes a change in the CA state tax return . 
Q) Therefore, I would not be required to file an amended CA state tax return?
 &gt;Generally, if you filed federal Form 1040X, Amended U.S. Individual Income Tax Return, file Form 540X within six months unless the changes do not affect your 
 &gt;California tax liability

personalfinance,Recent college graduate w/ ~$6.5k in credit card debt. Is it a bad idea to take out a bank loan to pay off my credit cards?,"I just graduated in May and landed an insurance analyst job making $50k/yr back in November. Due to stupid decisions in college/traveling I basically maxed out all of my credit cards, and while I was looking for a job was really only able to make the minimum payments on them monthly. My student loan payments just began in December and between paying them, rent, car payment, health and dental ins, 401k, and various other necessities I find that I’m still unable to put as much money towards paying them off as I’d like to. My student loan payments thankfully have great low interest rates so I’m not concerned with them at the moment; paying the minimum monthly payment but I’m planning to partially snowball my payments of my credit cards into the loans as soon as they’re paid off. But it feels like I’m just burning money with the crazy high interest rates on my credit cards; even after following the advice of that post on here the other day to call and lower my APR for them the average is still about 21% APR per card. I feel like it might not be the worst idea to take out a personal loan to zero them out and then just make a single monthly payment on that at the new lower interest rate. I know it’s not an excessive amount of credit card debt and I could be a lot worse off but with my current income being stretched pretty thin it stings every time I see a large portion of my payments just going to accrued interest. Is this a good idea or am I missing something? And if it is, what are some of the more reputable institutions I can apply for a loan that have a reasonable interest rates? My credit score is 644, I only have about 4% of my total credit lines available but I have never missed a single payment. Any advice appreciated. 

EDIT: student loan debt is ~$80k split between public and private loans but the interest is only about 6.5% for both.",finance

personalfinance,"19 yo, Full Time Job, need help.","Okay, I just made this account to use at my work lol.
So about my job, I'm 19 and have worked at this place since I got out of high school (2016), I worked for like 6 months and made $20k, 2017 worked all year and made ~40k (I'm not entirely sure).
We make industrial type floor coatings and install them at various restaurants and production plants throughout the western us. I started installing as a labor, learned quite a bit, and got raised to $16/hr mid 2017. We often worked a lot of hours (100+) and we sometimes had a week or week and a half off duty. The reason I chose this job is because it's a small company and my dad has been working here for 16 years now, he raised me on this job and I know the owners, who are involved, very well. I think that my dad does okay for himself as he is the foreman for the install crew and is salaried right at $90k regardless of the hours he works or what he does. Toward the end of 2017, our sales rep (bosses SIL) announced he was moving to another company. I took the opportunity to talk to my boss and see if he would be open to training me and helping me take over for that position, to which he agreed. I moved into the office on the first monday of march (the 5th). My pay is at $16/hr. I can come in when i like (generally around 9) and leave when I like as well, same thing with lunch. I try and do 40 hours weekly and enjoy the benefits of being able to take off if I need to/want to a bit early etc.
My current pay is 640 a week, after a $30 weekly 401k contribution (3% employer match) and taxes (fed w/h, SS, Medicare) i take home $519.04 a week. I should also mention my company does provide medical and dental. (I don't pay anything). Also since I'm moving into sales I believe my commission is going to be somewhere around 5% but I do not want to count any of this into my earnings because that 5% on costs (1/2 the sale) is based solely on my performance selling jobs.

As far as savings and stuff, I blew through almost everything I've made since I began working. I saw my W-2 this year and got mad at myself for it. After almost 2 years of working at a job that pays better than most of my friends all I have to show for is a beat up 02 civic, an 87 caprice classic (was nice untill I hit a deer), $6.5k in savings that I don't touch for any reason, and the memories of good times with friends, cars that I destroyed, girls, eating out, movies, shopping etc.

Debts:
~$30k on a 2018 Subaru Impreza sport I just bought.
($480 monthly that begins 04/14/18)
$3,088 that will begin on 04/7/18 (I'm getting braces as this is something that I want to do for my image to help boost self esteem and feel more confident with myself (no one has told me anything yet but **I** dislike my teeth)
(2 x $200 + 24 x $112 monthly payments at a dental place)

Car: I bought the subaru for various reasons. While many of you might feel like reprimanding me for it and I totally understand why, I feel like I can justify this purchase well enough. I live in an area where we get a bunch of snow and Icy roads in the winter. An awd vehicle with studded tires is a godsend up here. The car is a 2.0 hatchback. A small naturally aspired 4 cyl engine won't be doing any insane speeds or anything so it will keep me out of trouble and safe. A hatch is good for groceries and carrying some light stuff around for when I do settle down and possibly have kids, I intend on keeping this car for at leas a decade. It's a very subtle car that will keep me out of trouble with the law. Subaru's are known for reliability and their safety (basically has an airbag curtain). While my beater 02 civic (Hood doesn't latch completely, left fender is fucked from a snow cable that broke, rear end is fucked from a truck that rear ended me last year) has 172k miles and is reliable (I am willing to hold a bet that it will get me coast to coast if anyone is interested), I am aware that I would be looked down upon If someone I was meeting with saw me pull up to a meeting or job walk through in that. That *is* one of the reasons I bought it as well but I do overall like the car and I am happy with my purchase. I have only used the car for work locally so far (maybe 40 miles in 3 weeks) and I have not spoken with my boss about a fuel card or car allowance. I do not want to be pushy on the matter but once he asks me to take it for a long drive for a project I will ask him for some sort of car allowance, the few times I drove my civic to projects when I was in the field, I was always given fuel, so I know that I am not expected to put my own fuel. Any advice on how to speak with him on car allowance is also greatly appreciated.

Expenses:
I still live with my parents as I have a good relationship with them as such I do not pay much as far as rent goes.
$95/mo phone bill (should drop ~$35 soon as I'm about to finish paying off my phone (S8+) and probably won't upgrade for a couple of years)
$120/ mo that I pay my mom for food a month (cheap asf god bless her)
$60/ mo that I pay my mom for doing my laundry
$100-250/ mo I handle the electricity bill and the water as well which varies. Overall I have $500 worth of expenses each month that can be categorized as ""rent""

Other stuff that I spend on is occasionally eating out or movies with my gf and gas of course although I do not track any of this for the most part (sorry will start now)(please advise on how to track). all I have at the moment is $1,165 in checkings and I will need to take from there to insure my car (my dad's going to put me on his insurance so shouldn't be that bad) hopefully I won't have to take from savings. Then next week I will have to register my car as well as plate it (somewhere around $400 according to my DMV's website.) so there goes my next paycheck lol. After next week I should be ready to start actually handling finances as well as improving my savings and getting on track financially.

I should mention that I didn't have much ""nice"" or ""office"" clothes before hand so I did go on a bit of a shopping spree before I moved into the office. I bought about 8 dress shirts (will be buying more soon), 4 jackets/blazers, and about 12 slacks, I already had one pair of dress shoes so I didn't purchase any more although I want to get another pair soon. I hope that you guys will be happy to know that I spent a grand total of $90 because I went thrifting for all this instead of buying new (probs over $900 all new). 

Goals:
I want to save up enough money to buy a double wide mobile home. My reasoning behind this is that I should be able to do this whilst living with my parents. Once I have the cash on hand to purchase a mobile home I can find a friend or 2 to rent out rooms too so as to not have to worry about lot rent etc since my ~$30k ""investment"" will generate this for me. Once I accomplish this I wish to grow as big of savings as I can to look towards buying a house without having to stress about selling my mobile home for a down payment. This will probably be once I settle down and decide to start a family. When I finally go to buy a house I would like to keep my mobile home to generate rent for me and help me with my mortgage payment. 

School:
I tried to go to community college for a bit and while I do good at school and I wouldn't consider myself dumb, I never liked school. I took honors and AP classes throughout high school so I have a few college credits but I just really do not want to go.

Career: As far as my overall career is concerned I am very happy where I'm at and I am aware that I will see increase in pay as I gain more experience. My boss has sort of guided me through what I should be doing and mostly lets me do my own thing in trying to find jobs and stuff. Next week he's going to be introducing me to some long term contacts. Although this is only my 3rd week I'm on the verge of closing a decent sized contract ($150k for about 7 days) so fingers crossed on that. I think I'm happy where I'm at currently and if in the future I'm not once I get some experience under my belt I may switch companies if I see that this place no longer benefits me.

What I need help with:
How do you guys recommend I handle my finances to better and quicker reach my goals. As well as any advice on saving some money without staying at home 100% of the time and not having a social life. Also any advice on how to speak with my boss on a car allowance is greatly appreciated, what are key points you guys think I should bring up and what seems like a fair rate to ask for.

Thank you all for taking the time to read all the way through, and thanks in advance for any and all the help! I will try to respond as much as I can and I will make sure to read through all of the replies.",finance
personalfinance,Are federal student loan offers estimates or can you specify exactly how much to take out?,"Like, instead of taking $5500 out in loans, is it possible to take out a specific number such as $5129?",finance
personalfinance,Would like an opinion on my current financial situation.,"Hi everyone. 

I graduated from college in December and accepted a job in Raleigh (NC) for $57k. Currently I'm paying: 

Rent: $830

Elec.: $100 (Only an estimate based off of my apartment in college. I havent gotten my first full bill yet.)

Car: $451

Internet: $50

Streaming services: $39 (I realize that this is a cost that could be removed, however, my dad and I have an agreement that he'll pick up the tab for my cell phone if I'll pay for their Direct TV now and hulu services, so I save quite a bit of money from this deal)

Renters Insurance: $18

Gym: $54 (Love to lift weights, chose this one because its located near my office and reasonably affordable compared to most places here.)

Parking: $40 (Really cant avoid this expense but my job supplies me with a $90/month parking stipend)

I currently budget $40 per month for gas (4 mile work commute plus very fuel efficient vehicle) and $200 per month for food (I set aside this amount so that I'll have enough that I wont starve but it leaves room to save money if I clip coupons, portion meals correctly, etc.).

A large chunk of my income will be going to student loans starting in June. I have $30k in federal loans in my name and $38k in parent plus loans that my mom took out under the agreement that I'd pay them back in order to try and get as low of an interest rate as I could. In order to afford the payment on both sets I've opted to consolidate each of the individual loans from both sets. Currently I will begin paying back the $30k in June at $198/month and the $38k in August at $330/month. 

The reason I opted for consolidation was so that I could pay a smaller payment now with the idea being that once I gained experience in my field, changed jobs for more money, got my professional engineering license, etc. I would be able to toss more money at them later. 

Lastly, I have $1500 on my Discover card from my last semester in college. I used it to buy books and a few other things I needed for classes. 

Currently I will bring home plus or minus $3300 per month and have planned on throwing $750 in both April and May at my credit card to get that debt paid off as quickly as possible. This leaves me with about $720 each month to do whatever with. What I currently plan on doing is placing $500 per month into my Discover savings account (1.5% interest) and leaving ~$220 in my checking account for any expenses that might come up, maybe a movie or a video game or something fun just to keep my sanity. Any money left over of that $220 at the end of the month will be deposited into my savings account with the $500 already set aside and I will start over with a fresh $220 at the beginning of the month. 

Once the credit card is paid off and my student loan payments start I will end up with approximately $950 each month. I was thinking I'll then keep $250 in checking and put the rest in savings until I have a decent sized emergency fund. Once I accomplished this I will reevaluate and go from there. 

So, what does everyone think? Does anyone see anywhere where I could possibly save a buck or two? Does this seem like a solid strategy? Instead of a savings account should I be placing that extra money elsewhere?

gaming,Gamers at the Bar; a review of gamers at an arcade bar,"Didn't really know how to title this or even what I want out of writing this, just over spending a good bit of time hanging at my local Arcade Bar I wanted to talk about it. Honestly I am just ranting point to point with no goal, just some thoughts I'd like some comments on. Thanks to anyone who reads all this.

First a quick funny story to try and hook you and a photo as proof. One day I am hanging at the bar drinking and it's about like 6-7ish, around when parents eat. Looking to the window to the street I notice a baby just giving me a stink eye standing in the middle of the bar. So I quickly try and get out my phone to take a picture. Sadly as you can see the little monster already started to take off. Luckily I got the phone out when I did cause no one else at the bar saw it. https://i.imgur.com/yobeqwb.jpg 

One thing I noticed is almost everyone has played some games to some level. Really apparently the only thing that separates a ""Gamer"" from everyone else is self labeling. Some times see people bring friends who literally sit on their phone playing games cause [""I'm not a gamer""](https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/7/71941/1526751-5.jpg) however mobile games are video games too! It actually makes me pretty sad as people are still excluding themselves from an entire format of media because of a sense of social acceptance or something and it is almost always a girl with her boyfriend, which promotes a bullshit stereotype that girls don't ever game or find it bad/nerdy. But, there is a silver lining sometimes, muscle memory! Many of these ""non-gamers"" haven't played any console video games since whatever was new when they were young. In fact many seem to have been pushed away from gaming due to friends or a sibling but for a short time they had it, and it creates an amazing thing to watch at the bar. 

So you are sitting there having a beer and suddenly a wild couple appears! The guy for whatever reason thinks an arcade bar is a good place to bring a girl who has never seemed to be into gaming. Rarely do you see the girls truly get annoyed, however due to the aforementioned history of childhood gaming the older games actually tend to be easier for these ""non-gamers"". And, I sit there watching a dude who started by ""Don't worry I'll go easy on you"" now put on the defensive as the girl dominates. Many of the guys haven't played these old games in a number of years but also never stopped playing new games. So if you are used to a FPS with 2 analog sticks right? Suddenly you are playing Golden Eye on N64, still think you are as good? Just the hand positioning needed to play is completely different from pretty much any modern shooter. Now add in bad graphics, not as perfect hitboxes, old mechanics, and so many other parts make it hard to go back. 

Overall I think the idea of Old vs New gamer is related heavily to Sixth Gen of gaming and if you started gaming heavily before or after those systems/years of gaming (from now on if I say old vs new gamer I mean that cut rather than actual age). Older gamers were raised on every game might have completely different controls rarely asking ""What are the controls"", where newer gamers tend to always ask without even trying a single command on the controller. Even getting out of the menu can confuse people cause it doesn't literally say ""Push start to begin"". Watch ""Sequelitis - Mega Man Classic vs. Mega Man X"" as it talks about some of these concepts in way more detail, but in short when you grow up basically turning on a game and being treated to ""FIGURE IT OUT YOURSELF!"" vs today where every time something new pops up there is a fucking freeze frame and a dialog box or a full on tutorial level. But, beyond the games themselves and the controllers we use there is also something else that happened in Sixth Gen that also seems to add to the disconnect. Online gaming and the ""Rule of Three"".

Biggest impact at the arcade is that older gamers will drink themselves stupid trying to re-beat an old game where modern gamers seem to get fed up quickly. So idk where I heard it first but the ""Rule of Three"" idea in gaming is that if anything takes a modern gamer more than three tries they will get mad and likely give up the game completely. Often I see people show up super excited to try out these classic games they've seen but never played and then after a few deaths or issues they right away ask for a new game. Many end up never playing a single game long enough to finish a drink. Some of the games I get, they are just legit annoyingly hard, but others it is like ""you did 100% the same thing every time and are annoyed at the game for sucking?"". Without the game saying ""hey, you know you can charge Mega Mans buster cannon"" they will never try it because why would they? Maybe it is just human stubbornness, but not trying new things in the games is really common. 

This one is really is specific and possibly relates to general stubbornness, but what is with players in racing games always treating the accelerator as an on/off switch. Doesn't really seem to matter the age, gender, or type of gamer some people just treat EVERY racing game this way. Anything from Mario Kart to Star Wars Pod-racing, [which at this bar has a really large late fee](https://i.imgur.com/GPoT1U3.jpg), they are sliding off the map or crashing because they are pushing down on the gas full force the entire time. Worst part being is you explain the controller is pressure sensitive and they will change nothing about how they play then when they fail again be like ""it didn't work!"". Though worst than that is the know it all gamers who show up. 

These are people, regardless of their actual experience gaming, who feel the need to tell others how to play. Now not talking advice or like ""did you know there is a hidden area to the left"" I mean people who even when you are owning in a game think they are better or know what you ""should"" be doing. As if they are really saying ""btw your fun is wrong"". In Mega Man X at this bar I actually have the good vs bad example of this; GOOD) so playing mega man and started a boss order different then the dude sitting next to me apparently likely, I know this cause we had a good convo about the various boss orders and what they mean, why each of us liked each style. BAD) I'm playing Armored Armadillo's stage and this guy is trying to tell me about the ""secrets"", sidenote I didn't have all the armor or heart tanks, as his advice isn't useful I go to finish the stage normally rather than doing the stuff for the hadouken, so the dude right away tries to grab the controller for me to ""show me how to play"". Moral of the story? People can play however the fuck they want even if they suck or don't do it the way you did, specially in a game like Mega Man X where the design is setup specially to allow players different methods to finish the game. 

Again don't really know if I had a point to this, more just wanted to see what other people thought or if they had their own arcade experiences and things they noticed about gamers in person. Lastly to reward you for reading this pointless random rant; here is a photo of a dog sitting at this Arcade Bar https://i.imgur.com/CCywkg7.jpg",technology
personalfinance,"[Retirement/Planning/Budgeting] First entry level job, question about 401k/IRA contributions","Background: 

I'm 28 years old, and I recently accepted an engineering position at a company making $70k per year (pre-tax), in a low cost of living city (my rent is only ~$600 per month including utilities, and I'm comfortable enough that I have no desire to spend more for a nicer apartment). My new salary is nearly triple what I've been making the last few years, and I'd like to put that surplus to good use. I already have an emergency fund worth ~4 months of expenses (parked in an Ally Bank account, APY ~1.35% last time I checked), in case that alters the advice anyone has.

I've made some mistakes in the past, so I have some high interest debt (~$2500 in credit card debt) to take care of before beginning contributions. I also have federal student loans, with the highest interest rates being 6.8% and 6% (the rest are under 5%).

The company offers a 5% match on the 401k, but it doesn't kick in until I've been there for a year. 

Questions: 

1) Obviously the CC debt should be eliminated first, but after that, should I begin contributing to my 401k, open an IRA (Roth or traditional) and contribute to that until the 5% match becomes available next year, or focus on further debt reduction?

2) I've heard that for younger, healthy workers an HSA is a good thing to look into early on. I don't know what the guidelines are for ""high deductible"" health plans, so I'm not sure I'd qualify based on the segment in [the chart](http://i.imgur.com/1rPEkGQ.jpg).",finance

Bitcoin,"Hello /r/Bitcoin, this is Jared &amp; Derek from the Digital Assets Coalition of America. We are a national group of lobbyists and crypto lovers fighting to restore like-kind transactions and lower capital gains. Join us for our AMA this Sunday at 1PM est!","**The AMA is live here:**
https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8722rj/hello_rcryptocurrency_we_are_the_digital_assets/

---

Before we were members of the Digital Assets Coalition of America (DAC), we watched as blockchain and distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) grew from proof-of-concepts to the powerhouses of innovation that they are today. Digital assets and distributed applications are revolutionizing the way the world does business, manage data, assign and validate ownership, provide accountability, auditing, and more. Simply put, within a sensible regulatory climate, DLTs can fuel the American economy for generations to come.


However, there’s an issue happening right now that we as a community must come together and resolve. The crypto community deals with an unacceptable lack of representation in the creation of the federal policies that regulate everything from ICO participation to tax policy.


In response, we formed a coalition of innovators, strategists, lobbyists, and educators to ensure representation on the issues that affect us all. Through public education campaigns, congressional workshops, and face-to-face interaction with legislators, we’re educating the federal government on DLTs to promote a favorable regulatory climate, facilitate informed policymaking, and secure the USA’s position as a global leader in the digital asset arena.


Our first policy objective is to instate crypto-to-crypto trades as like-kind transactions. With the passing of the new tax bill, like-kind transactions only apply exclusively to real estate exchanges. This change has resulted in an over-complicated reporting process that makes filing compliant taxes exceptionally difficult and inefficient. The new bill also opens the risk for traders and users to be hit with massive taxes that are potentially disproportionate with their true profits.


Note: While we have accounting partners who worked under the interpretation that because cryptocurrency is treated as property for federal tax purposes, then U.S. Code § 1031 *previously applied*, this cannot be confirmed without specific guidance from the IRS. -- **As always, trust your accountant(s).**


Secondly, we want to reduce the capital gains tax rate for both short and long-term digital asset holdings. With current policy, every time digital assets are used to make a purchase, or when digital assets are converted to fiat, high capital gains tax are assessed on any potentially derived profit. This financial burden disincentivizes spending crypto, acts as a barrier to adoption, and ultimately prevents crypto from ever benefiting the economy.


Our team is composed of experts such as Stephani Scruggs, who led the resistance to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) which resulted in nearly a dozen delayed Fast Track TPA votes and the ultimate demise of the TPA. Stephani has advised President Trump on international trade deals, currency manipulation, and the Chinese trade wars. She also has experience working closely with Congressional offices to strategize and develop international trade and economic policy, establishing her as a fountain of wisdom on Capitol Hill.


Or Michael Bowen, an international trade expert, whose organization advised the Trump campaign on trade agreements. Michael has also advised Congress on economics, housing development, international trade, and currency manipulation. Over the course of Michael’s career, he has negotiated over $1 billion in capital market transactions and implemented the largest affordable housing development in Hawaiian history.


Recently, we’ve on-boarded Frank McCarthy. After 20 years embedded in and advising on politics, media and policy making, as well as serving two House Transportation Committee Chairmen, Frank founded McCarthy Advanced Consulting (MAC). Frank uses his experience as a seasoned congressional staffer to run MAC, a nationally recognized lobbying firm that is known for helping unions fight above their weight class.
We want to make sure you’re a part of this process. We want you to ask us questions during the AMA this Sunday (the 25th) at 1PM est, but in the meantime, we have a few for you! 


1. Do you know of any industry leaders that you would like us to reach out to?

2. What policy would you like to see changed or put into law?

3. Do you have a thorough understanding or access to the resources necessary to pay taxes associated with your cryptocurrency?

4. What is your favorite cryptocurrency use-case?

5. What websites or publications do you use to stay updated on cryptocurrency news?

We look forward to seeing you Sunday at 1PM est! We'll be updating this post with the AMA link.

* I'm 27
* Mom passed away June 2017
* I make about $44k/yr and fiancee makes $40k/yr
* $180,000 in 401(k) from Employer A
* $11,000 in 401(a) from Employer A
* Took 401(a) as a lump sum (Fed 20% / State 5%) 
* Took $180,000 as a lump sum (Fed 20% / State 5%)
* With taxes taken out, I had a LS of $135,000 of which $40,000 went to an Inherited IRA and $95,000 went to me in cash
* With cash, I paid off all of my debts and all of my mom's debts and maaaaybe did some shopping :)

Questions:

* I live in CO, I know I don't have to give the state any inheritance, so does that money just come back to me in my state tax returns or did I just give the state my money out of the goodness in my heart? The reason I did that was to prevent me from touching it lol
* Fidelity is now telling me I have to take RMD's from the IRA since it was an inherited sum and went into an IRA - BDA. That was the $40,000. First, did I have to rollover the $40k into an IRA BDA and why couldn't I have put it into another qualified plan like my own 401(k) or traditional IRA? I'm aware of the limitations of IRA contributions, do 401(k)'s work the same? Second, now that I have to take RMD's, what happens now? Am I forced to take RMD's for the rest of my life (to avoid addt'l tax penalties) or can I take the money and put it elsewhere? Will that have tax implications? I would gladly take all of the IRA-BDA, make the 2018 contributions to my HSA, Roth, and Trad. IRA, and take the rest cash, or would that put me in a bad tax position?

I'm sure I have more but I'll wait and see the responses before I ask. Thanks in advance for the help!!! I am lucky enough to have worked at a bank for 3 years and in retirement administration for another 3, so I know a decent amount but I'm certainly no expert.",finance

personalfinance,"Traditional 401k vs Roth IRA vs Roth 401k; and, how am I doing?","Hi everyone! I'm a big fan of r/personalfinance, and I wanted to get some other eyes on my current financial situation.

I’m 23, and I make 55k/year. I’m in the biotech industry.

I have $18,000 in a checking account. 

I owe $19,000 in student loans at a rate of 3-4.5% (I have three different loans, each with its own interest rate). The minimum payments are 300/month. I’ve been paying these down pretty aggressively since I got this job when I graduated college last year, but not consistently- I put an extra $1000 in when I got my tax return, for example, or when I really wanted to purchase something but decided to contribute to my student loans instead. I have no other debts.

I contribute 5% of my salary to a Roth 401K, starting in January of this year. I’ve built up ~$500 in there. My employer does not match, but they do cover all of the fees associated with the 401k. 
I also have an HSA that my employer contributes about $200/month to that I opened in January. I don’t make payments into this account, but it’s at about $500 right now as well. 

I bring home $3,500/month after 401k contributions. I live in a high cost of living area; after my student loan minimum payments, 401k contributions, rent, travel, etc., I’m left with about 500/month. I could live more frugally in order to bring that number up significantly, but I value traveling, and I don’t really see a need to cut that out of my life, since it fits into my paycheck.

A representative from my company’s 401k provider came to give a talk today. I’m a big fan of r/personalfinance, and was convinced that the only right option was to open a roth IRA and max it out, and maybe consider contributing to a 401k after that. I asked him about whether they offered roth IRAs, and he tried pretty hard to sell me on contributing more to my 401k instead. He said that the only thing that I really lose from utilizing a 401k over an IRA is a bit of control over how my money is being invested. Now, while I’m interested in thinking about my financial situation, I’m not really in a position where I would feel more comfortable managing my retirement fund over someone who’s paid to manage a retirement fund, and I would be happy to defer to that person’s judgment. But I also know that it’s probably in that representative’s best interest to convince people to contribute as much as possible to their 401ks, so I wanted to bias-check that here. 

I’ve been thinking about what to do with the money in my checking account. I want to move some of it into a savings account as my emergency fund. I was planning on moving some portion of it into an IRA, but I’m no longer certain that this is the best option for me. 

I also am not sure about what to do with the extra $500 a month. I just upped my automatic student loan payments to $600/month; is that the best use of my funds? Should I increase my 401k contributions instead? Should I switch from a Roth to a traditional 401k?",finance

personalfinance,I'm new graduate and I'll be starting a job that pays 200k per year. I have massive expenses and need help with budgeting.,"A few numbers have been changed to preserve anonymity, but the basic information is the same

**Current situation**

I'm 27 and I've been in university for the last 8 years, primarily focusing on my degree, research, and internships. I've financially supported myself through student loans, scholarships, and assistance from family. 


I'm in a medium cost of living area and I have a budget of $2,500 per month.  I live with roommates and my rent is $600. I'm spending approximately $1,900 on other basic expenses such as car, food, entertainment, etc. Other than an emergency fund of 6k, I have no savings. 


My budget allows me to have a decent lifestyle. I'm not struggling to buy food or pay rent, but I cannot spend money on luxuries. My brother is one of my roommates and I pay for some of his expenses such as food, internet, and utilities. I'm able to eat out 1-2 times a week at medium priced restaurants (such as Dennys), go to the pub once a week, and one vacation a year (Christmas). I have an 18 year old car worth roughly $3,000 and a few tech gadgets worth $3,000. 


**Expected earnings and expenditure** 

I'm about to graduate and I have a job that pays around 200k (see below) for my 1st year. My compensation goes down because these are guaranteed earnings and my bonuses for 2nd, 3rd, and 4th year will not be decided until I finish my 1st year. These amounts assume that I contribute 18k to my 401k because they will add additional 9k . It's very likely that my compensation will increase by roughly 10-30k every 2 years until I reach 350k to 400k. 


Year | Amount | Notes | After tax income
----|------|-----|----------------
1 | 198k  | Includes 50k signing bonus with first pay check | 127k
2 | 172k | Partial bonus guaranteed | 112k
3 | 157k | No guaranteed bonuses | 102k
4 | 157k | No guaranteed bonuses | 102k




Expense | Amount | Notes
-------|------|-----
Student loans | 162k | Currently at 6.2% interest. When I pay off 25% of my loan, my company will pay any interest over 1% for 5 years. This is assuming that I'm still working at the company.
Family loans | 67k | From my dad and uncle. Both are 2.5% interest to keep up with inflation. There's no rush to pay them off, but I want to be fair and return it as soon as reasonably possible.

I'm putting 27k into 401k every year. I know that this amount is supposed to be pre-tax, but I'll make it post tax to make things a bit simpler (and have some additional savings). Furthermore, it's 27k instead of 18k because I factored my company's contribution into my compensation package. 

After my basic expenses, I'll be left with 34k per year for non-routine expenses. How should I spend this money? What should I pay off first? Should I plan for anticipated compensation increase over the years? Any advice is greatly appreciated!

personalfinance,"Crushing debt, owe the IRS and student loans","I just filed my federal income tax return and I owe the IRS money. I am not able to pay the IRS, as I'm barely afloat because of my significant monthly student loan payments. What is the best option for me?

I made $33k doing contract work this past year. Due to a serious vehicle-related financial hardship in the fall, I had to pay approximately $11,500 out of my savings account. I was planning to put half into my IRA (first year I've had one) and spend the other half on my self-employment taxes, and take the Saver's Credit and owe like $300 income taxes. However, it didn't go as planned and I did not pay self-employment taxes on my earnings (yes, I did not file quarterly taxes because I couldn't project how much I'd be making with the multiple, unstable contracts I had this year, and I didn't have enough money to pay at opportune times, it was feast and famine this year). They equate to approximately $3779 for social security and $884 for medicare. I owe $2956 in income taxes after all of my self-employment deductions. So, I owe the IRS $7619. 

I owe $95,000 in private student loans, for which I pay $887 a month. I owe $30,000 in federal student loans, for which I'm on an income-based repayment plan of $0. I can't skip my student loan payment because my father is a co-signer and it would hurt his credit, he would find it very difficult to pay my bill also, and I would feel incredibly bad to pull him into my hardship. My co-signer gets released in three more years (thankfully).

I haven't gotten any notices/bills yet. I've been reading the IRS site going round and round in circles trying to find a solution, forgiveness, or way to stall. I am working incredibly hard to increase my earning, but I don't think I'll have the extra money this spring. I have $1000 in my checking account but I need that for upcoming rent and other basic costs of life. My living expenses are as minimal as I can make them before finding a free closet to live in and skipping meals - including my $887 student loan payment, I live for $2000 a month (not saving for the future anymore, I get kicked off of my father's health insurance plan later this year when I turn 26).

I am 25 years old, and it's been two years since I graduated college with a BSc in computer science. Jobs are extremely competitive in my area, and I have only been able to land temporary contracts. I am actively interviewing at companies and trying to find a salaried job, which as anyone can image who's done multiple programming tests in one week AND works AND has a lot of debt, is incredibly stressful. Frankly, I am depressed and burnt-out.

Has anyone been in this situation and survived? Should I continue to be honest with IRS, but pursue an Offer in Compromise? I am scared to enter a payment plan because I honestly don't think I could pay more debt a month than I currently am, without impacting my health, and I might need that ten year statute of limitations.",finance
personalfinance,Using a heloc to pay of credit cards?,"Hello Reddit! I'm trying to figure out the best option for paying off my and my wife's credit debt. 

As it sits right now we have roughly 20k between credit cards and my tool bill(autobody technician here) and between the two of us we make a little over 100k so I'm able to throw quite a bit of money at the debt, and usually pay about 300 a week to it. The question I have is since the interest is pretty high on most of it, should I look into a home equity line of credit to try to get everything consolidated and make one low interest payment? Or should I try to find a zero interest credit card (or 2 or 3) and go that route? I'm not well versed in how helocs work per se, but I've been told they're usually a good way to get a low interest rate and pay off big bills. I already pay an extra 1-200 a month to my principal while saving over 1k to my 401k and Roth IRA, and I'd like to try to get rid of this debt by the end of the year if possible so my 30's can be debt free(minus the house).

energy,I had this idea and I was hoping you could tell me all the things that are wrong with it.,"Two problems of the myriad of potential problems the world could face in the near future are the possible collapse of privatized central banking from loss of faith in the US dollar and climate change. The idea is to take out one final massive IOU from the federal reserve and invest it into the construction of the largest green energy grid ever made all throughout and around the US. Designed by the most brilliant minds in the world. The energy generated by the grid is used and excess is stored to be used to back our dollar by a public owned central banking system. Everyone who can prove they have something to lose from the idea could be issued bonds that mature at a time that analysts project the country would be able to pay it back.

EDIT: The holes you've made are good. It's highly appreciated, and I just want to acknowledge that, so thanks ^_^. You're probably right about a lot of it. I'm only 24, and I'm still in the process of gaining an education. Just like every other sane person though, I realize there are too many things in the world I don't fully understand, so I try to collaborate with other people. The problems I'm trying to address are just possibilities that in my personal opinion are likely, but nobody can tell the future with true %100 certainty. I do understand that only the people who agree with that notion would be even mildly intrested. It's radical and therefore crazy, just like all other big changes made in society. I would be eternally grateful if you could find credible reading materials for me to better understand your points. 
I'll offer as many lines of thought behind the ideas features, and modifications to the idea, as I can form (If I'm wrong please tell me, and either provide some kind of factual resources supporting the point being made or an alternative solution that you've come up with yourself). I welcome and encourage all 2nd, 3rd, and 4th (etc.) party recommendations to the idea as that is the best way I know of for an idea to evolve.

Inflation:  My line of thinking on this is that energy is something we all use and consume. As long as it's not being released into the market faster than it's produced inflation would not be an issue, right?

Storage: I'm not fully aware of what new technologies are out, or what their capabilities are. However, I know there are a great variety of options out there to be looked at. This is why I think that much greater minds than mine would be needed in this endeavor.

Banking &amp; Economic related issues: I've read that it's uncommonly known to many how our money system works, but I'm not an expert, and I don't claim to be. I'd very much so like to further discuss these things with a few actual experts of varying opinions, because from what I've read in articles and seen in interviews/documentaries so far... well it doesn't look good.

CryptoCurrency,2018's Bull Run On the Way! A *MUST READ* Analysis,"Disclaimer: DYOR and only trade on your own accord. I am currently not invested in BTC or LTC. This is just my opinion. 

So...I want to tell you why I think crypto's bull run is about to start from both a fundamental and technical viewpoint. Here we go!

Fundamentals: 

Well, cryptocurrencies are currently undergoing a massive adoption period. Whereas the previous bull run was largely based on speculation and perceived value, this bull run will largely be dependent on use cases. Cryptocurrencies as a whole are gaining media attention every day. CNBC recently had a ""Fast Money Goes Crypto"" episode, Forbes &amp; Bloomberg have at least one article on Bitcoin a day, I recently saw an IBM Blockchain ad on national television, and Trump even banned purchases of Venezuela's shitcoin (although this may look bad if someone doesn't know what crypto is). People are becoming more aware of crypto as a part of everyday life, even if the initial Bitcoin hype-train has died down. Litecoin and several other cryptos have launched payment processors that make it much easier for merchants and retailers to accept cryptos as real methods of payment. 

Moreover, given the additional attention that the United States' state and federal governments have paid to the market, crypto has gained legitimacy. A few states have now begun to accept tax payments in crypto, and the SEC has stated it would likely take a ""regulate, don't hinder approach."" Combined with the recent statements from the Congress' economic report on cryptos, the state of the market is overall bullish.

Finally, the largest exchange, Binance, is moving to Malta in an attempt to avoid excessive regulations from the HK government. They have also announced a MAJOR development with possible altcoin/USD fiat pairing in the near future. This is yet another bullish event for all of crypto.

Now for the technical analysis...

I will be using BTC and LTC charts to further support my points. (I believe these are given the most legitimacy by their exposure and fiat pairing on Coinbase. I am avoiding ETH because I have a few fundamental issues with it.)

Bitcoin: https://www.tradingview.com/x/KH05w6Ln/

You see that bull flag on the hourly? It feeds into this inverse head and shoulders. --&gt; https://www.tradingview.com/x/mQyJpScu/

Now you see that inverse head and shoulders, it feeds into this inverse H&amp;S. --&gt; https://www.tradingview.com/x/ZmyPKYpZ/

Now you see that inverse H&amp;S? It feeds into THIS inverse H&amp;S! --&gt; https://www.tradingview.com/x/yaoFHvea/

Now you see that inverse H&amp;S? Look at it again. The neckline forms the resistance line of an absolutely gigantic symmetrical triangle. The lower support line of the symmetrical triangle of the symmetrical triangle is a very long-term support line. 

So what does this all mean? Bitcoin is all about the fractals! It's insane how many inverse head and shoulders patterns are feeding into each other, not to mention the huge symmetrical triangle that is forming the neckline. A breakout from the small bull flag in the right shoulder could set off a chain reaction resulting in a ton of successively larger breakouts. Given that these are all bullish formations, this is giving us a STRONG signal that BTC is headed up to possible new ATHs from here.

You know what else? A very influential trader named Peter Brandt said that trades really work when all of the timeframes line up. Well, guess what...all of these formations are currently being validated by bullish MACD crossovers across all timeframes! Even the daily chart, which has been stuck in a bearish MACD crossover this whole bear market, recently crossed over in a bullish manner. 

Further proof: https://www.tradingview.com/x/BmRfYDlX/

You see Litecoin's chart? THE EXACT SAME FORMATIONS ACROSS THE BOARD! The future of crypto is in the charts, it's in the symmetry, and it's all around us.

I'll update as we go. If I'm wrong, I will admit that I'm wrong, but I am highly bullish as of now. We've gone through our moon, our retracement, and our consolidation. Now it's time to start a new chapter in crypto, one of mass adoption. There's beauty in the charts. Keep an eye out for the breakouts! Good luck all, happy trading, happy HODLing, happy whatever! :)

TL;DR: Extreme confidence in bullishness.

Update: Seems like there’s always a price drop in the late night/early morning hours. It’s almost like the bears read my post and are intentionally trying to ruin my reputation. Good news is, even if the bull flag is invalidated by the close of the next candle, we still have all of the inverse head and shoulders patterns that tell us a reversal is in the cards. 

Point of emphasis: If you use TA, you should technically only make a trade after a successful breakout. We still have to see at least one inverse H&amp;S pattern break through the neckline. Inverse head and shoulders patterns are only invalidated if the price on the shoulder extends lower than the head. That being said, a little price drop in BTC does not immediately discount or invalidate all of what I said either. My prediction is that a large bull run will come soon. A small drop is insignificant in the context of what I’m putting out there.

Updated Chart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/z0Twq2Or/

We need to see a rebound off the bottom of the triangle and a completion of the right shoulder of the inverse head and shoulders. If we fall through the bottom of the triangle, rapid selling will ensue and we will probably see the death of many cryptos. If we do fall through, I would consider a leveraged short position because it is highly likely BTC drops to rock bottom.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,"Hello /r/CryptoCurrency, this is Jared &amp; Derek from the Digital Assets Coalition of America. We are a national group of lobbyists and crypto lovers fighting to instate like-kind transactions and lower capital gains. Join us for our AMA this Sunday at 1PM est!","**The AMA is live here:**
https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8722rj/hello_rcryptocurrency_we_are_the_digital_assets/

---

Before we were members of the Digital Assets Coalition of America (DAC), we watched as blockchain and distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) grew from proof-of-concepts to the powerhouses of innovation that they are today. Digital assets and distributed applications are revolutionizing the way the world does business, manage data, assign and validate ownership, provide accountability, auditing, and more. Simply put, within a sensible regulatory climate, DLTs can fuel the American economy for generations to come.


However, there’s an issue happening right now that we as a community must come together and resolve. The crypto community deals with an unacceptable lack of representation in the creation of the federal policies that regulate everything from ICO participation to tax policy.


In response, we formed a coalition of innovators, strategists, lobbyists, and educators to ensure representation on the issues that affect us all. Through public education campaigns, congressional workshops, and face-to-face interaction with legislators, we’re educating the federal government on DLTs to promote a favorable regulatory climate, facilitate informed policymaking, and secure the USA’s position as a global leader in the digital asset arena.


Our first policy objective is to instate crypto-to-crypto trades as like-kind transactions. With the passing of the new tax bill, like-kind transactions only apply exclusively to real estate exchanges. This change has resulted in an over-complicated reporting process that makes filing compliant taxes exceptionally difficult and inefficient. The new bill also opens the risk for traders and users to be hit with massive taxes that are potentially disproportionate with their true profits.


Note: While we have accounting partners who worked under the interpretation that because cryptocurrency is treated as property for federal tax purposes, then U.S. Code § 1031 *previously applied*, this cannot be confirmed without specific guidance from the IRS. -- **As always, trust your accountant(s).**


Secondly, we want to reduce the capital gains tax rate for both short and long-term digital asset holdings. With current policy, every time digital assets are used to make a purchase, or when digital assets are converted to fiat, high capital gains tax are assessed on any potentially derived profit. This financial burden disincentivizes spending crypto, acts as a barrier to adoption, and ultimately prevents crypto from ever benefiting the economy.


Our team is composed of experts such as Stephani Scruggs, who led the resistance to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) which resulted in nearly a dozen delayed Fast Track TPA votes and the ultimate demise of the TPA. Stephani has advised President Trump on international trade deals, currency manipulation, and the Chinese trade wars. She also has experience working closely with Congressional offices to strategize and develop international trade and economic policy, establishing her as a fountain of wisdom on Capitol Hill.


Or Michael Bowen, an international trade expert, whose organization advised the Trump campaign on trade agreements. Michael has also advised Congress on economics, housing development, international trade, and currency manipulation. Over the course of Michael’s career, he has negotiated over $1 billion in capital market transactions and implemented the largest affordable housing development in Hawaiian history.


Recently, we’ve on-boarded Frank McCarthy. After 20 years embedded in and advising on politics, media and policy making, as well as serving two House Transportation Committee Chairmen, Frank founded McCarthy Advanced Consulting (MAC). Frank uses his experience as a seasoned congressional staffer to run MAC, a nationally recognized lobbying firm that is known for helping unions fight above their weight class.

We want to make sure you’re a part of this process. We want you to ask us questions during the AMA this Sunday (the 25th) at 1PM est, but in the meantime, we have a few for you! 


1. Do you know of any industry leaders that you would like us to reach out to?

2. What regulatory policies affecting cryptocurrency would you like to see changed or put into law?

3. Do you have a thorough understanding or access to the resources necessary to pay taxes associated with your cryptocurrency?

4. What is your favorite cryptocurrency use-case?

5. What websites or publications do you use to stay updated on cryptocurrency news?

We look forward to seeing you Sunday at 1PM est! We'll be updating this post with the AMA link.

I have about ~$12,500 in the bank right now and I'm waiting to pull the trigger on maxing out my Roth IRA for the previous year, with a smaller contribution to my student loans, or paying the majority to student loans.

personalfinance,Unique student loan question / strategy,"Background: 
I graduated college in 2016, got an okay job in my field. Recently I got a better job and I make 70,000 pre tax. I’m currently in school getting my masters, which my job pays for. 
I started with just shy of 100,000 in student loans, with about a 50/50 mix of government and private. 

Strategy:
I’ve paid down about 20,000 since graduating on the private ones. My minimum payment is 390 just for private, the government ones are deferred since I’m getting my masters. I was stressing when I thought about them kicking in and I’ll be paying ~800 a month in student loans. 

So my strategy is to use the money my job gives me for school, to pay off my private loans. I will eliminate them, and then just do income based for the rest of the  government loans.  I will qualify for PAYE, and plan to do this one. I know it’s for 20 years, but there’s a good chance I’ll work for the government in the future and do the 10 year PSLF. 

Question: should I use my employers tuition payment and pay down my older private loans. Then just take out more federal loans. Since I will be doing income based the extra student loans won’t matter as I’ll be income based. Once the private loans are paid off just keep taking out federal loans and banking the money for school. Again as this won’t factor in to my monthly payment since IBR (PAYE, yes I’m eligible for this). 

Does this sound like a solid plan as I have a high amount of federal loans already??",finance

personalfinance,Student Loans and Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF),"I recently got accepted into my dream college for the fall class of 2018 to study engineering, and I have some questions regarding financial aid and PLUS loans. 
	

My package was $11,250 broken down by Federal Direct Sub ($3,500) and Unsub Loans ($2,000) combined for both semesters, and $3,750 via the College Grant. The estimated net cost owed to the college is $37,360, and if I get federal work-study ($2,000), and take out the loans ($5,500) that brings it down to $29,860. My parents are willing to contribute $10,000, and after my summer internship, I will most likely be able to put $5,000 towards school, thus bringing down the net cost to $14,860 for my first year. 
	

With regards to the remaining $14,860, I would like to take this money out myself in loans if at all possible because I don’t want to place the financial burden on my parents (via federal sub, and unsub loans), however I am not entirely sure if there is a way for me to do this. Is there an option for me to take out this money in my own name? I don’t have a credit score yet due to not having a credit card (although I think I will get one this summer). 
	

If not, it seems that the next option would be for my parents to take out PLUS loans. It’s my understanding that if my parents were to take out a plus loan per year they could have the option to defer the payment’s until I get out of college (however the loans would accumulate interest), and then start to pay them back, as well as consolidate the loans taken out per year into Federal Direct Loans due to my mother works for my state’s department of education as a teacher qualifying for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF). If she was to consolidate  $60,000 PLUS loans (over the course of 4 years) into a Federal Direct Loan, what would be the best way to minimize monthly payments so that she can pay the least amount over the course of the 120 payments (10 years) so that the loan forgiveness would be maximized?”
	

Continuing on this question, even though she will have to sign for the PLUS Loan, turned Federal Direct Loan, would there be a way for me to help in monthly payments other than just giving them money? 
	

Any help on the questions above is much appreciated!",finance

personalfinance,Please help me decide on an investment.I have No idea what to do.,"Hey guys, long time lurker here. I have a real big dilemma about an investment and I don’t know what to do. 

A little background info first: I live in a third world country in Central America, in this region, banks loan money at usurious rates. 15% to 18% for a mortgage, if it’s your second property. There’s a special fund for people who don’t own any property, you apply for 11.50% mortgage which is still ridiculous and anywhere from 20 to 30% interest on personal loans, credit card aprs are 50%. I am telling you all these so you can understand why banks here in my region are able to pay out such high interest rates on your money.

I bought a brand new small 2-bedroom townhouse about 4 years ago for $55,000 dollars, I’ve put about $8,000 of work in improvements. I don’t know much about the real estate market and appreciation, but let’s say it’s now worth $65,000 dollars. I gave a $21,097 down payment and got a 11.50% mortgage, my monthly payment is at $329 dollars.  I rent it out for $295 dollars, I use a management company so I don’t have to deal with tenants, the company charges me $29 dollars a month. So end of the month I’m left with $266 dollars. In case you’re wondering why I’m not charging more for rent, these are the market rates, I will ask for $337 dollars once the contract with my current tenant is up (If I ask for more might take much longer time to get it rented out) but even with that amount I’m still not cash flowing. I only owe $14,767 on my mortgage so I calculate I will have it payed off by January or February of 2019.

So here’s where my question comes in, If I sell my house for $65,000, minus the $14,767 I owe on my mortgage, I will be debt free and have $50,233 dollars left over to invest, which I want to put into a fixed rate deposit at my credit union, which gives 12% interest for any amount over $42,000 dollars, going with credit union because banks only gives 9%. So for $50,233 I would be getting a monthly check for $502 dollars. Just FYI these are considered safe investments, it’s how people invest here.

But everyone keeps telling me, no man that stupid, there’s no better investment than real estate. That property is going to be worth 2 to 3 times what you paid for it in 10 years because it’s a really good location. A house will protect you from depreciation and inflation, if you sell it your dumb, it doesn’t matter if it makes less money as a rental or if you get double the money in another investment, in a couple of years it’s going to be worth so much more, don’t sell it especially when your almost done paying it off. That $50,233 is going to be worth less because of depreciation etc etc…

So I have no idea what to do, I wanted to do the fixed rate investment; but now I’m not sure because everyone I asked for advice tells me the same thing, real estate is the best investment there is, but these people are not experts on investing, just friends and people I work with. So I wanted to ask here, to the people who know what they are talking about and have lots of experience investing, please help me make a decision because I’m lost on what to do. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, Thanks!!!",finance

CryptoCurrency,Blocks for Good - Humanitarian Applications of Blockchain Review #1 - AID:Tech,"[Steemit summary here](https://steemit.com/blockchain/@starthere/blocks-for-good-humanitarian-applications-of-blockchain-review-1-aid-tech)

With my background in the humanitarian field, I'm interested in how blockchain technology might be used to make the world a better place.  This post represents my first ""review"" of  start-ups that focus on social good, specifically related to humanitarian action.

Perhaps not as sexy as these omnipresent crypto reviews or ICO hyping sessions, but I'd like to shed some light on groups who aim to use emerging blockchain technology to make the world a better place.

An important distinction:  fundraising for a one-off cause or event is relatively easy and there are tons of non-blockchain platforms that already exist.  In my mind, this falls into the charity category.  I'm looking past merely short term or event specific fundraising to highlight outfits that are looking to bring significant change to the humanitarian system overall.

With that as background, let's dive in.  

Today I'd like to highlight **AID:Tech.**

**The Problem(s)**

AID:Tech is a for profit Irish startup which aims to tackle two major issues: corruption/fraud in humanitarian aid and the vast number of individuals on the planet who lack a legal identity.

*Corruption/fraud:*  AID:Tech references a statement in 2011 from then United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon who estimated that “corruption prevented 30 percent of all development assistance from reaching its final destination.”  While I believe this number is severely inflated (there are no reliable figures on how much aid is lost to corruption as it's notoriously hard to track - estimates are all over the place, from 2.5% to 70%) most will admit that corruption and fraud are in fact an issue.  While there are more anti-fraud measures in place than ever before, there is definitely much more the international community could do to clamp down on corruption.  (Counterpoint:  [some have argued that there has been an over emphasis on preventing corruption at the expense of positive humanitarian or development outcomes](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2017/08/04/539285319/is-corruption-really-a-big-problem-in-foreign-aid))

*Lack of Legal Identity:*  The other major problem that AID:Tech is trying to address is the fact that there is a massive amount of people alive on the planet today that can not prove their identity.  Although AID:Tech again exaggerates the problem (the number of people AID:Tech claim do not have means to prove their identity - 2.4 billion - is based on a 2014 estimate.  The latest 2017 [data from the World Bank](http://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/id4d) estimate a figure closer to 1.1 billion people) this issue still affects 1 out of every 7 people on earth.  Imagine the difficulty accessing health or financial services after fleeing a war zone with no time to collect your documents or having everything you own swept away by a natural disaster leaving you without a way to prove your identity. Imagine the difficulty in accessing educational opportunities or other social services.  Imagine trying to travel or enter another country as a refugee.  

**The Solution**

AID:Tech aims to use blockchain technology to make aid more transparent and efficient, tracking donated funds at every point in the journey in real time.  In 2015, they worked with the Irish Red Cross to deliver support to Syrian refugees in Lebanon using their core technology.  AID:Tech claims this was the first time that international aid was delivered using blockchain technology.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QkW9xAemtw

Because the distribution of aid was tied to an identity card provided to the beneficiaries, AID:Tech effectively hit two birds with one stone: they issued identity cards to the identity-less which were immediately used to receive aid.  Both sets of information (identity and aid distribution details) were stored immutably on the blockchain.

The pilot in Lebanon appeared to go extremely well.  $10,000 was given to 100 Syrian families to use at a local grocery store.  As the beneficiaries purchased items with vouchers, every transaction was tracked and recorded on the blockchain in real time.  They tested the system by creating twenty fake vouchers, all of which failed.  

If the system is able to handle up-scaling, it would have massive implications in terms of transparency and efficiency of aid delivery (not to mention making corruption more difficult) all while supporting the identity establishment process.

**Partnerships and Awards**
Since 2015, AID:Tech has been busy building partnerships to help them scale up: International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, PricewaterhouseCoopers, UN Development Program, and The Rockefeller Foundation to name a few.

They've also been busy winning an impressive amount of awards and did especially well last year: IBM's #1 Global Startup (2017), Citi Tech4Integrity Global Game Changer Award (2017) (DigiByte was up for this award as well I believe), Startup Europe Award National Winner in Social Category (2017), and UN Global Compact Sustainable Development Goals Pioneer for Blockchain Technology (2017).

**The Bottom Line**
AID:Tech has the potential to make a large and very positive impact in how aid is delivered while simultaneously supporting the identity-less.  They've established some impressive partnerships, which will be critical to if they are to achieve scale.  

I would advise them to do their due diligence when it comes to stating the problem - they need to be careful about overstating the need when it's not really necessary - the needs are massive as they are and don't need to be exaggerated!  

Other than that, AID:Tech appear to be a solid startup, staffed with people who appear to be motivated by a desire to make a positive impact on the world - with a specific focus on extremely vulnerable populations.  They're doing some very exciting work towards solving some very real problems in the humanitarian sector.  With the latest string of awards and partnerships they seem to have a bit of momentum which is cause for optimism.  It seems like quite an exciting time for AID:Tech - I will be following their progress with great interest going forward.",cryptocurrency

I will be putting 6% of my income into my company 401k which will be 50% matched by my employer for the first two years and then increase to 75% after that.

personalfinance,Embarrassingly Bad Situation; Recently Divorced 28yo,"So I’ve been married for 9 years and was together for 13, I completely relied on my wife’s steady income and credit cards to carry me through a very lackluster time in college in terms of maintaining a steady job.  We racked up a bunch of credit card debt and took out significantly more in student loans than the education cost to live off of while we were in college, mostly due to me blowing money on idiotic things and not keeping a steady job...which I justified by thinking, “oh well, I’m in college!  I’m working towards a degree and we will be making ridiculous money once we graduate!”  Hah.  That didn’t happen, at least not for me.  I didn’t finish my degree (Parks and Rec Mgmt). 

My wife divorced me, for some obvious reasons among others not mentioned, recently and I’m just now fully comprehending the situation I’ve put myself into. 

I’m working a 1099 seasonal job right now and doing my own small lawn and landscape business.  Hoping to obtain a $15-$17/hr job that’s full time, year round towards the end of this season and work on building my business up over the next few years. 

Right now I’m bringing home $600/wk (non taxed) from the 1099 job and somewhere between $250-$800/wk from my own small business.  With the season picking up soon I’m hoping it will be more like $600-$900/wk from April until September and maybe around $200-$500/month from October till next March. 

My monthly expenses are around $2,000. 

I owe my wife $8,000 as my half of the remaining credit card debt. 

I own my truck. 

I’m renting a 1 bedroom apartment and my food bill is about as cheap as can possibly be to maintain a functional caloric intake.  I’m living off of $.99/5lb potatoes for at least one or two meals a day and canned beans, corn, green beans and the cheapest fruit and meat available as well as sandwiches and eggs. 

I have internet and a phone bill, needed for my business and trimmed down to be as cheap as possible. 

Here’s the really bad part.  The student loan debt is $67,000.  One $65,000 loan with a 5% interest rate and one $1,850 loan with an 11% interest rate.  I’m paying $150/month on the high interest loan hoping to pay it off by the end of the year once business picks up over the next month I’ll try to pay $300/month on it.  The $65k loan is on an IBR plan and is $75/month. 

Should I make any attempt to pay down the $65k?  Or should I just accept it as part of my life, for as long as I am alive?  I could potentially make some headway on it if I can get to $1-$2k/month income over expenses and maintain that for 5-10 years but here’s the worst part, which I’m sure you’ve guessed....I have no savings whatsoever.  No retirement, no investments, no emergency fund.  My checking account is $5,000 and that’s all I have. 

I owe $550 to a dentist and $700 on a my care credit card. 

The way I see it is I pay down the my care credit on the lowest monthly possible to avoid interest, getting it paid off before the promotional no interest period expires. 
I pay down the smaller, high interest loan as fast as possibly to eliminate a monthly bill ($65/month minimum) and get that high interest money waste dealt with. 
After that I work on a 3-6 month emergency fund so I can stress less.
At this point begin some sort of long term savings. 

I also need to put some money into advertising for my business.  I’ve only done word of mouth and free craigslist postings the last two years but I feel like it’s worth investing a few hundred into truck decals and shirts and maybe Facebook ads to generate business.  Every seasonal client I gain is around $400-$1,000 between April and October and more depending on work in addition to regular lawn mowing. 

I feel like I know what to do but I am so overwhelmed by the sheer stupidity and volume of my failures and debt/lack of saving.  Maybe someone can say something or point me in some direction that makes me feel like this is going to be somehow manageable before I’m 65 and can barely work and have no savings, with a student loan that’s still more than it was when I was 30. 

Thanks!

So, I have student loans of about 100k myself, of which my parents cosigned for about half. When my parents did this I went out and got life insurance to make sure i had enough to cover those costs if i were to die. (My parents would never have been able to afford it)

Fast forward about 10 years and im in the process of paying down this debt and still have the whole life insurance policy that also holds cash value by now. I pay about 1k a month in student loans and about 150 in life insurance. 

Id like to get out of debt asap. I stopped working to be a stay at home dad for at least until they start school. (Being there myself for my kids is very important) My wife makes enough to cover our monthly bills. 

Now is there a better way to protect my family from my massive student loan debt other than life insurance? It just seems expensive. Maybe its more of a legal question, do my dads and my debt from the private and federal loans pass on to our spouses? We live in wisconsin.

Also is there any way i can refinance these student loans to pay them down sooner while keeping payments the same? Some have rates over 10% as low as 7% with terms over 30 years out. I have good credit but no income. I know Im probably better off sucking it up for now and just paying more when i can. Until I get my income back. Any constructive advice is appreciated.

This is my very first post ever!  I really need help,  as the people in my life don't always give the best advice.  So, I bought a house about 6 months ago.  Since then, things at my current job have gone downhill fast.  I'm paid on grant money (I work at a university), and I'm positive that were not going to get that grant renewed at the end of the cycle (about a year).  So, I figured that I would just look around in LinkedIn &amp; put in a couple applications to see if anything happens.  Boy, did it!  So, now I'm really torn.

I moved to my current job to help family almost 3 years ago, but they are now leaving the state.  So, I have zero reasons to be here now.

I was told the interest rates are going up in August, so I'm worried about trying to sell my house in a tougher market in a year or so.  I don't know what to do.

His only form of credit is about $70,000 in student loan debt (both federal and private). He’s aggressively paying it off and has a credit score around 680. 

I mentioned that he might want to open a credit card before he pays off his loans because it’ll help his length of credit history when he pays off the loans. He said that his score wouldn’t be majorly affected when he pays off the loans and that he doesn’t need a credit card.

personalfinance,Struggling with budgeting,"To start this post off I’m 27 years old living in the Midwest. I work for an Oil and Gas company and bring home $55k annually before taxes. I’ve never been really good at saving money and it’s always something I’ve strived to be better at. My main concerns are that I’m 27 years old with almost not personal savings besides my 401k which has roughly $24k in it. I’ve recently moved into my own apartment, after having roommates for years.

My gross monthly income is 2500$
Rent:780
Truck Payment: 240
Vehicle Insurance: 130
Cable: 45
Electric: 100
Water: 60
Netflix Spotify: 22

These are my base costs that I deal with monthly, with that being said I’ve got a few other bad things attached to me. Last year I had a rough patch with money and acquired several small loans from the stupid little loan places with outrageous interest rates. I have 4 loans for a total of maybe 2500$ I owe about $2200 on my vehicle. I also have two credit cards for a total of 1600$ in debt. With my current bills and the monthly payments of these loan agencies and my two credit cards I’m barely squeaking by.  So my question is what are some tips I can better manage my money, so that I can tackle these debts and get a savings going again.

A few things I know I personally need to stop in order to save money is: Tobacco(Dip) roughly 6$ a day, and eating out fairly regularly. I like to enjoy life and go out and do things with my girlfriend, so often times I find myself saying money isn’t as important as the memories I’m making. But the fact of the matter is I’m 27 it’s time to buckle down and start being financially responsible if I want to buy a house and live “The American Dream” 

A small side note my credit score is currently 610, which is garbage and I believe it’s mostly due to my credit card utilization, I need to substantially raise this which I know takes time. I currently have nothing negative on my credit report, the two things I had have fallen off (7 years ago)

Freshman, my major is engineering and I *should* be making more than 50k out of school, but who knows. I have 3 mandatory co-op rotations so my loans will be decreasing over the next 4 years once I start making money. Have loans, looking to begin repaying very tiny tiny amounts right now as I'm not working and have no income. My credit score floats around 560s-600, it varies, but it's been the lowest most recently, not sure why but I'm not concerned. My spending habits are good, I always plan purchases and never spend large amounts of money without considering everything. I have over $8000 in a chase account and $5000 in a huntington account, unfortunately nothing in a savings account because of small interest rate and just never getting around to it. I consider my checking account like a ""savings"" account, as I'm not spending really. I have no expenses, but will probably start paying phone bill and auto insurance soon.


Here is a breakdown of my loans

Direct Stafford Sub 2500 @ 4.45%

2018-19

Direct Stafford Sub 4500 @ 

Direct Stafford Unsub 2000 @

Due to the Perkins Loan being done, and me receiving half of my last Pell Grant, I have to take out these two loans next school year. 

**Question 1**

If I start paying let's say $10-$20 a month on a loan, for let's say, 3 months, does that affect my credit score much? At all? Should I repay at a higher amount like $150 a month for 3 months? My main goal is to get a credit card before the next school year, as I will be going on an internship/co-op spring of 2019 and need to plan ahead if I'm going to be purchasing things and like the extra security besides a debit card.

**Question 2**

I looked at Discover, they said if you are in the 18-20 range it's a good idea to be a verified person on someone else's credit card, or something along those lines. My mother has always had a fantastic credit score and paid for things on time. But the past year she has managed to accumulate over $10,000 credit card debt because of poverty and barely bringing in any money. I do not want her to cosign anything, because I doubt she will be approved to cosign anything with her debt, and I want to avoid any marks on my name.

Would I be a good candidate for a secured credit card? I'm not sure when the best time to apply for a credit card is.",finance

We're working to instate like-kind transactions and address capital gains tax rates. Ask Us Anything!","The AMA is live, ask us anything!

---
**Original Post:**

Before we were members of the Digital Assets Coalition of America (DAC), we watched as blockchain and distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) grew from proof-of-concepts to the powerhouses of innovation that they are today. Digital assets and distributed applications are revolutionizing the way the world does business, manage data, assign and validate ownership, provide accountability, auditing, and more. Simply put, within a sensible regulatory climate, DLTs can fuel the American economy for generations to come.


In response, we formed a coalition of innovators, strategists, lobbyists, and educators to ensure representation on the issues that affect us all. Through public education campaigns, congressional workshops, and face-to-face interaction with legislators, we’re educating the federal government on DLTs to promote a favorable regulatory climate, facilitate informed policymaking, and secure the USA’s position as a global leader in the digital asset arena.


Our first policy objective is to instate crypto-to-crypto trades as like-kind transactions. With the passing of the new tax bill, like-kind transactions only apply exclusively to real estate exchanges. This change has resulted in an over-complicated reporting process that makes filing compliant taxes exceptionally difficult and inefficient. The new bill also opens the risk for traders and users to be hit with massive taxes that are potentially disproportionate with their true profits.


Note: While we have accounting partners who worked under the interpretation that because cryptocurrency is treated as property for federal tax purposes, then U.S. Code § 1031 *previously applied*, this cannot be confirmed without specific guidance from the IRS. -- **As always, trust your accountant(s).**


Secondly, we want to reduce the capital gains tax rate for both short and long-term digital asset holdings. With current policy, every time digital assets are used to make a purchase, or when digital assets are converted to fiat, high capital gains tax are assessed on any potentially derived profit. This financial burden disincentivizes spending crypto, acts as a barrier to adoption, and ultimately prevents crypto from ever benefiting the economy.


Our team is composed of experts such as Stephani Scruggs, who led the resistance to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) which resulted in nearly a dozen delayed Fast Track TPA votes and the ultimate demise of the TPA. Stephani has advised President Trump on international trade deals, currency manipulation, and the Chinese trade wars. She also has experience working closely with Congressional offices to strategize and develop international trade and economic policy, establishing her as a fountain of wisdom on Capitol Hill.


Or Michael Bowen, an international trade expert, whose organization advised the Trump campaign on trade agreements. Michael has also advised Congress on economics, housing development, international trade, and currency manipulation. Over the course of Michael’s career, he has negotiated over $1 billion in capital market transactions and implemented the largest affordable housing development in Hawaiian history.


Recently, we’ve on-boarded Frank McCarthy. After 20 years embedded in and advising on politics, media and policy making, as well as serving two House Transportation Committee Chairmen, Frank founded McCarthy Advanced Consulting (MAC). Frank uses his experience as a seasoned congressional staffer to run MAC, a nationally recognized lobbying firm that is known for helping unions fight above their weight class.

We want to make sure you’re a part of this process. We want you to ask us questions during the AMA this Sunday (the 25th) at 1PM est, but in the meantime, we have a few for you! 


1. Do you know of any industry leaders that you would like us to reach out to?

2. What regulatory policies affecting cryptocurrency would you like to see changed or put into law?

3. Do you have a thorough understanding or access to the resources necessary to pay taxes associated with your cryptocurrency?

4. What is your favorite cryptocurrency use-case?

5. What websites or publications do you use to stay updated on cryptocurrency news?

personalfinance,Advice on taking out student loans?,"So long story short, for as long as I can remember i've always wanted to go to a trade school and not go down the 'typical' route of a 4 year college, then years in a cubicle in an office. However, my senior year of high school I was given an offer that I couldn't in good conscious turn down. My aunt offered me an entry-level position (front desk) at the company she works for, and in return I make 13.50/hr plus my total tuition payed for at the University of Arizona. 
I will graduate in a year with a BA in business and a minor in marketing. 

I've been fortunate enough to live rent free with my aunt, save up some 18k over the past 3 years, and have absolutely zero debt from a degree that would have otherwise cost me 112k or more. Thing is, it's not what I want to do with my life and never has been.

Simply put, I'm just nervous about having to take out loans for a 2 year degree. I'll need to take some out for tuition, and likely living expenses as well, as I don't want to over extend my welcome with my aunt and her family. 

Since I will already have a bachelors, I know I won't be eligible for federal loans. Anyone here have any advice on what loans to look into, what to avoid, or any other life advice? 

I realize people make career changes much later in life, and sometimes go back to school years down the road. But at 22 I just feel strange 'starting' this process over again.

CryptoMarkets,Passive Income for the Average Trader?,"A lot of my time during bear markets is spent researching. I aim to find new and exciting opportunities to make the most of unfavourable market conditions. A lot of these are coins with real world adaptions and strong fundamentals. (NANO, VEN, ICX)

One of my favourite ways to find articles I might normally miss is by setting up Google Alerts, every morning I wake up and check my email for a list of the most relevant articles based on my keywords. (Cryptocurrency, Blockchain, Bitcoin, Fintech etc.) This morning I was shown an article on Medium. ""Top 5 Fintech Blockchain Projects of 2018"" 4 of the 5 projects outlined were already in the top 50 of Coinmarketcap. Obviously this post isn't about any of those, it's #2, FIC Network.
 (https://medium.com/@professorpopo12/top-5-fintech-blockchain-projects-of-2018-17996ac95948)

From their website ""FIC is a blockchain-based network that will enable users to list, buy, and sell any type of crypto or fiat fixed income financial instrument including: Loans, Bonds, Collateral Loan Obligations, Loan Syndication, Credit Default Swaps and Futures."" Which essentially will allow companies to raise money from crypto investors in the form of bonds. The companies then pay back what they've borrowed to all investing parties with an added interest. I see it sort of like depositing fiat to your bank account and letting it collect interest.

With such unpredictable market conditions, if you're like me then you're trying to find the next best source of passive income, usually in the form of masternodes. However, passive income these days is ironically very expensive. I certainly don't have the capital to buy a VeChain X node, and personally don't feel the smaller nodes give enough of a return to be a worthwhile investment.

What I like about FIC is their claim for Expected Cash Flows (ECF's) which is a new type of investment vehicle that is easilly accessible to the average investor. The general idea is that when a user loans money through the network, it can then be repackaged with similar pieces of debt (maturity times, interest rates, loan amounts) and bought in pieces by multiple investors. As the debts get repaid, each investor knows they will have an expected cash flow of X amount per month, or even have the freedom to choose when they receive payouts (E.g Lump sum at Christmas) until the loan is repaid.

I see FIC potentially opening the door up to smaller stack investors like myself to receive passive income, without the insane initial capital requirements of Masternodes. Groups of investors could put forward what they want to invest, until the required amount is raised for the company, and then each individual receives a return on their investment in the form of interest. Sounds simple enough!

Is this coin on anyones radar? Have you found a similar project that I should be looking at instead? I'd love to create a discussion.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,Roadmap release for Fedora Tips,"Hello all,

I would like to share the recently released tech strategy and roadmap for the Fedora Tips coin project.  The Fedora coin was abandoned several years ago, but in mid-2017 a new dev community coalesced around the project and commenced rebuilding the coin infrastructure. First activity involved rebuilding and hardening the wallets that had not been upgraded for many years.

One of our other priorities has been developing a strategy for what Fedora could and should be now and in the future.  We released a roadmap two weeks ago, however the Fedora community is still very small at this stage.  We are actively seeking feedback on the plans and the work to date.  The /cryptocurrency mods have kindly approved us sharing the roadmap in order to canvass that feedback - we would be very grateful for any thoughts/feedback from the community.  

The Fedora roadmap can be found here, for those who are interested: https://www.tipsco.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Fedora-Roadmap.pdf

In terms of roadmap progress, release 1 went live two weeks ago as planned.  The second release is due in May, although we are now planning to bring the Linux wallet forward to April.  For the time challenged, here's a summary of main roadmap stages:

- Foundation (March 2018) - Establish a tech baseline to enable future development (rebuild desktop wallets, mobile wallet prototype, redesigned tip bots)
- Enhancement (June 2018) - Deploy value add Tips features and use cases (Mobile wallet release, in-wallet mining, enhanced tip bots)
- Engagement - (Sept 2018) Bring the new Fedora platform to the wider tipping community (Enhanced mobile wallet, face to face tipping &amp; transacting, wider tip bot rollout)
- Uplift - (Dec2018) Take the refreshed Fedora community and infrastructure to the next level (Vendor and personal user engagement, bonus features, plus release of our next Roadmap)

personalfinance,Bond Index Fund vs CD Ladder for the Highest Tier of an Emergency Fund,"I'm weighing the pros and cons of each and here's what I have:

Bond fund pros

* Deposit or withdraw any amount at any time without penalty
* Potentially higher returns (VBTLX 10 year return is 3.95%)

Bond fund cons

* Chance to lose small portion of principal due to volatility (I don't see a loss of more than 5% in VBTLX's last 10 years, which I find to be acceptable)
* Rising interest rate environment tends to hurt bond funds
* Potentially lower returns (VBTLX 5 year return is 2.02%)

CD ladder pros

* No principal loss, guaranteed
* Guaranteed rate (2.45% for Alliant 5 year CD)
* Take advantage of rising interest rates

CD ladder cons

* Early withdrawal penalty
* Requires cancelling and paying penalty for $x CD when you may only need less than $x
* Creating and maintaning ladder structure is a pain and requires accepting lowers returns at the beginning.

I likely missed some points or got some wrong, so please correct me if I did.

As the title mentions, this is for a higher tier of the emergency fund. ~3-4 months expenses will still stay in checking/savings. The rest I would prefer to get better returns.

I'm kind of favoring the bond fund due to the completely fractional, penalty-free withdrawals that can be made at any time, despite the fact that it's a bit riskier. 

Are there any other options? I know of I-bonds but I dislike that you can't cash out for a year and will pay a penalty if you cash out within 5 years.",finance

investing,"Wells Fargo thinks its time to buy into the sell-off, even with fears over trade wars and rate hikes","CNBC: Last week, tech stocks sold off, the Federal Reserve hiked rates, and President [Donald Trump](https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/) [inflamed tensions with the world's second largest economy](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/23/china-urges-us-to-pull-back-from-the-brink-as-trump-picks-trade-weapons.html).

To one market analyst, all of the above means it's not a time for investors to worry; it's time to buy.

""We're trying to get our clients to buy on these pullbacks,"" Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at Wells Fargo, told CNBC's ""[Futures Now](https://www.cnbc.com/futures-now/)"" recently. ""We think this thing still has some upside the rest of the year.""

The market cycle is not over, says Wren. He sees the tax changes that were passed late last year by Congressional Republicans providing extra economic stimulus, and likely extending the growth cycle by at least another year. Tax stimulus should give a big boost to [S&amp;P 500](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=.SPX)corporate earnings this year.

On top of that, Wren expects the U.S. economy to reach 2.9 percent growth this year, up from 2.3 percent in 2017, without too much additional inflation pressure.

These factors make equity markets particularly attractive to Wren.

""Valuations are not stretched,"" he said. ""Are they at the average or the median? No they're not, they're a little bit higher than that, but they're not dramatically higher than that.""

The price\-to\-earnings ratio on S&amp;P 500 stocks remain at elevated levels of recent years, though the metric has sharply declined since highs seen at the beginning of the year.

The benchmark index currently trades at 16.5 times forward earnings, down from an 18.6 times multiple at the end of January when it last hit record highs. That is still a far cry from the dotcom bubble era, when the S&amp;P 500 traded as high as 25.8 times earnings at the tail\-end of the boom.

The [potential for a U.S. trade war with China](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/22/china-responds-to-trump-tariffs-with-proposed-list-of-us-products-to-target.html) sent markets tumbling last week, but Wren sees the likelihood of all\-out conflict at just 20 percent. Wren expects markets to react as they have in recent weeks – with an immediate sell\-off on new developments, but then a subsequent rebound.

""This is going to be on the front burner for the next couple of years,"" he said. ""I just really think this is not going to be an all\-out trade war, but obviously the market is worried about that and certainly if that would happen that wouldn't be a good thing.""

The next market worry is the Fed, says Wren. The central bank [raised borrowing costs last week for the sixth time since the financial crisis](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/23/4-things-to-do-with-your-money-when-the-fed-raises-rates.html), a move widely expected by markets. Higher economic projections did come as a mild surprise, pushing up the possibility of a fourth rate hike by year's end.

""Four is a mistake. I think that the Fed is not behind the curve. I do think finally the labor market is getting tight,"" said Wren. Unless ""you think inflation is going to jump higher, which we really don't, four seems extreme to me.""

The market is pricing in an above\-average chance of another rate hike in June and September, according to CME Group Fed Funds futures. A fourth rate hike in November or December is also seen as a possibility.

Even with changes to monetary and trade policy, Wren remains bullish on the stock market. He reiterates his midpoint price target on the S&amp;P 500 at 2,850 for the end of the year. A finish at that level marks a 6.6 percent advance for the year.

personalfinance,Tax return of 2017 issue.,"I went to a new tax guy and feel like I got way less then I should have gotten.

Here is a brief synopsis.
I pulled in $57,000ish working two different jobs.
I claimed 0 on both W-2’s.
I pulled out $7,500 from an old jobs 401K (I know, mistake but I really needed the money) saw $5,400 of that... so that was before or after the 10% penalty for pulling out early... cause I got taxed about 38% right off the bat, thinking that already accounted for the penalty. Unsure as I have never done this before but tax guy said no, I’m going to eat another $750 loss on top of the 38%.

Total tax withheld was $11,000 for federal and $3,200 for state (California)

Anyways, total for federal retuen I saw $972 and state I saw $143.  This is after the $750 401k penalty.

Does this sound about right? I know information is missing and I’m not asking anybody to do my taxes (as they are already done) but I just want to make sure I didn’t get screwed by this new tax guy.

Additional side information: my name is on the title that I went in with my soon to be fiancé. I pay for 1/2 if the mortgage and property insurance but the actual loan is under her name. Does this negate me from the tax breaks of having to pay for half of the mortgage and property insurance or do I still get those tax breaks?

TL;DR: 

- Made 65k total last year (including an early 7.5k withdrawal from 401k)
- No allowances on either of my jobs
- Paid 14.2k total in federal/state taxes (California)
- Only got a 1.1k return
*edit
- Pay for 1/2 the mortgage and property insurance since late 2016 of a house we purchased

personalfinance,Wells Fargo closed parents' joint account 6 months after father died and 3 days after POA added - bank is not cooperating to get their money.,"**EDIT:  I have access!  Thank you to everyone for your help.  It has been a difficult few weeks (well, year).  Apparently the POA required me setting up online access under my name.  Same accounts, just new online banking ID.  The local account rep didn't tell me this and it took the Executive Office over a week to figure it out.** 

My parents had five joint accounts (2 checking, 2 savings, credit card). My dad died in September and because my mom is no longer able to care for herself I am handling everything.  There has been a joint power of attorney with my sister since 2002 but Wells Fargo refused to honor it (dad was primary me and my sister joint successors).  I had a new one drawn up 3/9 and went to the local Wells Fargo branch the same day to get my name on the account and remove my dad's. 

Monday 3/12 Wells Fargo contacted me to provide a case worker's name and number but refused to tell me why a case worker had been assigned.  I informed them there is a POA that authorizes them to talk to me but she couldn't see it.  

Wednesday 3/14 the accounts were closed (or at least unable to be accessed).  I thought it was a system glitch but by Friday 3/16 still no access.  I emailed the local branch officer who updated the accounts the week before but he did not respond.


I also called the case worker since they had not bothered to contact me all week.  The case worker had no idea about why the accounts were closed but was following up on a complaint I made (the case worker issue is a whole other saga).

The case worker was supposed to work with the local branch officer to determine what was going on. I informed them I would be out of the country for a week but expected to have access restored by my return. Well, I'm back and still no access and no emails about the problem. I told them I only wanted to communicate via email now because I want an audit trail (and I get extremely upset when I talk to them).  

I plan on filing a complaint with the Federal Reserve after one final attempt to resolve this tomorrow.  Who else should I contact? What laws should I be aware of?

https://www.federalreserveconsumerhelp.gov/about/before-i-file-a-complaint

Other relevant info:

* Mom is in GA
* Lawyer said will didn't need to be probated
* No debt other than car loan with Toyota and a couple credit cards
* Lots of money in each account
* New POA is in my name with my sister as backup
* My mom's $7,500 assisted living caregiver bill is due in a week

personalfinance,Having trouble with a few credit items that won't go away,"Hi /r/personalfinance!

I started my credit repair journey in 2014/2015 after doing a good job damaging it during and immediately after college.

While unable to do so with various creditors for a variety of reasons, for the most part my approach was that I wanted to pay for any of the items (in full) should they be removed from my credit score.

I used the solid advice in the [Collections](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/collections) guide combined with a credit repair service that is either loved or hated in this sub.

With moderate success I was able to remove most items over time.

I have been unable to remove two that are keeping my score in an undesirable range while climbing slowly, I'd really like to buy a house in the next year.

.
 
Remaining negative dings:

* ~$400 medical (reporting as 2016 despite being from 2013/2014)
* Federal Student Loans, in default
* 60-day late payment on private student loans from Sept. 2015

Caveats:

* I'd *love* to pay-for-delete on the medical, they won't have it (so won't get my $ either) - I had moved and didn't know I owed them until it was sent to collections (insurance snafu, they would have paid it)
* I made a repayment agreement 3 years ago for federal student loans, have made the agreed upon minimum payment ($50 on top of it) every month since (10-month agreement) but they have not removed it from default status over a year or two later and credit repair service isn't seeing any traction with them
* Private student loan company (Sallie Mae) said they only report the last ~90 days to the credit bureaus and as such have been reporting me positively for years; *can't / won't help me*

What are my options? Is there some way of climbing out of this without waiting for the 7yr dropoff?

I *could* pay off my federal student loans in full but my S.O. is tired of apartment life and we're definitely ready to buy a house and begin building a family.

**TL;DR; Are there any credit repair companies someone could recommend that aren't a letter blasting service?**

technology,Does Google records your camera?,"I was studying for a test, in complete silence (so this isn't about Google recording voice, which we know he does). After seeing something I found interesting in my history book, I grabbed my phone and proceeded to google it. I typed 'Equ' and the first autocomplete suggestion was 'Equador Confederation', exactly what I was looking for. I found it cool and didn't think much of it, even though I never searched for anything like that before. But later, again I wanted to google something I saw on my history book. I typed 'B' and immediately appeared 'Bottles Night', something I never knew/searched before, and has not much relation to Equador Confederation besides being in my history book. What I'm thinking is that while I was texting, Google recorded my camera, where my history book was in reach, and proceeded to stock the words in the book to 'enhance' their data on me.

personalfinance,Setting up my financial plan for investing (21 years old),"Hi everyone, 

I've been doing a lot of research into financial planning recently and would really like some input so that I don't accidentally lose all my money. Please keep in mind that I'm very new at this, so if you spot any potential pitfall for me, just point it out. 

I want to grow a principal amount of savings of $10,000 over the next 15 to 20 years. Savings and CD accounts offer too little interest for me to be interested in them so I've turned to investing my money through brokerage accounts. 

Personally, I'm more on the risk averse side and would prefer all or most of my savings to be put into ETFs with a solid buy-and-hold strategy. I'm using this [site](https://www.investor.gov/additional-resources/free-financial-planning-tools/compound-interest-calculator) as a *very* generous estimator. I'm using 7% as the interest rate parameter (even though the average returns on S&amp;P is 9.8%) and am putting $1500 as my monthly deposit for 10 years. It's giving me about $270,000 as my outcome. Does this sound too optimistic?

My aim for 2018 starting after April is to put $2000 every month into the portfolio. Going forward to 2019, i would add in anywhere from $1200 - 1500 every month. 

What do you guys think is this feasible for me as I am now? I will be living with my parents for this year for sure and perhaps even for 2019 (still shaky on that). Salary is about $90,000. Also, I haven't been factoring in raises and bonuses into the equation which I know I will get, either of which I will definitely put towards my fund.",finance

After we split his investments, my brother immediately had his brokerage invest his half, while I chose a self directed approach. 


I've been lurking reddit investing,wsb, forums, news articles basically anything talking about the markets including close to every comment. Based on things I read, I did not invest any of my inherited money even though the economy was doing well and there wasn't any particular reason for it not to continue to grow.  I decided to stay in cash. Why?


Late 2017 through January 2018 news articles, brokerages, investment firms, and the general population seemed to be hinting at a upcoming correction. Now it could have taken place the next day or 3 years from now and I understand that. But as I was reading all these comments from all different sources and just public opinion, a large amount of people seemed worried about a correction even though there was no immediate reason for it. 


So how does public opinion and social views impact your investment decisions(if at all). Is it a factor when purchasing/selling stocks even though financially companies and the market are in good shape?


Also I'm curious if you guys think that the interest rate announcement was just a catalyst to act on the expected correction(Over sold due to fear of correction). Obviously there are plenty of doom gloom posters who've been preaching for the last 4 years that there was going to be a correction.(I guess they weren't necessarily wrong right?)

As you may or may not know, the Libertarian National Convention being held June 30th to July 3rd in New Orleans is steadily approaching.  It was brought to my attention by pro-peace libertarian activist Adam Kokesh that **the Dogecoin community has a much wow opportunity to be an even bigger part of the freedom movement than it already is.**

Adam, a fellow shibe who is running for not-president in 2020 on the platform of dissolving the United States federal government has set up **a campaign to deliver the message of freedom and voluntaryism** to every single residence in the New Orleans area before the convention by delivering ~205,000 copies of his book “FREEDOM!”, which he wrote in prison several years ago serving time for civil disobedience.  If you aren’t familiar with his work, I highly recommend you read his book which is free in any digital format at [thefreedomline.com]( https://thefreedomline.com/freedom/).

How is this relevant to Dogecoin and our community as a whole?  Being that Bitcoin and similar decentralized cryptocurrencies line up with the principals of individuals taking financial power back into their own hands and  dissolving corrupt central authorities within the monetary system, **Dogecoin taking a more humorous approach has proven to be a very effective and key part of delivering this evolutionary technology and message.**

Within the framework of Adam’s project [“Big Easy Book Bomb”](https://steemit.com/freedom/@adamkokesh/operation-big-easy-book-bomb), we have a prime opportunity to get the Dogecoin name out even further as he is incentivizing Dogecoin donations to help get the books printed and delivered before the convention takes place.

**I have personally pledged Ð860,000 (around $3000 USD) to the cause which guarantees Dogecoin one line of ad space that can say anything desired (ideas welcomed and encouraged!), along with our beloved doge logo.**

I have already spoken with Adam for confirmation and decided it would be even better if I reach out to you shibes for some additional help.  

So far, the project has nearly raised enough money from other crypto communities and donors such as: [Bitcoin.com](https://www.bitcoin.com/), [Steemit](https://steemit.com/), [DASH.org](https://www.dash.org/), [SmartCash](https://smartcash.cc/), and now Dogecoin among others.

It would really be something if we could raise anywhere near the amount that the [DASH community has already pledged](https://www.dashcentral.org/p/FREEDOM-book-drop-sponsorship)!

personalfinance,Advice on soon becoming financially independent at 18y/o,"TL;DR
I am a resident+citizen of the USA, turning 18 and graduating high school this spring. I will be completely financially independent and I want to take the necessary steps in having a healthy financial journey. What can/should I do both long term and short term?

I've been a lurker on this subreddit for years, and now that I'm finally about to be 18 and graduate high school this spring, I wanted to post to get some help on starting my financial journey.

I live in the USA. Have citizenship, all the technical stuff done.

Firstly, when I turn 18 everything that costs/requires money will be my responsibility. That includes college, car repairs, food, rent, etc.

Currently have $2000 saved. Work a job that gets me about $180/week.

Driving a 1998 Toyota Camry @ 220,000 miles ; no mechanical problems and has had a good history with past owners (i.e. oil has always been changed on time, previous owner used it simply for daily commute for work).

Planning on going to community college before transferring to a four-year college. Looking to attend my first year this fall.

Looking into the medical field ; I havent decided on a concrete job or specific position but something in the realm of nursing (RN, possibly).

My lifestyle has always been /r/minimalism with a mix of /r/buyitforlife ; I own only what I use on a daily/weekly basis, but what I do own is never a lowballed/generic product. Basically, I can fit everything I own in my car. What I work towards is having reliability and stability in what I own, even if it costs more.

On /r/personalfinance I've heard of emergency funds, 401k planning, budgeting, investing, credit score, student loan interest, etc. Everything seems a bit overwhelming when I look at the many ways to handle finances. What I want to take away from this post is knowing what are smart, safe choices that save me trouble down the road. What are objective, knowledgeable steps I can take in ensuring a healthy financial profile?

Looking for guidance in:

-Saving money (how much goes to it, where to put it, best interest rates, etc.)

-Spending money (how much should go to rent, food, car, etc.)

-Retirement (how can I start planning, 401k(?))

-Insurance (what types do I need, what does it take to afford all of the different types {health, vehicle, etc.})

-Taxes (1040EZ, W-2, W-4 {basically how are these forms important to me} ; getting tax exemptions on paycheck {does it matter to have them when I end up getting the taxed money back from the government in my tax return?}, tax return {how should that money be treated as.. saving money, spending money?})

-Rent (how do I find a place to live during college, what % of earnings goes to rent, having a good relationship with landowner {what are the do's and dont's of renting})

-Banking (which bank to choose, what makes a good bank, how are online banks different?)

-College (how to pay for it {financial aid?, student loans?, out of pocket?})",finance

personalfinance,Should I Be Worried About My Spending?,"Hello everyone, i’m a single 27 year old individual currently in his first year of residency.  For those who dont know, residency is a training period AFTER medical school for doctors working towards their given specialty (i.e general surgery or emergency medicine).  

I currently have about 150k USD debt, at a 4% interest rate.  My income is around 60K USD pre-tax.   I own no assets beyond a cheap vehicle, and do not have any family financial support.  My question pertains to my attitude and perspective towards spending throughout my residency.

There is a high likelihood that once I finish, I will be earning 300K USD+.  Given that, I have been approaching finances with a blase attitude.  I will buy the things I want to buy, spend money where i’d like and go on vacations on the occasional week off during my training.  I spend time on Amazon just browsing for things to purchase, and have little hesitation on purchasing clothing/shoes I like.  This amounts to approximately 5-10k extra above my income that I then push onto my loan burden.  

Is this really a big deal? Am I okay to continue spending at this rate knowing I will almost certainly make a good income.  What are the realistic risks/obstacles you project if so?

I do not mean to come off as pretentious in any way.  I am fortunate to be in this situation and just feel like I want to enjoy as much as I can to get through these grueling 80-hour weeks. Thanks!

4,200 vanguard federal money market (also have a tax refund around 2000 maybe I’ll add to my money market).

24,508.91 Roth IRA (vgenx vghcx)

I also have a 1972 corvette stingray, a tiger skin rug, some gold rings/gold watch, some 1960s era dressers, a marble table, etc but I don’t count these assets.

I max my tsp (I get a match to a certain extent), max my Roth, and add 500 a month to my taxable (more sometimes) and put a little into my money market.

With its major, rain-fed supply dams dangerously low after three years of drought, most of the city’s 4 million-plus residents — some rich, many desperately poor — have been facing the prospect of lining up at emergency water distribution points to collect a daily ration of just 6.6 gallons per person.

How did one of the best-managed and wealthiest cities in Africa find itself on the brink of a catastrophic water shortage in the first place, particularly considering climate change and water management have been firmly on the agenda of Cape Town’s leaders for years? What is the city doing to rectify the immediate situation, and at what cost? And with its population growing and the climate warming, how does Cape Town meet its future water needs?

personalfinance,What do I do with my bonus/tax refund?,"This isn't a major windfall like some I have seen here, but my bonus is around $3200. I have about 1k in savings right now from my tax refund. My typical net paycheck is about $1,190 right now, I get paid biweekly.

First things first, I am in grad school, and I had my work prepay for my classes. If I fail one/both, I have to pay them back, so I'm holding onto the money until the end of the April just in case.

My wife and I just got new cars, on loans, and while we can afford the payments no problem, we borrowed a bit more than we probably should have. My loan is 5 years, and hers is 7. I have no credit card debt, and I am unsure of her amount of debt but I think it is around 6k. We do a lot of our finances separately because my parents fought about money all the time and it was important to me to avoid that. I still have around 6k student loans from my undergraduate degree. I currently have no emergency fund.

1.) My first question is--what should I do with the bonus to maximize any potential earnings/interest for the month or so remaining until the end of the semester? Right now I just have my funds in a money market account.

Here are things I am considering:
1.) Just hold onto the money for any potential emergencies. Look into a CD ladder or I-bonds.
2.) Use the money to re-finance my auto loan for a lower interest rate, possibly lower payments, and switch the auto loan to my main credit union.
3.) Make a big payment on my existing student loans.
4.) Home improvements/repairs such as having the electric rewired, repairing some water fixtures that drip, and adding insulation and ventilation in the attic to prevent ice damming next winter.
5.) Making a big payment on my wife's credit card.
6.) Have a fence installed for our back yard so we can actually hang out there without feeling like weirdos since we are on a corner lot.",finance
personalfinance,Would it ever make sense to NOT take grant money to capitalize on tax credits?,"Here's the situation, my parents own a business that is looking at capitalizing on the 30% Federal Tax credit for renewable energy projects (solar). This business is also very profitable and is taxed at the 39% rate and subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax. We're looking at doing the solar project, but applying for the grant costs money and I'm aware it's taxable and would also make the grant funded portion of the project ineligible for the 30% credit. Does it still make sense to apply for the grant in this instance or would it be smarter to just take the straight 30% tax credit?",finance

personalfinance,Vanguard Target Date Fund in Taxable Brokerage Account? (VTIVX),"Just a question regarding my retirement accounts. My 401k &amp; Roth IRA’s are maxed yearly. Currently across 2 Roth IRA’s (mine &amp; my wife’s) and a Brokerage account, we have a lazy 3 fund portfolio set up at 60% Total Stock, 25% Intl Stock, and 15% Total Bond. When I max out our Roth’s yearly, I do the math and rebalance accordingly.

I’d like to begin slowly adding more to my Brokerage account monthly. My question is this: If I wanted to add $200-300/ month to my Brokerage account, am I better off just rebalancing every month with the deposit, or would it be worth my while to just exchange everything over to a TDF (in this case Vanguard VTIVX) so that when I throw some money in the the brokerage account I can just buy VTIVX and let it take care of itself? Or perhaps just buy VTSAX with each deposit and then rebalance only once a year?

My only hesitation is that I know it’s not efficient having Bonds in the Taxable account. I got some advice lately that interest rates are negligible enough right now where it won’t really matter too much (particularly with Vanguard and Schwab TDF’s).

Currently: Approx $39,000 so far across IRA’s and a Brokerage account. 60%/25%/15% lazy 3 Fund. One of the accounts does have admiral shares of Total Stock so not sure if this would be a downgrade all things considered.

Thanks for any advice!

Edit: My 401k is in a Blackrock 2045 TDF, unfortunately no Vanguard options so essentially working with the 3 accounts above as a separate entity for now.",finance
personalfinance,Refinancing student loan with cosigner,"I'm 22 years old and graduated from college in May of 2017.  I currently have 2 student loans totaling about 33k (one for 15 and one for 18) and was interested in refinancing them because my current monthly payments are about $500.  I make 2k a month so I was interested in refinancing the loans to possibly get a lower interest rate.  My dad mentioned that he has bad credit and that as a cosigner, refinancing the loan would likely mean running a credit check on him which would hurt his credit further.  The loan is through Citizens Bank.
Currently I can manage the $500 a month but it takes a toll on any attempts to save money and have a nest egg in case I encounter unexpected expenses.

personalfinance,Budget Assistance - What can I do better?,"Hello All! First off, thanks for the assistance! I've been working the past few months to get better at budgeting and wanted to know if I'm pointed in the right direction, or if there's anything else you think I could do better...
I'm 24, and live in Denver, work as a consultant in the technology field. My Monthly post tax &amp; 401k take home is about 5,500 a month. I have around 50k in my 401k and contribute the max with employer matching.
I have a 2015 BMW 328d I owe about $12,000 on, KBB is 21, payment is $225 a month (2.25% @ 60mo, 3 years left) and I have been paying $450. I also have a 2014 BMW S1000RR motorcycle I owe 6k on, payments are $125 a month for ~3.5 years @ 3.75%, I've been paying $250. I have paid off all my student loans, and have about 5,000 on a credit card. It is 0% interest until July and I have been making $500-1000 payments each month to get it paid off before then.
I've been attempting to come up with a plan to save for a house, I figure I'd need 40-60k down in this environment and can qualify for FHA. How much should I be putting into savings each month, both for the house and my own personal savings? Currently I have about 6k in savings.
other monthly Costs:
1BR Condo      $1550
Utilities           $100
Internet          $50
Groceries        $300
Entertainment $200

Insurance for the Condo, Motorcycle, and Car is about $4000/yr which I usually pay in full on the credit card for a discount.
Should I try and dump all my extra income into the car/motorcycle and then start saving it all? Or would it be better to split up savings/payments since the interest rates are lower?

personalfinance,Clueless about taxes and how to maximize (or minimize) them.,"Hello, I have 0 background in finances and really would like to know how to go about taxes. Should i max or min my returns?? I will just list the basics underneath and hopefully that will be enough info. Thanks!:)

Hope that helped! My current situation is that I am essentially breaking even (+$115 total) for 2017 tax refunds If my return is correct. Is this a good thing to achieve or should i be trying to pay more tax up front to maximize my returns?

personalfinance,"Money just came in, but taxes are going to take 50%+ of it. Trying to use the money to buy a house. Would a C-corp help?","My situation is a weird one.  I make independent video games by myself from home (no employees or other collaborators).  This means I work for YEARS without any income, and then have a big hunk of money come in all at once when my game is released.  I don't have any significant expenses during development (aside from business use of my home and a few other little things), so there aren't huge losses to carry forward.

However, given that we effectively have $0 income during those years, we are missing deductions many years in a row ($24K each year), and then when the money comes in all at once, we only get to take ONE year's worth of deductions from it.  In my current case, I spent three years with $0 income, so I missed $72K worth of deductions.  Now that the game is selling this year, I will get to deduct only $24K, not $96K (the total for all the years I spent working on the game).

Even worse, a lot of this sudden income will get taxed at a higher tax rate than it would have if it was spread out over four years.

We've been saving up to buy a house with cash.  And with the revenue from the most recent game, we're there.  Except that---oops---around 50% of it will go to taxes.  Self-employment tax, federal income tax (most of the money will be tax at 32%+), and also California's horrendous extra 13.3% personal income tax.  This adds up fast.

But then I saw that the C-corp tax rate has been lowered to 21%, and also California's corporate tax rate is only 8.84%, for a total of only about 30%.  A plan started to hatch.

What if the money stayed inside the C-corp as profit?  It gets taxed at 30%.  The problem is usually double-taxation when you take the money out.  But what if we don't take the money out?  The C-corp can buy and own a house, right?

And then we, as employees of the C-corp, could live in the house, either paying rent to the C-corp (which the C-corp would count as income/profit) OR simply receiving free rent as a benefit (that would be personally taxable as in-kind income).  And of course, the business would be operated out of one room of the house, as usual.

And we could also use the C-corp to pay ourselves salary spread out over future years to take full advantage of yearly deductions and lower tax brackets (and the C-corp would have losses during those years due to these salaries, which we could carry forward or back, to avoid double-taxation).

Also, if we ever DID hire employees to work on future projects (like, years from now), we'd have way more money left from this game with which to do so (because 20% less would be taken by taxes this year).  That's an obvious reason to form a C-corp (to keep more money for future business investment).

But what about buying the house with 20% more money?",finance

personalfinance,Am I on the right track?,"Hello hello,

I hope y'all are having a nice day!

I've done quite a bit of due diligence on investing/retirement (thank-you PF!). I am now  looking for a little reassurance that I am on the right track related to my investments and retirement.

Stats:

**Age:** 29 (30 next month)

**Income:** ~$74,000 (gross)/~$55,000 (net) = ~$2,100/2weeks net take home

**Current checking/saving account:** ~$3,000

**Emergency Fund:** ~$3,750 

**HSA:** ~$750

**Traditional IRA:** ~$27,500 in VTSAX with Vanguard (with $5,500 of 2018 to contribute)

**Traditional 401k:** ~$780 in 2055 Target Date Fund with Fidelity (11% employee + 4% match = ~$390/2weeks)

**Crypto:** ~$6,000 (today...who knows tomorrow)

**Debt:** ~$15,000 (car loan @1.9%)

**Monthly Expenses:** ~$1,300 - $2,000 (depending on how much girlfriend contributes to rent)

So here is my thinking on each above investment/account and where I am looking for some insight/reassurance...

**Income:** This will remain stagnant for the next two to three years. After that it could increase to ~$100,000 with taxable income going down related to profession which pays partly in non-taxable income. Really depends how many weeks of the year I plan on working per year.

**Checking:** I'd like this number to be a tad lower and better invested, but I want to wait until I'm at my job a little longer to ensure I don't get myself in a financial pickle related to monthly expenses, etc. I like knowing I have extra cash free just in case...despite emergency fund.

**Emergency Fund:** I am in no major rush to grow this, but I plan on getting it to ~$10,000 once I am on more stable footing with IRA and 401k for this year. I would also like to move this over to Ally before too long as well for the 1.45% APY. That is a good call, correct? My current APY is ~0.03%.

**HSA:** No current plans to really do anything with it. Will manage it once I know my other ideas are sound.

**IRA:** 2017 was first year I maxed contribution, I plan on maxing 2018 before end of year as well . Plan is to max yearly from here on out. For now stay in just US stocks, as I don't mind the risk and I feel stable in current job. 

Should I diversify further anyway and add bonds and international stocks for the Boglehead Three-Fund Portfolio? Is it worth it to convert it to a Roth? I do plan on upping my income later, but due to my progression of profession my taxable income will be low. If my taxable income will remain low and I most likely won't jump up in tax bracket, does it make any sense to convert to Roth?

**401k:** Low balance because I just got this restarted as I returned to old job. Plan is to remain in target date fund contributing 11% income (+4% employer match) throughout the end of year. Once I get closer to end of year I will get as close to maxing as possible to ensure I don't lose employer match.

**Crypto:** Set it and forget it. I don't plan on buying anymore until IRA and 401k are both maxed and even then I will be hesitant. I have a bit of coin diversity, nothing crazy. I hope it grows, but if it doesn't it was fun to speculate.

**Debt:** It's my understanding that due to low interest rate it makes far more sense to invest rather than aggressively pay down debt. I was thinking of maybe upping my payment by $150/month to shave a few months off, but I am unsure of this at this point.

**Monthly Expenses:** This is tricky. I've tried to become far more budget conscious recently, but getting my girlfriend on board has proven difficult. I have tried to talk about it and it isn't taken seriously. But either way, expenses rarely surpass 50% of my monthly income. Though I'd like it to be even less, it's something I'm working on. I'm more so trying to ensure I properly invest the other 50%.

**Life plans:** I don't have any plans on buying a house anytime soon (maybe in 10 years). Don't plan on having kids. Might get married in ~5years. The only major expense I anticipate this year is a new laptop. 

**Final questions:** Does it make sense to diversify further? Does it make sense to put emergency fund in Ally (other recommendations appreciated)? Should I make my emergency fund my first priority, though I feel little risk with what I have now? Does it make sense to aggressively pay off car loan? Is there anything I'm missing or totally off the mark?

I'm sorry this has gotten a tad long, but I greatly appreciate any insight into my plans and any criticism is most welcome. I feel pretty good about my next 10 years and I want to make sure I am making the best decisions now to set myself up for later. If there is any other information I can provide, please let me know! Thank-you!!

All the very best and I hope y'all have a great day!",finance
personalfinance,How to handle CC debt in a divorce.,"Wife and I are getting divorced. We're on great terms and it's helping things go smoothly. We have about $5000 of debt on a shared credit card that is probably 15 years old or so (the bank tells me both of our names are on the card) with a 9.5% interest rate. We're both paying towards it. Minimum monthly payment is $128 right now. She's able to pay $75/mo and I'm paying $150/mo. I'm fine with that based on our incomes. We're not adding any more debt to the card. It was from marriage counseling, so it's shared debt we both want to pay off.

I understand that closing a credit card account isn't great for your credit, but I don't have another credit card in my own name, and I'd like to get one in my own name. Things with the wife are good now, but if she has access to use the card, it becomes a liability for me and since we're divorcing, I think it's best to close the card even if it hurts our credit.

My question is would it be a good idea to get our own cards and split the existing debt between us, transfer it to the new cards and close the joint card? Then we'd be paying towards our own cards and starting to build credit on those new accounts.

It looks like I can get a personal card from my bank for 8%, so the interest would be lower too. I'd also probably do some shopping around for a card, but having it through my bank is convenient for making payments online. I'm not super interested in cash rewards cards mainly because I don't know much about them. It's mostly for emergency use only and building credit.",finance
personalfinance,Bonus of $15k net with a 45% raise. Over $200k in various debt. Avalanche vs Snowball vs common sense approach. Feedback welcome!,"So with this bonus and raise, I can finally start attacking my massive pile of debt.  I wanted to see what the PF community thought about my approach:
 
$15,000 check coming in the next week or two, followed by a new monthly surplus of about $3000/month going forward (after making minimum payments and paying all other bills) 
 
Debts by type:
 
 
**Private Student Loans**
 
$59,249 @ 10.5%
 
$52,649 @ 6.08%
 
$35,071 @ 11.0%
 
$24,762 @ 11.2%
 
$12,736 @ 9.9%
 
 
**Federal Student Loans**
 
$2,587 @ 6.8%
 
$5,369 @ 5.6%
 
$4,426 @ 6.0%
 
$2,716 @ 6.8%
 
$5,291 @ 4.5%
 
$2,443 @ 6.8%
 
$1,912 @ 5.0%
 
 
**Credit Card**
 
$5,590 @ 22.4%
 
 
**Car Loan**
 
$2,260 @ 2.6%
 
 
Yes.  FML.  Well over $200k to dig out.  But I want to dig smarter not harder, so here's my approach:
 

With the bonus check, I'll kill the credit card debt first and foremost.  Then I'm putting $2,000 into an emergency fund and will use the remainder to attack my largest student loan ($59,249 @ 10.5%).
 
 
As the new paychecks start coming in, I'll use the surplus ~$3000 to start picking off the smaller federal loans one by one in the snowball method until all I have leftover are the larger private loans.  At that point, I'll switch to the avalanche method and go from there.  I'll keep paying the car loan minimum payment as the rate is so low.

personalfinance,Student loan help needed. Recently started making some decent money. 27 and 110k/year. How do I knock my payments out ASAP?,"Hi Guys,

So I basically know nothing about paying my loans back as fast as possible (other than throwing as much cash into them as possible) as my family doesn't really have experience with this sort of thing.

personalfinance,Am I on the right track for early retirement? What can I be doing better?,"I (F/26) have been working full-time for about 3 years now (the past ~1.5 years as an engineer for the federal govt). About a year ago I made the decision to take control of my finances, to try to understand investing, and to start keeping better track of my money in an attempt to figure out a way to retire as early as possible. I basically started with zero knowledge of investing and have had minimal help thus far. Everything I've learned so far has been from this subreddit and other internet sources. I feel like I am stumbling around in the dark a little bit, and would appreciate any advice that can help me reach my financial goals (early retirement in about 20 years or so...not sure if that's too ambitious!) or any other guidance that might be useful to me as I feel like I'm just starting out.

The Basics: 
Salary -- ~66,000/year + ~$5,000 in overtime/per diem from travel (takehome is around $2300/month after taxes and retirement contributions)

TSP (government version of 401K) (~$12k) -- In the past year I've increased my contribution significantly to 25%. I've only had two pay periods so far where this has been in effect, and at this time I'm not sure if it's entirely sustainable or not. The govt. matches an additional 5%. Early on, I took my TSP out of the Lifecycle funds and have it invested in a combination of C, I, and S funds. 

Fidelity (~$15.5k)-- I had a 401K from a previous job in the private sector that I rolled over into a Fidelity Rollover IRA and some ended up in a Roth IRA. I did some research on stocks and mutual funds and am currently happy with what I have invested in (I can provide more details if necessary). Last week, I took $5500 from my emergency savings and invested it in the Roth IRA for 2017. I plan to do the same in 2018. My Fidelity account currently has around $15.5K (used to be higher, but all of my investments have taken a hit this past week).

Emergency fund ($9.5k)-- It's just sitting in a regular savings account. I've been thinking of transferring it to a high-yield saving account (probably Ally, but need to do more research on this first). 

Acorns (~$2.5k) -- I started up an Acorns account when I first decided to start investing more consciously. Right now, it's pulling $40/week from my checking and investing it. The returns have been pretty low so far. I have been thinking of withdrawing this money and putting it somewhere else, but I feel like this account is a bit more liquid (which I like) than if I just put it towards my Roth IRA and I feel like my investments are more diversified this way. Should it stay or should it go??
______________________
Expenses:
Rent/utilities -- ~$1000/month. I live with my SO in a tiny rented house with a total rent of $1700/month. I take on most of the rent because he makes much less than I do. Our lease is up in a few months but we just live in SUCH an expensive city that I don't think we will be able to find a place that is significantly cheaper. Buying a house is also really out of the question because it's way too expensive and neither of us is originally from here or particularly like living here. In the long run (less than 5 years), we'd like to move to a more affordable city.

Other expenses -- $900-1200/month. Most of my other expenses go towards groceries, travel to visit family, car problems (2006 Jeep Commander that is suddenly having issue after issue...), and entertainment. 

Student loans -- $0.

Debt -- $0.

Total Investments: ~$30k 
Cash: ~10k
Monthly expenses: ~$2000 
________________________
Just from writing this up I can see that my 25% contribution to my TSP might be too ambitious right now unless I plan to put in consistent overtime hours at work to add a bit more cushion, but I'll wait to hear some advice before changing it. I want to try to save as much as possible while I can (before starting a family,etc.). I know for a fact that my salary is quite low considering my education/skills (I have two master's degrees in engineering), but feel that my job is great at the moment and that I need to build up a few more years of experience and become a professional engineer (PE) before I can go someplace else (this is also why I'm waiting to move out of my current city). I know that this is not necessarily true for all cases, so if anyone has advice about this I'd also appreciate it. I'm held to a strict pay scale and can't ask for a raise. At this point, my only chance for promotion is if I get a Ph.D. or my PE license (I need to work for 2.5 more years before I can get that). 

I am mostly hoping for advice on whether or not my investment strategy is on the right track or not, and if the 25% I'm contributing to my TSP is way too much for me right now or if I should try to stick it out and make up the loss in takehome pay a different way. Is there anything else I can be doing instead of dumping a quarter of my salary into my TSP (especially since I'm not sure how long I'm going to be a federal employee) and maxing out my Roth IRA? I'm happy to provide any other additional details as necessary.

personalfinance,Advise from someone foolish (desperate) enough to get a high interest loan.,"WARNING!! If you are contemplating taking out a loan with a company who offers a 30% interest rate, because your desperate, and feel you have no other option, please, please think very hard.

Let me try to Coles notes’ my story.

Credit cards. Pay a seemingly acceptable amount against the balance, or, don’t want to pay towards the balance, so just pay the minimum….equals - taking forever to pay them off. So, in desperate need to get my debits moving in the right direction, I take out a loan to pay off the credit cards. I do not qualify for a bank loan on my own….but, thankfully I know I will qualify with Fairstone (was: Citifinancia). And I did @ 30%. Hey, not much higher than the 27.99% on my credit cards, and, with a loan, the debt is moving in the right direction with an end date only 60 months away.

Fast forward 18 months.  $14,000 loan, 30.99%, $275/bi-monthly. Checked my balance. I owe $11,059.24. What?? After 18 months?? I’m so upset. Thankfully being in a better financial situation, I try with a bank again. They agree to loan me the money @ 6% for 48 months. Done deal. 

&amp;nbsp;

Call Fairstone asking for the payout amount. A payment went through last week for $275 which I assume some of which would have been applied to the principle, resulting in the previous balance to have gone down. Nope. Very friendly customer service rep advised that the entire payment went towards the interest. THE ENTIRE PAYMENT. What about the previous payment? Oh, that went entirely to the principle. So, isn’t that 50% interest? She said it works just like a mortgage. More interest in the beginning of the loan. 

&amp;nbsp;

Then, she calls me back. She made a mistake. To pay off the loan, I need to provide them with $11,158.04. For the interest over the upcoming week. I am so confused. So how much of my payment touches the principle? She cannot tell me.  

&amp;nbsp;

I feel so foolish. So financially taken advantage of. It’s discouraging, angering and just downright sad. So, let me tell you. Please please please head my advice. Whatever you need to do, whatever your financial burden(s), stay away from these corrupt organizations. Sell your couch, borrow from your Dad, ask your (very) best friend to co-sign a loan WITH A BANK.

Expenses:
Rent: $500 per month
Car loan: $600 per month @ 4.99% fixed with $23,000 remaining over a 6 year term (5 years left). This loan started at $40,000 in February 2017 and I have made lump sum payments since then
Medical Loan: $2,500 remaining from an $11,000 loan over 5 years @ 11% interest. I should have put money towards this loan sooner at the interest rate is high but at this point most of the interest is already paid
Cell phone: $60 per month. I was paying $90 a month with Rogers and called this weekend because I saw an offer from Freedom Mobile and they dropped my bill to $60 per month and gave me a $50 credit 
Insurance: $333 per month for a car and motorcycle. I recently shopped around with brokers and agents to find out my premiums are competitive

I recently consolidated all of my past employer RRSP accounts into a self-directed account with Questrade. I also transferred my current Employer RRSP funds into this account so I have more control and pay less MER fees. 

Goals: 
-	In the immediate term, I want to be less anxious about my finances and know I’m on the right track to grow my net worth over time, I need to know I have a plan.
-	I want to be diversified in my investments so I’m not constantly worrying about the stock market going up or down. 
-	I want to be debt free within the next 2 years but not at the expense of missing investment growth opportunities. In the past I had wasted money buying things I didn’t need and not saving money. I missed the real estate and stock bull markets of the past 10 years and hate myself for it. 
-	I like the idea of owning a house but if it makes sense to rent and invest I can do that for the foreseeable future. I also like the idea of retiring early and living abroad in a lower cost of living environment. 
-	Pay less taxes, less fees, keep more of my money 
-	I want to hang out with the folks over at FIRE 

Questions:
-	Should I open up a non-registered account or work on maxing out my TFSA and RRSP? Which should I focus on? I want to preserve the capital in my TFSA and be liquid. Are the VGRO and VBAL funds diversified? Should I own any Canadian ETF’s that include banks or utilities? Preferred shares? What’s a balanced portfolio look for someone my age and situation? 
-	How can I be smarter with my money? I make a good income and feel like it’s wasted either sitting in my checking/savings account or getting hammered in the market (bought VGRO and VBAL shares in the last 4 weeks to watch my account go red…)",finance

personalfinance,Paying off debt and preparing for a mat leave (CAN),"Here is my situation. 

I am preparing for my wife's mat leave starting at the beginning of next year. 

I am stuck on what my best option is going forward. 

Currently, our net monthly take home is $9,655.

Our monthly expenses total $5,800. It's high, but $4000 of it is just living expenses (rent, utilities, car insurance, fuel, car payments, etc.). The rest is food, netflix, Internet, $40 cell phone plans, etc. I can provide a detailed breakdown if there's interest.

We have 5 major debts:

 * Mazda 23k @ 0.99%  ($176 bi-weekly)
 * Honda 20k @ 0.99%  ($340 monthly)
 * Federal Student Loan $40k @ 4% ($400 monthly)
 * Federal Student Loan $40k @ 4% (Payments begin Nov. 2019)
 * Student Line of Credit  Loan $100k @ 2.7% (Payments begin June 2020)

Currently, I have $80,000 cash saved up. I want to eliminate the two car loans and one of the student loans by the end of April. That will free up $1,100 in our monthly expenses. It will also wipe out all of our savings and emergency fund. If we can stay on budget, we can save up about $30k by the end of January next year before the mat leave begins.

btc,"Questions about the scope/impact of the LN ""Channel Backup"" failure?","Edit: this must be a bad question (?) or hit a nerve because it was quickly downvoted to absolute zero.

I'd like some clarity on the ""Channel Backup"" failure. I know funds were lost, but whose funds? The channel owner? If a third party were using the channel at the time, would they be impacted?

If a sale were in progress, or completed using the open channel, could there be material loss from the backup/close failure?

About the channel backup in general, does a backup need to be made after every ""ledger"" entry? If so, wouldn't you then have to scale the bandwidth 3x? You would have to make multiple backups, at least 3 copies, because if you loose any one of them, you would need to compare the other two for parity. In other words, it isn't simply the case of having a backup, the LN network will punish you severely if you don't have the eldest backup.

Could this also be an attack vector? Some hater creates a clearly bogus close operation, it pisses-off the network, your channel is closed and funds/material is lost?

Broader discussion: If LN channel participants need to make backups, is this really defacto centralization? Hasn't the network created single points of failure? Channel availability (up-time) was already a strong argument against LN, but if there's any potential for material loss then each channel will require vetting. This would certainly rule out someone with a RaspberryPi in favor of using Federal First Trust Mutual Channel (TM).",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Order of Student Loan elimination,"My wife and I are finally at the point where we have enough of a savings (not the ideal 6 month savings) where we feel comfortable paying off her car loan with our tax return this year. That will be the first and largest step we can take right now to a proper debt snowball. Which gets me thinking about what I should target next.  

I have a ton of student loans. They're mostly under $5000 but there are a lot of them. But I only owe them to two different banks, so my payments are higher and it seems like I have a ton of debt left, even though I can go after them piecemeal. The total of those loans are both over $10k. I have owe a third Bank just over $5000, but it's one solid loan and it's a variable 10% interest rate. So it's technically the largest single loan and it's far and away AWFUL as far as interest.  

I feel like I need to target that next, but it feels like I wont be doing anything to it. The other loans keep existing for years while I spend years paying this one big one down as fast as I can. Do others agree that I should pay that off even if it doesn't feel like I am? The monthly payment on it isn't even that high compared to the other two ($200 and $250 compared to $65).

personalfinance,"After years of stupidity, I am buried and don't see a way out.","Throwaway because I'm embarrassed I've let it get so bad. So I'm in my mid 30s, grew up poor, and never learned any sort of money management skills. I swore I wouldn't make the same mistakes my mother did, but alas. 

&amp;nbsp;

By my early 20s, I had nearly $20,000 in debt. Part of that came from two cross-country moves for jobs that I put entirely on cards. They kept giving me cards and raising my limits and I spent. Eventually I got a personal loan (with a cosigner) and paid off all of the credit cards. Aside from student loans and a car payment, I was debt free. For all of a couple of months. 

&amp;nbsp;

I started using again (credit cards). First for another (permanent) cross-country move, then to furnish the new place because a break up left me with no furniture. The credit card debt continued to pile up. 

&amp;nbsp; 

Somehow, I was able to purchase a house though. So my mortgage is super low, lower than any rent could ever be (it's under $600). Buuuut, the sewer and electrical systems conked out and I took out loans to pay for repairs. 

&amp;nbsp; 

I also got married and took on debt from my spouse as well - a credit card and student loans. Then she needed major surgery and even with insurance, we needed a medical loan to cover expenses. Then I needed surgery - same deal. 

&amp;nbsp;

So here I am: about $17,000 in credit card debt, $5,000 student loans, $20,000 home repair loan, $14,000 in medical loans. 

&amp;nbsp;

Edit: I forgot to add that in desperation, we entered credit counseling a couple of years ago, which has brought down the credit card debt from $35K to the $17K it's at now. But it's done a number on my credit. Was this a fatal mistake? Should I leave it? 

&amp;nbsp;

We make decent livings, with both our incomes we're pulling down $142,000 a year (before taxes). But I feel like we're starting to drown. I can't secure any sort of consolidation loan because of the high credit utilization and debt/income ratio. I looked into a home equity loan, but the places will only give me options for a refinance, which would mean a higher interest rate and only $10,000 to put toward debt.

I'm 28 years old, and I recently accepted an engineering position at a company making $70k per year (pre-tax), in a low cost of living city (my rent is only ~$600 per month including utilities, and I'm comfortable enough that I have no desire to spend more for a nicer apartment). My new salary is nearly triple what I've been making the last few years, and I'd like to put that surplus to good use. I already have an emergency fund worth ~4 months of expenses (parked in an Ally Bank account, APY ~1.35% last time I checked), in case that alters the advice anyone has.

I've made some mistakes in the past, so I have some high interest debt (~$2500 in credit card debt) to take care of before beginning contributions. I also have federal student loans, with the highest interest rates being 6.8% and 6% (the rest are under 5%).

The company offers a 5% match on the (Roth) 401k, but it doesn't kick in until I've been there for a year.

Questions:

1) Obviously the CC debt should be eliminated first, but after that, should I begin contributing to my 401k, open an IRA (Roth or traditional) and contribute to that until the 5% match becomes available next year, or focus on further debt reduction?

2) I've heard that for younger, healthy workers an HSA is a good thing to look into early on, and that it functions similarly to an IRA/401k for some workers. Is this true, and if so, where does this fit into my contributions outlook?",finance

personalfinance,"Medical student graduating soon with ~$135k loans, wondering if it is possible to enroll in REPAYE program but still make total worth of standard payments each month? Also a few more questions below. Would love your advice /r/personalfinance","Hello Everyone, 

I have been lurking this subreddit for a while and figured I would post my loan issues here and you guys can let me know what you guys think of my plan or if you guys have any suggestions I would love to hear them.

All my loans are federal Direct loans. 

I went to a public undergraduate university in California from 2009-2013 and left with about $22,500 in loans (subsidized/unsubsidized with interest varying from 3.4%-6.8%).

I took a year off in between undergrad and medical school. I did not pay any of my loans off so I essentially used up my grace period on them.

I went to medical school in Michigan since I received a nice little scholarship and I am set to graduate this May. I took about $113,163 (all unsubsidized) in medical school. 

So I am graduating medical school with a total of an outstanding principal of $135,642 and outstanding interest of $14,096. All under one servicer (Great Lakes).

I am doing residency back in California and I will be living home, so that will essentially save me a ton of money. Salary in residency (6 years of residency) is about $55,560 (with an increase of about ~$1,000 every year). Salary post-residency is about $450,000 if I decide to do 6 years of residency. If I decide to do 3 years then I am looking at about $250,000. Right now I am decided on 6 years.

So my plan is to aggressively start paying off these loans. I essentially want to pay a standard payment on them ($1,400/month), but I had the grand idea of enrolling in a REPAYE program (since I am sure I will qualify with such little income) and get the 50% subsidy on the leftover interest. So this is where my first question comes up…

1. Is it possible for me to enroll in the REPAYE program to gain the benefit of the 50% subsidy of the leftover interest, pay the minimum payment, but then put more money on top of that each month as if I was paying a standard payment? Is that even possible? If so, is there any harm in doing this as opposed to just doing the standard payment? Some people have told me that this may not be possible. That is really my biggest question. 

2. My other question has to do with enrolling in PSLF. I most likely will be able to pay off my loans prior to 10 years, but I figured I would enroll in PSLF in case anything comes up (emergencies, etc.). I do realize that this means I will have to change my loans servicer to Fedloans Servicing, but is there any harm in enrolling for PSLF at this point for me? I know that some people on this subreddit have had some success recently. 

3. Last question... any reason for me to consolidate given that I used my grace period on my undergraduate loans although they are all under one servicer right now?

I know that this is a long post, so any help, suggestions, or advice would be greatly appreciated! Thank you guys so much. 

TL;DR: Medical student graduating with outstanding principal of $135,642 and outstanding interest of $14,096. Starting residency in California at a salary of $55,560/year for 6 years and living at home. I can make standard payments on my loans ($1,400/month), but would like to know if it is possible to enroll in REPAYE program, make those monthly payments, and then pay more on top of that each month as if it were a standard payment. Also, any harm in enrolling for PSLF? Any reason for me to consolidate?",finance

Currently, I have about $28k left of my student loans, and starting next month I will put down another $9k to fully pay off my highest interest rated loan. The following month I plan to put down another $3k to pay off my second loan, leaving me with around $16k for my last loan. With the final loan, I figure I could pay it off in around 10 months if I increase my monthly payments. 


I have $10k in an emergency fund that is stored in a high yield savings account, as well as another $3k in a different high yield savings account for which I use to re-fill my main checking account for big purchases.


My current expenses as of right now are $3.8k including my loan payment (minimum payment is around $750 but I am currently paying $1.5k). I am contributing 4% to my 401k, and the only reason it is low is because my employer also contributes 7% of my pre-tax salary automatically. 


Now, in regards to my pension plan, I was told that I cannot contribute to it. It's more of a formula where the company will take the last 10 years of service, apply it to some formula, and give me a payout based on that amount. Hypothetically, if I stick with the company and retire from there, I believe I'll be getting between $3-4k/month. I have around $23k in my 401k right now, and another $5.5k in a ROTH I maxed out last year. Also, I would like to buy a property (apartment/condo) in the future, but being in Silicon Valley, it's pretty crazy right now. Tips on how to save for that as well as paying off loans and making sure I don't screw myself by not saving enough for retirement? 

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

**TLDR;** Putting away total of 11% to my 401k, but getting pension in 2 years. Currently have about $28k left in debt. How much should I be putting into my retirement fund with knowledge that I also will have a pension plan?",finance
personalfinance,Something seems weird about my taxes?,"Okay, so, I have been a server/bartender for five years. I have always received an income tax refund. In 2017 I started a new job and honestly I've made about the same money as I always have. I owe around $1,100 in taxes this year and this has never happened to me. I know it isn't uncommon for someone that works for tips to have to pay taxes, but something just seems way off. A few people that I work with are single parents and still owe the IRS $2,000-$3,000 even with their earned income credit. A lot of us have asked our manager(s) about the increase in people owing money this tax season and (s)he kind of brushes it off.

My most recent pay stub (3/22/18) says I've made $1,420.07 in charge tips and $222.44 as the hourly ($2.13).
My YTD says $7,489.63 in charge tips and $1,274.33 in hourly pay. The federal withheld is $114.76 and $634.80 YTD. The FICA is $130.37 and YTD is $689.96.

I am totally fine with having $0 paychecks as long as the correct amount of taxes are deducted but I just feel lost. I'm obviously no tax professional, so I just need some insight on whether or not this seems fishy to anyone else besides me.",finance
personalfinance,Student Loan Question- asking for a friend,"Forgive me if this is common knowledge, but figured you guys could provide some insight :) 
I have a friend who recently went back to school to complete her degree. She has around 9k from previous loans at an interest rate of 5.93%. She currently has more loans that she has had to borrow at 6.9% and around 3k of that she doesn't need in order to afford school. Does she use the 3k to pay off on the previous loans or just return it as it is a higher interest rate? Any info will be greatly appreciated!

I received one 1099-MISC form this year for $600 (broker sign up promotion).

personalfinance,Save for down payment in high-yield savings accounts or pay down current mortgage?,"My wife and I currently have a mortgage with an interest rate of 4.625%. We are several years away from buying a new property, but it’s something that’s in the not too distant future.

We’ve recently started thinking about a plan to save for a down payment. From everything I readI think it’s best to keep the money somewhere safe, such as high-yield savings accounts, rather than invest it in the market and risk a poorly timed downturn.

My question is, does it make sense to pay extra to our current mortgage as a way of savings up for a future down payment for a new house? I’m sure there’s something I’m not considering, but it seems to me like that would guarantee us a return of 4.625% assuming there’s not a downturn in our local housing market during the time frame. 

I understand that buying and selling a home simultaneously can add a lot of complications with contingencies and all of that. I also understand that liquidity is a big deal.

Maybe the best thing is a mixture of the two, where we determine a monthly amount we can save and split it between extra principle payments on the mortgage and a high-yield savings account?

Curious to hear everyone’s thoughts.",finance

stocks,3 Stocks to buy/watch in April 2018,"It's that time of month again! 3 Stocks I'm buying/watching in April 2018! As always, if you prefer the video, you can find it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1WjLkKzCQw


1) Nvidia
-Number 1 is one of my new favorite companies - Nvidia! These guys are just a profit machine and growth machine and they keep posting outstanding numbers and show no signs of slowing down. The last month or so as the market has been a bit weak and volatile, NVDA has kind stood its ground. Everytime it sells off, buyers come back in to push it higher and this stock is really outperforming the market right now, and is showing similar strength as AMZN and NFLX as well. In march, we had 2 analysts come out and reiterate their view on NVDA
	-Argus	Buy	$250 → $280
	-RBC Capital Mkts	Outperform	$280 → $285
Both have targets that are a lot higher than the current share price and it's clear analysts are also very bullish on NVDA's future. Looking @ the technicals, we can see that NVDA is really holding above all its MA's well. Everytime we come down to the support level, people have the BTD mentality and then push it higher. We can see its making higher lows, but is finding resistance at around the $250 level. We need one of three things to happen to push this higher:
1) good news about the company - maybe a raised guidance for the upcoming QoQ
2) good news in the sector - Micron for example reports earnings this month and if they show strength, investors will believe NVDA will as well
3) market needs to move higher - NVDA follows the market, like any stock, to some extent
If we have a big rally in the market, we'll see NVDA make new ATHs IMO


2) Facebook
If you don't know my current stance on FB - I believe all of this negative news right now will blow over in a few months. Once next earnings come around, investors will remember why they love FB - because of their huge reach and huge profits. This is a stock I personally hold in my long term portfolio, and it's a company that just keeps growing. They own FB, Insta, and Whatsapp, and they have over 2B users on these platforms. Celebs are switching from Snap to Insta, which is where I think FB will be seeing a lot of $ coming in from. The selloff imo was unwarranted - I gave my reasoning in a different post I made recently. I believe FB will recover this year - but April in a great time to scoop up more shares in this company. It might be a slower recovery than we're used to, but as long as their earnings and growth continue, it should be back to ATH this year. In march, they had a hold rating by Stifel reiterated with a $168 price target. Nothing significant IMO. From a technical standpoint if we jump to the charts, FB is around its 200 day MA now and typically stocks stay at this level for a little while as they test it. I don't think FB will be any different. To move higher and past it, we'll need some good news to come out. I think Earnings can be that good news and they are scheduled to report May 2 - and I think we'll see a run up to Earnings in April. I'm watching the $145 level for support, but we did get pretty close to that yesterday with a successful gapfill.

	

3) Home Depot
-HD - of course a home improvement store, the largest in this space in North America - and their only true competitor is Lowes - who is far behind. Morgan Stanley said the recent weakness has created a ""compelling entry point"" for investors. Now, you shouldn't believe what these Analysts say, but you should pay attention to the general sentiment. Nothing has fundamentally changed in HD and they are still strong, and MS recognizes that. There are fears out there that interest rate hikes may affect home sales and renovation sales - but this is something we'll have to wait and see about. We did have hikes in the past, and home sales just kept rising QoQ, so if the last few years tells us anything, it's that people want to buy houses! In march, Loop Capital initiated coverage on HD with a HOLD rating but no price target set
-as for the technicals, if we jump to the charts, we can see that HD is moving sideways for the most part recently, still above its 200 day MA. I believe we will most likely dip down to test this before we move higher and this would be healthy for the stock. It's kind of fallen back in a range it was in 2017, so we could test the lower bound of this range at around $168 if we see weakness in the market. That would ideally be my entry point for HD if I was looking to play this


So there you have it guys, my 3 picks for April. Share what you think (I'm sure there will be a lot of controversy about FB...) and share what stocks you're looking to scoop up in April.",finance
personalfinance,"College Bound HS Senior, in need of financial advice","Alright, I'm a long time lurker on this subreddit (pretty much since I opened my account 3 years ago), as well as /r/studentloans, but I've decided to post this here because this sub is more active and you guys seem to give more big picture answers, not just specific to university financial aid. I'm looking for some financial advice relating to my post-secondary education and the feasibility of taking out as much money in loans as I might. 

I'm nearing the end of my senior year, and I'm between two schools, and not sure which one to pick. The first is a local (Cincinnati, Ohio area) public university that I've been accepted to, which offers a more than adequate program for my intended major (Comp. Sci.). The second school is a private university in a different city and state (Chicago, Illinois), but also has a good program offering.

I've done A LOT of looking over the numbers after receiving my full financial package from both schools, and here's a basic rundown of yearly cost of attendance and grant-based financial aid offered:

School #1 (Local):
   COA: $29,862
   Total Grant Aid Received: $9,570
   COA - Grants: $20,292

School #2 (Chicago): 
   COA: $57,556
   Total Grant Aid Received: $29,862
   COA - Grants: $26,086

These numbers include everything, from tuition to housing and books. 

My family is also unable to provide any monetary assistance due to their personal financial state, and my best bet on a cosigner, as far as credit is concerned, is my father (whom I do not live with). They are also unwilling to take Federal Parent PLUS loans, which means that I will have to take private loans. 

At the moment, I am leaning toward school #2.

Either school I choose will require me to take loans, but #2 would cost more. I'm looking at anywhere from about $34,000 (cheapest, living at home and going to school #1), to $104,000 (most expensive, school #2, living on campus all 4 years). A good middle ground seems to be in the $50,000 - $75,000 range, which is achievable through moving off campus. But, this is obviously still a large sum. 

Is taking this much in loans a good idea?

I do not plan to live on campus all four years, and will likely move off campus after one or two years regardless of which school I choose, but I would HEAVILY prefer not to live at home if I chose the local school due to familial issues. 

I have been working for the last two years of high school, but my savings total only $8,000 roughly, so it will only be able to slightly reduce the amount I need to borrow. I do plan to continue working part time while attending university. 

I can provide more information in the comments if needed, but this about sums it up. 

TL;DR: I might take anywhere from $34,000 to $104,000 in student loans to pursue computer science. Need help deciding if the higher ends of the range are feasible or worth it.

personalfinance,Looking for advice on how to use money from future sale of home.,"I’m looking for some advice from all of you out there. My wife and I are beginning the process of selling our home and buying a new one. Given when we bought our house, we have quite a bit of equity. I’m hoping approximately $60,000 after commission. We’re planning to do a 5% down conventional mortgage since we’ll be buying and selling at the same time and won’t have the funds for 20% down. 

What I’m looking for advice on is this. My wife currently has about $53,000 in student loan debt with an interest rate of almost 7%. My two thoughts on what we should do with the money from our sale are. 1) take the equity from the sale of our home and lump sum our mortgage balance to get to 78% LTV and drop the PMI which is about $80 a month. 2) take the equity and pay off as much, maybe all, of my wife’s student loans after we reimburse ourselves for the down payment on the new home and buy some new furniture. I have an idea of what I want to do but wondering what others might do if in our situation. 

What have others done with the money they made from selling your home, assuming you had other outstanding debt?

Also, our new mortgage will be 22.5 years at 3.625% and the homes we’re looking at are between $200,000-$250,000.

personalfinance,"Student Loan Debt, Marriage, House, Budgeting Decisions...","Going to give a lengthy description of the situation in hopes of getting specific advice!

My boyfriend and I (32 and 28, respectively) plan to be engaged in the next few months and move from NY to FL, where we intend to get jobs and settle long-term. He is in the field of dentistry and I am in the field of education. Our combined income will likely be around $200,000 starting out, though we won't be married right away.

He has over $500,000 (!!!) in student loan debt to pay off from dental school. The loans currently have a 6.8% interest rate and he probably can't refinance until he has been steadily working for several months. I am debt free and have some assets to bring to the table, including $125,000 dollars I recently inherited when my grandmother passed, as well as other investments and savings.

Although this is his debt, we realize that his costly education will allow him to make a very good salary by FL standards (far higher than mine), which will impact our quality of life down the road. If we tackle it together, it will probably benefit us both in the long run. We want to try to live frugally and pay it off as aggressively and quickly as possible, since the interest has the potential to add hundreds of thousands of dollars to the total amount owed. 

The timing will be tricky, as it will be best for his long-term career goals and income potential to buy into a practice within the next couple years. We also would like to start a family in the next 3-4 years given our ages and buy a house within the next 5 years (sooner would be preferable, but we realize that's probably not smart given the situation).

When I inherited the money from my grandmother, I decided to hold off on investing while we figured out some details such as how soon we might use it toward a down payment. Now that we're probably going to hold off on a house, we trying to make some decisions. 

Any money we put toward loans would be like an investment with an automatic 6.8% rate of return  (or whatever new rate he gets after refinancing), since we'd be saving that much by not accruing interest. So now I'm contemplating whether to set aside part of the inheritance money toward a down payment and put the rest towards the loans. I realize I can't do a large amount without facing gift tax until we're married. And of course we would also budget for an emergency fund and money to put towards our retirement accounts.

If we move forward with that plan (which we would document in a pre-nup), we have to decide what to do with the loan money until we're married and the house money until we're ready to buy. I've researched money market funds, which are safe but yield &lt;1% return. Or there are some conservative short-term funds with the potential for 4-6% returns, but still a risk factor with 10-20% invested in stocks.  

The last piece of the puzzle is whether or not to make all of these decisions on our own (with help from Reddit!) or seek financial advice. The company that manages my grandparents' estate (Rehmann) has offered to manage my money and provide financial planning advice for the family discounted rate of .25%. My boyfriend is really not a fan of turning over money to a money manager as it can have long-term impacts on net worth and can take away from motivation to learn things for yourself. I can definitely understand and appreciate this perspective. However, we wouldn't have to stay with this company long-term. Would it be worth it in the short-run given the tricky financial situation and number of major decisions we will be making to work with a professional?

So, after all that, any advice on how to best handle any aspect of this complex situation would be much appreciated!",finance
personalfinance,"To maximize credit score improvement - pay off as many cards as you can in full, or get everything under 30% utilization?","Hi PF,

Title says it all. My husband and I racked up a tad of credit card debt in our irresponsible youth. We've gotten a bit of a windfall. Not enough to pay it all off, but enough to either pay off some completely, or get most of them down under the 30% utilization threshold.

We are selling our house in the near future, so will be applying for a new mortgage, and would like to get the best possible interest rate. So, typically, I know the advice is to pay off the card with the highest interest rate first, but in this case my priority is to get our scores as high as possible.

So, should I put as much as I can toward paying off some entirely (but leave others with high utilization), or should I try to get them all under 30% then go back to paying them off little by little, monthly, like we have been doing. Again, with the goal being to maximize credit score improvement.

personalfinance,Credit Card Debt Consolidation Options,"I'm looking at consolidating my credit card debt to get it under control a bit. With child care/food and other necessities I'm left with very little each month. My cards take up a good portion as I'm paying more than the minimum on them to try and get them down faster. 

I have 3 credit cards and I'm looking at two options:

1. Personal loan with a fixed 200/month payment with a 10.9% interest rate
2. A fourth credit card with a 9.9% APR with a 2.9% balance transfer APR until 12/31/19 which bumps to 9.9% after that

Both options are through a credit union and those rates are set and I know I will be able to get either one.

Currently my Experian FICO is 779.

Here is a chart of my current cards:

Name | Credit Limit | Current Balance | APR | Minimum Payment
---|---|----|----|----
Chase | $5000 | $700 | 15.49% | $25.00
Bank of America | $9100 | $5100| 15.24% | $135.00
CitiBank(BestBuy) | $8000 | $2100 | 25.49% | $102.00

I know I need to do something about the CitiBank card as that is a very high interest rate. I'm just looking for a bit of advice on how I should approach this.

Any and all information is greatly appreciated and if any more information is needed feel free to ask.

personalfinance,Considering moonlighting - help with a financial course of action?,"I’m trying to plan out a course of action for my finances over the next few years and would really appreciate any help or insight y’all could offer.

Here’s my current situation: I'm 26 and work full-time for a nonprofit making $40,000, and will soon be getting a raise to $46,000. I contribute 10% of each paycheck to a 403(b) and my employer also contributes 10%. I have about $9,000 in stocks from a UTMA that’s now in my name, and opened a Roth IRA that currently only has about $500.

I feel pretty good about my retirement contributions, but I live in a very expensive city and I also currently have $14,000 in federal student loans remaining (just finished paying off a high-interest private loan), so it’s a bit of a strain to put much towards these loans beyond the minimum payment. I live a pretty minimalist lifestyle, keeping expenses low by meal prepping, budgeting, sharing a cheap(ish) apartment with my boyfriend, finding free entertainment, etc., but this debt stresses me out. I want to get established and start thinking about starting a family in the next few years. I’m considering moonlighting at somewhere like Starbucks or Trader Joe’s for ~10 hrs/week to bring in a little extra income.

My questions:

1. Would moonlighting like this actually be a good idea? (my employer has no restrictions on this sort of thing). I work a desk job where I barely talk to anyone all day and am also quite introverted – I always enjoyed my cash register jobs during high school and collefe because it forced me to talk to people, so I actually think it would be kind of fun.

2. If I were to bring in say, $400-$500 extra income per month, what would be the best place to put it? Roth IRA? Student loans?

3. I’m inclined to sell off my $9000 in stocks and kill off the better portion of my student loans with it. They haven’t really increased in value much in the past few years, and I’d love to see my debt reduced to the quadruple digits. But maybe this is a bad idea? Maybe I should keep it? Or transfer it over to my Roth IRA?

Any help would be much appreciated. I didnt grow up learning much from my parents in the way of financial literacy so I'm kind of trying to figure it out as I go. Thanks so much!!",finance
personalfinance,University financial aid,"So I'm probably about to be screwed over at the end of this semester. My student loans don't kick in until I am no longer in classes, but I am at risk for being suspended from the University. It usually goes from Good standing to Probation to Suspension. Now, I'm going to require some benefit of the doubt that the probation is not my fault and it is what I am trying to get fixed currently, but the current semester is my fault. Working four 12-hour shifts plus going to classes and paying for things with my SO has usually got me drained.

I am 25YO and have barely 70 credit hours out of 120 needed for my bachelors. For my first poor semester, I actually only had one course at the University and had a few others at a community college. I used loans to pay for the majority of it and actually have a federal pell grant as well. For the one course that I had at the big university that I failed, I am fighting the situation. I am currently not able to withdraw any courses for special circumstances. The course was a 400 level math course. It had a prerequisite of another math course that I had already passed. However, it also had a non-formal prerequisite of *another* math class that was a level 300 course that I had not had. This provided a huge basis for the knowledge required of the course and I definitely would not have taken the course yet if I had known of this ""non-formal"" requirement. I tried contacting my Financial Aid as well as the professor about the course and basically found out that it was going to be an extremely hard course that I had little chance of passing and I couldn't drop it. So obviously, I failed it.

Now, since it was my only course at the semester and I failed, I was put on probation. I was charged against for failing a class since I had used loans to pay for it, and my financial aid was severely limited for the following (current) semester. So now I am extremely stressed because I am not doing well and I have to maintain X GPA for the semester else I go on suspension, I may potentially have to pay ""double"" for the classes I have yet to pay for, and I have basically no financial aid to pay for it.

Not really in a position where I can receive outside assistance, I have recently started going to a blood center where I can sell platelets for money, I already am worked basically to my capacity at work while maintaining school (have to maintain to keep the loan payments at bay), and am helping to support myself and my SO in a house that we rent. We have even moved two other people into this house so that all the payments are cheaper.

I do not spend really any money at all out, I don't eat out ever (I am actually very underweight), and I'm just afraid. I don't have a lot of savings to be able to just pay it off and buy time for myself.

personalfinance,Use savings to pay off debt?,"Hey PF, so I know this question is asked a million times but I just wanted to get some confirmation. I am wondering if I should dip into my emergency fund to go ahead and pay off my car and some credit card debt in order to clear up some more money to help pay for my tuition. I am currently 3 classes away from getting a second bachelor's degree in computer science, so in an ideal scenario my income would increase in the next couple months to a year. Here are some numbers for my situation below:


Monthly Income: $2800

Emergency fund: $5200 (saved my cars life with new starter replacement! I love emergency funds)

Roth IRA: $3700 contribute $100/month

Simple IRA: $2700 contribute 3% with work match

Investments: $500 (would probably cash these out for debt)



Car Loan: $1,100 left with $286 monthly payments @ 7.99% interest (car was older than 10 years when bought, lowest interest rate I could get...idiot buying my first car)

CC 1: $789 @ 15% APR

CC 2: $1900 @ 0% until January 2019

CC 3: $3500 @ 0% until September 2019 (I use this to transfer my tuition bills to for school)

Remaining tuition: $3700 with last class ending in August


Monthly expenses-----

Rent: $740 increasing to $750 in July

Utilities: ~$170

Car: $286

Insurance: $98

Food: ~250-300

..and other miscellaneous expenses/netflix subscriptions. By the end of the month I have somewhere around $300-$400 left in my checking and don't like to go below that number just in case something crazy happens.

My plan was to borrow something like $1500 from my emergency fund and cash out the $500 I have in other investments and just pay off my car to free up that $286 per month for other CC debt and tuition bills. Once I payed off my car, i would focus on paying my tuition and knock out CC 1 debt immediately. I am not extremely worried about the tuition bills as the late fee is 1% per month until it is paid off, but I would more than likely use the majority of the extra money to pay this tuition, then focus on CC 2, and then CC 3. Does this sound like a good plan? Should I leave the emergency fund alone? Take more of the emergency fund for debt?",finance

She is 75, has Medicare part A but not B, collects Social Security, but has informed me that she hasn't filed a federal tax return since her 1984 divorce. Her former husband worked while they were married, but she developed a pathological fear of the government during the divorce and was somehow convinced that filing a tax return was ""voluntary""

personalfinance,Super unusual tax situation - girlfriend needs to file an amended return but the form is not set up to handle her particular error!,"I'll add a TL;DR at the bottom because this may get lengthy.


My girlfriend is old school and does her taxes with pen and paper. Last year (2016 taxes) she was working a new job and owed something like $7,400 but had federal withholdings of $14,000. She got a big fat refund of $6,600. Technically she was working at two different jobs - so she had two W2s. 


Fast forward to this year and she does her taxes for 2017. Her income was a bit higher this year but not dramatically different. So imagine her surprise when at the end of the day she's showing a $900 refund! She goes back and checks all the math and it's accurate...so why did she go from a $6,600 refund to a $900 refund? To answer that she goes back and looked through her 2016 return and *that's* where she found her mistake.


For her 2016 taxes she had two W-2s. One showed withholdings of $5,000 and the other $4,000. Somehow, someway, she managed to double the $5,000 withholding when using her calculator. As a result she put down $14,000 [($5,000 x 2) + $4,000] in withholdings so $14,000 in withholdings on $7,400 in taxes owed: boom, here's your $6,600 back ma'am. Only her actual withholdings were $9,000 and she should've only received $1,600 [$9,000-$7,400] as her refund. My understanding is it's a minor miracle that the IRS didn't catch this mistake and went ahead and wrote her a check for $6,600. *[Sidenote: due to an error in how TurboTax reported healthcare expenses on a form I uploaded to the website my reported insurance spend was off by $6. The IRS caught that shit right away, sent me a letter asking for an amended form, and made me wait an extra 4-6 weeks for my refund]*


Now we're at the present and she hasn't heard a peep from the IRS. But being an honest, upstanding citizen she wants to correct this mistake so she prints out a 1040X *Amended U.S. Individual Income Tax Return* and starts to fill it out. But as far as either of us can tell, the 1040X is *not* set up to handle this type of error. I presume this is because the IRS cannot imagine a reality where this error is possible. The 1040X is set up so that you can add income or change your taxes paid - not amend your stated withholdings in order to give money back to the IRS.

https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040x.pdf

Now there is a **PART III: Explanation of Changes** at the bottom of the form. My thought is that she could write out an explanation of what's going on and include a check to the IRS for the extra $5,000 she mistakenly received. The fact that an area for explanations exists makes me think a real live human at the IRS will be reading this and it'll work. Then the IRS can write back saying ""thanks for the check, you also owe $XX in penalties and fees even though you pointed out this error to us as soon as you realized it"". 


Anyway, does anyone have any experience with this or insights on whether our proposed fix will work? The other idea would be to get someone from the IRS on the phone but I imagine that's an ordeal unto itself. 

**TL;DR:** girlfriend accidentally overstated her federal withholding by $5,000 on her 2016 tax return. The IRS did not catch the mistake and gave her an extra $5,000 in her refund. She found the mistake this year and is trying to fix the issue and give the extra $5,000 back. The 1040X form does not appear to be set up to address this particular kind of error. What do?",finance
personalfinance,Received bonus check and don't know where to start with debts so old if they were a dog they'd be dead.,"Through tax return, bonus and finally having some money left over at the end of the month I have about $6k in the bank in excess of my reoccurring bills.

Now, I’ve been employed at a marketing agency. I was hired on in October for $36k/year, and with a positive review, that’s been increased to $40k/year + quarterly bonus (~$2-4k a year).

Here’s my current funds/debt: 

&gt;+$6000 emergency fund.
&gt;
&gt;-$8900 car loan @ 4.1% interest
&gt;
&gt;-$11,700 student loans @6.8% interest
&gt;
&gt;No credit card debt or any other loans

My expenses break down like this: 

&gt;$750  rent
&gt;
&gt;$120 electric
&gt;
&gt;$50 water
&gt;
&gt;$182 car
&gt;
&gt;$234 student loans
&gt;
&gt;$145 cellphone
&gt;
&gt;$45 internet
&gt;
&gt;$16 gym
&gt;
&gt;$15 streaming
&gt;
&gt;$170 every 3 months for ADHD meds
&gt;
&gt;$740 every 6 months for car and renter’s insurance 


The rest of the money is food/gas/spending which tend to be more flexible amounts. Some of these expenses are shared with my boyfriend (rent, electric, water, cellphone, internet etc.) but all the bills come out of my account and he pays me back at the end of the month (Usually $550-600ish). Usually, that check goes right into savings, but sometimes some gets diverted to offset any over-spending or small surprise-bills.

Now that my EF is a solid 3-6 months bare-bones living, I’m deciding my next move. 

I know, theoretically, I should pay off the student loans first, since they are larger and have the higher interest rate. But I have a BAD track record with cars (totalled 2 within a year and a half. It’s a story.) After doing some quick math, if I throw the $550-600 a month from my boyfriend, plus my raise/bonus, at the car loan it’ll be gone within a year. I will always have my education - that car, not so much. 

However...Now that it’s possible (and I never thought I’d say this...) I REALLY want a house. I’m sick of renting. I want walls I can paint whatever color my heart desires, rooms I can remodel as I see fit, a yard I can tear up/garden, pets, an art/crafting space where I don’t have to worry about my landlord’s reaction if I get paint on the walls. 

Small, 2-3 bedroom houses in our area are only ~$100-150k in decent neighborhoods, LESS if we want to go for a fixer-upper that needs work. I have no intention of having kids, and that’s not changing. I have 0 interest in a mcmansion in a fancy school district. 

My credit score is solid (last it was pulled it was over 800).

Is it even within reason that, in 2-3 years, I’ll be able to afford to buy a house if the market stays stable? Or am I just delusional and should focus on ridding myself of my debts? 

Note: Until there’s a ring involved, I’m looking at things as affording this by myself. We’re talking about marriage and buying a house together, but that’s still a few years out. Yes, he knows of my desire to buy a house, and that's in the plan too, I'm just itchy to move it up the priority ladder.

&gt;$10k emergency fund

&gt;$40k student loans

Right now, I’m paying a slightly larger share of food/spending while he throws extra money at dem loans. If we were to break up, my landlord would let us out of the lease, and I’d move to a more modest place (one/two bedrooms in my area can still be found for ~500-600 a month, and include some utilities).",finance

I am a full-time student and my only income this year has been $4500 from an employer with whom I did a research fellowship. The 1099-G form I received says I received $4500 in taxable grants. All other boxes are blank.

I also tutored for a tutoring company on the side. From them, I received a 1099-MISC form saying my non-employee compensation and state income are both $300.

I also receive a large amount of federal loans, but I don't believe this counts as taxable income. 

Finally, I also received a check from my school for $6400, but the purpose of this is a stipend to support activities related to a research project I was doing. On the paystub, my total gross and net pay are $6500, but Taxable Gross, FICA Gross, Total Taxes, and Total deductions are all $0. When I log into my schools payroll and billing system, I can access my pay stub but there are no 1099 or W2 forms available for me.

My conclusion is that my taxable income is $4500 + $300 = $4800, which means I don't have to file anything. And since I haven't had anything withheld, I wouldn't be getting a refund after filing.

Every time I tell my friends this, they just look at my nervously and say that they are in a similar situation but just clicked through the forms on turbotax / credit karma ""just in case"".

personalfinance,"After being sold a lemon titled car I couldn't be more upside down, I have come a long way, but I need guidance!","My situation started in February of 2017. I traded my Jeep Wrangler (that I owned outright) for a 2015 Nissan Altima. Probably my first mistake, but the thing got about 12 miles to the gallon, needed regular repairs, had a soft top, and all the while I was starting a new job where I would be driving minimum 60 miles a day. Little did I know the new Altima was a Lemon title in the state of California, but it was sold to me in Arizona. Apparently since it was from a different state and the lemon law is different in AZ, legally they did not have to disclose it to me. 

About a month after I bought the car I talked to the owner of dealership about what had happened, and he told me I could speak with their lawyer. They offered me to buy back the car for 10,500. I owed 13.5k. They said they would only buy it back if I picked something else on their lot to roll the negative equity onto. 

So at this point I should have cut my loss and kept the car. I know NOW taking the deal was a huge mistake, but I was all up in my own head about how cheated I felt and didn’t want to end up with a lemon that was worth half of what I paid. I took the deal. Bought a Scion Xb for 12.5k and rolled 3,000 onto it. The kicker was they only let me use their financing with a 24% APR. 

I payed on the Scion Xb car for 6 months, and recently switched to a 2014 Nissan Sentra with a 4% interest rate. My current loan amount on the Sentra is 16,000. The car now has 35,000 miles on it, and I have owned it for 7 months. My credit score just went back up to 724 on Trans, and 730 on equifax. 

This model of Nissan is highly regarded as a terrible car due to the CVT transmission going out between the first 30-50k miles. I have a warranty on the car until 60k, and I have know two seperate people who had the transmissions go out before 50k. 
My Question for personal finance is what should I do about this loan? I don’t want to keep my Sentra after the warranty runs out in risk of paying out for a new transmission. I also do not want to keep carrying negative equity over to new loans. I feel like I have now done a good job in getting such a low interest rate for someone who has had 3 different car loans in 2 years. I have also worked very hard on my credit by regularly using my credit cards, as well as getting regular credit increases every 3-6 months. 
I have also saved several thousand dollars up for a down payment for my next loan to try and come out with equity this time around. 

I guess my question for personal finance is what would you do going forward in this situation? I know this car isn’t worth any where near 16k, and I have the money to cover the negative equity. Should I double pay on the car, should I refinance and put a lump sum down, or should I switch to a Toyota/Honda that isn’t known for problems? 
Thanks for reading this long winded post about my problems, ANY advice would help me. Everyone in my life is pretty well stumped on which answer is the best answer. 

I would say my goal is to get back to NEVER having a car loan again, and ALWAYS buying my vehicles outright in cash from now on.

**Bitcoin and me (Hal Finney)** 

Copied from https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=155054.0

I thought I'd write about the last four years, an eventful time for Bitcoin and me.

For those who don't know me, I'm Hal Finney. I got my start in crypto working on an early version of PGP, working closely with Phil Zimmermann. When Phil decided to start PGP Corporation, I was one of the first hires. I would work on PGP until my retirement. At the same time, I got involved with the Cypherpunks. I ran the first cryptographically based anonymous remailer, among other activities.

Fast forward to late 2008 and the announcement of Bitcoin. I've noticed that cryptographic graybeards (I was in my mid 50's) tend to get cynical. I was more idealistic; I have always loved crypto, the mystery and the paradox of it.

When Satoshi announced Bitcoin on the cryptography mailing list, he got a skeptical reception at best. Cryptographers have seen too many grand schemes by clueless noobs. They tend to have a knee jerk reaction.

I was more positive. I had long been interested in cryptographic payment schemes. Plus I was lucky enough to meet and extensively correspond with both Wei Dai and Nick Szabo, generally acknowledged to have created ideas that would be realized with Bitcoin. I had made an attempt to create my own proof of work based currency, called RPOW. So I found Bitcoin facinating.

When Satoshi announced the first release of the software, I grabbed it right away. I think I was the first person besides Satoshi to run bitcoin. I mined block 70-something, and I was the recipient of the first bitcoin transaction, when Satoshi sent ten coins to me as a test. I carried on an email conversation with Satoshi over the next few days, mostly me reporting bugs and him fixing them.

Today, Satoshi's true identity has become a mystery. But at the time, I thought I was dealing with a young man of Japanese ancestry who was very smart and sincere. I've had the good fortune to know many brilliant people over the course of my life, so I recognize the signs.

After a few days, bitcoin was running pretty stably, so I left it running. Those were the days when difficulty was 1, and you could find blocks with a CPU, not even a GPU. I mined several blocks over the next days. But I turned it off because it made my computer run hot, and the fan noise bothered me. In retrospect, I wish I had kept it up longer, but on the other hand I was extraordinarily lucky to be there at the beginning. It's one of those glass half full half empty things.

The next I heard of Bitcoin was late 2010, when I was surprised to find that it was not only still going, bitcoins actually had monetary value. I dusted off my old wallet, and was relieved to discover that my bitcoins were still there. As the price climbed up to real money, I transferred the coins into an offline wallet, where hopefully they'll be worth something to my heirs.

Speaking of heirs, I got a surprise in 2009, when I was suddenly diagnosed with a fatal disease. I was in the best shape of my life at the start of that year, I'd lost a lot of weight and taken up distance running. I'd run several half marathons, and I was starting to train for a full marathon. I worked my way up to 20+ mile runs, and I thought I was all set. That's when everything went wrong.

My body began to fail. I slurred my speech, lost strength in my hands, and my legs were slow to recover. In August, 2009, I was given the diagnosis of ALS, also called Lou Gehrig's disease, after the famous baseball player who got it.

ALS is a disease that kills moter neurons, which carry signals from the brain to the muscles. It causes first weakness, then gradually increasing paralysis. It is usually fatal in 2 to 5 years. My symptoms were mild at first and I continued to work, but fatigue and voice problems forced me to retire in early 2011. Since then the disease has continued its inexorable progression.

Today, I am essentially paralyzed. I am fed through a tube, and my breathing is assisted through another tube. I operate the computer using a commercial eyetracker system. It also has a speech synthesizer, so this is my voice now. I spend all day in my power wheelchair. I worked up an interface using an arduino so that I can adjust my wheelchair's position using my eyes.

It has been an adjustment, but my life is not too bad. I can still read, listen to music, and watch TV and movies. I recently discovered that I can even write code. It's very slow, probably 50 times slower than I was before. But I still love programming and it gives me goals. Currently I'm working on something Mike Hearn suggested, using the security features of modern processors, designed to support ""Trusted Computing"", to harden Bitcoin wallets. It's almost ready to release. I just have to do the documentation.

And of course the price gyrations of bitcoins are entertaining to me. I have skin in the game. But I came by my bitcoins through luck, with little credit to me. I lived through the crash of 2011. So I've seen it before. Easy come, easy go.

That's my story. I'm pretty lucky overall. Even with the ALS, my life is very satisfying. But my life expectancy is limited. Those discussions about inheriting your bitcoins are of more than academic interest. My bitcoins are stored in our safe deposit box, and my son and daughter are tech savvy. I think they're safe enough. I'm comfortable with my legacy.

After six months of being unemployed and being forced to survive on my credit cards, I've finally landed a full time job again. I haven't started yet, but that should happen in the next few weeks.

I've currently got two cards with a combined balance of roughly 15k. Now my new job doesn't pay a ton, but it's enough to survive, and definitely better than unemployment. Of course, interested companies have been sending mailers for debt consolidation services, and I wanted to ask what you guys thought about these services.

As part of my background, I'm not horrible at managing my money, before my job was discontinued, my credit score was over 800. Now I've taken a significant hit, but only due to my balances being carried. Haven't missed a payment (even though I've only been paying the monthly minimums).

Should I look into debt consolidation to try and reduce my interest rate? Or are there other, better options to repair my credit?

Thanks in advance for any advice.",finance

personalfinance,When to refinance?,"I'm a 21 year old female who just left her 5 year job due to the stress and lack of movement. I want to go back to get my Associates in Nursing and start working as an RN by 2019 Spring the latest. Right now my monthly income is ~1600 a month roughly. My monthly expenses are ~1320. This is due to the fact I haven't found another solid job to replace my old one. I do have two part time jobs to survive, but I'm scared of the fee I'll get for not having health insurance. 

Anyways, my current car payment is 282 with a 72 month lease, and a 4.45% interest rate. I looked on credit karma and it provided me with a loan that would lower my payments to 230 and my interest rate to 2.5%. I've been in the loan for about 10 months, one thing hurting my credit score is my credit age being so low. Should I just wait it out or should I refinance? My current credit age is 1 year and my score is roughly 700.

I hope that covers everything? Thanks in advance!

I was feeling a lot of stress about my finances because they seemed so overwhelming and it didn’t feel like I was making a dent despite making large payments.

personalfinance,Private student loan payoff and new vehicle down-payment dilemma,"Thanks for taking time to look at this scenario with me to find the best solution for my situation.

I currently live in an area with a higher COL and earn about 54k annually. From that, I contribute 8% with a 12% employee match for retirement and deduct about $1,500 for HSA.  I have only $2,500 in savings with plans to get engaged in the next year and take some minor trips to see immediate family that live far away.

I can't do anything about my public loans (44k) because I'm working towards Public Student Loan Forgiveness (PSLF), which caps your payments at IBR.  I have two other loans that I can dictate how fast I pay off: the first is at 13k with an 8% interest rate and the second is at 2k with a 6.050% interest rate. The vehicle I own (completely paid off) is a '04 and has cost me about 1k a year in necessary fixes and has a few things that will add to those expenses if not treated within the next year.  For this reason, I am hoping to upgrade to a newer vehicle with features suitable for the lifestyle and climate I live in (need 4wheel drive, towing capacity, etc.). 

The issue I'm running into is the long-term financial sense it makes to take any option. I could save about $300 a month currently to put towards a down-payment or use that be more aggressive with my private loans.  I also know that refinancing is an option, but am inexperienced in how to do it or what to look for, should that option even be considered as the best avenue.  

I'm sure those of you who can help are missing some information from me and for that I apologize. I'm happy to add more if it will help to make the most sound decision moving forward.",finance

personalfinance,I went to a CPA and owned taxes for the first time ever. Can I double check with TurboTax or is that illegal or can it cause any issues?,"I've used the same CPA for many years now, but usually my parents would go and I would just sign documents since I usually was busy with work or volunteering.


Anyways, I believe in 2016 I increased my deductions to, I believe 3. This way I got more money back in my check and was hoping to get a small deduction. I even asked my CPA prior to help make sure I wouldn't owe anything.


My income was around the $43k at the time and is $45 now. I have a child and I am married as of 4/2016. Dont own a home. Investments I have are a Roth IRA, Deferred Comp, and Goldman Sachs (saving). I also use and used as of last year Flex Benefits for my copays ($50 biweekly). 


I thought I would be good to come out a bit ahead with a tax return, albeit a small one. However, I was very upset to hear that I owe the Federal Government around $500 and the state (NY) around $75. We did file married and he said it was an issue with my withholdings.

personalfinance,"Continue to withhold extra for spouse's sole proprietorship taxes, or begin paying quarterly estimated taxes?","Hi everyone,  

I work in corporate America, while my spouse own's their own sole proprietorship. In years past I've simply withheld an extra $200 month ($100 Federal/$100 state) to ensure that we didn't owe in. However within the last year my spouse's business has doubled. This year, despite withholding $200 per month, we owed $3500. This wasn't a surprise per se, but it makes me wonder if there's a better way to do this.  

This year I estimated that we'll need to withhold $500 per month in order to make up the shortfall assuming this year is similar to last year. This begs the question, should we begin paying quarterly estimated taxes, or continue to withhold?  

The advantages of withholding are simple, don't really change anything but up the amount. However I'm thinking it may make it easier for budgeting/financial projections if we simply deduct taxes due on a quarterly basis.

personalfinance,Advice on spending insurance money wisely?,"**TL;DR** - I'm getting a few thousand dollars from my insurance company for a motor vehicle theft claim on a vehicle that was not my primary mode of transportation.  Would it make more sense to invest it into student loans, my auto loan, or pay off my credit card and keep the rest for rent/utilities? (if else, I'm open to suggestions!)  

Hi everyone! So to give a little background here, I owned a motorcycle for the last 5 years.  Unfortunately it was stolen out of my parking garage a few weeks ago and I'm heart broken over it.  I put a lot of blood, sweat, paychecks, and tears into that thing to truly make it my own.  Looking ahead, I was notified by my insurance company recently that they will be paying out the total loss compensation from my insurance policy (value of the bike + accessories/work that I did to it).  I have a *very rough* estimate of what this will be, and it will be enough to make a dent in one (or some) of my debt that I've accrued from college and life after college.  

A little bit about myself:  I'm 24 y/o and about a year out of college.  I've had well-paying entry level job since.  I am a software developer in a very stable position, and I am not *hurting* for this money, although I want to spend it wisely and efficiently.  FWIW my credit score is above a 750 as well so I like to think I got my recurring finances under control.  I'll admit, I'm not a finance guy, so some topics might be ELI5 material.  Before I get berated, yes, I read the amazing wikis that were put together on this page and they were very helpful! Thanks to all that contributed to those.  However, I have most of those topics covered and I feel my situation is a little different because I'm not asking *where* to put my money, rather which would be *more efficient* in my scenario.  As far as rent, utilities, mobile/cable bills, gas, food/groceries, etc. goes, I have them under control and retain around $1,200 a month after I pay all of my bills (to include the following debt summaries).  I have both a Roth IRA and 401k. I contribute the maximum amount in my 401k that my company will match - I think it's 5%, matched 5%, IIRC, in a fund that matches the stock indexes.  Since I started working at my current company, I have neglected investing in my Roth IRA because I don't really get anything that matches it like my 401k does.  

Summary of my debt:  
Auto loan:  
*  original principle - $14,315.95  
* remaining principle - $12,151.23  
* interest rate - 3.54%  
* maturity - April, 2023 (or 72 mos)  
* details - 2013 GMC SUV, bought it used (prior lease), ~49k miles on it, clean title, no history of damage. Minimum payment is about $220/mo, but I usually put in $115 biweekly.  This is a comfortable payment in my current income bracket.  

Student loans:  
* current, total principle - $20,242.52  
* types of loans - 4 different loans: 2 direct sub, 2 direct unsub  
* interest rates - 2 sub @ 4.29%, 2 unsub @ 3.75%  
* maturity - 2028(ish)...10 years payment plan.  
* details - I pay about $124 a month between all 4 loans and have only just begun paying on them due to the grace period after graduation.  I'm about 1-2 payments in and have not paid anything towards the principle of the loan yet.  I haven't quite figured out how this will impact my ""comfort"" in my finances because I also just got a pretty good tax return that I've been using to chip away at this for the first few months while I adjust my lifestyle to owing this bill too.  

Various credit card debt:  
* principle - usually floats around $500-$1000, bimonthly.  
* details - although this is debt, I usually pay my credit cards off each month.  

Cellular:  
* principle - around $250  
* details - I can't believe this type of debt is a thing, but yes, I owe money on my cell phone. Lol.  

So here's my question:  
Given the state of my vehicle, with [predictive vehicle depreciation](https://goodcalculators.com/car-depreciation-calculator/) taken into account (assuming I own the car for at least 7 more years), is it worthwhile to use the insurance money I will receive (should be close to $5,000) at the principle of the vehicle - which has almost double the monthly payment of my loans, or is it more efficient to put a ""dent"" in my student loans - which has a higher interest rate?  Of course, I could split it and pay some of both.  I suppose I could also pay off my phone and keep the rest in a checking account to use for utilities and give myself some more breathing room for a ""rainy day fund"".  My question is **which debt should I attack in order to be most efficient at eliminating ALL of my debt in the shortest amount of time**  

side note:  
I've been reading a lot of /r/churning lately and I've also tossed around the idea of applying for a more appropriate rewards-based card for my lifestyle, paying X dollars to X payment book, and then using the insurance money to pay off that credit card.  Thus maximizing rewards *and* tackling some of my debt.

Does this information affect how much of a raise I should get? I've never negotiated for pay before and I'm somewhat nervous. I don't know what my coworkers are paid. Do I need to ask them? Is it normal to ask for a 65% increase if sales and my workload have gone up that much? How do I ask?

personalfinance,Living+working abroad - pension/savings/mortgage?,"Well I've been living and working abroad for the past 8 years or so. Due to a few mishaps and events outside of my control I haven't actually managed to save up much money (as was the original plan-and then come home). Things have changed recently and I've started to finally take control of my finances. I'm currently able to save 40% of my salary each month, around 15-20% goes on my rent, another 5% is on bills+fixed costs. The rest is living expenses and discretionary spending. 

Anyone know what happens to your UK pension if you've been living abroad and not paying taxes for so long? 

Also what would the general advice be regarding obtaining a mortgage? I assume I don't have much of a credit score in my home country, as there is no such system where I have been living. I have been paying my student loan back but that's it. 

Also I'm working toward building a significant deposit for a downpayment on a home upon my return. Currently this is accumulating in a savings account with a 1.75% p.a. interest rate, which is calculated and paid monthly. I also have access to this money if need be for emergencies so its not locked away for a fixed period or anything like that. Is there anything better I could do with this money to help it grow faster? Perhaps buy gold, or invest in solid shares such as apple (take some inspiration from Warren buffett) ?

personalfinance,"Set up payment for a forgotten credit card, but found it listed as a ""Closed"" account in credit history...","Dear personalfinance, 

I have been reading a lot of this sub lately in an effort to create a better relationship with money and budgeting. I have a much larger post that I am in the process of drafting, but I have a specific issue that is time sensitive that I was hoping I could get some input on. 

I have historically been quite terrible with money. I was taught nothing about budgeting or planning, and have never learned it myself. I have found myself, in desperation, occasionally doing stupid things, such as opening this Total Visa card - high-interest rate, low limit, high fees - using it to pay off a big bill, and at some point, forgetting about it. 

A few days ago I spoke with a representative at Total Visa. She told me that I have a balance of $468 on the card and that I **must** pay a minimum of $114 by the end of the week to keep the account from getting ""charged off.” So, not wanting to screw up my credit even more, but currently being extremely broke for the next three weeks, I set up a debit payment of $114 to come out of my account this Friday, March 30th. 

I remember reading something in here about paying things in collections and getting things in writing and such, so I decided to look into it further. I signed into Credit Karma, and in my closed accounts section, there is the Total Visa card (which is with Mid-America Bank &amp; Trust) for $468. The Credit Karma information says that it was closed on Dec.1, 2017, and that is 120 days past due, [as you can see in the photo.](https://imgur.com/a/HA20G)  

So, if this account is already closed, and is not currently showing in my payment history section or derogatory marks, should I NOT pay the $114 later this week? What is paying them that money going to do to me and my credit? Will I just be throwing money away? 

I also just received an email today from them stating that the Mid-America Bank &amp; Trust has been acquired by the Bank of Missouri...

To be clear, I am not trying to shirk my debts. I spent some of that money/credit that is owed (the rest is their insane interest and fees) and I fully intend on paying this and all of my debts. But, I would really like to do it in an organized fashion, with planning and organization, in a way that most positively benefits my situation and credit. I will be ready to start doing that in a few weeks once I have made/finished my plan, and have the income to execute it. 

Thank you for your thoughts.",finance

personalfinance,[Debt] Helping my GF consolidate her $20k CC loans - personal loan or 0% CC ?,"Hi there - thanks for taking the time to read this. I'm a big fan of PF, but this latest question from my girlfriend has me scratching my head.

Over the past few years, my gf has had terrible financial habits.  Last year, just a week after I met her, I discovered that she had maxed out some credit cards and a few other debts in her mid 20s.  In an effort to clean up her act, she hired a company to help settle those debts. 

Long story short, she ended up with a consolidated loan of about $20k at 24% interest, and her minimum monthly contribution is $600 and change.  Her credit is shot (thats a given), but her parents are willing to help out as a cosigner if she can find a better solution.

She has recently come into a situation where she can contribute around $1k/month, but even so, the interest on that loan is a killer.  I then considered recommending a 0% CC with a balance transfer, with the idea that when the 0% interest is over, she could find a competing credit card and transfer the balance again, until 20 months or less has passed.

I realize there is almost always a 'transfer fee' usually to the tune of 5%, but that seems a pittance compared to multiple years at 25% interest.  Would this be a good avenue to suggest?
Could you even use a CC transfer check to pay off a personal loan?

Just looking for suggestions here to help her get out from under the interest rate. At $1k a month, she could have it paid off in under 2 years, especially if she is able to make extra contributions as they come along (bonuses, etc).

Thanks again!",finance

personalfinance,(AUS) 20yo needing general investment advice for the future. Have a start but don't want to make stupid mistakes,"Hi all, I've been reading through this sub for quite some time and thought that I might get some advice based on my own situation.

Bit of background first - I'm 20yo and live in Australia. I have a primary job earning 65k a year, and a secondary job earning 15-25k a year. Employer superannuation rates are 18.5% (12.5% employer, 6% me) and 9% respectively - both are taken out pre-tax.

I've recently purchased two investment properties (under 95k owing, the interest rate is 5.7%) which if rented, bring in a combined amount of about 18k per year. At this stage, I do not own my home and am paying board in a sharehouse. 
Also have credit on a car (less than 8k owing, the interest rate is 8.49%)
I don't hold any credit cards and have no other debt

I have about 2k in savings but plan to increase this to about 20k to start. I don't have a budget but can easily save about $500 per week.

I have a few questions:
Should I be putting that spare money into the car or properties? If I put extra onto the properties, will it have any negative side effects (tax-wise?)?
Should I look at putting the money into completely different investment options?
Is it worthwhile putting more money into superannuation?
Are there any other tips that you guys think I may need for the future?

I am the only one from my family to have completed university, so I cannot ask my family for advice.

personalfinance,Term life insurance,"Hi all,

We are looking at term life insurance as I am newly pregnant. Is there really any difference between companies? I have one quote, how many more people should I contact? What am I overlooking? 

My husband is a teacher and just yesterday he got a booklet from the NEA about the option to buy life insurance through whoever they have a contract with (I think Prudential). It is significantly less expensive than our first quote. Even if he loses his job, as long as he is a member of the NEA, the policy stays in effect. 

We are not looking for a huge amount--maybe $200-300k each. That would be enough to pay off our house and give us a savings cushion. We also both have pensions, which would become available to the surviving spouse, as well as social security for the child.   We both earn the same amount, and if the house is paid off, the income from the surviving spouse would be more than enough to live off of. 

If we would both die, our assets, life insurance, and pensions  would probably be close to 750k, and enough to support our child, and cover college, without even considering SS benefits they would get. We have no real debt outside my student loans, which are all federal and would dissappear if I died.",finance

personalfinance,Pretty significant credit score drop,"In fall of 2016, I took out a personal loan to shift some old credit card debt so that I could reduce the interest rate from 27% to 10.75%. After doing this, I began chasing sign-up bonuses on credit cards (always paying balances in full, never carrying a balance EVER). I had excellent credit (upper 700's to 800+ at times) and was approved instantly for pretty much every card I applied for (15 cards over 18 months). 

In December 2017, I opened a Citi Simplicity card with the aim of using it for a large purchase that I could pay off during the (then) 21-month 0% intro period. I wound up not needing it for the purchase, and in February of this year, I decided to do a balance transfer from my personal loan to this card so I could pay off the remaining balance of the loan before the promotional 0% period is up (October 2019). This kicks my butt into gear and makes me pay it off quickly and saves me interest...smart move, or so I thought. 

Last night I checked my credit score on Chase's free thing, and I almost screamed. 697!! I've never had a credit score that low. Is this because of the $4900 balance on the Simplicity card (credit limit is $7600). I have $81,000 worth of credit total, and I'm at 8% usage according Chase's Credit Journey. I have 100% on-time payments, my oldest credit card account is 25 years old, I have 11 open credit cards, a mortgage, and a car loan. Always pay them on time. 

Is this just the balance transfer and the closing of the personal loan? Will it rebound?",finance

personalfinance,Student Loan Problems - Help Needed,"So, I've discovered that I'm in pretty big financial trouble and need advice.

I (29/m) recently discovered that my entire college education was paid for via student loans that my family took out for me. The principal balance of these loans was 80k, but now 7 years after graduation the total amount due is 137k.

I have 13 federal loans in default, these loans total 50k- those are now in a rehabilitation plan. The remaining 80k are in private loans.

My father had been making payments on the loans for me, but obviously wasn't doing a great job with the loans that were in default. I am going to take over and take charge of my own finances.

I am a state employee that makes 37k per year- How am I ever going to be able to pay these loans off?",finance
personalfinance,I'm 16 and I believe I'm exempt from taxes.,"Hello, I am a 16 year old and I believe I am exempt from taxes. I believe this because I am a full-time student in High School. Last year I started working 2 jobs in early September. I claimed exemption from state and federal income tax, and blocked withholding. Last year I made roughly $5,500 and had $1.29 withheld from my first paycheck, as I didn't have the proper form in at the time. Social Security and Medicare taxes have still been taken out. I am a little worried that I may have done this wrong, but my dad has insisted that I have done it right. I've now come to you, Reddit for a final answer.

personalfinance,Buying a house with USDA loan. I'd like to make sure it fits our budget.,"So my wife and I are buying a house. (YAY!!!) There is a USDA 100% loan option available in our area which I think makes sense for us. I just want to make sure that I am accounting for everything. 

The purchase price would be 115k.
 Closing costs at 3,000ish. 
PMI is a thing at like $100/mo. 
Annual Property tax at $2200ish (rate is high here).
 If the current interest rate at closing is 4.5% that ends up at $880/mo if I distribute the cost of property tax. 

Do my numbers make sense? I just want to make sure that I'm not missing something huge. (We are currently paying $850/mo in rent)",finance
personalfinance,"I'm lucky enough to have a lot of options to pay for grad school, need help deciding which path is best.","I will be going to graduate school starting in the Fall of 2018. I'm getting a Masters degree, not a doctorate. The university I will be attending is not only in-state, but in the city I currently live in so I will not have moving costs. 


My financial situtation:

* Tuition+living expenses is about $20,000 per semester


* I have been out of school and employed for the last 5 years. My grandmother also gave me a LARGE monetary gift when I graduated from undergrad. Between that gift and savings, I have about $30,000 cash saved. I am planning to use this to pay for my first semester.


* I will not be able to keep my current job when I begin grad school because the lab I am currently working in is closing. I can potentially work another job, though. I just don't know what my class workload will be yet.


* I have been offered and accepted a $4000 scholarship.


* After my first semester, I will either need loans or a TA position to pay for schooling. The graduate TA positions at this school come with a tuition waiver and a stipend, which is obviously preferable to a loan. However, they are not guaranteed to masters students.


* I filled out the FAFSA and have been offered a $20,500 unsubsidized direct loan and $3000 work study for the 2018-2019 school year. I have not made a decision to accept either one yet. I can take less money than they have offered.


My question: Should I decline the loan/ work study and hope I get a TA position during my second semester, or should I just take the federal loan to guarantee that I can pay for that semester? 


If I decline the loan but I am not offered a TA position then I may have to take a higher interest private loan. 


If I take the federal loan but then get offered a TA position, I will have debt that I didn't need to take. The problem is, I don't know how likely I am to get a TA position. All the college will tell me is that they are ""competitive"" positions.


Which choice would you make in my position?

personalfinance,Tips for asking for lower Credit Card interest rate or a better card on already existing CC accounts?,[deleted],finance
personalfinance,Help me understand high credit utilization and credit score.,"I'm aggressively paying down credit debt and attempting to raise my credit score, which is currently only fair. I understand that having a lower credit utilization, i. e. keeping my balance to a lower percentage of total available credit, will help boost my score. However, I'm not entirely clear on how this is calculated and how it to prioritize payments on one card vs. others - is it just the total debt vs. total available credit on all cards, or is it weighted per account?
I ask because have three cards that are fairly close to their limits; ~75% or so. I figured it would be best to pay the one with the highest interest rate first, so I've begun decreasing that card by ~10% each month and pay only a little over the minimums on the others. However, I'm wondering if it would be more beneficial to my credit score to pay each in turn, so that they each have a lower % usage in relation to their respective limits?",finance

personalfinance,I am a student who got a good job (CAN),"I am a university student who recently got hired as a research assistant at my university. I am currently in my second year of my undergraduate studies and still have a while to go before I graduate because I am planning on getting two bachelor degrees. 

The job I got pays really well for a student job and I will be making good money. I still live with my parents and they pay for most of my expenses, and because of this I can easily put the money aside and save it. This is the first time I am really going to be able to put a good chunk of money on the side and wanted to know what the best thing to do would be. Since I am not planning on leaving my parent's house until I finish my undergraduate studies, I will be able to save all the money from the job for the next 4 years or so.

I was planning on either putting it in a saving account with some interest rate or give it to an investor. I don't know which account types are best for someone in my situation nor do I know where to look or how to find a good investor.

personalfinance,What are some of the best high-yield savings accounts being offered right now?,"Hi there - 

I'm currently with Chase for both checking and savings and earning what I believe is .05-.06% APY on a 'Chase Plus Savings' account. I'm fortunate enough to have a good amount in my savings account that allows me to avoid the fees associated with the Chase Plus account and I believe my balance would meet most 'minimum balance' thresholds on 'high-yield savings account' offers that I have seen. Most all of my spending goes on credit cards and paid through my checking account (no CC debt to speak of), so the 'brick and mortar' or 'ATM access' isn't all that important to me - I would much rather be earning a higher rate on my savings.

I've read a lot about how the consistent bump in Fed rates should, in theory, free up more capital for banks to offer to customers, and how customers may see better offers in APY on savings accounts due to this. So, that brings me to the question of..... 

What are some of the best high-yield savings accounts being offered right now?

personalfinance,"""Bonus"" was taxed nearly 3x that of my salary","I work in NJ.

I'm probably just missing a key piece of information somewhere but figured this sub may be of assistance. I was recently awarded an 11k ""bonus"" at my job where my salary is ""$50k/yr plus bonus"", but it netted to only about $5.5k in my paycheck and I'm really confused. 

For the past 1.5 years I've been working here, the total amount deducted from my $2.3k bi-monthly paycheck is roughly $600 (~26%), $250 of which is federal withholding. This past paycheck that included my bonus along with bi-monthly pay (totaling ~$13,300) was taxed a total of $6100 (~46%), $3550 of which was federal withholding.

Why are these so much different? Some light Googling led me to believe that bonuses are taxed no differently than salary, but clearly that can't be true at least in my situation. I also don't think this could have had any effect on my income bracket because it was paid out at the beginning of this year, not part of last, so I'm really scratching my head.

I knew it'd be getting taxed but I never thought this much, and I really needed the extra cash. Any help is greatly appreciated.

EDIT: Figured it out, my bonus was not taxed differently, but *withheld* differently, and if any excess withheld it should be sorted out next tax season.Thank you everyone for clearing this up so quickly. Awesome sub!",finance

**We live in a high cost of living area



My wife and I currently live in a small townhouse and would like to move into a single family home in the next couple of years. We have our first child on the way and we have the space in our townhouse to start raising our child. We think in about two years we will desire more space (and probably have a second kid coming), and will be extremely comfortable financially to buy a home at that time. 

Here’s where I’m getting caught up… interest rates are on the rise and I’m scared that if we wait two more years to buy then interest rates might have risen so high that we get priced out of a house that we could afford today. 

We are looking to buy a home in the $700k to $750k range. I would like to put 20% down when we buy, and if we pulled all of our funds together now (cash savings, stock, and equity) we could come up with the money to do it today but that would deplete everything except our emergency fund, and we also need to find money for moving expenses, closing costs, furniture, etc.

We are saving 65% of our income right now, and don’t really need the bigger space yet which is why we were planning on waiting, but if interest rates go from 4.25% like they are today up to 6% in two years, a mortgage on a $750k home with 20% down goes from $3,624 to $4,270… and to get the monthly payment back to $3,624 we would have to put down $255,000 (an additional $100k)... and if that happens all of the saving that we do in the next two years will be nearly nullified by the interest rate hike. 

So what would you do? Buy now and drain it all, or save like crazy and hope that our savings outpaces the rise in interest?",finance

I am 23 and a first year grad student. At 24, I will have my Master’s and expect to make 55-60k starting out. 

I have one more year of grad school, and I have been planning to pay with cash. Tuition is $15,000. I have been living frugally, then to my surprise, I received a $10,450 scholarship. I am set for next year, with $5,000 left over.

I also will move back home and cut my expenses to around $400 a month and I will work 20 hours managing a restaurant, making $13 an hour plus 4 bonuses a year. While I would like to get more hours, it is not feasible with the structure of my program next year. Life at home is stable and I help my parents when I can, and I think I can sustain living there for 2 years after graduation.

I plan on being on my parents’ health insurance til I am 26, if that is still applicable in a few years. I talked to them about getting off it because I sometimes feel like a mooch, but my two high school aged siblings are on it and having me still on the plan does increase the costs of what my dad pays into it. I also will be living in a big city, no car is needed at the moment. 

Now, I am nowhere near financially stable, but I feel ahead for where I thought I would be as a grad student. I am overwhelmed thinking about my next steps, so any advice would be appreciated! 

I would like to start saving for retirement.

I have $35,500 in federal student loans with interest rates ranging from 3-6%. I would like to have them gone around 2 years after graduation.

Safe Withdrawal of $35,000 in Annual Inflation-Adjusted Net Income.","This will be really long, but I put a lot of work into learning about the FI side of FIRE and putting it down plainly. It was interesting how everything worked, so I hope it might also help others as an example of how things might play out in their future situations. 

That said, I'm just some guy researching stuff on the internet before I reach FI myself and I could be wrong somewhere, so the main purpose for my post was to ask for any input or advice you might have! Please leave a comment if you see something wrong with my example plan, I'd really appreciate it!

This was something I did as practice, so my actual numbers will vary somewhat, but that shouldn't matter for the purposes of my example. I did put all the criteria I could think of that apply to me though. I will, of course, be hiring a financial consultant for sessions as needed going forward, but I plan on keeping my portfolio fairly simple and lazy so that I can do the majority of the work. It also helps to be able to walk into a consultation with a decent amount of headway on the subject, so here I am. 

Anyways, on to the example:

**Details:**

I'm 26 and plan to remain in a LCOL area for the foreseeable future. I'll be solely using a non tax-advantaged, personal brokerage account with Vanguard.  I have no money saved in IRAs or 401k yet, but I do have my Vanguard account already established. That said, I've never taken the next step into actually investing and plan to wait until my first consult before moving forward. 

My FI timeframe is much longer than 30 years, so I've adjusted most variables conservatively. For example, I estimate inflation at 3% and I've adjusted my SWR down from the widely suggested 4% to 2.7% which seems safer for the longer time frame and should give me decent growth over inflation in the good years. Any real danger is in the first decade or so, I've been told. If your money doubles in 10 or 15 years and you're still able to live on that same initial withdrawal rate, then it makes sense that you're pretty well protected from volatility.

On the flipside, if I were to invest right before the next recession, as is the fear of any new investor, I would be okay. I could still have a decent stipend and I can also get a job if need be or set up and rely on a fund separate from investments. I don't plan on sitting around doing nothing all the time either, but for the purposes of this example, I assume no earned income.

**The Numbers:**
My own situation differs slightly, but for brevity sake, assume I win the lottery and I have $1.3 million to invest 70/30 in Vanguard Total Stock Admiral ([VTSAX](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0585&amp;FundIntExt=INT&amp;funds_disable_redirect=true#tab=1)) and Vanguard Total Bond Admiral ([VBTLX](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundIntExt=INT&amp;FundId=0584&amp;funds_disable_redirect=true#tab=1)) all at once, right now, and then wait a year and 1 day before selling any shares.

I get most of my numbers going forward from the two links above, however no one can predict the future, so realize that these are estimated averages.

VTSAX and VBTLX are both no load. https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/no-load-funds

VTSAX Expense Ratio is .04%

VBTLX Expense Ratio is .05%

$910,000 in VTSAX with 10 year average annual total return of ~9.9% = $90,090

$390,000 in VBTLX with 10 year average annual total return of ~3.5% = $13,650

Total 10 year average annual return of 70/30 allocation is 7.98% or $103,740 of my principal.

I only need 2.7% SWR + 3% inflation + combined Expense Ratio which I estimate is around .042%. So 5.742% real returns. Anything more is growth. 

So how do I get that 2.7% into my bank account? My plan involves using the quarterly dividends from VTSAX and the monthly distributions from VBTLX for the majority of my income, and then selling shares to make up the difference and keep my allocations close to 70/30.

Well, I'm not entirely sure about how qualified and unqualified dividends work on stock funds, so I'd appreciate advice if the math coming up soon is wrong, but Vanguard says VTSAX has 94.78% qualified dividends, 0% qualified short term gains [here](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/taxcenter/qdi/yearend-qualified-dividend-income-2017). All distributions from bond funds are unqualified. 

VTSAX has an average annual yield of ~1.65%

910000 * .0165 = $15,015

Of that, 94.78% are qualified dividends

15015 * .9478 = $14,231.22 qualified, $783.78 unqualified

VBTLX has an average annual yield of ~2.6%

390000 * .026 = $10,140 unqualified

Total qualified dividend income: $14,231.22

Total ordinary income:  $10,923.78

Gross Income: $25,155

So to hit my SWR of 2.7% I would need to sell enough shares to cover the difference between my distribution income and my SWR which is $9,845 in LTCG. As a worst case scenario, I'm going to assume a 0% cost basis, because it would be very difficult for me to estimate that and it'll change before I actually do any of this anyway. If my math checks out so far, it doesn't actually matter. Higher cost basis will reduce capital gains tax liability further.

Normally, I'd be taxed 10% on ordinary income of $10,923.78, but as I understand it, the standard deduction of $12,000 wipes out ordinary income first and then $1,076.22 of capital income leaving $23,000 as taxable income, all of it at capital rates and well under the $37,950 upper limit of the 0% capital gains bracket.

**Gross Income: $35,000**

**Total Ordinary Income: $10,923.78**

**Total Capital Income: $24,076.22**

**Standard Deduction from Ordinary Income: -$10,923.78**

**Standard Deduction from Capital Income: -$-1,076.22**

**Taxable Income: $23,000 at Capital Rates**

Leaving my federal tax rate effectively 0% in this situation! This seems insane and I feel like I must have missed something. 

**Afterthoughts:**

Bear in mind some states do have their own rules for capital gains and may just treat everything as ordinary income, in which case I would pay some taxes to the state in this example.

In this situation I could work and earn up to $5500 in a year and contribute that to an IRA tax free as an adjustment to gross income.



**Questions:**

1. Is all of this correct? If so, it seems too good to be true. Did I assume something I shouldn't have or miss something?

2. Can I lump qualified dividends with LTCG for tax purposes as I did or are they separate things? Are dividends qualified even in the first year of holding the asset? 

3. Do I even need to seek out a more general financial consultant in my case? Or should I just be looking for a tax specialized consultant instead? I feel pretty comfortable with the actual investing side of things and digging into the numbers once things get going. I'm also learning more and more about the tax side already, but still feel uncomfortable in that area.

I appreciate anyone taking the time to read this. I know it was long, but I don't really feel comfortable discussing any of this with anyone I know personally and I want to iron out the general details of my plan before I sit down to my first consult.

If you see something completely wrong and would like to tell me, I'd like to thank you in advance for any advice you might offer! I hope this opens up some healthy discussion. Have a good day!

EDIT: I do want to mention that I know I'm not taking taxable accounts into, well, account. The thing is, for my situation, I don't currently HAVE anything in tax sheltered accounts.

personalfinance,Thinking of buying down closing costs and taking a higher rate and then refinancing in 6 months to a year.,"So our house is probably going to be done in about 2~ months so we're now in talks with our lender about interest rates etc,. I brought up how we were hoping to refinance in 6 months to a year to try to completely kill mortgage insurance (I know, I know) since we're planning on finishing our bonus room(600 sq feet and a full bathroom) in that time and think that our home would appraise for more than what we owe + 20%.


Anyways, he brought up that we could kill our closing costs by taking about .5% higher of an interest rate now (about $110 more a month on our monthly payment) which we could then drop once we refinance. 


Here's where I'm unsure. There are a lot of ifs. I like the idea of not having closing costs since it essentially drops the price of our home by $7000, however, I get nervous taking the higher rate because of the unknown. Rates have been trending upward, but have been known to dip at the beginning of the year, which would be right around our 6-8 month mark. The other unknown is the housing market. There is always a chance that there could be a substantial enough dip that our home wouldn't appraise for the value that we'd want and would make it so the re-fi wouldn't  go through/ wouldn't kill the mortgage insurance.  We're building in an area that is having a lot of business growth all around, which usually is an indication that home prices will continue to rise, but nothing is for sure.

Serious Delinquency: was a $30 fee on a Wells Fargo account that has since been paid and closed, I’ve got no other late payments. This payment became late in May 2017 and stayed as a Charge-Off until 3/1/2018. 

Age of Accounts: my oldest account has been open for 7 years and 7 months (a $31k student loan, 11 loans from 3.1% to 6.55%) and my most recent account is the NFCU Credit account opened November 28th 2016, the average account age is 3 years and 5 months.

Questions:

1) I’ve been approved for Discover One and Capital One cards, should I be taking out more lines of credit to potentially decrease my utilization or will the increase in the “newly opened” accounts only hurt my score?

2) Are there any other reports that I should be looking at in addition to or in place of the Discover FICO Score 8?

3) I’m looking to rent a new apartment in October, realistically how much could I improve my score by then?

4) Any other things that I should be focusing my attention on? Please roast me",finance
personalfinance,Mortgage payments question: how quickly can I pay it off with 2 extra payments per year? How about 3? 4?,"Something I have done every year with tax return money is to make an extra payment on the mortgage, but I am in a better financial situation and want to know what the figures look like if I pay more. Here are the stats:

$169000 borrowed at the end of 2013.

30 years at 3.875%

Monthly payments are $1150.

$139000 left on the bill

I already max my Roth IRA and 401k

I have no other debt besides a car that will be played off this year.

I already have a 12-month rainy day fund for all expenses. 

The house currently functions as a rental property that pays for the mortgage every month.


I have seen the articles about how making an extra payment per year can reduce the payoff time by 5ish years. What I want to know is what the payoff time is if I make an addition 2, 3, or 4 payments per year is and if at the current interest rate, if it's worth it.",finance
personalfinance,How can I get my 2016 IRS Federal Income Return Tax Transcript online for school?,"So I thought this would be fairly straightforward. I need the 2016 IRS Federal Income Return Tax Transcript for my college so they can process my financial aid eligibility. I am recommended to go to the irs.gov site so I can request them online.

When I get there, there is a problem. To create an account I need to confirm my identity, with either with the last 8 digits of a credit card number, mortgage number, or some other loan numbers I don't have. I only have one credit card, so decided to use that. They didn't have my credit card number and says it was invalid (Yes I made 100% sure it was my credit card number). I called them and after being on hold for half an hour, was told that they can't help with not recognizing my CC.

So I called up Chase, and after being on hold, was sent to six different people. None of them were able to help, and transferred me to other departments. I am confused to what I should do now so I can get my tax transcripts online. Does anyone have any suggestions, or know who I should call to fix this?",finance
personalfinance,Probably should be a question for my loan officer but I’d rather ask it here first anonymously,"My fiancé and I are planning on buying a house.

Long story short we’ve both obtained new jobs in the same fields making more money to make $x house affordable with room to save. 

So I’ve been doing a financial overhaul lately and realized my credit cards although I maintain zero balance monthly are not as useful as they were as far as bonuses go. I’m considering closing one of the two out and getting a new one  for the better interest rate (which I never pay any on) and the extra few hundred $$ in bonus points I could easily accrue based on Essential spending. 

We probably will start looking for a house in may with hopes to close on something during the summer.

personalfinance,Should I pay off my mortgage or invest or hold cash?,"I'm 40 and I have a mortgaged condo I rent in another state - it's a 5.125% fixed interest rate 30 year mortgage with 15 years left. I borrowed $136k and have about ~$51.5k left in principal to pay off. I paid $170k and paid the rest with downpayment and a home equity loan ($17k), which is now paid off - it's probably worth ~$205k as is. At the height of the 2008 real estate bubble it was worth nearly $250k.

I currently have a renter in the condo and a property management company. Between the rent/condo fees/management fees/maintenance I end up owing between $500 and $2k each year. I have increased rent and remarkably the condo fees have decreased so 2018 should be close to break even. From 2008 to present, I have about $16k in ""losses"" on the rental.

I'm a freelance writer and my income varies wildly: in 2014 I made $16k (YES!), in 2015 I made $60k, in 2016 I made $110k, last year I made $80k, I'm probably on pace for $60 this year - I'm currently sitting on around $100k in savings/checking and my own rent and expenses are just under $3k/month.

I'm probably a little behind on retirement saving. Before I moved I created a rollover IRA and consolidated an old 401k and a 403b and procrastinated investing it as the global economy pooped itself. I invested a little late, but it's now worth $213k with mostly tech stocks. I have not contributed to it at all since 2008.

My fear is my renter leaves (which would make my monthly expenses balloon to about $4.5k/month) and I don't get hired for eight months.

personalfinance,"[Auto] Moving out of country and need to sell my car, which I'm upside-down on","I got swindled when I bought our family SUV back in 2016. I had a good loan worked out USAA to cover the cost of the vehicle. Long story short: the dealer talked me into financing with them convincing me to with them with a lower interest rate.

I, being a terrible money manager, didn't really look at the fine print or pay that close of attention when signing all the documents and didn't realize that the $14,500 SUV was being sold to me for a final total of over $18,000.

personalfinance,Parent Plus Loan Advice,"I decided to make a discussion post on here because my parents are in need of advice/assistance in regard to their parent plus loans and their (currently) unaffordable monthly payment and I wish to help them to the best of my ability, while also working towards my own goals and career aspirations.

The entire debt is roughly 138,000 dollars (definitely nothing to sneeze at) and the payments recently went up to 811 a month under the lowest repayment option. For the time being they can only afford 500 a month at most due to how they manage their finances and current bills they are working to pay off. In about two years I learned that my parents will apparently be able to afford 1000 a month as they will no longer be saddled with 500-a-month payments on a credit card debt. In the meantime I am working/saving up and planning to teach English abroad, hopefully later this year if I am offered a position. And once settled into full-time salaried work I plan on contributing to seeing this debt paid off. Though down the line I am interested in graduate school (should I obtain funding/an assistantship with a program). As it stands, there are multiple parent plus loans of varying interest rates that add up to that 138,000. The average interest rate is 7 percent. I'd also mention that my dad works full-time (his salary before taxes I believe is roughly 90,000), and my mom works part-time (roughly 200 dollars a week) and they are both in their later 40s, just for a bit more background info. 

Recently I visited a local Citizens Bank with my dad to inquire about refinancing, in hopes of a lower monthly payment for now, possibly a better interest rate, and having a single loan to handle rather than a bundle. My parents learned this week that they would not be approved, the reason being that (apparently) for parent plus loan refinancing there is a cap at 130,000 and they would not refinance if they could not refinance the entire amount, so it wasn't an issue of my parents' income or credit (I assume it was because they don't want there to be two loans in the end to deal with). 

This week I am looking into other refinancing options/companies to get in touch with. That said, is refinancing the best option for dealing with this debt efficiently? As it stands there are multiple loans of varying interest rates adding up to the amount I noted. And if it is, are there other companies to work with (SoFi, etc.) that may cover such a large amount? I appreciate any and all serious feedback and I hope to eventually be on track to actually paying this debt off in a decent timeframe, and not just handling it with minimal payments.",finance

technology,The EU new GDPR disguised protectionism,"Warning: Potential rant and typos ahead. Polite discussion with valuable comments is appreciated.

We know in global world tariffs are bad. Everyone, EU countries included complained about the US new steel tariffs but I’m shocked that nobody is reading the new General Data Protection Regulation precisely like that. Tariffs!

One of the new GDPR clauses says that all data from Europeans should reside inside the EU (infrastructure within the EU). You know what this means? Buying or leasing servers in EU datacenters.

This is madness and nothing more than EU protectionism. Companies that sell or offer services (even for free) are now forced to spend their budgets with EU companies to host their data in the EU.
Can you imagine if the US applied the same? What if the US knows forces every EU company to be forced to keep all US data on US soil (datacenters)?

Service selection should be based on quality and offerings, not by discrimination based on location.

This is nothing but madness as companies will now have to maintain two locations and keep data in 2 physical separated countries. Its division and technical chaos.

What if China comes with the same. And then Russia, and then Latin America. Do you see where this insanity is going? It’s the end of Internet e-commerce as we know it. Without asking the EU who in the hell is going to pay for the enormous costs increases (sure, its profit for the EU), it would be impossible to comply with this if every country decided to go the same route.

Imagine keeping a different database, on a different server, with different settings, for every type of customers depending on which country they are. This is what I call being nuts.

This has nothing to do with data protection. The Internet is connected. Most data centers in the EU I know don’t even have 24/7 staff because they can’t afford to pay them overnight. Yes, that is right. Most data centers in the EU have absolutely nobody at night or on weekends. You can break in and compromise servers and networks quite easily. Most don’t have security guards or any sort of protection either to protect data from physical breaches. This is not even close to how US datacenters work. All of them are mostly staffed 24/7, and they have all sort of security systems in place. 

I wonder what will happen once other countries start to implement the same “data tariffs” on EU based companies. Companies worldwide are spending millions already to comply with the GDPR. Guess where that money is now flowing? If this is not protectionism, I don’t know what is.

More ironic is that everyone complains the US is continually trying to apply its laws to other countries and the GDPR is doing precisely the same. It imposes fines and regulations on foreign people and foreign companies outside the EU. If this is not a violation of international laws, I’m curious how exactly does the EU plan to apply EU laws on foreign jurisdictions without agreeing to the same with those countries. A bill which extends out of its limited extraterritoriality is an overreach.

This is bad for everyone. Including EU companies as other countries will eventually react with similar regulations against the EU. Once companies all over the world must spend more and more money to comply with EU regulations, they will reach their representatives. This is also very dangerous because other countries (mostly in Asia) can decide to adopt similar regulations. Is this really what we want? 

Online services from blocking certain countries when you try to sign up because they can’t afford to comply? Everyone agrees geo-locking is bad and this is exactly what regulations like this create. They try to link an intangible thing (like digital data) to a physical location which is the opposite of how the Internet works. The beauty of the Internet is that you can reach everyone globally. Mark my words. This is going to be a mess, a race nobody will win. I can’t wait to see what mess this will create with international laws and regulations that contradict each other, once other countries come with their own data regulations measures. To comply with one will make have to breach the other one…

Don’t worry, huge companies like Google or Microsoft certainly can comply. The ones affected are the small companies that can’t come up with new increased costs. In the end, this end ups hurting competition by making the big guys stronger and creating more barriers for smaller startups. The EU does what it knows the best. Hurting small business. This one of reasons why Europe has such a big problem with tech startups. All odds are against them. 

I expect this to happen in the next years with some online services:

1) Charge more to EU citizens to comply (because of its cost you more to service people residing in Europe)

2) Block EU signups

Remember: The regulations are from the same “smart” entities that came with one of the most stupid laws ever created in human history, the cookie law which the only effect is to annoy web visitors with popups and notifications. This comes from the same people that came up with regulations on how the curvature of bananas should be (no jokes here). No wonder most Europeans want out of the EU. They are ruled by politicians disconnected from reality.",technology

CryptoCurrency,Federal Government Taking Notice of Blockchain Technology Implementation,"As the SEC wrestles with the complex task of crypto regulation it's becoming more and more evident living in Washington D.C. that the Federal Government is not only taking notice of crypto in a regulatory sense, but also from a technological sense. Many crypto investors go to bed with nightmares of impending SEC regulation that spoils their visions of lambos and moons, but to those paying close attention the signs are more bullish than ever. The Government is not just interested in regulating crypto for profit and corporate greed, but they are also interested in the actual technologies behind our beloved crypto investments. Here are a few links to events happening next week in Washington D.C. that lead me to believe the Federal Government has plans to implement blockchain technology on the horizon:

personalfinance,Young couple with $19K in Credit Card debt and a baby due in September. Best plan of attack?,"Hi all, 

Due to a combination of stupidity, poor financial planning, and some medical expenses, my wife and I have racked up $19K in credit card debt over the last two years. We were definitely living beyond our means and behaving like children. As of this month, we have finally gotten on our shit, created a budget with You Need a Budget, ""tightened the belt,"" and started paying more aggressively on our credit card debt (this month we paid $800, about double the minimum payments). Prior to that we had only been paying the minimums, which, I know, is very stupid and is only servicing the interest and that's about it. 

We don't have much in terms of savings. $1100 in a CD, and $5900 in an individual account that is making basically 0 return but it is 100% liquid. 

Our credit card debt is as follows: 
$1,240 on a Discover card at 15.24% APR
$2,250 on a Suntrust card at 22.49% APR (yikes)
$15,500 on an AmEx at 18.49% APR.

I make $52K a year and my wife makes ~$35K a year as a wedding photographer. My credit score is good, not great (~700, 709 last I checked).

Right now I am thinking that the best plan of attack is to take the $5900 from the individual account and pay down the SunTrust and Discover Cards completely and then use the remaining part of the AmEx. 

From there, I'm thinking that I should either move part of that balance into a balance transfer card with like a 0% intro APR (because I doubt any balance transfer card will let me move $15k right away), and then make payments on both the balance transfer and the AmEx. Then I would apply for a personal loan through SoChi or Upstart or something on the remainder of the AmEx balance (which will probably be ~$10K I'm guessing) to get a lower interest rate and pay that down aggressively. 

What do you guys/gals think? Am I on the right track here? Am I missing anything? Thanks in advance.

Student Debt:

I have over 150k in student debt, all in government loans, no private loans. I work in the public sector, so I will start an income-based repayment (IBR) plan in April, at about 215/month. Under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PLSF) program, in 10 years, after making all (IBR) payments, the rest of my debt will be discharged. 

 
For all the tax nerds out there, this likely means I will owe a sum on the discharge of my debt. Last I checked, a discharge of debt is counted as income. This income, I think, is taxable. With my student debt as high as it is, I believe I will owe between $50-60k in taxes if that discharge is counted as income. Of course, it will depend on how much I owe at the time and what our tax laws are at the time, so I can’t be certain.
I plan to save this amount over the years in case I will owe taxes on my discharge of debt. I set out a plan below to help me start my career off successfully while setting myself up for the future. 
 

There is talk that PLSF may not exist in 10 years, but that is a fear that has existed since it started. I did not come from a wealthy family and attempted to save at a minimum wage job before going to school. I landed my “dream job” in the non-profit sector and can potentially get my debt discharged with PLSF. Without the IBR, I would pay $1.6k/month. I probably wouldn’t be able to work in the public sector and pay that amount each month or I would be paying on my loans for 30 years.


I believe the PLSF is the fastest way to pay off my student loans, even with the potential $50-60k tax at the end of the 10 years. Even if the program is cancelled, I hope that by saving the funds in the event that it is not will help me rethink my plan at that time. 
I also have payment help through my school and through work that will cover 3 years of my IBR payments for working in the public sector. I have not factored them into my budget below as I am not yet receiving these benefits.

 
Credit Card Debt:	

I have four credit card accounts open. I would like advice on whether I should transfer the balance from CC1 to CC3. The balance transfer fee for CC3 is 3% (roughly will pay $50-60) and I will have no interest until 11/2018. My monthly interest charge for CC1 is roughly $20. I would break even spreading out my payments on CC1 to CC3 after three months. This debt is from moving cross country and certification fees for my profession in my new state. 

 
I am thinking of canceling CC2 as I pay a yearly fee of $99. It is an airline card I used while still in school to travel back home across the country. I will save $99/yr if I cancel it, but it has been open for four years and has a large limit, boosting my credit score. Is it worth it to leave this line of credit open if I do not use it often now and pay a yearly fee on it?
 

CC4's interest kicks in 3/2019. Once my debt from CC1 is paid off, I will put CC1's payment toward CC4.

personalfinance,Should I get a credit card in college?,"I am looking to build my credit while in school. I have a full-time job and a steady income. I am doing slow pay on some medical bills so I thought it would do some good to get a credit card. HRRG the agency I am working with only does recurring payments through a credit too so that is another plus. I have the means to make the monthly payments. The interest rates vary between 12.5% and 22.3%, is this normal, high, or okay? Also, my mother is adamantly against me getting this card and so I may not tell her.

personalfinance,31 yo health care professional and retirement noob seeking 457 and HSA fund advice.,"Hi PF
I’m a 31 year old health care professional earning approx $135k before overtime in a HCOL area.  Thus far my HSA will be maxed every year for the foreseeable future, and I could potentially max out 457 contributions although currently I’m on track to contribute $9000 for 2018 (saving for wedding and home down payment).  My 457 has a monthly fee of 0.055% and my HSA has no fees on investments.  My 457 also has the option of a self directed brokerage account via Schwab that I’ll be opening soon, no more than 50% of my account balance can be in the account.  I’ll also have access to a pension upon retirement up to $115k/year with COLA.  It is very likely I will receive the full $115k/year.  Now that I’ve settled into my job and passed by probationary period, I’d like some feedback in regards to my 457 and HSA fund choices, and thoughts on AA.  Many of the funds seem expensive.  A finance friend suggested Domestic 50%, International 27%, Emerging markets 16% and Bonds 7%, the numbers are somewhat in line with what I’ve read on 3-fund and 4-fund portfolios.  Round numbers are visible below.

&amp;nbsp;

HSA @ Optum Bank - $4200 (VITSX and SWYMX or SWYNX seem like good fits to start)

&amp;nbsp;

Roth IRA @ Vanguard - $8700 (currently 100% in VFIFX Vanguard TR 2050) 

&amp;nbsp;

457 @ Mass Mutual - $1300 (currently 100% in VFFVX Vanguard TR 2055)

personalfinance,How can I move?,I have a 30 yr mortgage at 3.65% for 275k on a 470k house. We want to move but I feel like we are trapped in our current house because interest rates have gone up so much. Even if we sold and bought a different house for exact same price (though the new place would likely be 40-60k more) my payment would go through the roof for basically nothing.. am I stuck here?,finance
personalfinance,"Medical insurance company told me my bill was taken care of, turns out they the hospital sent the bill to collections and I now have a derogatory mark on my credit. Where to go from here?","On September of last year I had to visit the ER, I did not have my insurance card on me at the time so the administration told me to wait for the bill to come in the mail, call the number on the bill (for hospital accounting) and give them my insurance information. I am under my parents insurance plan through Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield. 

A few weeks later the bill comes in the mail (to my apartment), I call and give/confirm my insurance plan information and they tell me it will take a few months to process. 

Fast forward to around October/November where I receive letters in the mail from the hospital about my ""overdue"" bill. I call BCBS, give them my account number assigned by the hospital, the BCBS rep calls the hospital herself and finds that there was a single letter incorrect in how the hospital filed my group number, which they never alerted me about. The BCBS rep says something similar to the hospital rep the first time around, ""wait a few months for processing"". 

Fast forward to January 2018, I get another letter in the mail except now it's from a collection agency for the same debt. I call BCBS again... the rep tells me my claim was ""just filed"" a few days ago and that it will be ""months"" before we receive an actual bill from the health insurance company to pay the difference in coverage to the hospital. I made SURE (from her word) that the claim was indeed filed and that the bill was on its way, she assured me it was.

Now to today, my credit score tanked ~100 points and after running an Equifax report I see I have a derogatory mark due to the collection. 

I'm honestly fed up at this point, as the bill itself isn't even that much ($900) and I've had the means to pay it, but we have health insurance for a reason. I'm calling BCBS in the morning and will even go to back the ER and talk to someone until this is straightened out. 

So my question is, is this a situation where I can dispute the derogatory mark and have it removed from my credit report since it was the error of either the hospital or the insurance company? If not, what can I do to lessen the marks impact?",finance
personalfinance,Charging frequent flights to credit card?,"Hi y'all!

I'm a soon-to-be college student (18) and in the next several months, I'm going to be taking quite a few flights across the country to visit the universities I've been admitted to, as well as a trip to space camp. I'll only be paying for three of the five (four of which are concrete plans) flights I'm taking, but I also will have various expenses to pay for in the coming months, such as buying dorm items and investing in a new laptop. (The trip currently in debate is to Cancun, and I expect I will have some tourist expenses there as well, should I go.)

For the flights that I am paying for, I have the money on hand to cover those. The college expenses will be a bit more of a struggle to handle, but I will find a way to manage. I'm currently working part-time and making about $400-$600 a month, of which I save half. However, I won't be able to increase my hours over the summer, as I would be at risk for losing my government insurance. Come fall, I'll most likely be participating in a federal work-study program (depending on where I attend).

Because I have much of the cash on hand for these larger expenses, I was wondering if it would be worthwhile to charge these expenses onto a credit card with rewards (I'm considering the Discover IT card or a card on which I can accrue miles) in order to fully take advantage of the first year benefits, as well as get my money's worth. Because I am 18, I acknowledge that it may be difficult for me to obtain a credit card. I wanted to see if it was a good idea before pitching it to my father. 

I like to think that I am fairly disciplined in terms of spending money. Once the card is opened, I most likely won't be touching it unless it is an emergency. Would years of inactivity harm my credit standing or affect the card itself? I'd like to understand all the risks before pursuing this idea head on.

Thank you for teaching me financial literacy that I've been missing!

TL;DR: Thinking of getting a credit card (Discover IT or a card with miles) to put major purchases (flights; moving cross-country for college) on. Have limited income as a soon-to-be college student, but have the cash for most of those major purchases. Is it a good idea? What are the potential effects of opening one and remaining mostly inactive for the next few years?",finance
personalfinance,Trade Pension for Student Loan Payoff?,"46 years old.  $48k in student debt.  After child support, spousal support, monthly living costs, etc., I don't make enough to make an appreciable dent in the principal, so I'm on the treadmill.

Pension balance is around $60k.  I have 20 more years to work regardless of all other circumstances.

What happens if I cash out the pension to pay off the student debt?  The idea of living debt free is hugely liberating.

Edit:  The interest rates aren't terrible (highest is 6.8%).

Would the 10% penalty be in addition to my current tax rate? I just glanced at a table; looks I pay 22%.

Help me understand if I've got this right: I take the $60k, they take the penalty right off the top. Leaves me $54k. I then pay my normal tax rate on the 54k as well as my normal income (less all the deductions, etc.) So on the 54k I'm liable for 24% in additional taxes (I'll get bumped because of the higher income), which is @ 12k. So I net 42k. Right?",finance
personalfinance,How to proceed with starting up a firm,"I was recently contacted by a corporation acting as an umbrella corporation for self employed IT specialists. They want me to start up my own company and start working as a subcontractor for them. I just got out of the second screening and everything went super well, they seem really eager to sign me up for this.

In the country I live there are basically two kinds of companies. Either you start something like a personal company, where you have all the responsibility yourself - and all the income of the company (minus whatever stuff you need to buy) counts as your salary, which is heavily taxed, about 50%-60%.

The other company form is a shared company, where you have to put up about $5k worth of money which becomes the starting capital of the company (you can use it to pay yourself salary or buy stuff).

Now the thing is that a few years back I made some really bad decisions resulting in me getting a 9% interest rate on my student loan (about $28k) and I am forced by the loan institution to pay back about $1k each month, which is 1/3 of my entire taxed salary. Also, I have no money saved up at all, and I owe my current employer 4 weeks of vacation which I took in advance when I started my current position.

Now I'm in kind of a tough spot. If I quit my current job, most of the last paycheck will go to paying back the vacation days I owe, so I won't be able to pay rent or the required amount on my loan that month. Also, I can't really count on the umbrella company to pay my first bill immediately so I basically need to be sure to have at least another salary + loan payment saved up just in case.

How do I get out of this mess and start my own business?",finance
investing,Stock Market on Track to Close First Quarter of 2018 With Losses,"WSJ:

&gt; Global stocks rebounded Thursday but remained on track for quarterly losses after investor worries about rising rates, trade tensions and the health of the technology sector ended an extended period of calm.

&gt; Ahead of the long holiday weekend, the Stoxx Europe 600 was up 0.5% led by the auto sector, following small gains in Japan, Hong Kong and Shanghai. U.S. futures pointed to a 0.4% rise for the S&amp;P 500 and a 0.8% boost for the Nasdaq .

&gt; For the first three months of 2018, however, the S&amp;P 500 was poised to lose roughly 2.6%, ending a nine-quarter winning streak, while the Stoxx Europe 600 was on track to end 4.6% lower, the U.K.’s FTSE 100 8% lower, and Japan’s Nikkei 7.1% lower, also hit by the dollar’s weak trajectory.

&gt; While little was able to stir stocks for the past two years, markets have become more sensitive to any hints of bad news in the last two months, returning to a more elevated level of volatility and lower returns.

&gt; With central banks moving gradually away from stimulus, tax cuts already passed and the early signs of acceleration in the global economy in the rearview, “the question now is how much newsflow can there be about things getting incrementally better versus getting incrementally worse,” said Chris Dyer, director of global equity at Eaton Vance.

&gt; While he still is optimistic about global equities in light a healthy and upbeat corporate sector, “when you think about trade wars, North Korea, privacy and internet companies, there’s a lot that could scare investors,” he said.

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has fallen 4% so far in March, on pace for its worst month since 2016, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen 4.7%. Yields on 10-year Treasurys have risen to 2.77% from around 2.41% at the end of 2017.

&gt; “You’re losing money in fixed income, losing money in equities: The average balanced account at the end of the first quarter is going to be down,” said Philip Blancato, chief executive at Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management.

&gt; Just a handful of equity markets have clung to small gains for the year, including Italy’s FTSE MIB index, the Nasdaq Composite, and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng.

&gt; Still, Mr. Blancato and many investors remain encouraged about the outlook for the second quarter, pointing to continued momentum in the economy and corporate earnings.

&gt; “You’ve got a strong consumer, great earnings growth because of less tax, and an expanding economy coupled with low inflation and low lending rates,” he said. “You still have all the underpinnings of a very strong stock market.”

&gt; Data Wednesday showed the U.S. economy grew more than previously estimated expected in the final three months of 2017, while figures Thursday showed the German unemployment rate hit a record low in March.

&gt; First-quarter earnings per share for the S&amp;P 500 are meanwhile projected to rise 16.6%, according to CFRA Research, and 2018 earnings estimates for the tech sector, a current focus of market worry, have continued to move higher in the past month, according to FactSet.

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 now trades at 16.3 times forward earnings, cheaper than where it started the year.

&gt; On Thursday, auto makers led gains in European stocks, with reports of merger talks between Japan’s Nissan Motor Co. and Renault boosting the sector. Renault shares were up 4.2%,

&gt; In Asian trading, many tech stocks took a hit following falls in the U.S. and recent declines in crude oil prices hit the energy sector, but a slight easing of geopolitical tensions, driven by speculation of a Japan-North Korea summit meeting, helped weaken the yen and support Japanese stocks.

&gt; Japan’s Asahi Shimbun newspaper reported that the country has reached out to North Korea about a meeting between Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Kim Jong Un, who just shook hands with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing and already has a summit planned with U.S. President Donald Trump.

&gt; Some investors took it as a sign that Pyongyang may be more open to negotiating an end to its nuclear-weapons program. The two Koreas agreed to an April 27 meeting.

&gt; The report came on top of a dollar rebound, which pushed the dollar up 1.4% against the yen on Wednesday, its biggest one-day gain since September. A weaker yen tends to boost shares of multinationals which translate earnings from abroad. The Nikkei rose 0.6%, pulled down slightly by shares of Takeda Pharmaceutical after the company said it was considering a takeover bid for London-listed Shire.

&gt; Still, for the quarter, the Nikkei ended sharply lower, hurt by a 5.6% climb in the yen against the U.S. dollar.

&gt; In China, news of a tax-cut plan boosted local shares. Shanghai stocks were up 1.2%, helped by Beijing’s plans to lower value-added taxes. The 400 billion yuan ($63.5 billion) measure, due to take effect in May, is expected to boost factory profits in China by a further 11% this year, said Li Xunlei, an economist at Zhongtai Securities.

&gt; Hong Kong’s Hang Seng edged up 0.2%, keeping it up 0.6% for the quarter.

&gt; The U.S. Commerce Department releases its report on February personal income and outlays on Thursday, which will be watched for any signs of a pickup in inflation. Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President Patrick Harker said he expects officials will need to raise interest rates a total of three times this year, up from his earlier projection of two, due to stronger inflation.

personalfinance,Adult looking for experiences with private student loans,"Hi there!

heres the short of it: i was super ill from around 19-23, and never had the chance to go to college. Im 30 now, and I just graduated with an AS in computer science last fall (after going nights for way too long). 

I just found out i was accepted to my dream school, AND theyre giving me about 1/3 of my tuition in grants! in addition, im receiving my maximum in federal student loans. 

Heres my problem: most of my expenses are covered EXCEPT for housing/food, which is where the private student loans come in. 

Ive done a lot of research, and decided to go with Discover Student Loans, as they seemed to have universally good reviews/perks. 

Im worried about needing a cosigner. Im 30 years old, and only have a little family, and even fewer of them have better credit than me. 

#1) Can anyone provide insight as what my credit score should be in order to avoid a cosigner? 

Here are my stats: 12 years of perfect credit. Never missed a payment, including on CCs, car leases, etc. However last year, I was involved in a 15 car pileup, and made the foolish mistake of being transported to the hospital in an ambulence. I was unable to pay it at the time, and its since gone to collections. Ive been slowly paying it down, but its still very much on my record. 

Id say im using about $2,500 out of a total $30,000 credit line, and my credit score about 685. Im looking to take out roughly $15,000 in private student loans. Obviously theres no right or wrong answer, i was just hoping yall might have some insight

#2) In the event of me needing a cosigner, what can i do?

I remember a couple years back, a good friend of mine was looking for their first apartment, and needed a cosigner they couldnt get from their family. After some research there existed companies which would cosign a lease for you, for a one-months-rent fee. Does anything like this exist for student loans? This is literally my dream come true, and i cant even imagine being unable to do this because of my inability to get a cosigner. Im willing to look into literally anything.

personalfinance,IRS: Refunds worth $1.1B waiting to be claimed by those who have not filed 2014 federal income tax returns!,"**Don't let the government hold onto your money!**

WASHINGTON ― Unclaimed federal income tax refunds totaling about $1.1 billion may be waiting for an estimated 1 million taxpayers who did not file a 2014 federal income tax return, according to the Internal Revenue Service.

To collect the money, these taxpayers must file their 2014 tax return with the IRS no later than this year's tax deadline, Tuesday, April 17.

""We’re trying to connect a million people with their share of $1.1 billion in unclaimed refunds for 2014,” said Acting IRS Commissioner David Kautter. “Time is running out for people who haven’t filed tax returns to claim their refunds. Students, part-time workers and many others may have overlooked filing for 2014. **And there’s no penalty for filing a late return if you’re due a refund.”**

The IRS estimates the midpoint for the potential refunds for 2014 to be $847; half of the refunds are more than $847 and half are less.

In cases where a federal income tax return was not filed, the law provides most taxpayers with a three-year window of opportunity for claiming a tax refund. If they do not file a tax return within three years, the money becomes the property of the U.S. Treasury. For 2014 tax returns, the window closes April 17, 2018. The law requires taxpayers to properly address, mail and ensure the tax return is postmarked by that date.""

personalfinance,Where to stash largish emergency fund,"My wife an I combined make around~300k living in a low-mid cost of living city. We have a 15 year mortgage at a 3.325% rate with a monthly payment of around $2500, but we put in around $4k a month. We invest around 8k a month, and spend the rest.

Right now, our emergency fund is quite large. We have around 50k on it, which is well over 6 months expenses. We we're thinking of lowering it to 30k, which would be about 6 months, but it still seems like a lot to just be sitting there. My questions are as follows:

Would it be better to use the 20k to pay down the house, or invest? I know investing tends to have better returns, but a guaranteed 3.325% sounds pretty good in this volatile market.

What should we do with our emergency fund? 20k seems high and our savings account is pretty low yield. I was thinking about splitting it in two, keeping 10k in the savings account and putting 20k into municipal bond funds with Fidelity (I'm thinking a mix between intermediate and short term to limit interest rate risk). Is this a good idea? If we desperately need the money, we can always withdraw, but our cash flow and credit limit is enough that I think we would still be safe without doing that.",finance

personalfinance,How does my grad school budget look? Will I be able to afford living on my own?,"A lot of changes are happening in my life this summer. I was accepted into grad school and will need to move out of my family home come August. I'm trying to make sure my budget is sound and I won't be in financial trouble.

Currently I make $3200 a month. I'm doing grad school part-time and working full-time and will need to cut back a few hours, so my budget will be closer to $2800. 

Starting in August:

* Rent: $800-900 
* Food: $120
* Gas: $200
* Car: $325
* Cell Phone: $60
* Fun: $100
* Misc: $100

So about $1100 left each month if I've done the math right. Which will go into savings/emergency fund/school expenses.

Rent includes utilities and is the average for a decent apartment in a decent part of town. I've averaged about $100 on food per month through meal prepping so I feel that's doable. I've been getting away with about $90-100 for gas since I don't drive far for work or go a lot of places. My grad school is a bit further than work, so I added about $100 extra just to be safe. Car category is car payment + insurance. I could cut my cell phone bill down if I switch off of unlimited, but I don't think it's a big issue. Fun can be scaled back if necessary.

personalfinance,Should I form an S-Corp?,"BACKGROUND INFO:  I'm a self-employed entertainer and made roughly 60k in 1099 pay in 2017.  I've been setting aside 37% of each paycheck and paying 30% federal and 7% state estimated quarterly taxes.  I'm expecting ~4k back for 2017.

When I met with a CPA to prepare my taxes, he encouraged me to form an S-Corp to save money on self-employment taxes.  I'm expecting to make at least 100k this year and maybe about the same or a bit more for 2019 so he said it would be a good idea.  He encouraged me to form the S-Corp through his website since he'd be able to help get everything going.  I've realized that it would cost about $650 to do so through his site.

How exactly would paying myself as the sole employee of an S-Corp work, and what happens to the other money outside of my ""salary""?  Would it be worth the cost and hassle of setting everything up?  Should I form the S-Corp through another service or is that $650 fee a fair price?",finance

personalfinance,USA - Canada Tax Treaty Help/Questions,"First I apologize for the length, I just want to make sure I have all the relevant information that will make it easier for any of you to help/provide input. **For simplicity I have bolded and numbers direct questions.**

**Summary:**

I'm a Canadian working in the USA and I'm doing my taxes in the USA for the first time, but I'm unsure if I qualify for any article in the tax treaty. I'm hoping one of you fine folks can help me clear some things up or point me in the right direction.

**Background Info:**

* Worked from sept-Dec 2017 as an Intern (total of 107 days)
* Was done school prior to the internship (June 2017)
* Gross income of $11,192 USD
* Was working under a J1 visa (Trainee/Intern)
* Working for an American company in California

**What I know (I think...):**

I know that I have to fill out the 1040NR-EZ for federal taxes, form 540NR for state taxes (CA), and I believe I can fill out form 8843 to get my Medicare and Social Security back because I was working under a J1 visa (**1) Is that correct about medicare and social security?**). The part that I'm struggling with is determine which, if any article in the USA-Canada tax treaty that applies to me.

I tried to use Sprintax to complete my taxes as it allows for the form 1040NR, however it said I did not qualify for any articles in the tax treaty. It did however indicate that I do indeed get Medicare and Social Security back.

**Tax Treaty Inquiry:**

There are only three articles that I think that may apply to me:

* XV - Dependent Personal Services
* XX - Students
* XXIV - Elimination of Double Taxation

**Tax Treaty Inquiry - XV**

I think that **XV** applies to me because while I made over $10,000, I was not in the USA for more than 183 days (including the years prior when doing the presence calculation). The only thing that has stopped me from moving forward is the specific sentence 

*""and the remuneration is not borne by an
employer who is a resident of that other State or by a permanent establishment or a fixed base
which the employer has in that other State.""* 

**2) Does that mean that because I was being paid by an american company I do not qualify?**

**Tax Treaty Inquiry - XX**

I don't think that **XX** applies to me because of this sentence *""shall not be taxed in that State provided that such payments are made to him from
outside that State.""* 

Which from my understanding means to qualify I would have to be paid be a company in Canada. **3) Is that correct?**

**Tax Treaty Inquiry - XXIV**

For **XXIV** I'm not sure, I can't make sense of the lawyer talk here. I think that I qualify because I'm being taxed in Canada for my USA income. **4) Care to shed some light on this**

devops,[REQUEST] Advice For Landing a DevOps Role for Someone w/ Some Dev and IT Experience,"Hello all,

I'm interested in becoming a ""DevOps Engineer"" or ""Site Reliability Engineer"".

**About Me**

I'm a 28 year old male who lives within 45 miles of Los Angeles, with a bachelor's degree in computer science, and a master's degree in software engineering, along with 4.5 years of ""Internship"" experience (I had a paid federal job through the Pathways program while attending school) as a web developer, 6 months of IT experience and 1.5 years of experience as a ""Developer Support Analyst"".

* In school we focused mainly on C++ programming in a Linux Environment. 

* From my web development job I learned to build CRUD applications in PHP/HTML/CSS, as well write Java unit tests.

* From my IT job, I learned the basics of Microsoft system administration.

* From my ""Developer Support Analyst"" job, I learned how to troubleshoot and help other developers fix their applications in mostly C# and JavaScript. 

**What I've been Trying to Learn**

* AWS (through Udemy)

* Docker (on DigitalOcean VPS)

* Kubernetes

* Linux system administration

**My Dilemma**

I haven't been able to get anyone to respond to me when I apply for DevOps roles, even at the junior level. In fact, I have not been able to score an interview for any type of development opportunity. At first I thought my resume might be the problem, however, I had it reviewed by recruiters and through the resume subreddit. My fear is that people do not want to speak to me because of my current ""Developer Support Analyst"" title, which implies I do not do new development and am not an engineer. I am not sure how to make myself more marketable. 

**My Questions**

* Based on my current skills, how can I best orient myself to acquire a DevOps Engineer or SRE position?
* Would having an AWS certification open more doors for me?
* Is there any general advice or skill you guys can advise me to take up in order to land one of these roles?

**Thank You!**
I really appreciate all of your help, advice and guidance.",technology

personalfinance,Looking for a mortgage calculator,"I've been searching for a while and can't quite find what I'm looking for so I was hoping someone here may know, or would be able to point me in the right direction.

As the title says, I'm looking for a mortgage calculator- but not just the typical ""how much house can I really afford?"" calculator. 

I'm hoping to find something similar to unbury.me where I can enter all my debts/loans and their interest rates, and my income,  and it will project a mortgage or real estate purchase price based on that info over time as I pay down debt.  Does this even exist?

personalfinance,Question about understanding new Federal tax brackets for 2018.,"For 2017, according to TaxFoundation.org, they calculate tax owed as a base rate plus % over base rate for the total due. So for 2017, say I'm Married Filing Jointly with a taxable income of $100,000, that would land me in the 25% bracket and is calculated as base rate of $10,452.50 + 25% of anything over $75,900 (100,000 - 75,900 = 24,100*.25 = $6,025).  
  
Total Federal Tax owed is 10,452.50 + 6025 = *$16,477.50*  
  
https://taxfoundation.org/2017-tax-brackets/

For 2018, I don't see anything about that base rate of 10,450.50 + percentage over X for Married Filing Jointly. I only see a flat percentage everywhere I've looked online, which would be 25% for that taxable income. So the assumed tax for $100,000 would be $25,000? Am I missing something? Or has that base number not been provided yet?

personalfinance,Almost 30 and I want a fresh start. High debts. What to do??,"I've gotten myself into a situation that is now all consuming and all I think about. I have a debt that has accumulated to an excess of **$26K**. 

* Credit card at $7000 with a horrendous interest rate of 29.99%. *I pay the minimum, sometimes a little more, ~$200/mo.* 
* Another credit card that is $6300 with a rate of 8.5%. *I pay the minimum, sometimes a little more, ~$150/mo.*
* Personal (fixed) loan of $8500. *I pay $243/mo.*
* Car loan that is $4300. *I pay $200/mo.*

**I bring home a little more than $2400/month after taxes**. It's a good stable job with great benefits that I have had for 7 years. About 5 years ago I got a DUI and my debt went from zero to this hot mess. It started with the legal bills and fees but became much more than than as I played and failed at the game of life. **I am 29.**


My spending breakdown is thus:

* $650 for rent w/utilities. I am 7 miles from work and the price is v reasonable for where I live/work.
* $158 car insurance which is the cheapest rate I have been able to find bc of my DUI.
*  $85 phone bill
* $120 gas
* $200 on groceries, I have to do better for sure. 
* $25 on random subscriptions that I won't give up considering the joy it brings me.
* ~$800 for all debts and loans listed in the above section, at minimums.

I don't own anything, not even my car, and I have zero savings. I'm far from perfect, I like to go to dinner with friends about once every other week and I attend a couple shows/events a month. Whenever I get the rare bonus or come across extra cash from selling my stuff, I use it to pay down a little more debt -- but it's not enough, and at times I end up having to charge my cards at the end of the month for things like groceries and gas. I've reached the point of maxing my cards and continually paying down and charging for the same things in this sick cycle.

**I recently started reading about Chapter 7 &amp; 13 bankruptcy and have wondered if this would be best for me.** **So I seek your advice PF.** I heard that if you cannot pay off your debt in 5 years then it's something to consider.

I stopped drinking because I realized I spent a lot of money on going out and buying booze - but now I don't really leave the house. It hasn't made the significant difference in my budget that I anticipated.

Banking,Guy called me a piece of shit slut for not refunding another bank’s fees,"Lemme begin by saying I am SO GLAD I found this sub. This happened about 3 months ago.

I work at Bank A. I’m sitting in my office when the phone rings, and the following conversation takes place:

Me: Thank you for calling Bank A in (town), this is (my name), how may I help you?

Jerk: Hi, last week I transferred $1,000 from my account with your bank to my account with Bank B online. I thought online transfers were immediate so I wrote checks off of my account with Bank B and they all bounced and I now have $108 in overdraft fees from them that I shouldn’t have to pay. I was wondering if you could help me with that since the money didn’t go in on time.

Me: Online transfers between two accounts that are both with Bank A are immediate, but transfers between accounts at different banks take a few days to process. It’s always best to check your balance before writing checks off of any account.

Jerk: (long pause)...I normally do check but every time I’ve transferred in the past, it’s always been immediate so I didn’t think I needed to check my balance. Anyway, I get what you’re saying but it’s inconvenient and I shouldn’t have to pay the fees that Bank B charged me. I need you to please refund them since this wouldn’t have happened if it transferred immediately.

*At this point he’s being polite because he’s trying to get me to somehow refund another bank’s fees. This changes in a moment.*

Me: Unfortunately, we only refund fees if they are a result of a bank error, and in this case it was not our error. Online banking states that it can take 1-3 business days for transfers to be complete. Additionally, even if this was a bank error, I cannot refund another bank’s fees as I have no access to their system.

Jerk: It kind of is your error, in the past my transfers have happened right away.

*I get kind of fed up with talking circles around this guy.*

Me: Ok, sir, in this case it’s your error since you failed to check your account balance with Bank B before writing checks off of it. There is nothing I can do to refund that. I suggest you contact Bank B to see if they will give you a courtesy refund due to your error.

Jerk: I already called them, they won’t refund me because they said it’s not their fault.

Me: They’re right, it’s not. Unfortunately all I can tell you is that in the future, it’s best to check your balance before writing checks.

Jerk: (another long pause).......you’re a piece of shit slut. *hangs up*

Because my mum always drilled into my head never to be in debt (sorry mum), and because I hate owing people money (especially banks), I always try to get rid of it as quickly as possible. When I first started working and was earning AU$28k a year, I had an $18k/7yr car loan (I got ripped off SO BAD, but that's a tale for another day) that I paid off in four years because I always put in more than the required amount. 

I'm currently paying $30 more on my mortgage than is required, $20 more on my credit card, and $70 more on my personal loan, as that one has the highest interest rate. The HECS payments are taken, pre-tax, from my pay, but I'm not currently making any additional payments there. All this debt doesn't really leave me with much out of a paycheque every fortnight, but it's enough to get by (usually), and I'm still contributing a small amount to my savings if there's anything left when my next pay rolls around. 

I've recently been under some pretty intense financial stress with council rates notices, things around the house that need repairing, my car needing a service and three new tyres, illness, and a bunch of other things, so yesterday I called the bank to ask how far ahead I was in my personal loan repayments, and if I could put a stop to them for a few weeks to allow me to pay a few other things. They told me I had nearly $2500 in my redraw, which meant I didn't have to make a payment until July. 

THE RELIEF. 

So now, the money I was putting toward that debt can go toward the other bits and pieces I have to pay, which will make things *much* easier for a few months. I'll probably also put some additional money each fortnight onto my credit card to get that down even quicker. 

This obviously isn't applicable to everyone, and it sometimes isn't feasible to pay an extra $20-$70 a fortnight toward a debt (it isn't for me either), but every little bit counts. Even if you're only contributing an extra $5 a month, or a bit here and there, it adds up. That $2500 I'm ahead has built up over about two years or so. The extra repayments I'm making have varied from $0 when I've been super broke, to a one-off $100 when I was on leave for four weeks, didn't do aaaaanything or spend any money, and had some extra to put in.

personalfinance,"First time changing employers, doubled my salary, PSLF, plus retirement fund questions?","I'm using a throwaway account for privacy reasons. 

As the title says, I recently got a job with a new employer who will be paying me significantly more than what I currently earn. I'm excited and anxious to start in my new position, but I also want to be sure I'm starting out on the right foot financially. I don't have friends/family to really talk to about finances, so I've had to learn a lot the hard way. I think I have a lot to be proud of (I'm 27 and have been on my own since 17 and the only debt I've accumulated has been student loans.) But I also still have a lot to learn and I've most certainly done some stupid stuff with my money in the past.


**Details about my current situation:**

Current employer - I've worked in my current job for almost 2 years (it's my 1st job out of college, and 1st time having health insurance, retirement benefits, etc...)

* Currently making: ~$1,900/mo. after taxes, etc. (Salary before tax is listed as $29,800/year)
* Current expenses: ~$2,600/mo. (split with my partner)
* Student loans: I have $42k in federal loans. My current job is with an employer that is qualified as far as PSLF is concerned. I'm on an income driven repayment plan and as of right now, my monthly minimum payment has been $0. This is a double-edged sword, as I am legitimately too poor to pay anything significant on the loan balance at my current job, but I was told that with a scheduled payment of $0, paying *anything* on the loan (even just a few dollars) would put my account ""paid ahead"" which would mean I'm not accruing months of ""qualified"" payments. With my new job, I'll need to re-certify and I'm sure I will have a minimum payment of more than $0, at which point this won't be an issue anymore (I've been wanting to pay interest at least, so that if the PSLF program fails, at least I wouldn't have been sitting on a pile of actively growing debt for 10 years.) But I'm still not sure if I should pay much more than the minimum since my new job will also be a qualifying employer under PSLF.
* Retirement: I have between $3,200 and $3,700 in my account (my contributions) and I'm not sure if I should take the tax hit and just get a refund on the amount, or if I should roll the amount into the retirement option offered by my new employer (I was told rolling it over would eliminate the tax penalty.) 
* Current emergency fund: $1,500 (it was a lot larger at one point, but we had two legitimate emergencies and never got it back to what it was previously. We made progress though, as it actually dipped all the way down to $900.) 


**New job info:**

* New salary: $63k/year (I'm not sure exactly what it will work out to after taxes, etc...)
* Expenses: will remain the same, but I'm in pretty desperate need of a more reliable car. I would buy used and probably pay in cash, so that would be the 2nd thing I save up for after beefing up my emergency fund.
* Student loans: would I want to pay more than the minimum? It causes me a lot of stress just knowing that they're outstanding, but I also know it's pretty stupid to pay something off that I may not actually need to pay off (I've only made 10 qualifying payments for PSLF and you need 120.)
* Retirement: My contributions will be 7% of total earnings, with the account earning 7% compound interest each month. Apparently they allow you to retire after 20 years of service, regardless of age.
* Emergency fund goal: $8,000 initially, then aggressively saving for a car (probably $12-$18k) and then back to beefing up the emergency fund and eventually starting on other savings goals.


**My Questions:**

Can anyone offer tips on what I should do with my retirement contributions from my current employer (roll it over or take the refund; I'm leaning towards rolling it over, but I could use the money to repair my car and it would put my mind at ease.)

Does anyone have advice/insight about my student loans? Should I be paying more on them (I'm sure I could pay them off in less than the 10 years it would take to qualify for PSLF, but then I would be paying that out.) Should I only pay the minimum/interest and hope for PSLF to live that long?

Does anyone have tips for saving in the future, since my income will be so dramatically different? In the past, I've been almost paycheck to paycheck every month, even with strict limits on spending and regular deposits into my savings account. It's seemed like I've just barely been getting by for a long time and I really don't want to start spending more than I need to simply because I ""can.""",finance

personalfinance,Need advice on secured loan,"Hi all,

I’ve got a 2012 Camry that I’ve had since it was brand new. My dad has co-signed on it and he has been paying it off for me since the start. There’s only about $600 owed on it left.

My credit score is a 580 due to some past mistakes and hardships I’ve been in, but for the past few years I’ve become completely stable with a moderate income. 

Currently I’m in a bit of a emergency financial bind. My fiancé is going through some medical issues and I need to pull a loan of about $5000.

My local credit union called me and said that my credit score would not qualify for a signature loan but i could put my car as collateral and she could pull some of the equity to approve me for the loan.

She gave me an unfortunate rate of 18% on a $5000 loan, but I am definitely in need and stable enough to take on the payments.

My biggest question is that if I do accept this offer, what is to follow? I don’t exactly want my dad to know that I’m receiving this loan because I know he would give me an argument about it and want to lend me money instead with no interest rate... but I want to do this myself.

Is this a situation I can do under the covers without him knowing at all? I’m not fully aware of what kind of paperwork i have to do or show for.",finance
CryptoCurrency,Clearing up the question of economic rescission/depression and cryptocurrency,"Hey guys! Something i've seen talked about a lot here is what would happen in the case of economic downturn in the case of crypto.

Firstly let me state 1. I'm extremely bullish on cryptocurrency in these hard times. 2. What I say here is entirely speculative. 3. I've liquidated 92% of my equity holdings prior to the downturn. 

So first and foremost we're seeing serious signs that hyperinflation is rampant. The flattening yield curve, the buying power of your dollar, technicals showing downturn, and political uncertainty. All of these factors have played massive parts in prior economic downturns.

So the question then becomes, if the dollar is showing signs of hyperinflation why havent we seen it talked about? Unfortunately when things like this happen our only tool to shed light on whats going on behind the curtain is technicals; with a leading economic indicator like the yield curve flattening out it points very clearly the fed will start printing more money. 

So if the fed starts to print more money excessively, what does that mean for cryptos? Simple crypto should, per  correlation to the dollar, go up. Well, thats all well and good. What is important though? The price or the value? 

The price may fluctuate nonstop everyday in and out. If in 10 years time you get where you want to be value wise, who cares about the in and out movement? 

I'm open to discussing this more but this was just a quick sentiment of bull as everyone is down. Every project you like before the dip still holds the same value.

personalfinance,Moving to quarterly estimated taxes--a couple of questions!,"Hi everyone,  

I work in corporate America while my wife is a sole proprietorship. For the last ~5 years I've withheld a significant amount extra in order to cover our tax liability, however last year business for my wife picked up significantly. We expect this to continue, or even grow slightly, from here. Due to this we want to begin not withholding extra, and continue to keep our allowances at 0. From this comes two questions:  

1. Can someone please double check this math? Last year we owed $2700 for Federal, and were positive $900 for State. We withheld $1300 ($50 per each x 26 paychecks) for Federal, as well as State. This leads me to believe that all things equal we should owe approximately $4000 for Federal in 2018, and approximately $400 for State. Paid quarterly this would be $1000 and $100 respectively.
2. Assuming the math is right, since my wife and I file jointly is there any issue if she's the one to pay the estimated taxes for both Federal and State online? I don't think this should be a cause for concern.  

Thank you as always PF!",finance
personalfinance,File your tax return on time even if you can't afford to pay.,"Late filing penalties accrue at a much faster rate than late payment penalties (0.5%/mo vs 5.0%/mo). So file your return on time or at least file an extension. Then you can either arrange to pay the balance later or request an installment plan.

Keep in mind that installment plans and deferred payment arrangements do not stop penalties and interest from accruing, so pay as quickly as possible. It may save you money to take out a personal bank loan to pay your taxes.

Also, pay your state taxes first. Penalties vary from state to state, but they tend to be higher than federal penalties and many states front-load their penalties (10% up front then 1%/mo).",finance

personalfinance,[Retirement] Should I continue in the same job once my husband retires or will I take a major hit.,"My husband is older than I and can retire in about 3-4 years.  I have 10 years left.  We both work as civilians for the US government.  We both contribute to Thrift Savings Plan and our job offers a matching contribution up to a certain amount.  We have both always put the minimum matching amount in and currently my husband has his TSP maxed out for the year while mine is at the minimum.  I don't have mine maxed out because having kids costs money and their schooling and sports fees and clothing costs comes from my salary. We had children later in life. 

I currently have a bit over $200k in my TSP and my husband has over $300k in his.  I have a Roth IRA from a previous job that has about $35k in it.  We are doing much better than our peers in the retirement area.  

When my husband retires, we'd like to move out of the DC area completely. Unless we move to a place that has a lot of federal or military, my benefits won't transfer and we don't necessary want to live in those areas as they are just as expensive to live in as DC.   I've been doing a lot of pondering about doing a career change and just doing something new (and doesn't require 'mandatory overtime').  

When my husband retires he will get all his benefits and the full retirement package.  Is it worth it for me to continue to stay in the same career in the government for an additional 8 years?  DC is expensive and my salary alone cannot pay rent/mortgage.  Moving to the mid-West/anywhere but DC and switching careers will mean a pay cut, but we also wouldn't be paying for the high cost of living in the DC area. 

Yet, on the other hand, the school and benefits the DC area has are really good compared to other places in the US.  It's a complete balancing act.  

My husband does have a mandatory retirement age for his service time, so he must retire within the next 3-5 years anyhow.  It's just a question of financially of the below factors:

- Cost of living would drop dramatically if we move from the DC area to say Ohio or North Carolina.  Housing costs drop as well, but can we find jobs that even it out?   

- Currently we pay our before and after school care and summer camps/care for our children as we both work - husband stay home means we don't incur these costs. The costs for summer care alone is half my take home pay.  

- Quality of life.  DC area has a lot of benefits and opportunities, but we don't get to enjoy them due to commuting, and lack of time.  

- My husband has considered going contract after he retires and moving to an area where the big contracting companies are located that aren't DC - but I would either have to quit what I do outright or go contract myself.  I would definitely need advice from someone who has gone from civilian to contract before retirement to hear the pros and cons.

economy,"Some good news for Nigeria's state revenue, though its budget announcement is, again, delayed","It was announced Thursday, Nigeria’s State revenue for February of this year edged up by 19 billion naira ($53 million). This was thanks to higher crude oil exports and prices.

Rising oil prices, new foreign exchange measures, attractive yields on government securities, and a tighter monetary policy have made the foreign exchange more readily available and helped contain inflation. Consequently, investors are returning to Nigeria. So far, lots of analysts tend to be optimistic about Nigeria’s economic development. (recommend FuninUSA for more global financial news)

After the recession of 2016, with the country’s economy shrank by 1.58 percent, according to its National Bureau of Statistics, Nigeria—which is Africa’s largest economy and easily the continent's most populous nation—will grow 2.1 percent in 2018, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). 

This year, chaotic fiscal management has meant that its budget announcement has been pushed back yet again. Expected for April 24, the announcement will now come on May 31 since last year's budget was also published in May. But, thanks to the existing limitations of the Nigerian state, the delayed budget may not be so impactful in the everyday lives of Nigerians.",finance

personalfinance,IRS W2 Allowance Calculator Says I should take 15 allowances....,"Married. Filing Jointly. 2 Children (3 years, 1 year).
Previous Job had no 401 or IRA. So I took 1 allowance. Got a huge refund at end of the year ~10000 and put that into an IRA for myself and my wife for savings.

Now I am starting a new job. It has a 401k. I want to maximize my paycheck but no owe at the end of the year.

So  I have looked at the new W2 form and when I fill it out... It says I should take 1 for me, 1 for filing jointly, 1 for wife not working (she has a job she works once monthly for 50$ a pop). Then it says I should probably be taking 4 per child.  So ~11 allowance. That seems absurd. I was thinking I would go from 1 to 4 or 5.

I went to the IRS calculator and it is telling me to take 15!!!

I don't understand!.

I am expecting to put 10-18% of my paycheck into the 401k. But until we get a few paychecks deep I don't know what will be the right amount for us to ensure we have enough paycheck day to day.

Anyone have any suggestions? I don't want to claim 15, but I do want to make sure I end up with as close to no federal return as possible without owing at the end of the year.

I also have a number of other deductions that reduce taxable interest. 2500 yearly loss on an estate, 2500 student loss debt, Plus I am using my current paycheck at my current job to estimate for what my pay will be at my newer job.. So it seems off. But this year I did get 9200$ back for federal.

&gt;Your Results
Based on the information you previously entered, your anticipated income tax for 2018 is $3,614. If you do not change your current withholding arrangement, you will have $8,472 withheld for 2018 resulting in an overpayment of $4,858 when you file your return. If you want your withholding to more closely match your anticipated tax, adjust your withholding on new Forms W-4 as follows:
Job 1 (which has a projected salary of $95,000): 15 allowances.
Job 2 (which has a projected salary of $600): 0 allowances.
Check the “Married” box on your Forms W-4
&gt;Based on the information you entered, if you file a new Form W-4 for the rest of 2018 the expected refund to which you may be entitled, should be about $125. Following this recommendation to file a new W-4 will ensure that the amount withheld from your wages will cover all of your projected tax liability while minimizing your refund, as long as the information you entered in the calculator remains correct.

personalfinance,Citibank fraudulent Behavior: can't figure this out.,"Hello,

So about two months ago, I disputed a $430 dollar charge from a company called DieselPerformanceTexas.com on my credit card: it was a fraudulent charge. It came through Paypal (not my account and ran as debit), but used my credit card number. The merchant refuted my dispute, and now we're going through a back and forth. The merchant said that the package was delivered to me and I originated the request, and that I had purchased through them before. I have not, and this is not the case.

So some details:  I was e-mailed a few days after I disputed the charge (and canceled my credit card and ordered a new one, being a victim of fraud) by Fedex: in this e-mail they let me know that a package was being sent by this DieselPerformanceTexas.com company. The day before this ""package"" was about to be delivered to me, there was a request by the sender (DieselPerformanceTexas.com) to change the address (package was rerouted) of the delivery: the package ended up being delivered somewhere in Michigan after the reroute, and I don't live in Michigan. I called Fedex today to see if I can get the address of the package and to whom it was delivered in Michigan, but the person on the phone was dodgy and either didn't or wouldn't disclose the address of where it was sent to me.

At first, I thought maybe this was an honest mistake: maybe there was a person, with my name, in Michigan who ordered a $430 package and our wires got crossed somehow. However, I am now suspicious: why was the package rerouted by the company the day before it was delivered to me? I called Citibank this morning to let them know, and I've also contacted the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as well and filed it with them, and they're following up.

It's strange because I did get the e-mails from Fedex while it was happening...at the time, I e-mailed Paypal and asked them to look into it and see where this originated and with whom, but their response after 7 days didn't relate to the issue since the charge was removed from my credit card, I moved on. However, the charge has been put back on my credit card: I reopened the case and again, as stated before, we're going through a back and forth.

Just wondering if this fits anything at all like typical fraudulent behavior patterns...and if the company is the one doing something fraudulent, or if it's likely a third party entity. Seeing that $430 dollar charge makes me anxious: even though the Citibank representative told me not to be concerned about it, I hate seeing that number there and this isn't something I did, although at first glance it looks like the charge originated from me.",finance

What the current lender wants to do is lower my interest rate from 3.875 to 3.375.

If you do not accept this offer: Everything you already have stays the same, Except we will no longer service your loan. The loan would be sold to the highest bidder.

At this point, I'd love to just be done with it, but if it's only 20 minutes more work, I'd be fine with doing the form with the medical deductions and get the three of us heirs the equivalent of a nice lunch out.

personalfinance,Buying New Home - Payoff mortgage or leave invested?,"I'm 39 yo, I have a job of 10 years, make roughly 60k a year before taxes.

I currently own a home that I owe 162k on, comps for this home are 280k in my area. 

I plan on moving from my area to a new state in the next 12 - 16 months, selling this home, and using that and other money to put a down/pay off my next home.

My mother recently passed, I will have what's left over from this home after paying off the balance, after fee's etc likely about 70k, I will also have roughly 50k from my mothers estate to include as a down.

I currently have ~450k invested with a broker, not including my work retirement.

My question is this, I plan on buying a home in the 230-260k range, putting down my ~$130k, and having a remaining mortgage leftover of ~$100-130k.

With the mortgage interest rates rising, does it make sense to pull out ~$100k out of my investments to pay off the mortgage, or should I leave it invested and pay monthly on the mortgage?

I've considered having to pay Taxes on the lump amount to pay off the interest, if I kept the 30 year loan and paid interest @4.5%, it's roughly 100k of interest payments.  If I cut that to a 15 year, it cuts it in half, but still having to pay ~$50k in mortgage interest.  

Lots to think about, minus some variables, what is generally the suggestion here?  I'm not married, wont be, I have no major bills other then a ~$450 car payment every month on top of normal utility bills.",finance

Help!","I work for a small company in California and because we're a team of 12 or so people we generally hire someone from the outside to come in and walk us through selecting our medical plan.

I selected a GOLD plan about a month ago, but they signed me up for a different plan. I spoke to my HR dept who told me to speak with the broker.

It's been 2 paychecks and I've been paying for the GOLD, but not receiving it. I'm a bit fed up, and would like to report them.  I'm not sure where to start? I don't mind throwing my company or the broker under the bus, I've given them more than enough chances to redeem themselves.

personalfinance,My parents are trying to take out a loan in my name.,"Currently, I'm 19 years old and about to transfer to a university. My parents told me they're planning on buying another house for the purpose of renting it out on Airbnb. They want to put the loan under my name so they can get the first time buyer interest rate. 
My dad said that although the loan is under my name, he's going to make the payments himself. The house that they want to buy would also be under my name.  I want to know if this is legal and if it will affect me in any way in the future.

Edit: I argued with my dad and pointed out many of the risks you guys stated. I told him I’m not signing anything and I would rather take out student loans. I think he gave up on the idea of buying a second house now that he realizes I’m not dumb enough to believe what he says. Thank you guys so much for your responses!",finance
personalfinance,Wife Lost all Savings in IRS scam 30K,"Hey all,
First time posting on PF long time reader although, I never signed up. I'm posting this to see help for my wife in steps we need to take when someone scams you for all your life savings. She was a victim yesterday March 29 to the IRS scam. They pretended to be the IRS, Local Law Enforcement, even her own bank. They threatened her with jail time and arresting her if she did not meet any of the demands. She was not allowed to speak to anyone because it was ""considered a crime to discuss federal investigation"" I was not brought into the equation till after the fact of what had happened. She lost everything to a Bitcoin ATM where she deposited everything. All we have now is Chase Bank receipts from all her withdrawals and a big fat $0 in both the banking and savings.

We cancelled all our credit cards, froze our bank account, called one of the 3 major credit bureaus, we are in the process of closing that bank account and opening up a different one. She is an emotional mess ATM and we are at a loss any help that any of you would recommend we will be grateful for. If there is a step we missed or if anyone has gone through something like this. Please share some insight we will be forever in your debt. 

Thank you fellow PF redditors.",finance
personalfinance,Paying off debt.. is what I'm doing reasonable?,"Basically, a lot of nonsense happened and my husband and I are left with $25k in debt. I've been working on paying it off with all possible haste, paying at least $100 over the minimum each per month. The only exception to this are the three cards with no interest offers, which I will pay minimum on until the interest kicks in or I've paid off a different card. 

After our tax refunds and an RSU payout for my husband, we have about $9k that we're pouring into debt, the card with the highest balance and second highest interest rate. That will bring our balance down significantly. 

We currently have $2k in savings, which I've not added more to until the debt is paid off because I feel that I'm paying more in interest than I'd get from having more in savings. 

After the debt is paid off, I'm cancelling one of my cards because the benefits aren't worth the hassle of having it. My husband's credit card has great perks, so we plan to keep that one. 

Is there anything additional I should be doing, or is the action I'm taking reasonable?

Just for a bit more information, I didn't count my student loan (which is less than $10k) because I'm not paying on it yet. I have another year or so until I'm done with school and the grace period will end.

Now he has a legit grass cutting business, and I’ve recently figured out a lot of what he does, well, shouldn’t be done. He’s payed me under the table this entire time, just giving me a check, so no taxes have ever came out and I know this for a fact.

I have bills to pay, and I’d like to either file my taxes, I claim 0 so I should get money back for sure, but the thing is I was never taxed. I also want to file unemployment.

I'm working at a pizza place for $8.50 a hour, but we get paid more the longer we work there and when training is over, and since I have no will to spend my money I thought I might as well invest it.

personalfinance,Have to borrow about 18k for school (no student loans available)- is there any good option for me?,"I got into a great school in Canada that will cost about $35k U.S. to attend for the year the program takes. If I work during my time there (the 20 hours allowed by the study permit I'd be there under, min. wage), and bring my current savings with me, I'll have about $18k U.S. still to make up. Thing is, there are no federal loans that recognize out of country, certificate program based schools. And all the private loan companies I've seen don't offer student loans for this purpose specific either. There's plenty for trade schools, there's plenty for international schools, but none (that I've found) for the combination of the two.

My family's offered to pay the interest on a personal loan while I'm in school, plus a few months, essentially helping in the same way a government student loan would. But securing a large personal loan without taking credit-card levels of interest seems a difficult task. I've got about $4k available to me at the moment, and I'll have a bit more in the next month or two. The best option I've found for myself is to open a CD with Wells Fargo with about $3k in it, then use that as collateral against a loan for $20k, likely at around 9-13% interest.

The payments on that would be around $200/month, and I wouldn't have to start paying until I'm out of school, hopefully with a nice job in my field. Though I would have to start paying my previous schooling off. I have about $9k of community college debt at 4.5% interest over ten years that I'll start having to pay off a couple months after I move to Canada.

Any better ideas, gang? Or does anyone want to tell me exactly how stupid this plan is, because I get that feeling for some reason. It would really suck to not be able to take this opportunity, but if I can't do it without inevitably drowning in debt, them's the sh*t brakes I guess.

personalfinance,Mileage reimbursement and taxes question,"I worked for a small privately owned company (18 people total) where I did a lot of driving for work. They only reimbursed at 41 cents a mile vs. the federal 53.5 cents a mile.

personalfinance,It’s never too early to plan for retirement... Advice needed on starting a Roth IRA,"So I’ve been thinking recently about starting a Roth IRA. I know a lot of questions are going to start with “are you making your companies 401K match”, so let me start at the beginning. 

I’m Evan, I’m 19y/o and I’m in college. I run a small business out of my home, that probably should generate a little more than minimum wage this year. I do it instead of working at McDonald’s because I get to fluctuate my own hours, and I don’t have to work nearly as long to get the same payout. It’s a sole proprietorship, and I’m the only person involved. Most of my sales come through eBay and YES I PAY TAXES. My sales nexus is in a 7% sales tax, while my home state is 6%, not sure if that makes any difference. I am paying for college in cash, I have 2 cars, one is a 2015 Ford Focus with 30k miles and I also have a Datsun 280z I restored myself and it’s near immaculate, so no money will need to be spent in this department for a long time down the road. 

So I was thinking the other day, and rather than putting the money in my bank, I’d rather start putting it in something with a much higher interest rate where I can try to cut a few more years off when I can retire. At this point in time I’m thinking it’ll be easy for me to contribute $50 a week, but it may fluctuate. That being said, is there a better/safer/more recommended option where I can insert x amount weekly or monthly and come out better? I plan to keep this going until I retire. I am a business major in college, so if I end up with my own startup I will need more advice, however if I get a “standard” job, I plan on maxing the company match, and still leaving as much as I can in this plan for retirement. 

Thanks for any advice you guys can give me",finance
personalfinance,"PSLF candidate with employer who ""forgot"" to withhold Federal Taxes in community property state, better to file separately or jointly?","Hi r/personalfinance,

I finished grad school about a year ago (June 2017), and I also started my current employment (full time) in March of 2017. Also, I got married in July 2017. I live in a community property state, and I work for a nonprofit so I'm planning to do the Public Service Loan Forgiveness plan. 

While completing my taxes this March, I realized that my employer had not withheld federal taxes from my paycheck. I double checked with them and read my w4, and they agree that this was their mistake. They plan to loan me the amount, and I will pay it off over time. 

I had originally planned to file separately from my husband, but I am not sure anymore. I make $47k and he makes about $30k. I was under the impression that filing separately would lead us to have a lower income based repayment, but I'm not sure if that is impacted by living in a community property state, because we must give all the info of incomes on our taxes return anyway. 

Would it make more sense to file jointly, as our returns will have 50% of the total income on mine anyway?",finance

personalfinance,"What's the smartest thing a 30 year old can do with $7,000? I've done so much research, I've confused myself and I'm scared to make a move.","I finally made an account today after 8 months of researching and reading this sub because - although I'm grateful for the in-depth information available to me - I've become so overwhelmed by my options that I'm scared to make a move. I have had zero guidance as I have no family and have taken care of myself since high school. I've taught myself everything I know and it's been hard for me to reach where I am now.

About me:

* 29 year old female living in Southern California
* No debt
* Annual income: $72,000
* Savings: $11,000 (including $4,200 emergency fund)
* Living expenses (rent + bills): $1,400/mo
* ROTH 401k Contribution: 10% (employer now matches 3%) Right now I have $40,000 in the Vanguard account but because of my employer, I'm automatically enrolled in Vanguard Target Retirement 2055 Inv (VFFVX) and when I tried to contact Vanguard for advice, they said my company doesn't pay for that and they couldn't help me.

I have paid off my student loans and I have $11,000 sitting in a Wells Fargo Savings Account that I've been contributing to since I turned 15, it includes my emergency fund, and I think I should move a chunk of my savings to an account where I'll at least make some money from interest rates.

I am so lost and overwhelmed by my options. I've done so much research and reading and I can't decide whether or not I should open my own IRA, invest in a CD or move my savings to a Money Market Account. Then more recently I started wondering if I should instead invest in bonds. I've talked to my financially savvy friends and each person is doing something different or had a lot more money to invest. I also spent weeks researching the stock market but the more I learn the more confused I become.

I am approaching 30 and panicking about the fact I feel completely financially illiterate despite the amount of time I've spent researching and reading. I thought about hiring a financial adviser and have talked to a few who said they want to meet but I feel silly because I really only have $7,000 to move around after subtracting an emergency fund. I don't know if it's smart to pay someone to help me.

I guess my question(s) are:

* Should I move my emergency fund to an account other than my Wells Fargo Savings account?
* What's the smartest thing I can do with my $7,000? (Should I spread the money out?)
* Should I just hire a financial adviser or is that a waste?
* I recently got a higher paying job and have started to save $500 per month in the Wells Fargo Savings Account. What should I do with the additional $500 per month moving forward? (I mean where should I put it?)

My goals:

* Invest in something long term to reap benefits of compound interest (save for retirement)
* Simultaneously invest in something where I can reap benefits (dividends etc.) in the short term so I can have some spending money toward traveling &amp; attending friend's weddings &amp; baby showers. 

I know there is a lot of advice out there and on /r/presonalfinance so I have waited months before posting to ask for help but I really need guidance. I've read about compound interest and I'm so eager to start investing but my fear of making the wrong decision has me paralyzed.

personalfinance,6.5 years into PAYE student loan program with $55k in debt. Considerable jump in income. Thinking about not paying down the debt and investing in 401k with the money.,"Sorry for the long thread title. Hope it makes sense. $55k in student loan debt. 35 years old. $50k already in 401k. $80k over 28 years left on mortgage at 4.05%. Making $70k per year.

I've been throwing around the idea of [taking advantage of the PAYE program to forgive my debt after 20 years](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/understand/plans/income-driven) instead of paying it down over the course of the next 10 years, or so. Wondering what y'all think about this idea. I'm aware of the fact I would be forced to pay taxes on the forgiven debt.

I haven't been making much money until 2017 when I saw a significant bump in my pay. Before that, I was barely paying anything on the loans and the interest alone was making the amount go up. Now, I'm making about $70k. I have no car payment, I have saved up my 6 months in expenses, and I'm about to have all of my CC debt paid off within the next 6 months (yay!) I see a lot of places talk about paying off the student loan debt next but I'm thinking about not doing this and investing it all in the 401k. The reason being I've already got 6.5 years under my belt on the 20 year PAYE forgiveness clock at very minimal payments, so I only need to pay 13.5 years at whatever my current salary is. This year it went up to $256 per month. The effective interest rate on these loans in total is 6.18% and I would essentially just be paying the interest off every year and I would be getting the total down to about $45-50k to forgive in 13.5 years if I just kept doing the bare minimum. That year, I would have to pay taxes on whatever is left.

So, instead of paying down this debt, what would be wrong with putting loads of money in my 401k instead of trying to pay this thing down? Wouldn't it essentially be like the government giving me money to invest into the market and then after 13.5 years I have to pay taxes on the outstanding loan balance? I would obviously plan to switch my 401k contributions for that specific year from Roth to traditional and then also slow up my income a bit for that year.

Please pick this apart for me because I'm sure I'm not seeing all the angles and this plan would start in about 6 months time, so I'm just mulling the idea over right now.",finance
investing,Even more bad news for Tesla coming in: Tesla Says Autopilot Was Engaged in Fatal Crash Under Investigation in California,"WSJ:

&gt; Tesla Inc. late Friday acknowledged its semiautonomous system Autopilot was engaged by the driver in the seconds before a fatal crash last week, raising more questions about the safety of self-driving technology on public roads.

&gt; Federal investigators this week began examining the March 23 crash of a Model X sport-utility vehicle that was traveling south on Highway 101, near Mountain View, Calif., before it struck a barrier, then was hit by two other vehicles and caught fire. The driver of the Model X was killed.

&gt; Tesla said its vehicle logs show the driver’s hands weren’t detected on the wheel for six seconds before the collision, and he took no action despite having five seconds and about 500 feet of unobstructed view of a concrete highway divider.

personalfinance,"Refinance student loan, just pay more each month, or none of the above?","I'm trying to figure out if it's worth it to refinance my student loan.

I have a federal direct consolidated student loan, with FedLoan Servicing, of $27,000 (technically it's a consolidation of $16,800 in a federal direct subsidized loan and $10,200 in a federal direct unsubsidized loan).  My interest rate is 5.88% fixed, I pay $250/month on the standard repayment plan, and I have 13 years left (20 year original repayment term since at the time my balance was over $30k).  I just checked the FedLoan thing and it looks like they no longer have a 10-year standard plan, so I could switch to a graduated plan for the remainder of my term but that's it if I stuck with FedLoan.

I've been looking around at several student loan refinancing sites (SoFi, Earnest, Laurel Road, etc.) and most of them have interest rates ranging from about 2.5-8%.  I have excellent credit, so theoretically I would qualify for the lower end of those interest rates.  5.88% interest isn't as high as it could be, though it's certainly not the lowest, either, so should I even bother looking at refinancing?

I see my options more or less like this:  1)  I do nothing, continue paying on my current plan.  2)  I refinance, hopefully with a lower interest rate and for a shorter term.  3)  I pay extra per month with FedLoan, thus paying off my loan faster although my interest rate would not change.

If I'm reading the FedLoan ""pay extra"" info correctly, then I would actually be paying extra and not just paying ahead.  They say ""If you use Direct Debit: We withdraw your payment (plus any additional amount you request) through Direct Debit every month regardless of your ""paid ahead"" status"" (https://myfedloan.org/borrowers/payments-billing/paying-ahead).  So if I just paid double my monthly amount I would actually be paying down and not paying ahead.  Is that a better option than refinancing?

If I did refinance, should I go with a variable interest rate or a fixed one?  Variable is slightly lower than fixed, but it's also subject to change.",finance

personalfinance,The Worst way that credit card debt Fucks you,"So everyone knows debt is bad, and the main reason cited is the amont paid in interest.  But even the worst interest rates like credit cards are ~20%.  

While that's bad, the trade off is that you can increase your standard of living by reducing your net over time and that's perfectly acceptable to me.  But that's not what's actually happening.

If you have debt vested in anything that doesn't have inherent value, like your standard of living, it's taking up to 100% of your spending power as dictated by your credit score.  Some banks will let you go to 110% because why the fuck not.

You see 20% and it seems like a lot, but that's still within like hustling range in your day to day.  And it is.  So say you have a $50k salary and without being at all frugal, you net $10k.  Doing everything as cheap as possible, you could probably get that to $20k net. 

Cool, you make yourself live a miserable life for $10k net.  Well doing that work helped me find something that gives me an opportunity that makes more than the interest of my debt (even after accounting for risk, very possible with low interest debt).  You think oh, I'm making $10k more net, this makes more than what I'm paying in interest, put it in there.  Delta of profit and interest.  

Except it's wrong.  Going back, if you have 50% of your debt limit at $50k, you could probably have a credit limit of $10k.  But if you are using $5k of that, you can most likely turn around and get a personal loan of $10k.  If you invest $5k into paying of dead weight debt, and then you are immediately doubling your capital power.  

Now you can invest $10k into profitable activities by putting $5k of net after a year into debt.  Now your portfolio of profitable investments, while having the same profitability (say 5%) it doubles your profit coming from your portfolio.  

So in 2.5ish years (accounting for the interest of the loan) , you would be profitable on your investment into your debt.  If you spend two years of $5k net and pay off $10k in debt, the new loan you can take is not $20k, but probably closer to $30k and probably lower interest.  

After two years, your capital power is three times your original net with the debt, + the difference in interest.  Your same 5% profit portfolio will break even from the debt investment in 3.5ish years.  But now your net per year after that has tripled.  

Dont take on debt... And if you have pay it off first I guess...",finance

Bitcoin,Is bitcoin futures volume driving ordinary markets? (“taming BTC” and the effects of futures of commodity markets..),"Can ordinary trading of a “classical asset” be manipulated by FX exchanges? 

Once the futures market volume is higher than the regular spot market, general notice leans towards FX markets for direction. 

Marginal traders (and short term price) are looking to the FX tickers to indicate whether it’s a bear or bull market. A bad actor with ""unlimited access"" to fiat (i.e. BIS or federal reserve or their agents) can control those FX markets with taking both sides of bets.

This is what happened to gold in the 70ies (and looks like the current bear Bitcoin chart). Or any other traditions precious metal commodity market.

Fundamentally though BTC is different, not in scarcity, but is use case, and its lack of being manipulable with “fractional” issue like being done with unredeemable paper gold (though the futures contract appears similar).

Theory: institutional high volume traders (marginal trading) move from buying the actual asset (Bitcoin) into partial alt coins, and futures (all types). Hence suddenly stopping trading the actual asset (Bitcoin), that then suffers from a decline in interest, which again influences the other dependables (alts, futures..).

CryptoCurrency,State of Crypto?,"Hey everyone,

I genuinely wanted to ask how you guys feel about Crypto right now. To be honest I lost a lot of trust in my investments. Not because I invested in bad coins or because I didnt do my dyor, but because I am anxious about the crypto market as a whole.

To be fair I got in at the worst time. I was after the big and fast money. I only started investing in late december (I think around 26th I did my first investment). I doubled my investment in a week and was super bullish and pumped alot of money in. Prices were stagnant and then dropped rapidly. I didnt invest more than I could bear and I was very well prepared to lose all when I invested. I am not mad about any losses I have (although more than a couple of my coins are over -80% which is kinda sad and I havent got a single positive coin left for quite some time). 

However I had faith in crypto and kept re-investing more and more money. I bouth the dip, then the dip of the dip and so on and kept hodling. Actually as of right now I still want to buy more because it is cheap as hell, but I feel like I want it more to go back up than it is realistically possible.

People keep saying wait for this or wait for that. When institutional money comes in it gets up again, it is only down because of chinese new year, wait for wall street end of the year payouts, they will invest, bla bla bla. People go on blabbering this day after day for many months now that it lost any meaning to me. The market is unprediactable, atleast I cant predict it and I havent seen anyone in this sub who could (and I am browsing this subreddit daily). 

So maybe it is about time to ask the right questions. It is not about whether coin X or Y has potential. Whether they have a good idea, a solid team or a working product and partners. Maybe it is not about whether we chose the right coin when it comes to surving this low, but whether we chose the right thing to invest.

I keep reading Blockchain is the future. I guess this is true. However this doesnt matter for any of us. We should ask ourselves whether Bitcoin, Ethereum or any other coin is the future. What stops any big company to develop their own blockchain thechnology? Guess what if Google or Amazon creates their own blockchain 99% of all your coins will probably become worthless in the matter of days. They have the resources and the know-how to make something waaaaay bigger and better than anything we have seen so far. They also have the credibility that real investors want. 

Also dont just ask if the coins we bought are the future but also if the tokens we hold are actually meaningful. I read alot about IOTAs adoption in many industries and projects. I strongly believe IOTA as company will go big. But does that affect the price of the Tokens we own or IOTA as a cryptocurrency in any way? Nope, it does not. The company will become a big player but the associated cryptocurrency will probably vanish some time.

There is currently a picture of a ""heatmap"" on the frontpage showing Bitcoins gains and loses over the last couple of years. This post tries to show that the market always plummets around this time of the year and comes back stronger at the end. You want to know what I see in this heatmap? That 2017 was the first and maybe the only time bitcoin and the whole altcoin market skyrocketed. The gains at the end of 2017 were without predicent and there is no reason why it should come back up again.

Another note which I cant verify however. A friend told me investments like cryptocurrency but also stocks become less attractive since the Federal Funds rates get increased. Prices will most likely keep going down with less incentive for such high risk investments. I dont know why this is, I am solely referring this to what my friend said. But looking at the Dow Jones for example, the graph looks kinda similiar to what is happening with crypto. 

This is not supposed to be FUD and I dont want to worry anyone. I for myself will keep hodling. I am prepared to go 0.00€. I either go big or lose everything, there is nothing in between for me. I just wanted to prompt some questions everyone should ask him or herself.

This will probably go to to deaf ears, because nobody likes it when strangers from the internet tell them that they did a bad investment. But hey, I am the same. Maybe this sounds desperate and all, and I know that negative statements are hated in subs like this, but ask yourselves guys! Is Cryptocurrency the future or is just Blockchain the future? Those are not equivalent!

Tldr:

Blockchain is the future, but is Bitcoin, Etherum or any other cryptocurrency also the future ? (probably not)",cryptocurrency

I also interviewed for the Peace Corps, where I would serve 27 months in a developing country and receive ~$8k in reintigration money upon return. Peace Corps qualifies for PSLF, and most volunteers pay $0 with REPAYE/IBR. I would still be earning my Master's when returning from service. 

I have, with interest, $34,782 in federal loans. I rent a place ($200) an hour away from work, but intend to purchase a small home in town upon graduation if I do not do PC. The COL for this area is very cheap, too.

personalfinance,"24 y/o, finally ready to start being financially responsible. Need advice.","Hi PF, I've been a long time lurker but up till this point have never really thought about how to optimize my financial health.

Some background: I have a Bachelor's in chemistry with a total 2.99 GPA. I have a ridiculous amount of federal student loans. $28,000 in my name at around 5% interest and $81,000 in my mom's name (parent PLUS loan) at 7.63%. So total sum is **$109,000 @ 7.02%** weighted average interest. Yikes.

I have a job in my degree field, working in a water testing lab. I've been there 3.5 years. Started in 2014 @$13/hr and worked my way up to $18/hr. I work about 43 hrs/week. I calculated my monthly take home pay to be about **$2700**.

Up till now, I've been paying the bare minimum on my student loans, and most of it is going to interest. I've been spending frivolously the past 3 years hoping my loans would just disappear someday. I'm finally ready to face the reality that these are not going away. I have to deal with it or be racked with debt forever. Last year I started to change, payed off $4k in credit cards and bumped my credit score up a lot. It felt **very** good to have that shitty high interest debt gone and it gave me confidence to start tackling this student debt. I also managed to save $2000 for an emergency fund (I've never been able to save *any* money until recently) which also felt great.

Luckily I live at home and pay no rent. My typical monthly expenses are (not including student loan payments):

* $183 - Car payment
* $85 - Car insurance
* $73 - Internet/TV
* $63 - Cell Phone
* $10 - Gym
* $12 - Amazon Prime
* $12 - Hulu
* $10 - Youtube red/Google music
* $10 - Moviepass
* $7 - Crunchyroll
* $270 - Gas (My car is fuel efficient but I drive a lot, about 2000 miles/month).

I can trim some of these expenses down if I must. I've gotten into better habits like eating out less so I am learning to make sacrifices. I have even tossed around the idea of living like a miser for the next 5 years or so until all my loans are paid. I could possibly pay $1600-1800/month. I am getting desperate to get rid of this debt ASAP. I feel it would be hard to stick with this plan though, as depriving myself of a lot of things would be psychologically challenging. I am also seeking better job opportunities to make more income. As of now, I'll make about $41,000 this year. I just got a raise last month so asking again won't be an option. I have also started reading Dave Ramsey's *Total Money Makeover* which is the first personal finance book I've ever picked up.

Thank you for any suggestions/thoughts.

**EDIT:** I have a secondary question. I have a meager savings of $2000 and $2000 in investments. Should I put off retirement savings (401k/IRA) completely until I'm debt free? **Note:** my current company will match 100% if I put 10% of my gross pay into a 401k. It's a sweet deal, but I don't know if it's better to put that money toward my debt.",finance
personalfinance,Student Loans of $18.4k. Currently making around 25k. I have enough savings to cover the loan. Working on CCNA certificate.,"Currently working making around 25k per year after taxes. I have been juggling retirement savings, 401k, and emergency funds. I am in a very lucky position of being able to rent my parent's home. They live in another state, so this allows me to save money. I currently have a student loan of $18.3k, my savings are looking around $17k, and my emergency funds, are at $5k. My bills are looking at around $1.2k per month. I am very lucky my parents are still helping me out, but I need to get out of under their wing.

I am currently in the slow season of the company I work for, and my hours will be near non for the months of June/July. I have decided to work on my CCNA certificate during these two months. If I dedicate myself these 2 months I believe I can take the CCNA and start my networking career. My plan is to start a family with my wife in the next 2 years, and possible have a home before our baby is born.

My question is, should I bite the bullet now, and use our savings and pay my student loan, which has an Interest rate of 6.8%, or keep paying the minimum plus some over payment towards the principal each month? The bills are not the issue, I live pretty comfortably at the moment, but that can change any day as my current job is very back breaking at times, and the hours fluctuate with each month. The looming debt discourages me quite a bit every time I think of planning towards the future. I want a small home, a kid, and a relatively better paying job with regular hours.

personalfinance,Girlfriend Has $10k in Credit Card Debt. Whats the Best Way to Manage this Debt As She Pays it Off?,"Hey PF, As the title states my GF is $10k in credit card debt. 

The debit is distributed as follows:
- Chase Slate (was a balance xfer) $2300 @ 19.24% APR
- BOA CC $8346 @ 22.4% APR 
(this is all her debt) 

She makes ~$2440 a month and has $1,500 in savings (We’ve ear marked this as her emergency fund). Credit score is a bit over 700.  

We wrote out a budget together and went over some basic money mgmt stuff which I think will help to prevent her from getting in this situation again. Following the plan, GF thinks she should be able to throw ~$470 a month at her debit (this represents $270 in minimum monthly payments + extra $200). She’s in debt pay off mode so she’s throwing everything extra at the debt as long as a $1.5k emergency fund is funded.  I personally had success with the snowball method so we are leaning towards that.

Whats the best way to go about managing this debt as she pays it off. Those interest rates are real high and I think it would be best if they were consolidated under one loan/card with a lower APR. Whats the best way to do this? Balance transfer, take out a loan, debt consolidation? Worried that if we did a balance Xfer after the introductory APR it might just end up skyrocketing…

personalfinance,"Would like outside insights in setting and achieving successful milestones for my future (US, 22yr)","Hi /r/personalfinance,

I've watched family members and close friends struggle with and stress over money, spend money they don't have, et cetera. Thanks to a mentor of mine for teaching me that money is a tool, not the end-all, be-all, I want to take control of my finances. I have been very fortunate in my situation and my upbringing. I want outside help (unbiased views) in setting stretch goals, or milestones that I will actively have to work toward to achieve and be successful. To start, let me give you an overview of my situation:


**Education**

I am a 22M, pursing a dual degree in Accounting and Cyber Security. I will complete both degrees this June. Approximately in September, I will begin a Masters degree in Accountancy. I plan to obtain my CPA shortly after and complete related certificates in Cyber Security. My goal is working with AIS (Accounting Information Systems).


**Employment**

I am a full-time student as well as a full-time (40 hours) staff member at the state campus I attend. Because of my staff status, I can obtain my Masters for (almost) free. The only caveat is that I am limited to 1-2 courses per semester. This is fine with me, as it will allow me to work full-time while completing my Masters on the side.


**Personal Situation**

I am paid approximately $2,100 per month (net). I do not have any other sources of income. 

I live at home with a parent. My costs (thankfully) are comparatively low. I enjoy time with my girlfriend who I drive to see 1-2 times a week. My personalized Excel budget is very meticulous, as I track every cent I spent, how I spent it, when I spent it, and for what reason I spent it. Currently, my expenses are budgeted just under $1,000 per month.

Rent (monthly)- $100

Internet (monthly) - $60

Car Insurance (monthly) - $80

Phone (monthly) - $54

Household Groceries (monthly) - $40

Self-Saving for IRA (monthly)- $100

Gas Allowance (monthly, set by me) - $150

Eating Out (usually pay for girlfriend) - $200 (typically overspend by $100, this is an area I need to work on)

Parking Permit (monthly, school/work expense) - $15

Budget for unforeseen expenses (monthly) - $100


Any additional cash I make is thrown into a savings account. Towards the end of the year, I turn my attention to max out my IRA contribution (see below). I make virtually all of my purchases with a credit card with cash rewards, which is always paid off at the end of the month. I have approximately $7,000 as my emergency budget, and am starting to save additional cash towards future car maintenance/preventative maintenance.


**Personal Investments/Debts**

I want to start investing in a 401k/403b up to employers match, but I have to wait for approximately 3 months before I have that option. I have invested the maximum in a ROTH IRA each year since inception (2016, 2017, working on 2018).

Disclaimer - I do not know much about a 403b other than the fact it is offered to state employees (me) ... I think

The vehicle I drive is paid off, thanks to my parents. The only debt I owe is student loan debt, approximately 18k. Two loans broken down as so: Loan A ($10,428 owed, ~3.45%) and Loan B ($7,400 owed, ~4.5%) ... *the interest rates are estimates, I don't have the figures in front of me at the moment; will update when I can*.


**My ideas from here**

1) I plan to research more about my employer's 401k/403b for when I am eligible

2) I want to start an additional revenue stream

3) I want to research Certificates of Deposit (CDs) as a method of short-term investment to keep my emergency fund in

4) I want to cut down spending on eating out with girlfriend, ways to approach the conversation


**Why I need your help**

I have been managing my finances since I started a part-time job, but I feel I have become complacent in budgeting / goal-setting. I would appreciate any outside assistance or insights into my situation and what I should do next. Again, I want to set stretch goals. What I mean by stretch goals are goals that I must actively work to achieve.

Thanks for reading and any contributions you make!

personalfinance,$6k+ tax refund,"First time poster here. Any advice would be amazing!

I got married in August, 2017 and my wife was a full time student for spring and fall 2017. I recently filed our joint taxes. She made no notable I come for 2017, I made around $40k. 

I submitted my W-2 and her 1098 and our estimated return for state+fed was approx. $6500. I was thrilled but slightly concerned as that seemed a bit high. I ended up filing and we are now $6500 richer and prepping for a healthy savings account and possible investments.

My problem is this: we didn't pay for her school costs. It was a generous family friend. The 1098 from the school reported around $22k received and $15k in scholarships. I'm a little afraid I filed incorrectly and may end up owing the IRS most of my $6.5k back. 

Did I do anything wrong in filling with my available paperwork? If so, how would I go about fixing it?

personalfinance,Payoff student loan before car purchase or right after?,"Hello PF,

I have been diligently eliminating my student loan debt from $32k and am on track to knock out the current remaining $5700 before the end of the year. I am also wanting to get myself a new (pre-owned) vehicle around the same time. 

My current car is a 2004 Prius with 228,500 miles on it and I put approximately 20k on it per year. It's done me well, but I use my car in business and it's starting to show its age badly with a worn interior and accumulated scratches and I want to pickup something with less visible wear and tear (I'm liking Camry Hybrid or Avalon Hybrid). I'll be selling the Prius privately and using the money towards the new one.

I've seen many posts on here about paying off student loans causing your credit score to dip after they've been paid off. I'm concerned that doing so before I pick up a new car will affect the interest rate I'm able to get. I've never financed a car before and the only other credit accounts in my name are my mortgage (originated 2013) and 3 credit cards (paid off monthly). Current FICO per my American Express Statement is 814. 

Should I just hold off on paying off the entirety of my student loan until after I pick up the new car or just say screw it and eliminate the student loan first? I mean to still pay the thing down, but leave like $1000 left of it and hold that money aside until after I finance a new car, then knock it out immediately. Rate on the Student Loan is 3.86%. I do not have the money to do either now to be clear, I will have the money to do both by the end of the year. Maybe sooner, I make commission.",finance

personalfinance,I'm getting some sort of inheritance soon... and what now?,"Hey PF! I lurk here fairly frequently, and I really think that you guys can help me out with what I need to do going forward with some sort of inheritance that I'm getting.  

Background: My great aunt died a few weeks ago and when I was giving my condolences to her son, I found out that I am a major beneficiary in her will. I don't know how much money I am going to receive; but from what I was told by my uncle who knows a little about the will, he believes it to be a somewhat meaningful amount of money. I have no clue what that means and won't until... I guess I receive a check in the mail from the executor of her will?

So I guess, my first question is, how does all of this work? What are the timeframes on things? What kind of taxes will I need to pay on the inheritance come tax season next year? Do I need to be mindful of family doing shady shit and not giving me whatever was supposed to be apportioned to me (I don't want to think that way, but I see plenty of horror stories on here)? Basically, what the hell do I need to know about all of this? I have never inherited anything in my life. 

Second, if it is a substantial amount of money or even $1--in what order do I do things with it such as paying off debt, investing, etc. I don't have a vehicle, so potentially purchasing one could be monumental in my life so that I can stop relying on Uber; but I also have a large amount of money in collections that I am presently paying off as well as a private student loan and 8ish federal loans that I'm paying. I assume that I should try to pay the debt in full if possible and see what's left from there? 

My parents were terrible with finances and now my dad is dead and my mom is homeless. My uncle that is my father figure helps me out, but this is something that I think I need some outside perspective on, partially because my uncle doesn't know the extent of my debt. 

I have literally no idea what I'm doing and it seems like every time I've gotten my hands on a substantial amount of money (for whatever reason), the money is gone and I can't even account for how I've spent it... so with that being said, I'd like for that to *not* happen this time with whatever this inheritance may be, $1 or $100,000.

personalfinance,"First job, making $115K, but in lots of student loan debt ($165K), no savings, no retirement","First thanks for reading and for any advice you offer!

I'm 27 years old, grew up poor. I am just starting my first job in two months. I will be making $115K + 15% yearly bonus. This salary should be going up yearly as well (I imagine at least 10% raise). I live in a city in Midwest with a reasonable cost of living. 

My student loans are from undergrad (bachelors) and grad school (masters) and total ~$165K. I went and got my PhD afterwards but this was fully funded and I didn't go into any more debt (besides accruing a great deal of interest ~32K). During my PhD I was only earning ~$25K a year so it was difficult to do anything besides just spend that on living expenses. 

All my student loans are federal loans. Most are unsubsidized with interest rates ranging from 5.4-7.9%, and 3 subsidized (3.4%, 4.5%, 5.6%). 

Right now my loans are being deferred. I technically will not be graduating until December 2018 (or possibly even May 2019). I would like to start paying them down ASAP, with some money for fun, possibly saving for an engagement ring, etc.

First I would like to know if I should refinance my loans or is there a benefit to keeping these loans federal? 

I have no savings or retirement and would like to start working towards having an emergency fund and maximizing retirement. I think my company has a 401K match and I don't really know anything about opening up an IRA but am going to look into this as I start my job. I am going to learn more about these but honestly am very naive towards retirement right now (my parents didn't teach me much about saving moneys as they are broke jokes).

Also, I have a 2015 Toyota Corolla that has 20K miles on it and the lease is ending in August. The monthly lease payment is $195. I was thinking about switching to buy this car. It would be about $11,000 and I think I can afford a slightly higher payment (my guess is that it'd go up to like $300 a month). 

I'm in about $3,000 in credit card debt (0% APR first year, 16.24% APR after this year). 

It seems like my monthly take home after taxes will be ~$6600 (not including bonus). 

My current monthly budget is the following:

Bill|Amount
:--|:--
Rent|$550
Cell phone|$100
Groceries|$200
Doggie Daycare|$200
Dog Food|$50
Car Payment|$195 ($300 if I choose to buy)
Car Insurance|$65
Fuel|$60
Electricity|$30
Gas Utility|$50
Credit Cards|$300
Activities|$250
Friends Weddings Budget|$100
**TOTAL**|$2150

 So am I totally fucked? By my estimates I should have about $4450 a month to allocate to student loans, retirement and savings. Any tips on how I should balance this to get out of debt in a reasonable amount of time? I'd like to get married and maybe have a kid or two in the next 5 years.

personalfinance,I had a plan and was thrown these curveballs. Now I'm depressed and don't know what to do.,"I attended a private university for computer science. I graduated around $32K in debt last May. I made a plan to pay off my debt in three years max. Since then, I paid it down to $20K (also while buying a car). My salary is around $53K/year (it was $49K/year but I just got a raise) and I've been putting pretty much all my spare cash toward repaying my loans. These loans are all 5% interest or less.

A few weeks ago, my roommate got engaged and decided she wants to move out. That's fine, but I can't afford our $1200/month + utilities double by myself and don't think I will be able to find someone to fill her space in our apartment before the lease ends in May. Right now I pay $600 in rent, plus $100-120 in utilities. Single apartments in the area (nice town out of Cleveland) are around $1000/month + utilities, so I've already been stressing about the cost of living going up.

It gets worse.

A few days ago, my mom admitted financial hardship and told me I would have to take on the loan she took out my freshman year. They haven't paid anything on it and the interest has blown up. Presently, it's at $18.5K. Interest rate at 7.25%. My mom has been hiding this loan from my dad and claims she'll pay it when she has the money, but I know unless she starts shitting out money there is no way she'll just happen upon all that money to pay for it. Minimum payment is like $250.

I've become incredibly depressed the past few days and doing the math I'm not sure I can afford to make these new payments if my rent goes up as high as I'm anticipating it to. I can't move back home as it is too far away from work. I'm also just stressed in general because I really wanted to travel (I've never had the opportunity to in my life) and was considering trips in the next year or so with friends that now it'll be impossible for me to afford if I want to keep my life on track.

I'm not sure what to do. Is there a way I can get a better interest rate on these newly inherited loan? Still in my parents' name. 

I think I need to get a second job. Is this a bad idea, and will it hurt my taxes to have a part time job on top of a full-time job? I'm under the impression that my tax liability goes up when you get a second job so they take more tax out but I could be wrong, I know nothing about taxes. I'm hoping I can find a part-time job that can build my tech skills and diversify my resume so I'm not just selling my soul for money but actually getting something else out of it.

I'm just really lost as to how to handle this and incredibly depressed about it. I wouldn't have gone to the school I did if I knew this extra debt would fall on me. I've already had a hard time mentally accepting the debt I did start with and was only just beginning to accept it. I don't know what to do.",finance

personalfinance,Expecting a windfall. Where would you put it?,"Hi all. Long time lurker, fist time poster. 

I am 30 years old. I was an early employee at startup that started five years ago, and is now a real life, grown up company. 

When I was hired (and at a few points since) I was given stock options, and it appears that this year I will have the chance to sell a portion of said options to the tune of a $200-300k depending on a few moving numbers and the volume I elect to sell. I believe the company will continue to grow, and the bulk of my equity will be worth more in the future. But I also fear a major recession is coming which could kill much or all of that growth. Selling a portion now is in effect me taking some money off the table while it's still a sure thing. 

The shares I would be selling are ones I already exercised more than 12 months ago, so will be taxed as gains, not income (or at least that's my understanding). But regardless, it'd be at least an over $100k cash infusion this year.

The rest of my financial picture follows the playbook of this sub and other resources more or less (though I admittedly have less spendthrift habits than others). I have a $20k emergency fund in cash, a maxed out year-to-year Roth IRA, a 401k that I contribute to at the full employer match rate (though I did just learn on this sub like many of us that that's not the real max...), and a vanity Robinhood account worth about $8k. 

I have a house and a fixed mortgage sitting at 3.75% with about $400k left on the principal. Other than that, I do not carry any credit card or auto debt, and paid off the last my student loans a year ago (woo hoo!). For what it's worth, the house is in a desirable part of a major US city and I don't see values around here going down any time soon or at least not permanently. 

My wife and my big passion is travel which is where most of our excess income goes. But we travel very efficiently and and rent our house on Airbnb when we're not here so it ends up being less of a drain than it might be. 

Anyway, that's a lot of preamble, but apart from some not-so-humble bragging, my intent in posting this is to get some input on where I should park the money after the sale. I don't have any immediate major expenditures on my horizon apart from the possibility of having children in the next few years (we don't have any yet). 

I plan to keep working at this company for now, though could see myself needing to float without a job at some point in the future as I may seek out some individual projects or start my own company at some point.  My initial hunch was to pay down the mortgage, but at that interest rate, I'm also considering just indexing the whole assuming annual returns stay where they have been at least for now.   In light of potentially wanting to use that money to start a new business or live on at some point in the next few years, though, I worry about putting it into anything along the lines of a longer-term, retirement strategy.

Anyone ever been in a similar situation? I'm a little ignorant of planning here beyond just the Roth/Index basics, so any guidance would be much appreciated. thanks!

personalfinance,Is buying this house biting off more than we can chew?,"Hey PF! Just wanted to say thanks for all your wisdom, thanks to this sub, I was able to clear out all my CC debt and bring my credit up to 800 from the mid 500s!...but alas, I need some home buying advice so created a throwaway.

We live in a HCOL area and have been saving up as much as we can towards a down payment on a house over the years in order to reach the 20% down threshold to avoid PMI. Lately though it seems like were chasing our tails, as home prices keep rising so fast, our yearly savings cant keep up, and each year that passes, our purchasing power is actually decreasing. We are still renting as we watch our peers build equity all because we are saving for the 20% down payment. 

Now with interest rates on the rise again and a friend looking to sell their home (which we really like), we decided that maybe its time to actually take the plunge, but were a little hesitant because the mortgage seems so high. Here are the details. 

The home purchase price would be $575,000
Single Family Semi

Our financials
We have 83k saved up in our house fund account. 

We plan to put down 50k (~8.5%) , 15k in closing costs, and then leave ourselves 18k in the bank as a E fund/cushion.

We got pre qualified for a 4.7 30 year fixed mortgage.

The monthly mortgage plus insurance (1200 per year) and taxes (5200 per year) would come to $3,450.

We gross around $16,500 per month 
After taxes and 15% to retirement we net around $8,600

We have zero CC debt, and 1 auto loan with a 11k balance paying 239 per month. We also have an auto lease at 465 per month. No other debt.

Ive read some rules such as purchase price no more than 3x annual salary which we would be right around 3x, or no more than 28% gross income which would be 4620 for us per month, so were 1000+ less than that per month. Ive also read no more than 30% of net income, but in our area that seems next to impossible. Ive also read to base it off one earners income, but again in our area, that seems literally impossible.

But i cant help but feel like we really shouldnt be taking on this mortgage. Am I just being conservative? 

If it matters both of our jobs are extremely stable, and mine comes with a pension and health benefits for life. 

Sorry if the formatting of this post is bad or the post itself isnt appropriate here, just looking for some advice. Thanks in advance",finance
Bitcoin,Lesson - Why Bitcoin's fiat price is irrelevant?,"I've mentioned before that I'm an old hand when it comes to Bitcoin but while it was nice to see the surging 'interest' in Bitcoin towards the end of last year, I was keenly aware that Bitcoin's utility had not scaled in proportion and the price was driven solely by institutional interest.

Retail interest is manipulated by institutional disposition towards Bitcoin. They own the media. They own your psyche, your thoughts, your decisions.

'What do you mean by institutional disposition?', you ask? Nation states and their banks.

If you think fiat price matters, I only have one question. What is Bitcoin to you? If the answer is 'a speculative asset to print new bank money', you should get the hell out of here and head over to the stock market.

The world we live in today is not a far cry from feudalism, even in so-called democracies, however much we are brainwashed into believing the polite fiction that is force-fed to us.

Banks are our feudal lords, each nation-state a fiefdom and every common man a serf. They print money out of nothing, inflating the economy and we keep paying interest on nothing, all the while diminishing the purported value of the money we hold which was created from nothing.

Why does nothing have value at all? Because we endorse this paradigm. Borderless currency is bad news for this paradigm.

Now let me tell you what Bitcoin really is,

Bitcoin is a new economic paradigm, where, for the first time in the history of money, every man gets to live in a truly democratic society with economic autonomy.

Bitcoin is not an asset that has value in bank money. Bitcoin is here to destroy bank money. Bitcoin is the everyman's money.

Bitcoin's true value will be its own purchasing power. How will Bitcoin have purchasing power? The same way bank money obtained purchasing power.

We just need to endorse this brave new paradigm. 'We' does not include banks or nation states, but we, the people!

Bitcoin is ingenuity. Satoshi is to Economics what Darwin was Evolution and Galileo to Science.

Most of us are just too benighted and brainwashed to appreciate the power of Bitcoin.

What would happen if we all ditched the bank money they keep printing out of nothing at will and bought into Bitcoin?

Voila!",cryptocurrency
