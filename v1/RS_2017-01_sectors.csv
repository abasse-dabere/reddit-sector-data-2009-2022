personalfinance,How to navigate the IRS Federal Withholding Calculator?,"Hi PF,

I'm looking at the IRS Withholding calculator to figure out how much we over payed this year (and to figure out next year what we need to adjust so we aren't over paying). The problem is, I'm confused between two areas of the calculator that seem to be asking for the same information. I'm married filing jointly, and we itemize (we have mortgage interest and property taxes).

The part I'm hitting a snag with is one page there's a space to enter the amount of ""Adjustments"" to income, and then the next page wants you to list amounts for ""Deductions"". But they're seeminly asking for the same information (Adjustments gives examples such as ""student loan interest"" while Deductions has an area to simply enter ""interest paid""). We've got student loan interest ($2,500), mortgage interest ($14,091), and property taxes ($8,844) to take into account. I've tried entering the entire amount into Adjustments (suggests a refund of $7,723) versus putting the entire amount in the Deductions section (suggests a refund of $4,911). It's a big difference, and I'm just trying to figure out which one is correct. Any thoughts?",finance

personalfinance,Im nearly back in control but need some advice,"Hi all, I've been subscribed to this subreddit for a year and as a result I have managed to get alot of my finances into shape but not all. im looking for some tips really on how to improve.

So, I got divorced last year and the financial shock really pushed me into doing something about my financial situation.

I signed up to getpocketbook.com and after an initial incubation period I now use it daily. I met with a financial advisor who basically recommended that I buy a investment property in order to have something to claim against and reduce my taxes. I did that and now have rental income that covers the mortgage which is great and I have a lengthy list of tax claims that are tagged in PocketBook.

I am on a 150k salary and have only just got to the point where I can save. Last month I saved 4k so I am going to try to keep that up and get to 50k per year. Currently I leave the money in my offset account but I'm definately going to be refinancing both homes mortgages to the one bank in order to get some bigger savings on interest rates.

After that which will happen over the next two week I would like to open up a savings account. 

Questions, Are there any good investment strategies (short term and long term) for a saving account? I've read about also trying to gamify the savings. I think 1k per week is a solid amount and is near my limit so I wouldnt want to push that(yet). I havent seen many good strategies.

Thanks in advance!",finance
personalfinance,Vacation or no vacation?,"We've had some 3 day Disneyland tickets gifted to us this Christmas that are limited use for 2017 only.  We are currently concentrating heavily on paying off student loans; this leaves little room for anything outside of necessities - there isn't any extra fat to cut in the budget.  While I think it would be great for us to go - this would derail our current course and I'm thinking realistically we will end up spending 2k for this unplanned trip between 15 hours of one way travel, 4 nights of hotel stays and food.  Given how much we are putting toward debt (350 per  wk) we could easily just shift it to vacation savings for a couple months - but this feels like a bad idea and generally just irresponsible given our current circumstances.  We did plan to go eventually in the future (shooting to payoff the loans in less than three years) and the kids have not been to Disney before.

I'll admit I'm a bit of a Dave Ramsey listener (not exactly since I think paying higher interest rates first makes more sense) - so I'm fired up to get the debt behind us.  What do my fellow redditors think?

Here is the data:

Oregon resident - pretty low cost of living  
60k annual household salary (984 weekly take home after taxes/insurance)  
350 paid weekly toward student loans (minimum req is only 40 a month - IBR plan)  
52k in student loans  
15 yr fixed 1,200 monthly mortgage payment (140k owed; 172k value)  
No other debt (no cars/credit cards/etc)  
Practically no retirement savings (spouse and I are 32 years old)  
Family of 4 (children's ages 10 and 12)  

**EDIT:** I'm quite surprised by all the yes votes - I thought for sure I would find a fellow tightwad that would advise against the trip :).  My spouse/kids are certainly layering on the peer pressure/guilt trip and I'm either going against my gut financial feelings or disappointing all of them; a no win situation.  I feel like we are so far behind financially that it's a terrible idea, but I appreciate all the honest feedback and keep the comments coming!",finance

personalfinance,"[AUS] Saving, tax, budgeting - Clarification and questions!","Hi all, I just jumped on the budget train to hopefully 10k by 2018.

I started to construct a spreadsheet that will help me budget, very similar to the one in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5lcbve/for_those_interested_in_keeping_track_of_their/) thread - this thread actually prompted my interest.

For the past 6 hours I have been learning excel and learning about budgeting, snowball interest payments and avalanche payments, minimizing expenses and I am excited to tackle this challenge and improve myself further in regards to money.

I don't have any debt except a government assistance fund, that I need to look into paying off (they won't take it until I earn more than a certain amount, but I rather start paying it off when I am financially stable). I bought my car and motorcycle outright, paying **so** much insurance because I'm under 25. I don't have many expenses, 600 a month in rent.

I have no credit cards, and I have a savings account that I don't touch. since it was created, about half a year ago, I have been putting in 50 a month. I have increased this to 450 a month (+100 week) and I should see results soon.

With my next pay I plan on putting 1k into that savings account, it has an interest rate of 2.6%. I am thinking that if I have 2-3k in there, I can get $4-7 a month in interest. I am not sure if it's compound interest because from what I understand, if I have 1000 and after the first month I have ($2.16, 2.16% monthly) 1002.16 won't I get an additional amount the next month based on the 2.16 that I incurred over interest?

So far my budget sheet looks ok, so now to what I am really worried about:

####Tax:  
Tax in [Australia](https://www.ato.gov.au/rates/individual-income-tax-rates/) states that it will have x cents for each dollar, which is pretty much the % (32.5c for $1 is 32.5%). That is in addition to the standing tax.

The page states that 

    $3,572 plus 32.5c for each $1 over $37,000		

Does this mean I pay a flat amount of 3572 on the 37k? that doesn't make sense as it's only ~10%.  
From what I actually know, you pay x cents on the dollar for everything OVER the tax bracket, but it can't be cumulative because that would be over $1 (19c, 32.5c, 37c, 45c).

I appreciate all the help, and if you have any questions please ask away!",finance

We use Chase Bank for everything mostly because in college I worked for them and just never left. That and I'm in love with the Chase Sapphire Reserve and it's nice to have everything in a centralized location (checking, savings, mortgage and credit). 

Anyways, it'd be great to get a better interest rate on our savings than what chase can offer. I see Ally offers 1% on their savings. Two questions:

1. For those using Ally, how do you like them?

2. Any other banks out there who offer good interest rates that you would recommend?

personalfinance,Is my Chase Mortgage Broker Lying?,"Hey PF! I've been a long time lurker and I'm a first time home buyer.


I'm in negotiations with a small lender and Chase. Chase obviously has offered the best rates, but have also offered to waive the loan discount points (apparently to get the rate they offered me, they had to simulate that I bought points). In addition, they've offered to credit me back $2500 on closing costs. You may say.. ""this is great, what's the problem?"" Well, the mortgage broker says that he cannot show me the credit and waving the discount points on the cost worksheet because the current one in my preapproval is generated by the computer. He says I have to go through a formal application and lock my rate, which requires a $500 application (or deposit) that goes towards my closing costs. Within 24 hours of this application, I should see that the discount points were waived. Also, he said the credit won't be displayed anywhere, but he will detail it out to me by email. I questioned why he cannot show me and how I know he is telling me the truth. He responded that we have all of our conversations logged on email threads. I don't want to paint him in a negative light as he has been extremely responsive and patient with explanations.


Does this sound sketchy to you? Does he have to honor things said in an email?

edit 1: I have him detailing these offers out on email. Is that enough of a guarantee? Even if he writes it on a cost worksheet before I lock, he could be lying?

edit2: He also says there is a new concept known as a ""cure"". He said it is for the case that unexpected costs come up, the **lender** has to eat the cost.

edit3: These are some text messages we have exchanged.
Yes, I have 2 other lenders I am talking with. The small lender is offering a higher rate and much greater closing costs fees.  I trusted the lender from Chase up until about 2 days ago. Here are some of the text messages we have exchanged.

Me: Is the application fee the appraisal fee?

Him: The $500 is just a deposit that gets credited back to you at closing.

Me: Are there any other upfront costs I should be expecting?

Him: No, only the $500.

Me: If the rates and closing costs are not what I expect, do  lose the $500 deposit?

Him: Before you are charged the $500 you will have the rate and fees in writing.

Me: I will have the complete and accurate worksheet with the discount points waived as well? Before I am charged that is?

Him: You will have an updated rate lock agreement showing $0 Loan Discount Points, the interest rate and loan program prior to your card being charged. There are new rules in the mortgage industry that requires that a lender provide a cure (meaning the lender has to pay) for any fees above that wasn't initially disclosed.

personalfinance,"How to tackle student loans, about to be a Freshman in college","Hello r/personalfinanace

About a month ago I was accepted into my first choice college, Rochester Institute of Technology.

personalfinance,I raised my credit score by 73 points in 3 months and got myself out of debt thank to this subreddit,"I know I still have work to do but I wanted to share my small success story and some gratitude to this sub for helping me get my finances back on track. 

In late 2013 I was out of work for several months due to an illness, and just a few weeks after I returned to work my husband was laid off. I had a small emergency fund but medical bills and keeping the rent paid on time meant that I was left with some sizable amounts of debt, some of which went to collections. I ignored my credit through 2014 and 2015, since I honestly didn't know how to fix it. 

Then I found this subreddit. I read every post that seemed at all relevant to my situation, and read all of the amazing information provided here. Towards the end of 2016 I finally decided that I was ready to fix my situation and get back on track. 

In October I signed up for Credit Karma. My credit score was a dismal 590. I thought it was insurmountable, but I took it one step at a time. I treated it like a game -- every Sunday I would log on to CK (as well as several other score providers) to see how many points I ""earned"" that week. 

To start, I found a few old collections accounts that were either inaccurate or were being reported past my state's statute of limitations, and disputed them. To my surprise, the very next week every single one of them had been removed from my report. There is still one small $200 collection account on my report (one that wasn't disputed because I legitimately owe it), which I plan on tackling next. 

I now make a good salary but frequently found myself low on funds at the end of the month, due to poor budgeting. I signed up for Mint and monitored all of my spending to see where my money was going. I cut cable, stopped eating out so much, and cut some other unnecessary expenses. Coupled with taking on some extra side work on evenings and weekends when I could, I was able to put over $1,000 a month into savings, when previously I struggled to save even 1/10 of that. 

Next, I tackled my credit card debt. I started with about $2,800 in credit card debt, which isn't very much but my utilization was near 90%. Every extra dollar I had went to those two cards until they were paid off. I paid off the lowest balance first, since the interest rates were the same for both cards. Seeing that first $0 balance reported to my credit report was really nice. Once my utilization was under 50% I called CapitalOne and requested a credit line increase, which they provided, taking my utilization down to 31%. I continued paying down my debt aggressively and now have 0% utilization across both cards. It took about 6 weeks to pay these off due to my new aggressive budgeting strategy. 

Finally, I called my credit union (car loan) and asked them if they would be willing to remove any of the late payments that were reported during my unemployment, because it can't hurt to ask. To my surprise, they listened to me, saw that my payments had been current since I started working again, and removed 3 late payments from my report as a ""good will"" adjustment. I still have 3 late payments reported, but 3 is better than 6. 

Today when I logged in to Credit Karma my score was 663. All of my credit card debt is paid off, my car loan will be paid off in 3-4 months and I was able to replenish my emergency fund *and* start saving towards a down payment for a house. 

Seriously cannot thank this sub enough. I've never posted here before but I must have read every single post here over the past 3-4 months, and just wanted you to know that I'm grateful to those of you who take the time to answer questions and help people get their lives back on track. 

Happy New Year! 

**A small edit since this post got a little more attention than I anticipated! (Wow,  thanks everyone :))** 

First, I have gotten some PMs and comments assuming that this post was some sort of ad for CK, and I assure you it isn't (lol). Credit Karma was one of several score services I utilized, and I initially signed up since I saw it mentioned so frequently on this sub. I mentioned it by name simply because it was the service I used (&amp; continue to use) most frequently. I've also received some messages from people who, for some reason, don't believe that my post is true, and that was certainly unexpected. If the mods are amenable I would be happy to post screenshots with personal information redacted. The purpose of this post was to remind everyone that a series of seemingly small steps forward can make a bigger difference in a smaller amount of time than you might expect. 

I also appreciate the advice to check my ""real"" FICO score. I did that this morning and to my delight it was actually 667, so a couple points higher than my CK score :) 

I'm very humbled to hear that my story was inspirational to some of you, and wish everyone great success in the new year!",finance

economy,How Can China Establish an Economic “New Normal”?,"Author: Wu Jinglian, Baosteel Chair Professor of Economics, CEIBS

In recent years, many people have recognized that China’s old economic model – with high-speed but inefficient growth driven by large-scale capital investment -- is unsustainable. The Chinese economy must transition to an economic “new normal”.

The Transition Will Be Difficult

To begin we must ask, what characteristics should the economic “new normal” have? In China there are many different perspectives, but overall there is an agreement on two points: First, GDP growth should shift from high speed to middle-high speed, even middle speed; second, the economic model should shift from an extensive approach relying on increasing capital investment, to an intensive approach relying on innovation. 

We should recognize that the above two points are very different in nature. For the first point, slowing economic growth is already an unalterable fact. For the second point, increasing economic efficiency, and optimizing and transforming the economic model, this has yet to be realized, and indeed it will require tremendous effort to achieve. 

Thus we face a problem: if the economy’s structure is not improved but economic growth continues to slow, then many societal problems and inequalities that were previously covered-up by high economic growth will burst into the forefront. Additionally, if the economic structure is not improved, then China’s economic growth rate will drop too quickly, and this will exacerbate existing societal problems and inequalities. Simply put, a slowdown of economic growth without an improvement of economic structure, is not the economic “new normal” we want to see. On the other hand, if economic growth slows but we are able to achieve quality economic growth, able to improve China’s economic structure, able to increase production efficiency, then we can reduce problems created by slower economic growth, and can even provide more real benefits to the Chinese people despite slower economic growth. Therefore, efficiency-based middle-speed economic growth is the economic “new normal” we desire.   

The “Three Horses” Analytical Framework Is Misleading

There are different theoretical frameworks that can be used to analyze economic policy. Different frameworks lead to different conclusions. 
	
Starting from approximately 2009, for some mysterious reason, when analyzing the macroeconomic trends in China, the most popular framework has been based on the concept that economic growth is driven by consumption, investment, and net exports, the so-called “Three Horses” of aggregate demand. According to this theory, China’s economy lacks vigor because consumption, investment, and net exports, the “three horses” of aggregate demand are not strong enough. If we can just increase the aggregate demand, then growth will return to previous levels. 

I believe this analysis has severe flaws.  

First and foremost, it simply misuses the original framework. The “three horses” analysis is a mutation of Keynesian short-run economic framework. Keynesian theory holds that the strength of aggregate demand determines the scale of aggregate supply, therefore, the overall level of output is due to society’s overall demand -- comprised of consumption, investment, and net exports. However, even though this is Keynesian theory, he only used it to analyze short-term economic issues. To take this framework and use it to analyze a long-term economic development path is obviously a mistake. 

Second, the policy conclusions that have been reached based on this framework are problematic, because at the end of the day, the demand for consumption, investment, and net exports is determined by fundamental conditions of the economy, not by people’s desires. Taking imports and exports as an example, in the end their volumes depend on the state of the entire international economy. In the past China had high levels of net exports to developed countries. This was firstly because these countries with high levels of consumption, high levels of state-welfare, and low levels of savings, saw a large gap between savings and investment, and imports from developing countries came to fill this gap; and secondly because China was a very strong low-cost competitor, and thus took a relatively large slice of the pie for net imports into developed countries.          

After the 2008 financial crisis, many developed countries de-leveraged and increased their savings rate. According to the “twin gap” model of economics, when developed countries decrease the gap between their savings and investment, it becomes less likely for developing countries to achieve positive net exports. The US savings rate will have its ups and downs, but it is unlikely to return to ultra-low pre-2008 levels. Furthermore, as China’s labor costs rise, China’s low-cost advantage will diminish, and its share of the world export pie will fall. 

Increases in consumption do not happen according to people’s wishes and desires. For example, some people say that urbanization can increase consumption, because after farmers enter the city their consumption patterns change and consumption increases. Thus they say as long we increase the rate of urbanization, the demand for consumption will increase quickly. However, this argument confuses the demand for consumption with the desire for consumption. In economic analysis, demand refers to the buying power to demand something – you need money (income) to back up your demand. So to increase the consumption demand of rural laborers, we must first and foremost increase their income. And the primary way to increase their income is by improving production methods, and increasing efficiency. Although in theory the government could give them subsidies, this would be “the wool comes from the sheep’s back”, it will not bring real prosperity.

Overall, to use the “three horses” framework every time the economy slows down results in the same conclusions – implement stimulus measures, increase money supply, start more government investment projects. 

In 2009 China implemented 4 trillion RMB fiscal spending (for two years) and 10 trillion RMB new loans, driving the short-term economic growth rate to increase. But the overall result was high government debt, excess supply of money, and a lackluster stimulus effect, leaving us with burdens that must be remedied over many years to come. After 2012, China again used government investment measures to stimulate the economy, but the positive effects are less and less, while the negative side-effects become more and more. Many people began to realize that these methods are not good.

The Three Driving Forces of Economic Development

Researching more reliable methods to drive up long term economic growth, we find three key factors: 1) labor input; 2) capital input; 3) production efficiency. 

Where did the past 30 years of high speed economic growth in China come from?

Mainly it relied on large scale capital investment. However, there were also other factors. First, there was a huge amount of newly added labor power – this is the so-called “demographic dividend” pointed out by Professor Cai of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. Additionally there was another factor -- that is increasing production efficiency. China’s policy of reform and opening up greatly enhanced production efficiency. On one hand marketization reduced barriers between the cities and the countryside. Huge amounts of previously low-efficiency agricultural labor and agricultural land was transferred to cities. This sort of compositional change allowed these resources to be utilized much more efficiently. Additionally, opening up allowed China to bring in technology from overseas, quickly improving China’s production machinery, and closing the technical gap between China and developed countries at a rapid pace. In this way, after China’s reform and opening up, increasing production efficiency had a much greater contribution to economic growth than ever before.  

The problem now is that the above elements that helped to grow the Chinese economy and improve production efficiency are fading away, and some are already gone.   

First and foremost, newly added labor power’s contribution to economic growth is less and less. Professor Cai already pointed out in 2006 that according to research conducted in the past three years, the era of unlimited supply of surplus labor is ending in China. The “Lewis turning point” is already emerging. 

Furthermore, As China’s general level of technological advancement becomes relatively closer to the west, the adoption of foreign machinery and technology can no longer bring about large scale improvements in production efficiency. Professor Bai Chongen of Tsinghua University and other researchers have all reached the almost identical conclusion that starting from this century, this crucial element of improved production efficiency has begun to play less of a role in China’s economic growth, and that the future opportunity for growth in production efficiency is also diminishing. 

The basic principles of economics tell us that when potential growth from current resources and technology diminishes, and we still want to increase the short-term economic growth rate, then the only method is to implement stimulus measures. Through increasing access to credit we can “turn on the water” to the economy. But in the case of China, using stimulus measures over the long term can make the macro-economy vulnerable to the threat of bubbles and systemic risks. 

More specifically, after 2009 China has used stimulus measures multiple times, and their diminishing effectiveness is already becoming obvious. If for example we look at the 4 trillion RMB fiscal spending and 10 trillion RMB new loans in 2009, these measures were still able to bring the 2009 fourth quarter and 2010 first and second quarter GDP growth rate above 10%. However, the 2014 second quarter stimulus of 1 trillion RMB government investment only brought the growth rate from a 1st quarter growth rate of 7.4% to a second quarter growth rate of 7.5%, and by the third quarter the growth had fallen to 7.3%. The so-called “law of diminishing marginal returns” is clearly in effect

The above analysis makes it clear that the only road forward is to increase the so-called “Solow Residual”, that is the contribution of technological progress and increased efficiency towards economic growth. In other words, we need to optimize the economic structure, drive innovation, and realize a fundamental shift in the economic model from a resource-driven extensive approach to an efficiency-driven intensive approach. 

Institutional Transformation is the Foundation for Economic Transition

A new slogan or a new desire is not enough to realize a transformation of the economic growth model. From 1996 to 2000, the 9th five-year plan already pronounced this desire. However, in the majority of situations the implementation was not ideal. The root of the problem has essentially been the old economic and bureaucratic system, which has impeded attempts to change to a new model.

In 1995 when China set the 9th five-year plan, leaders for the first time expressed the need to transform the Chinese economy from a resource-driven extensive growth model to an efficiency-driven intensive growth model. In the resulting discussion, people summarized the lessons from the Soviet Union’s failed transformation attempt, and pointed out that systemic transformation is the foundation of a transformation in the economic growth model. Thus the 9th five-year plan stipulated that China must realize “two fundamental transformations”: first the economic growth model should change from relying on using resources extensively to relying on efficiency intensively, and second the economic system should shift from a planned economy to a market economy.  

Then from 1996 to 2000 during the time of the 9th five-year plan, because of the 3rd Plenary Session of the 14th Central Committee’s decision to fully push forward comprehensive market oriented reforms, there was definite progress in transforming the economic growth model.  
	
However, when we arrived to the 10th five-year plan for 2001-2005, with the increased speed of urbanization, which was originally a good thing, under the old system led government at all different levels to greatly increase their control over land and other important resources. The government in many places then directed a wave of investment into heavy industry. Because of the government’s improper allocation of resources, transformation of the economic growth model turned backwards. 

The 11th five-year plan summarized the lessons of the 10th five-year plan, and once again placed transforming the economic growth model as a priority. However, reforms were slow during the time of the 11th five-year plan, and although we set a very good plan, there was very little actual progress to report, and in 2010, the last year of the 11th five-year plan, the party central committee had no choice but to put forward the slogan “there is no time to delay the speeding up of economic transformation”. 

Adding up the above analysis, the policy we need to adopt for the present situation should ensure that we do not increase systemic risks, and instead place our focus on systemic reforms. Only by comprehensively deepening reforms can we establish a good social and economic system, optimize the economic structure, change the economic model, and ensure an economic “new normal” characterized by middle-speed economic growth supported by high efficiency. 

Reduce and Contain Risks

Currently it is difficult to ignore the many problems in China’s macro-economy, but overall risk is manageable. As long as we implement the correct measures, systemic risk can absolutely be avoided. I believe there are many policies that we can adopt, including the following:

First, put an end to investment in low return and even no return projects. These days it is popular for people to say that we do not need to consider the returns on basic infrastructure investment projects, because the infrastructure is there, at the end of the day someone will use it. This type of reasoning is completely divorced from economics. When considering a problem in economics, an essential pre-requisite is that resources are scarce and limited. Since resources are limited, doing one project means we cannot do another, and when we make investment we are making a choice. We should only do the most effective, most necessary projects. In this regard we need to take a lesson from Japan. In 1986 Japan faced the problem of weak domestic demand, and the government initiated large scale public infrastructure investment projects to drive up economic growth. But these were large scale useless investment projects. They only helped to form the basis of the great financial collapse that followed.  

Second, use the country’s capital resources to pay back the “possibly-owed” debts. The so-called “possibly-owed” debts refer to the type of debts that are not on the asset/liability balance sheet, but that eventually will have to be repaid. Currently an obvious one is the deficit in the social insurance funds. According to calculations, social insurance plans for retired workers are under-funded by several trillion RMB. If we address this issue earlier, we can not only reduce the burden of this responsibility, but we can also create better ownership structure of state assets. Regarding this point, the decisions of the 3rd plenary session of the 18th central committee clearly stipulated that a portion of China’s state-owned capital should be appropriated to replenish social insurance. This decision should be promptly implemented. 

Third, we must stop blood transfusions to Zombie companies. Currently there are some local governments that are using loans, subsidies, tax breaks, etc. in order to prolong the life of certain companies that cannot survive. These governments are not fulfilling their important role in society -- to reduce the difficulties of workers displaced by industrial changes. Rather they are wasting resources by supporting Zombie companies to continue wasting the society’s resources. This increases the accumulation of systemic financial risk, and does not benefit the society. Japanese government took similar failed actions after their financial crash, and again we should be reminded of this lesson.

Fourth, for company’s whose assets do not support their debt levels, begin bankruptcy liquidation or bankruptcy restructuring. In this way we reduce systemic risks and make some small bangs instead of one big bang. We want to avoid accumulating system risk that might result in a big crash. 

Fifth, end the current climate in which state-backed players feel assured of a government bailout; everyone should be held 100% responsible for their own debt, this would reduce moral hazard. 

Sixth, strive to revitalize dead assets. As a result of the previous period’s excessive investment and extensive approach of growth, “dead assets” have emerged across the country. For example the “under sunshine” (no use) development zone, and sprawling rows of “ghost cities”, etc. Although it will not be easy, we still need to strive to revitalize these assets, in order to reduce leverage on the balance sheet and reduce the possibility of a recession driven by unrecoverable asset backed debt. 

In addition to the above measures to plug up holes and reduce systemic risk, we should also flexibly adjust fiscal and monetary policies in the short term. 

The combination of these two responses will allow us to ensure a stable macro-economy and avoid the emergence of any system-wide crisis. It will give us more time to implement reforms, and with reforms bringing further development we can gradually re-enter a virtuous cycle. 

Place Reform as the Topmost Priority 

In academic circles there continues to be debate as to whether comprehensive reforms can fundamentally resolve the problems we face, and whether we should prioritize the implementation of reforms over economic growth.

In my view, reforms can resolve the problem, and not only is there theoretical proof for this, but also there is confirmation from practice and implementation carried out in recent years. 

Some economists believe that China should increase government investment in order to maintain a growth rate above 8% because this will ensure a high rate of employment. A high rate of employment is certainly crucial. However, to look at the relationship between the GDP growth rate and employment rate as purely linear, and say that GDP growth must remain high in order to ensure high employment, this perspective is by no means a fixed principle. Because growth has a structural dimension, so when some industries grow 1% their employment grows by more than 1%, but when other industries grow 1% their employment barely grows at all. China’s previous growth model based on capital intensive companies with high levels of investment actually did not employ as many people as typical service companies would. So along with changes in industry composition, under the same level of GDP growth, the employment levels can be very different. Our situation over the past three years has demonstrated this very clearly. In recent years our country’s economic growth has descended step by step, but the employment rate has actually improved. To provide an example -- China’s economic growth rate has gone from 10.4% in 2010 to 7.7% in 2013, but the employment situation in 2013, and in particular the employment rate for low-skilled labor, has actually improved. According to reports from China’s National Bureau of Statistics, the original plans for 2013 called for towns and cities to grow 9 million new jobs, and in reality 13.1 million new jobs were created. In the 3rd quarter of 2014, economic growth descended another step, but the employment situation was even slightly better than in 2013. The actual situation that has played out in the past few years may not be as rosy as the statistics reported by the Bureau, but we should not doubt that overall employment situation is on a good trajectory.

Why is this happening? Mainly it is because the service industry is developing faster.

Previously, slow development of the service sector created a bottle neck for China’s overall economic growth. Our countries 11th five-year plan summarized the experience from the 10th five-year plan, and established that we must make transformation of the economic model a priority. Increased efficiency is the core of this transformation. My book, Decision Time for China’s Growth Model, discusses four key ways to increase efficiency: 

First is to turn farmers into city dwellers, educate them and make them skilled laborers. Second is to begin providing services at the two elongated ends of the production chain’s “smile curve”. Third is to develop the service sector, particularly manufacturing related services. Fourth is to use modern information technology to transform the economy; and the essence or main component of the IT industry is providing services. In summary one could say that one key point about transforming the economic growth model and increasing efficiency is to develop the service sector.

Unfortunately, the 11th five-year plan did not do this. Some regions made small progress, but some regions even regressed backwards. However, in the recent two years there has been a large change, and the service sector has begun to develop at a noticeably faster rate. Previously the manufacturing sector was always clearly leading growth, and until 2012 the service sector struggled to keep up. But in 2013 the service sector’s growth rate has increased, and it exceeded the industrial sector to become China’s largest sector.

Why is it that past governments repeatedly called for development of the service sector with little result, but in the last two years its development has suddenly improved? The reason is two reforms implemented before and after the 18th People’s Congress that have greatly advanced the service sector’s development.

The first reform started in 2012 in Shanghai, and was quickly implemented throughout the whole country -- the sales tax was replaced by a value added tax. The ministry of finance officially stated that this reform was in order to reduce the overall tax burden on companies. Currently Chinese company’s tax burden is very heavy, and indeed should be reduced, but this was not the main purpose of the reform. The reason economists proposed this reform is because they believe in Adam Smith’s principle that the division of labor is the best driver of economic growth. Because China’s sales tax double-taxed income when it was levied on total sales of companies, Rather than their value added, this created disincentives to division of labor. The value added tax only taxes the additional value added by a company, so it does not have this double taxation problem. In this way the reform benefited further deepening of the division of labor. In the service sector, for example E-commerce related services, growth in recent years became noticeably better.

The second reform started in 2012 in Guangdong, where the local government transformed its function in the critical area of corporate formation/registration, in order to make starting a company more convenient. After implementing this reform, some districts saw huge increases in new company registration. 

Currently employment statistics show one problem area, that is, recent college graduates and even recent masters-degree graduates are difficult to find jobs. Some of them end up with salaries even lower than a housekeeper. This is related to the inability of our economy to make a transformation of its economic growth model. It demonstrates that there are still issues regarding the employment situation that need to be addressed. However, overall employment levels are quite good

The above two reforms are simply a prelude to the overall deepening of reform that is needed. Although these two small reforms cannot comprehensively resolve all the distortions in our economic structure, resolve the problem of low efficiency etc, but they display a master’s finesse in making small strokes that result in large effects. They make me feel certain that the Party Central Committee’s reform strategy, when fully implemented, can resolve the problems we are facing while establishing the necessary conditions for a well-functioning system.  

Systematically and Resolutely Implement Reforms

Last year many reforms were systematically pushed forward. For example, one critical reform in the financial sector -- interest rate liberalization and exchange rate liberalization, the progress in these areas was even faster they predicted. Financial reforms are gradually being implemented. Reforms in the function of government, simplifying government and reducing bureaucracy, took their first successful steps forward. We need to make certain that these reforms are not rolled back and instead are deepened even further. Through “negative lists” regulating market entry for companies, and positive lists stating the role and rights of government, we can clarify the proper role of the government and the market in our system.

Additionally, reforms in some areas need be made even faster. 

First and the foremost, reform for parts of the economy controlled by the state should be implemented faster. This reform is crucial, but its progress is too slow. In order to resolve low efficiency problems in state-owned enterprises, the 3rd Plenary Session of the 18th Central Committee made many resolutions, and now we need to urgently implement these resolutions. 

One important reform was the creation of the Shanghai Free Trade Zone. However some people, according to past ways of thinking, took the free trade zone as simply establishing some favorable business incentives. This is a misunderstanding of the purpose of the Free Trade Zone. President Xi Jinping stated that the main purpose of the Shanghai Free Trade Zone was to act as a mechanism for institutional innovation, to “make trade and investment more convenient”, “bring about marketization, internationalization, and a market environment with an excellent legal system and governance.” Expanding the experience gained from the Shanghai Free Trade Zone into other districts will not only help to form a more open economy with a better legal system, but also will help to unite the whole country establish a more open, competitive, and market-oriented system. 

Privately-owned businesses are the main power behind the transformation of our economic model. However, currently many business owners lack confidence and positive energy, and this is something that must be noted. We should draw on the experiences of the steps taken at the time of the 1998 Asian Financial Crisis to support private businesses. We should arrange a team to do thorough research and analysis, and put forward a comprehensive plan to address private sector confidence.    

Efficient functioning of the modern market economy is inseparably linked to government’s establishment of a good market environment and government’s proper provision of services. Currently with the high pressure against corruption, government officials no longer do a lot of improper things. However, some government officials no longer do anything at all. Previously, the secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, Mr. Wang Qishan, said that the policy is to first treat the symptoms then the root cause, because treating the symptoms buys time for treat the root cause. I believe that with the high levels of anti-corruption pressure already established, we should increase the strength of combating corruption in its institutional root and “put power in a cage of law”. At the same time we should do what Premier Li Keqiang said, establish a principle that “in areas where government officials are no not given power by the law, they cannot exercise power in these areas”, and speed up the process of establishing a positive list for the functions of government officials to ensure they exercise their power according to law.

The Chinese Communist Party Central Committee’s “Decision on Important Issues in Comprehensively Deepening Reforms” is already past its 2nd anniversary. Although our country’s economy faces some difficulties and pressures, as long as we correctly analyze the problems, mitigate and control risks, put the implementation of reform as our priority, and systematically and resolutely implement reforms, we will definitely be able to overcome these difficulties, create high-quality economic growth, optimize the structure of the economy, increase efficiency, and establish an economic “new normal”.",finance
personalfinance,Unsecured personal loan's affect on credit score?,"I recently got a loan from SoFi to consolidate my credit card debt. My credit score is pretty low (~640 FICO, 577 CK) due to having too many cards with high balances. SoFi gave me enough to cover all of my cards. It's a pretty high interest rate (14.49%... the max they offer I think) but it's still lower than most of the cards. I suppose there's nothing stopping me from refinancing later, too.

All that being said, does anybody know what kind of effect this will have on my score? CK estimates that paying off all my credit cards will result in a jump to 753... almost 200 points. They also estimate that taking out a loan in that amount (we're talking almost $30k here) will not affect my score at all. They won't give you an estimate of your score change based on more than one factor, though, so I'm curious. Now that I've taken that money and paid off all my cards in full, I will show $0 in debt on revolving accounts.

I had a loan officer give me an estimate as far as what would match our rent, including taking out a CT first time home-buyer down payment assistance loan, PMI, insurance, etc, i.e. worst case, and it turns out to be roughly $113,000 for this areas taxes.  Believe it or not, this is doable to get a livable house (certainly not our ideal, but whoever gets their ideal in a house.  What I mean is move-in ready, but dated).

Couple that with I am very handy and DIY (we built our house growing up when I was in high school, I do all my own work on my cars, etc.)  My stepfather is a contractor by trade, so are two of my uncles, and I have another uncle who is a plumber.  Couple that with I also have a lot of ""know a guy"" friends who would help me out with anything as I would for them.

Recap: With what we *actually* pay on our cards, I am putting about $900/month into savings minimum.  My lease is up in June, so I am expecting a savings of, I don't know, about $10,000.

Do you think this is possible?  I mean, what if we get a house that is $200/month than my rent, then throw in $100 more for utility increase.  Does $300 a month seem doable?

Thank you so much.  We just started using PearBudget to get my CC debt down.  We are so excited!",finance
ethereum,"Staking Economics – Targeted Inflation, Variable Participation","An early consensus seems to be developing around a mechanism for setting interest rates in Casper.
 
A targeted inflation rate determined by the community, combined with a variable percentage of total ETH supply at stake would create a floating interest rate.  This rate would allocate resources between network security and competing investments such as ICOs.  

[This chart](http://imgur.com/a/hHjkS) of a hypothetical 0.75% inflation rate shows how the return on staking rises exponentially as staking participation falls.  This is a critical design element that will ensure enough stakers are present at any given time.  Conversely, the staking rate falls quickly if too much of ETH supply is participating.  This design feature will prevent too much ETH being tied up in the staking process, thereby freeing up capital to be invested in Ethereum’s burgeoning ecosystem. 

The optimal inflation rate is likely to change over time in relation to ETH’s market cap and other factors.  Perhaps The Foundation could propose the inaugural inflation rate.  The community can take over this task as voting systems and futarchy improve.  
 
Does the community feel there is a better rate setting mechanism being discussed?

personalfinance,"Alright PF, I need to pay of my student loans. Can you help me plan it out?","I just graduated college and I am fortunate enough to have a good paying job right out of school.

The 4.5 years of school has cost me 54,817.

I have 2 loans, one private and one through the government. The private loan is pretty high at 8% with 25,208 on it. And the rest is through the government with 4% interest. 

 I am hoping to consolidate through my credit union with a lower interest rate. What guidance can you give me on consolidating and what resources will give me the best interest rate? Also what type of loan would I take out to consolidate these?

My job will be paying 65k before taxes and I think I will be taxed at roughly 25 based on previous tax calculations. I am hoping to use 50% of my income to pay off loans.

I have a decent credit score at 757 so I'm not sure what kind of interest rate that will get me. 

In assets I have about 15k.

My personal expenses are: 378 for rent, which is going to go up in June. About $300 in groceries, $200 bills, and $200 for entertainment/leisure. I am also hoping to open a Roth IRA that I can max out at $5500 a year.

personalfinance,(US) I need a private loan for college. Is it a good idea to take a variable interest rate loan (~8%) if the fixed interest rate loan is too high (~11%)?,"To make a long story short I'm transferring back to the university that I dropped out of. I messed up really bad when I attended this college four years ago. I went to a community college with a different major (from liberal arts to electrical engineering) and transferred back with a great GPA. 

The university agreed to wipe the slate clean on the condition that  I need to take out a loan for the first semester (this past fall semester).
I did great for my first semester here and will most likely get the spring semester through financial aid. But now I'm trying to get a private loan to pay for the fall semester so I can register for the spring and I'm having a hard time getting a loan because the fraternity that I was in (four years ago was full of terrible decisions) sent me to collections and destroyed my credit. 

Even with my sister as a cosigner my fixed rate for a 10K loan was ~11% vs a variable rate loan which is about ~8% 
I need to make a decision soon and I'm leaning toward the variable loan. Is this a smart idea. 

If it helps, I'll be graduating in a year and a half.

Thanks, for all your help.",finance
personalfinance,Student loan struggle,"Hello reddit! Hoping for some good advice.

My current dilemma is my student loans. When I went off to college, my parents could not afford to send me, and none of us knew anything about student loans. They took out a parent plus loan every year for about 24k for 3 years. I also was provided about 3k from the government (under my name) in total, I have about 100k in loans to pay off. Here's the struggle. The parent plus loan is under my parents name. It's a pretty high interest rate, 8% or so, and the payments are close to $900 a month, and my government loan is $250. I am currently stuck in this situation because my parents say there really isn't anything they can do to lower the payments. I can't move out because I can't afford rent and bills and groceries on top of these payments. I only make about 2k a month tops. Is there anything I can do to fix this situation and make my monthly payments lower?

personalfinance,Should I buy a house or pay off student loans?,"Hey! New to here and wanted advise. 

Quick backstory:
I make good money and am recently married. My wife has a good amount of student loans. These loans are all around 8% interest rates (sucks I know). 

Currently, we have enough money to pay off these loans or to put a down payment on a house. I am starting to think I want to consolidate the student loans at a lower rate and then purchase a home. My reasoning is that we are wasting $2100 on rent each month. I would prefer to get a house so that those payments can go towards a mortgage instead. Some quick numbers below in case that helps 

1. Student loans are around $85k ($34k is federal)
2. Currently have around $100k
3. Down payment on a house here is roughly $75k

If we were to consolidate the loans, who do I use to do that? Also, I run my own company. Is there any way to pay these off through my company?  I also am hesitant to pay off the loans in full because there may be some tax benefits to having loans in the future. We make a decent amount of money so I doubt we qualify for any loan forgiveness plans out there.

personalfinance,Question regarding student finance or how to optimally delegate finite resources,"Okay so here goes.
Norwegian redditor here, currently im pre med. I have a total of seven semesters, or three and a half years, left to study before i get my degree in clinical nutrition. 

I am qualified for student loans from the governement for a total of 5 more semesters or 2,5 years. 
Two semesters of loan equates to approximately 100.000 NOK or $11.600, with part sums being paid out  each months for 10 months per year. (5 months per semester, july and august not covered)
40%of the loan is available for conversion into a stipend if i pass my exams, and the floating interest rate is at 1,8%. Interest is not applied as long as the loan is being paid out. 


Either way i split it, i will have to spent 2 semesters with zero governement funding.
The question is - how to adress this optimally? 
I could opt out of loans all together, but with school getting harder not having to work 75 hours a month to get by would be real nice. 


I work part time outside school, raking in anywhere from 1-2k USD a month after tax, depending on what shifts are available. 

Current monthly expenses being rent, bus pass and cellphone plan totals $630, living in student housing for the forseeable future, so not possible to reduce rent cost.

Bitcoin,"For the newbies: You may have heard that Bitcoin works by ""solving math problems"", but what are the math problems?","*Disclaimer*: This has probably been covered before, and in more approachable language, so if this explanation is pointless duplication, let me know and I'll delete it.

--------------

So the math problems in Bitcoin aren't your traditional math: your computer isn't solving algebra problems or partial differentials. They involve cryptographic hashes: you might've come across these when you download a file, where the website says ""here's the file, and here's a hash you can use to verify that the file downloaded properly"". So your process of verification would be:

    Download -&gt; Hash(Downloaded File) -&gt; Is Hash The Same?

Say you downloaded a copy of Audacity for OSX, and the site says ""the MD5 hash for `audacity-macosx-ub-2.1.2.dmg` is `535e103d9bc4a4625d71260c3a427d09` if you want to check it downloaded properly"". So you download the file, head to your command prompt, and:

    $ md5 audacity-macosx-ub-2.1.2.dmg
    MD5 (audacity-macosx-ub-2.1.2.dmg) = 535e103d9bc4a4625d71260c3a427d09

Hey, it's the same.

Now, hashes work by taking all the numbers in the file and Doing Something to them; the simplest would, of course, be the checksum: add all the numbers together. One big problem with checksumming though: if you add 1 to a number somewhere in the file, and subtract 1 elsewhere, you get a corrupted file with the same checksum. Not ideal.

So algorithms like MD5, SHA-1 and the like arose, which do more complicated things. The number that falls out of these is quite large: MD5, for example, outputs a 128-bit number (the biggest value is something like 80 quintillion quintillion) but it's not the absolute value of the number that's important, just the fact that it's the same as what the website says it should be.

---------

*Aside*: ""But if the hash is just a huge number, why does it have those weird letters in?""

It's just written in hexadecimal (base 16) instead of base 10. In your average decimal base-10 number, the digits are 0-9 and the number values go units, tens, hundreds, thousands, etc.

In base 16, the digits are 0-9 then a-f (ten to fifteen), and the number values go units, sixteens, two-hundred-and-fifty-sixes, four-thousand-and-ninety-sixes, etc.

----------

Now. Bitcoin uses this same technology (it uses the SHA-256 algorithm in particular) to hash the contents of each block of transactions that comes through. It looks a little like this:

    Hash of the last block  -----\
                                 |
    Hash of the transactions   --+--&gt; SHA256 -&gt; This block's hash
    in this block                |    (twice)
                                 |
    Current time       ----------/

And thus the block chain gets built: ""this block's hash"" falls out of the above algorithm, and gets fed into the algorithm for the next block.

Except SHA-256 doesn't take long to compute; a cellphone can do literally millions of these hashes per second. Here's where the genius of Bitcoin comes in: there's an artificial limit placed by the algorithm on how fast blocks can be generated, and it doesn't matter how fast your computer (or the whole network of computers) is at generating these hashes. It works by adding one thing to the above diagram:


    Hash of the last block  -----\
                                 |
    Hash of the transactions   --+--&gt; SHA256 -&gt; This block's hash
    in this block                |    (twice)
                                 |

(The technical literature actually calls it a ""nonce"".)

I said above that the numeric value of the hash isn't important when you download a file, just the fact that it matches what the website says it should be. In Bitcoin, the numeric value of the hash *is* important: it needs to be *less than* a certain value (the ""target"") for the block you make to be accepted by the network. For example, (as of the time of writing) the last block had a hash of ` 000000000000000001ef62f299ea93356f4d52c75ff3cc442b4a073e90f947e0`; look at all those zeros at the front!

SHA-256 is very good at making an even distribution of its numeric value: futz with the content of what you're hashing even a tiny bit, and the number that falls out is vastly different. So, you need to do a *lot* of twiddling of that nonce, to find a block where the hash comes out with all those zeros at the front.

In fact, you need to do so much twiddling that, on average, the entire network of computers doing this will only find one solution to the problem every ten minutes. That solution gets broadcast to the network, the other computers will plug it in as ""the hash of the last block"", and keep going.

-------

One more question you might have: what happens when computers suddenly get a lot faster at doing these calculations, and they can rattle their way to a solution in a minute, or 30 seconds?

Bitcoin has a solution: change the target, to make it even lower. This is referred to as a ""change in difficulty"", and happens around every two weeks if the blocks come out every ten minutes (every 2,016 blocks). If the blocks come out faster, the difficulty changes sooner, and changes by more, to get things back on the ten-minutes-per-block track.

Conversely, if computers suddenly get very slow at doing this work and blocks only come out once an hour, the difficulty will change to make life easier. (Again, it'll only change every 2,016 blocks, so it might take a while to build the chain up to that point; until then, we'd have to suffer with slow blocks.)

-------

So, I hope this was useful, and that it was accurate. It helped to clarify things in my mind, at least; let me know if it helped (and if I missed anything).",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,"Refinancing credit card debt with a personal loan, need some advice!","I have amassed $6,250 (~80% of total credit line) in credit card debt spread throughout my three cards. I have recently began my career after graduating last May and I'm making a decent income.

I want to improve my financial stability and increase my credit score. I have looked at various options for paying off my credit debt and decided taking out a personal loan could be the best choice.

All of my cards have around a 23% APR, being that I got them while still in college with a low income. I also just have a credit score of 690 at the moment.

I have been pre-approved for a loan through SoFi at a 9.9% interest rate. This sounds very appealing vs. the 23% APR on my cards.

personalfinance,22 years old - Making ~75k/yr and soon to be a lot more. Seeking general advice and insight on my retirement plan.,"Sorry for how long and probably boring this turned out. And I apologize for any formatting issues since I just typed this all up on my phone on my lunch break. And I don't have anyone in my personal life who I can ask for financial advice. Big shout out to everyone in this community, I owe you guys a lot.




So here's the deal. About 9 months ago I landed a killer apprenticeship with outstanding pay and benefits (considering I didn't go to college) but the retirement plan here seems to be different than everything I've read on here.

As an apprentice here, I'm making $22/hour, and another $9/hour which is directly put into a annuity account - and after I'm vested in 4 years my pension pay will also start which will be an additional  $5/hour into a pension account. Not to mention I don't pay a dime for my very good health care and dental since it's all negotiated in the contract between the company I work for and my local.

Also, since I work a weird schedule  (Friday-Tuesday) every Sunday for me is called a ""premium day"" so essentially it's overtime built right into my 40 hour work week that isn't costing me anyting. Additionally, the annuity pay also scales 1.5x for all premium/overtime I work; and also for all holidays I work is 2.5x and it is also proportionate for that. As if this isn't confusing enough, as an apprentice I have full control of how much overtime I work and can take on as much as I want and it's written off as ""training.""

And in addition to that, once I hit the one year mark at my position I will be getting a promotion &amp; raise up to $40/hour and all of my other benefits will stay the same. 

Now here are my real concerns:

1. Does anyone have any insight or experience with these kinds of retirement funds in my situation?

2. I plan to fully fund a 2016 IRA account before the April 15th(?) cutoff but I'm not sure if I'll go with traditional or Roth since I see the benefits to both. Is there any reason why I can't have a traditional and a Roth? Since my company doesn't really have a 401k type plan since we have the annuity &amp; pension I want to make sure I have a nice nest egg to retire with.

3. I recently closed a condo on the cheaper side at ~150k to avoid high rent costs in my area and to at least build some equity. My interest rate is a 30yr fixed rate at 3.229% but after my promotion I plan to pay it off as if it were a 15yr as well as make additional payments with extra money laying around. Is this a good plan financially for someone my age if I can manage it? 

4. (Last one, promise.) Due to me recently buying this condo I did have to use a big chunk of my savings. So now I have just around 9k in liquid cash in between my checking and savings accounts. Would it be unwise to take $5,500 of that to fully fund my Roth or tradional IRA before I hit the deadline in April? 

Also keep in mind that I have no other debt besides my mortgage loan and my payment is ~$1100/month which is also including the $195/month HOA fee. 

So all in all my monthly expenses average out to about $1800-$2100 depending on the month according to Mint. But with the occasional impulse buy or splurge purchase sometimes pushing more than that $2100 a month but I'm trying very hard to be more vigilant on excess spending.

I can add a more in depth breakdown of the current state of all my accounts if it's needed later on.

personalfinance,Question regarding student loan plan and savings.,"Hello PF,

I am 24 years old and looking for information on how to best tackle my student loan debt. I've already visited r/studentloans, but the advice given by this community seems more comprehensive and helpful.

I graduated in May 2016 with a Master's degree. In total, I owe about $26k spread across 7 different loans (Stafford loans, some subsidized and some unsubsidized), all with different interest rates. I started my career in September and I bring home about $4,000 per month after taxes.

Here is a summary of my income, loans, and other financial obligations:

=====================================

Income: $4,000 per month after taxes

Current balance on loan #1: $2,959 (4.50% interest)

loan #2: $4,500 (3.40%)

loan #3: $2,683 (6.80%)

loan #4: $5,565 (3.40%)

loan #5: $2,546 (6.80%)

loan #6: $5,574 (3.86%)

loan #7: $2,237 (3.86%)

Car payment: $273 per month for 5 years

Car insurance: $250 per month (not paying this yet, but will be soon).

Gym membership: $20 per month

=====================================

Since I started my career in September, I've focused on saving most of my paycheck while paying off my credit card and car payments monthly. I still live at home, so I do not pay rent and I pay a small amount for my own groceries. 

My first loan payment (on all loans) is due in March 2017, but I'd like to start paying now. What is the best way to go about paying each of these loans? Each individual loan has a first payment due date of March 2017, so do I need to make 7 different payments per month? I've looked into loan consolidation, but I'm not sure if it would be of any benefit, besides sheer convenience.

Sorry if the formatting came out badly, this is my first time posting here. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much in advance, and happy new year!

btc,Proof that core are trying to be central planners is that they will not commit to a hard date for an increase. Why? Because they are trying to react to market forces and they don't know in advance what they will be yet.,In other words the Federal reserve doesn't tell us what the interest rate will be 5 years from now because it is too far for them to predict since what they are trying to do is to centrally manage an economic system through central planning and react to it accordingly. In the same way blockstream won't commit to an actual date for a actual modest increase in block size for the same reason... because they are trying to convince everyone that bitcoin needs central planning. Think of how incredibly easy a fork would be that satoshi recommended in that forum post a long time ago where you simply start coding into the client in advance the increase that will activate at a later date. Think of how low risk and simple that is and yet they can't do it because they won't commit to an actual number or date since they desire to be central planners.,cryptocurrency

personalfinance,(UK) I've received notice that my student loan is almost paid off and that I need to take action in order to avoid overpaying. Advice needed.,"I was studying between 2005 and 2009    
  
According to the letter I had an outstanding balance of ~£3,300 at the beginning of this financial year.    
  
I currently pay ~£240 per month ~~which is deducted from my gross pay before tax~~. According to the letter, If I continue to pay in this way I will pay back more than I owe. I gather this is because HMRC only sends my payments to the student loans company at the end of each year.  
  
My concerns are:  
  
1. If I continue to pay via deductions from my salary and I overpay, is it a simple process to reclaim my over-payments?   
  
 
~~2. If I choose to pay via direct-debit, I will be paying tax at 40% on the £240 before it is sent to the student loans company. Is it a simple process to have this tax refunded?~~    
  

3. The second option is to pay off the loan in full now. I can afford to do this but it seems I'd be better off earning interest on these savings. I'll have to compare the interest rates of the student loan and my savings account but I don't have that information right now.

personalfinance,I submit to you for review,"So it's a new year and I've just returned to work with the new year comes a new pay raise and a chance for me to evaluate my savings plans and plan of attack for my credit cards. I submit to you now for criticisms and tips my revised plan.

First off the debt.
1.$4300 bank of America credit card. Minimum payment is $95 interest rate is 14.74%
 2. $5027 line of credit from santander. 5 year term. Current minimum payment is about $120 at 11.74% interest rate. The LOC is structured to be payed off in 60months.

Savings plan. 
 Currently I have to make sure I save $1500 by mid June. My job shuts down for about a month and after being payed out vacation and sick time. It's not usually enough to keep me afloat in the summer. So the 1500 is a serious boon on keeping me more than afloat.
I currently save $400 per month. For paying my cards. I've been using the avalanche method and been paying more on my BoA credit card, Anywhere from $150 to $200 per month, while I make minimums on the line of credit.

The new plan.

My new plan is to shift my focus from the card with the higher interest rate, and attack the line of credit instead since it has a lower interest rate. When I pay it off I would be able to use the LOC to pay off the BoA card. My plan to do this is. Spend the next two months without a savings account and use the 800 I would save to make payments on the LOC combined with this year's tax return at roughly 1000 plus the added money from my raise which would be $50 dollars per week. I calculate that I would be able to pay back $3000 by may. Then after the summer when I return to work. I can finish paying the LOC by November. I may even be able to speed the process up by selling some of my belongings.

personalfinance,"Help a foreigner get his head round 401(k), IRA and tax returns","I'm a European national that is considering a relocation offer to the United States, so I've never worked there before or had to submit any sort of tax return in the pass.

I know I'll need to speak to some sort of accountant when I do submit my first tax return, but I've been trying to get my head around how pensions and retirement savings work in the United States.

I've had a look around on the internet and done some reading, and I think I've got an idea how it all works but would appreciate if anyone can point out any holes in my logic or anything that I am missing.

Assume that I would be receiving a salary of $120,000.

From what I understand I can contribute to a 401(k) or an IRA from my gross income before tax, with the current personal contribution limits being $18,000 for a 401(k) and $5,500 for an IRA.

If I wanted to spread that out from each salary payment, I would want to contribute $1,500 and $458 each month, with both payments coming off before tax.

If my employer offers a 401(k) match of 3%, they would then top that up with an additional $3,600 to give me a total contribution of $21,600 for the year.

When it comes to the time to submit a tax return, do I then take a look at my gross income and reduce it by my total personal retirement contributions of $23,500, giving me an Adjusted Gross Income of $96,500.

That's then the figure that is used to work out my federal and state income taxes, with any excess withholding throughout the year then being returned back to my by the IRS?

Does this all look correct?

Should my employer try and set my withholding as low as possible so that I don't over pay throughout the year?

Are there any other techniques or anything else that I can do to reduce the amount of tax that I would need to pay?

I did some reading about relocation expenses being tax deductible, but I'm not sure what would constitute a valid relocation expense as my employer would be coving most of these for me. If I had to pay out of pocket to cover my cell phone or satellite TV subscriptions early due to the move, would I be able to claim those fees as expenses?

personalfinance,Issues with the dealership.,"Hi there! So I will get right to the point: I am having issues with the dealership that I just purchased a new car from. 


Background:

I recently went home for the holidays (parents live in South Carolina, I live in Virginia) and on my way home my cars check engine light came on. It had a history in the past of when this light came on the car would just shut off completely in about 5 min or so. So needless to say my parents and I both agreed that driving it anymore would be ill advised (the car was theirs to begin with). I therefore began shopping for cars with them while at home. I found a few I was interested in and ultimately bought a car with one new car dealership. I had a horrible time dealing with them in terms of finance and ultimately had 7 hours of my life taken from me by them. I left the lot then thinking everything was fine. I then get an email a few days later from the sales person at the dealership saying that they now needed additional information before they could 100% file my loan paperwork for the vehicle. I have since in the last few days been constantly harassed by them as they ask for this paperwork on my behalf. I am confused now as upon leaving I was under the impression that you wouldn't let someone leave a parking lot with your car if they didn't have a loan properly set up for the vehicle. This has left me more frustrated and confused, to the point of wanting to somehow return the vehicle. They keep informing me though that this is ""normal for a first time car loan"" and that they need this paperwork before being able to continue any further. This further has complicated issues for me as I wish to refinance the loan from the car company with a personal bank for better interest rates, but am now being told I don't have an account set up in the first place as the loan has not been completed. 

**So my question to you guys of r/personalfinance is:** *Is this normal to have paperwork for a loan on a car completed after the person has already left with the vehicle?* 

If not, is there somewhere I should be looking to as a sort of follow up, say for example r/legaladvice?

My situation is this: I'm about halfway through with medical school.  I happen to live in a place where medical school is cheap, and financial aid generous.  

My debt coming out of medical school at the end of 4 years will be 25k of interest free government loans (that will remain interest free till I finish residency).  

I got a line of credit after being accepted in medicine (because that's what med students do...) with interest rate at prime (2.7% currently). In the last 1.5 years, I've only needed about 2k from this line of credit for my expenses (limit is 200k).  Maybe with away electives, flights for interviews etc. I'll end up with max 15k from the LOC. 

I have another 20k debt from undergrad (all interest free till I finish residency).  

In total, I expect to have max 60k debt at the end of medical school.  This is a much lower debt burden than most people who train in medicine and definitely very manageable on a doctor's pay.

I figure it's still half the avg 160k debt medical students in my country incur, so I should be ok?  

But I'm somewhat hesitant because at this moment, I don't have a penny to my name, a mountain of debt, and I'd be giving someone money it's mine.   

On average, doctor's make 200k-300k/year. Resident salaries start around 50K and goes up to 70K for senior residents.  

Tl;dr: Penniless med student with student loan wants to borrow 20k from line of credit to give to mom.  Feeling conflicted because the principle of giving out money that doesn't belong to you feels wrong. But I'll actually be graduating with a very low debt load for my field, so I don't feel it's as risky.

Edit: Elaborating on my relationship with my mom:
My dad is addicted to gambling. He stole hundreds of thousands of dollars from my mom. My mom tried to divorce my dad many times and he sabotaged the proceedings every time.  It was only finalized after he went in to a homeless shelter 5 years ago and could not fight it anymore.  My mom kept us afloat for years while my dad hemorrhaged their accounts and stole from us.  

I guess when I say ""awesome mom"", I mean I recognize that she is the reason we're not also homeless (granted, she choose my dad to marry in the first place).  Not only are we not homeless, she had acquire 2 properties that are worth about half a million in total.  Thing is, right now she's in a tight financial spot. She's on sick leave at her work and the compensation is delayed. She's expressed a need for some capital to update and sell one of the properties. I could say I'll lend her the money, and she can pay me back when the house is sold, but honestly, my earning potential far outweighs her earning potential (she's an early childhood educator who makes 30k/year) and once I start working (in residency), I won't need her to pay me back. So why not let it be a gift (with no expectation to pay back) to begin with?",finance

personalfinance,Student Loan Math confusion,"So I've been looking to refinance some of my private student loans. I currently have about $33k in private student loans with interest rates from 6.8% to 9.4%. 

Using some links from this subreddit, I looked up some initial rates, to be paid off in the same time frame, with lower interest rates. 

What doesn't make sense to me, is why the new monthly payment would be *higher* than it currently is. e.g. I used to pay roughly $330/mo  on 6-9% interest loans, but when refinanced it I'd pay $390/mo on 3-5% interest loans. How does that make sense. What am I missing?

Edit: More information.

current loans

Why would I get a higher monthly payment, for a lower total interest rate?

1. I feel dumb for not realizing this crucial detail before now.

personalfinance,"Graduating in a semester, want to start off right.","Been lurking here for a while and have been working about being smarter about finances this past year. I graduate in a few months and I am trying to make sure I am aware of all of my options available. There are a lot of things I wish I would have done different before college, but cant change that now. Live and learn. So...


- Federal: $30,436 ($38,910 if paid over 10 years)

- Private: $36,299 through Sallie Mae, not a good interest rate. 8%~

- 401k- Not 100% sure, just a few hundred. Going to increase what I put in.

- Checking &amp; Savings: $1100 each, Savings is my buffer for tuition payments this semester just in case. This semester I wont be able to put much towards loans, I am paying for it out of pocket since I only have to take classes part time.


Currently work as a Paramedic. Not the greatest pay, but I love my job and it is better than my food service days in every way. I estimate that if I work til graduation (Jan 12th-Late April) I will make $7,200 post tax and will be paying about $3,000 for tuition. A good chunk of what is left will go to things like gas, food (cant use that meal plan on the rig), insurance, etc. so big payments will start once I move back home.


Plan after graduation is to work at an EMS agency in the city for about 14-18 months ($16hr starting w/o experience) and most likely going to just pick up two 15 hour part time shifts. Once I am home I know I can earn enough to pay off at least 25% of my loans excluding family help. After that 14-18 months though, I plan on enlisting and will be on an E-3 pay scale. Right now I am leaning towards trying to join some specific guard/reserve units (one which is Active Guard Reserve), but active duty is also on the table. Not enlisting for the benefits. Wanted to do this for 15 years now, benefits are just an added bonus. 


So all that being said, I am looking to learn about the pros/cons of various options I have from people who have used them or know more about them than myself. Or to learn about options I had never even knew about or considered.
- Loan forgiveness: I've heard about this, but I recall there being a stipulation about being employed full time. Not really something I will do consistently any time soon, but I think I could still manage the payments.

- Military benefits: Would like to go to PA school down the road under the GI bill, but also looking for anything that helps with current loans.

- Loan consolidation: I've read some about the pro/con of this, but at my current point it seems like consolidation would be a much better idea? 

- Pay the shit out of it beyond just the bare minimum.

- Suggestions?

personalfinance,"Buying 20k used car, 10k in cash to put down, but poor credit. Can I get a loan from local CU? What is the best way to utilize this 10k?","First and foremost, I just want to sincerely thank everyone on this thread for taking the time out of their day to help a complete stranger with their financial confusion. It's amazing that there are online communities like this that help people like me so much when we have no one to ask. 


**Background:**
I just just graduated with my MBA (3.65 GPA if that is important to know in regards to loans). I am being offered a full time position next month and will be making near 80k a year in an area where that is comfortable money for a single male. Unfortunately, I have **poor credit (600)**due to student loans and I have not paid my credit card on time for the past 2 years. The credit card amount due is 600 dollars so I can take care of that rather easily if need be or if it will help me qualify for a loan.


**Main Question:**
I want to purchase a used car that cost $20k. I have $10k right now in cash that I can use towards this car or towards obtaining some sort of loan from the Credit Union. **I have bad credit (600)**. What would be the best way for me to utilize this 10k to pay for this car? I will be buying the car out of state.  Will I be able to obtain a loan from the Credit Union if I have 10k in cash to put down for the car? Should I finance with the dealer and let them know I have 10k to put down during the financing part? I know the dealerships give people with bad credit pretty bad interest rates so I would obviously prefer to get a loan from a local credit union but will they consider me for a loan given my scenario? Do I give the credit union 10k towards a 20k loan or do I leave the 10k in my savings with the CU  to show them I have half the money and ask for 20k loan? If this option is feasible, what would you say is a rough estimate of what you think my interest rate on this loan will be? Not sure how the process works so I figured you guys could help me! Excuse my foolish question, I have tried researching this online but cannot find a direct detailed answer to my specific scenario. Just want to say thanks for your time and consideration ahead of time. Please help me out! I don't have any family to ask. This really means a lot to me you guys :) The favor will be returned. 

**EDIT**:
I would like to purchase this car although I understand that buying a cheaper car or investing the money elsewhere would be a better option. I can see how in your eyes this financial move is foolish and will be a big burden on me in the future but I do not agree and I am quite positive I will be alright. I am just asking you guys what is the best way to invest this money towards the car that I would like to buy by the end of this month. Should I put all of it down towards the car? Should I put some down? What is a good interest rate to look for considering my credit score. Thank you for your time. P.S. - I am still not interested in a Jetta.",finance
personalfinance,Soon to be graduating college student - need investment advice!,"Basically, I have zero experience investing and don't know much about the different options for investing.

personalfinance,Do I have to enter my 1098T information in TurboTax?,"I am a full time graduate student. Last year I imported my 1098-T in TurboTax and ended up owing a lot of money. Some other grad students said I was dumb and now I'm wondering what to do this year.

These numbers are all approximate. Last year I worked as a TA to pay for my graduate tuition. In my TA contract, it said I would earn tuition &amp; fee payment + a stipend of $2000/mo. My 1098-T form then said I paid $0 for school and earned $26,000 in wages. When I entered this in TurboTax, it said I didn't qualify for the full time student tax credit because I didn't pay anything for school, and that I now owed $1500 in taxes. (~10% of my income was auto deducted that year.)

I then tried entering everything manually, my school expenses as $15,000 (my tuition + fees), and my wages as $41,000. I qualified for the student tax credit and was supposed to get a $3000 refund. But I didn't do this. I went back and imported everything as I received it because I felt like it couldn't be right to do it manually when you have the forms. 

So I ended up paying $1200 instead of receiving $3000, and several people said I was stupid for doing this. When I asked how they (other grad students) reported everything, none of them could give me a straight answer. They just remembered that they didn't owe any taxes and got all of their taxes refunded. 

Does anyone understand how my balance could go from -$1200 to +$3000 when my wages were essentially the same? That seems crazy to me. It was really hard for me to pay off $1500 in taxes as a grad student and I'm upset now that I may not have needed to at all. I have been paying an extra $220/mo in taxes to avoid this again this year. I am now at different school (still a grad student), and all of the student TA's here are telling me the same thing: they never owe taxes and get back any taxes they pay. I just doesn't see how they get that result if they are filing the same way I am.

edit: my W2 said I earned $26,000 and $3000 was deducted for fed taxes for the year

edit2: Based on the comments I am pretty sure I filed correctly, and there was just too little money being withheld from my paychecks. I had $26k of taxable income, my tuition waiver was tax free, and I didn't qualify for the LLC because I didn't actually pay very much for school. I still have no idea why the other grad students are not having to pay taxes, but I suppose that isn't my problem.

edit3: Nevermind, looks like I filed incorrectly! I checked my 1040 from 2015 and it looks like my tuition waiver was treated as taxable income which brought my adjustable gross income up to nearly $30k. I think I need to amend my taxes. The people on this sub are really amazing.",finance

personalfinance,Getting a Car Loan.,"So I am just beginning as a nursing student next, currently not working. I'm 21, I live at home and my weekly expenses are minor. Unfortunately our family van finally kicked the bucket a couple weeks ago and now I'm scrambling to find a vehicle to purchase so I can make it to school when it starts next week. My family has a very small income and I'm pretty much on my own for the purchase. 

I found a great Pontiac Vibe with only 55K miles from a mechanic that is the brother of one of my mom's childhood friends, so from someone reliable that we know. It's $6500.

I currently have about $4000 in the bank, and will be getting another $1500 once extra financial aid and my tax refunds come in in a couple months. I figure insurance and gas are going to cost me around $1000 for the next four months, until school's done, after that I will be working and have a source of income.

I have no credit score, but my sister and brother-in-law have been doing well for a while and their score should be excellent. They already offered to cosign.

My hope is to get a $5800 loan at something like 4% interest and pay roughly $130 a month over four years. The rest of the cost including taxes and fees, around $1300, would be my down payment. That way I only have to spend $1820 before the semester's done. The rest of the year, including gas and insurance, would cost me about $3000, but I will be working full time. 

There are health career jobs I'm looking at, but many require full time training and I can't do that until the semester ends. Previous years I've spent working at a combination of the nearby greenhouse (2 minute walk away) and at FedEx. FedEx won't fit around my nursing schedule and I will not be working there. I can pick up hours at the greenhouse but I'll make $1000 at most, probably more like a few hundred. My annual income the past two years has been roughly $8000. My classes are at the community college and I max out financial aid, so my school costs are negligible for the rest of the program (after I buy these books and supplies, which will be used for the entire program.)


I figure if I can get the loan I'm hoping for, I should be able to stretch my finances until the rest of the semester with $2700 to spare for repairs or emergencies and random expenses. After that I figure I'll can get a regular job and I'll be fine. Does that sound realistic? I'm stopping by the local credit union to ask about the loan tomorrow, any advice or suggestions for auto loans? 

All of this is new to me, so please understand I'm pretty nervous. I don't know if those loan numbers are even realistic. The car is priced realistically for its low miles, but its 'value' may be lower and I'm worried that may hurt my chances with the loan. 

EDIT: I'm in the US in Michigan, taxes is 6%, dealer fee is $100, and title and registration should be $100-150. Total cost of vehicle would be roughly $7100.",finance

* Credit score of roughly 640.

* I have one other CC without a balance.

* I have $1,800 that I'd like to throw at it right away.

* Yearly income of $26k (very seriously considering a change to a job with $40k)

* Since I'm paying about $65/month in interest alone, even a 3% transfer fee is worth it.


Questions:

* Would I even qualify for a card with a high enough credit limit to transfer it in the first place? (specifically I would want to get the Chase Slate card, but if it's worth it, any card would likely do)

* How much is a new credit line going to hurt me when I hopefully apply for a mortgage later this year (much later, like Nov/Dec)?

* Would it be smarter to just ask for a limit increase while paying off what I can right now?

personalfinance,I screwed the pooch; totally my fault [Long],"All right, so I made a VERY rash financial decision last year and consolidated all of my outstanding debt onto one credit card (balance transferred from a higher interest card, paid off car 6 months early to have an extra $250 to go toward savings, paid off outstanding tax debt and a few smaller medical bills before they went to collections, etc).

The background: Last year when I did this, my job had unlimited overtime for about 8 straight months. At $13.00 an hour, I was netting around $1,000 every two weeks. Then, in October, I got the opportunity to be a salaried employee at 28k, grossing $1,166 every two weeks without the need to kill myself working 60+ hours and working from home with travel and car expenses reimbursed, so I took it (not to mention it was a company promotion and helped improve my resume in less than a year).

The first problem: as an additional savings mechanism, I also have additional withholding ($40 per check for federal at 0 exemptions, $10 for state at the 2-earner rate). I know a lot of people rail against an ""interest free loan to the government"", but my substantial tax refund has saved my bacon more than once. So I have about $200 per check going toward my withholding. 

The second problem: due to my income being fixed at a salary rate, my net check has gone from $1,000 down to around $700-$800. I cannot pick up a second job because I am also in school to finish my Accounting degree and need time to go to class and study (I'm taking online classes to finish my Associate's).

The third problem: I am bipolar and was diagnosed due to a severe manic episode back in 2013. I haven't had a relapse until last month, when I wiped my $1,500 savings to pay down my one of my credit cards so I could buy things I didn't need with it, and the other credit card because it needed to be paid down (didn't help; I'll explain that in a minute).

Coming income:   
I have a student loan refund totaling 2.5k being disbursed over the next two months in two equal payments.   
My current withholding between both federal and state is sitting at $5,370 with my additional contributions  
I will net $700-$800 between each check in January 

My bills:  
Rent: $450  
Car Insurance: $104 (yes, this is the cheapest out there for me. Don't speed, kids, and don't go uninsured)  
Electric: $80  
Internet: $55  
Cell Phone: $120 (I can break this down to its individual parts if needed)  
Personal Loan: $100 ($1,600 balance at 0% interest)  
Groceries: $100  
Gas: Reimbursed by work (around $20/every week)  

Credit cards (AKA where I screwed the pooch):  
Capital One: Current $121 out of $750 available, will be paid in full before statement date (20% interest; this is one of my emergency cards)  
Navy Federal #1: $12,954 out of $13,000 (when I consolidated, I didn't take into account how fast and how much interest there would be on all my debt; my minimum payment is over $200); 15.24% interest  
Navy Federal #2 (my work expenses card, was getting paid in full due to work expenses getting reimbursed until I hit a car problem and had to replace a part. I'm going to pay this off in full with part of my student loan disbursement): $1781.05 out of $1,800; 12.24% interest  

I'm just at a loss as to how to pay off the high card at a decent rate and get back to saving money, since I'm planning on having the other two cards paid off by the end of the month and then only charging work expenses to the second card. My goal was to have it paid off by the end of this calendar year, but I don't know if that's feasible. Is there any way for that to happen at my current income level?

Currently, I have a one month emergency fund saved, 3% towards matching 401k (1 to 1 match up to 3%), $82,000 in student loan debt which I have been using the snowball method for the past year to pay down faster (roughly an extra $225 towards it per month, weighted average interest rate of ~8%) and no other debt. 


This puts me right at row 6 of the flow chart. So if I were to follow the flowchart verbatim, I should technically keep building my emergency fund to 3-6 months but I've already forgone that step by paying extra down on my loans.  I feel comfortable with just one month saved.


So, would you put the the bonus towards student loans or CPA study materials?  I've been leaning towards just splitting it 50/50.   


If I'm leaving out any pertinent info I can provide more detail.

personalfinance,"I was just told by my credit union that if I opt out of overdraft protection, and a transaction is made without the available funds the card will be captured and I will have to opt-in for overdraft protection before I can use the card again.","This seems fishy to me. With Christmas, some unexpected car repairs etc. etc. last month my account overdrew and I was surprised to see an overdraft privilege fee assessed, since I have always declined overdraft protection. I called today to opt-out, and ask when I had opted in since I would never knowingly do that. Apparently back in March I used the card without available funds, and it was captured and when I got a new one I was opted in without my knowledge/consent.

personalfinance,"Need to pay off $80,000 or reconsolidate to a better rate...","About 2 years ago, I started building a house with a little bit of help from YouTube and one or two family members. Initially, I used about $60,000 of personal savings. The last few months of building, I charged about $60,000 to credit cards and borrowed $20,000 in cash from family. I had hoped to get a home equity loan upon completion... When I applied about a month ago, I ran into several roadblocks. Because I did not have a contractor and I lived outside city limits, I wasn't required to get inspections or even a certificate of occupancy. The banks, however, want all of this before they will loan with the house as collateral. Although I could get some inspections done, I wouldn't be able to get some if the inspections that are required of building contractors earlier in the building process.
My wife and I are both teachers, and I am a member of the Army National Guard. We have no other debt other than what I've racked up in the last few months finishing this house. Monthly take home is approximately $4500... Monthly bills are approximately $2000... As a 33 year old, I've never missed any payments and had a credit score around 800 before over utilizing and opening new credit cards the last few months.
Currently my plan is to put as much as possible each month on the highest interest card and go from there, but I would prefer to pay back family quickly and get a lower interest rate.
Does anybody have an idea on where or how I could get $70,000-$80,000 loan without using the house as equity?",finance

personalfinance,Am I calculating ROI the correct way? (Real estate),"I plan on investing in real estate, and the numbers seem too good to be true. I'm hoping somebody can pick up on something I might be missing! Here's the example I'm working with, from a podcast I'm listening to.

I purchase a single-family home, $10,000 down and a $40,000 mortgage (keeping the math simple). Let's say that with this $50,000 house I can charge $700/mo in rent. Being super conservative in my planning, I'll take out 40% for vacancies and repairs. (700 x 0.6 = $420). Worst case scenario, I'm planning for $420/month to come in, or $5,040/year. 

Here's where I'm getting confused. The podcast guy is telling me that I'm getting a 10% ROI. This makes sense if you're looking at it from the perspective of the house. However, it doesn't make sense from the perspective of *my investment*. I paid $10,000 - and I'm getting $5,000 back a year. If I got a 30-year mortgage for $40,000 at say 4%, I'll only need to pay back (according to an online calculator) $2,300/year. So $5,000 minus $2,300 is a $2,700 cash flow, meaning that I'm basically getting 27% on my 10,000 investment!

So obviously a 27% interest rate (the conservative calculation!) is pretty crazy. Can someone explain what I'm missing?",finance

Right now we have it in a savings account with our bank and it is very very low interest. I would like to move our E-fund to Ally, for several reasons. First, I don't like the idea of having our E-fund in the same bank as our credit card and checking, just in case our main account is compromised. Second, the interest rate is substantially higher. 

My question: should I place the money in Ally's online savings at 1%? Or should I put it into a no penalty-CD at 1.25%? I'm leaning towards putting in the CD account because I see no downsides. If I went this route I would break the fund up into CDs of 1-2 months living expenses so if I need to dip into the fund I don't need to withdraw the whole thing at once. 
I'm open to other suggestions as well. 

Edit: most commenters are saying that E-fund should be easy access and available immediately, however my thought has always been that in an emergency I can put expense on a credit card and pay the bill in full with the E-fund. This gives me a month to draw money from the E-fund before I begin to accrue interest. Additionally, I already keep 1-2 months expenses in my checking account as a matter of course.

personalfinance,What's my next step with my car?,"I’ve posted here a few times before but I’m looking for some guidance for the inevitable; getting a new car. My mom moved a few states away last year so this is my first time going at it alone and it’s giving me a great deal of anxiety.  I’m going to outline everything so I apologize for the wall of text.

My current situation: In March 2015, I leased a 2015 Ford Escape for 2 years, 0.5% interest rate (might not be using the correct terminology here) 21k miles. The owner of the dealership is a very good friend of my mom’s so he got me that rate by calling in a favor. My current payment is $319.34 a month. I only put $300 down. In March, I will have to return it. I currently have almost 16k miles but I probably won’t add much more before turning it in… 1k MAX, 300 is a more reasonable estimate.

Before I get into my thinking, I’d like to mention that I recently graduated college so paying off my student loans is top priority. I also stay on top of my credit like a hawk. I have 4 separate scores that come from my credit union, my Discover card, and Credit Karma(2): 668, 698, 747, and 748. I’m listing all of them because I’m not sure which is most reliable… If this isn’t relevant, just ignore please lol

The future: I’ve been thinking about what to do once this lease is up. I love my Escape but with my desire to pay off my loans, it’ll take too long to pay them off if I buy my car out of the lease. I was thinking, to keep my payments low, to lease a sedan that I like then buy that out once that lease is up. I’m really loving the Honda Civic or a Toyota Camry, more so the Civic though… My mom keeps pushing a Ford Fusion because she knows her friend will get me another good deal again but I just don’t know… If I am going to be buying this car out of the lease, the only car I can see myself liking for a while is the Escape I currently have or a Civic. I have $1500 I can put down.

Basically… What is the best solution for low payments that won’t go to waste once I’m done paying off my loans and I’m ready to buy the car? I know this sub is very much against leasing but please take the whole situation into consideration… Should I look into my bank/credit union’s loans? Do they offer loans for leases or just financing only? I feel like I could go on with questions for days about this whole process...

I currently live in the Washington, D.C./Metro area and am contacted regularly (DAILY) by recruiters looking to hire SharePoint developers. I love working for this particular government client, but my employment situation is crap, so I'm looking at making a change. 

When I am contacted by these recruiters, most of the positions are other contract positions and most of the recruiters use standard ""scripts"" when e-mailing about these positions. Aside from the obvious questions (who is the client? how long is the contract? what's the salary range? what are the benefits?, etc.), is there anything that I should be including in these conversations? A lot of them want to know my current salary and are resistant to my salary request of ~$85k/yr due to the fact that it is such a large jump from my current salary, even though SharePoint developers in the DC metro area average more than ~$95k/yr.

personalfinance,Where to start for retirement,"Hi All,

Wondering the best place to start for retirement. First, a bit about me.

- 30M, married, 1st child on the way
- Full-time student using GI Bill
- My taxable income: $6000/yr [super low, was making significantly more but cut back because of school .. self employed]
- My current non-taxable income (VA disability, GI Bill benefits, etc): Probably like $50,000 per year.
- Wife makes around $65,000 year pre-tax

Financially:

- We have combined around $100,000 in savings
- We have no credit card debt and have great credit. I make all purchases using credit cards, maximizing their benefits. Pay in full each month.
- 2 car loans, one for $9,000 and one for $10,000. Low interest rate on each.
- Wife has student loans totaling like $20-30k
- Wife has matching 401k at work, I think to 4 or 5%. She maxes this each year. After 4 or so years, she's around $25,000 I think. Has been earning a good return lately.
- Currently rent a home. Don't own a home, but would like to in the next few years, I graduate from college May 2018.

----

The short term debt/finances doesn't concern me. Most importantly we don't mess around with credit card debt by keeping a balance. We could probably pay her college loans off more aggressively, but I think we're doing okay. As mentioned, we will want to likely buy a home after I graduate once I find a job. I am in one of the top [undergrad] business programs in the country that's highly recruited by finance, tech, etc., so I expect I'll find a decent job with decent benefits.

My big concern is retirement. My wife has $25,000, which is pretty low I feel because she only pays what is matched. Even worse, I have nothing. What's the best way I/we should proceed? I've read through a ton of posts on here and have read a lot of the FAQs, but it's so overwhelming. But I need to do something and we have savings to support me finally doing something. Our savings sit in a savings account that gives us like 20 cents per month in interest, so we have a fairly significant amount of money doing nothing for us, much of which we won't need for at least a year and a half until we buy a house .. and even then, I will be eligible for a VA loan which makes it easier/cheaper to get loans for a house with little or no down payment.

As I mentioned, I'm currently self-employed but I don't expect that to be the case after May 2018.

Any feedback is appreciated and in the meantime, I'll continue to read and learn. Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Saving for retirement vs paying off small loan,"Hey guys,

I have recently become more conscious of my finances thanks to this sub so first off, thanks. 

I made a post awhile back about the best way for me to begin saving for retirement. Thanks to your help, I have decided that I will most likely open a Roth IRA with Vanguard and set up a target date fund. 

I am currently about four months into a 48 month motorcycle loan with $6500 remaining at 4.78% APR. 

My question is will it be smarter for me to focus on aggressively paying off this loan including throwing whatever tax return I may receive at it (probably between $2-2500) before opening an IRA?

After reading the wiki here and speaking to some people, I am conflicted. Half seem to suggest that paying off the loan at that rate will likely yield a better return than an investment account as the interest rate is a bit high. The other half state that since the payment is low and manageable, I should focus on at least setting up a retirement account and making a monthly contribution, stressing the importance of time in the market and that I will at least have an account starting to grow.

I am also considering opening an account with a small amount of maybe $1k, then focusing on the loan. 

Edit: I'm 26 if that makes a difference.

In 2017's budget I based it off the previous six month's spending. Car insurance should go down once the Dodge is sold so I figured at most $100 and I noticed I used slightly more gas and food then I had budgeted for in 2016. Realistically there was no way $100 covered toilet-paper, random home items, and other random small expenses that came along in 2016 so I tripled it to be in-line with what I actually need/used. With the small raise, real budget numbers, and getting rid of the Dodge I should be able to pay off the $38,325 ($27,343 CC + $10,982 Ford) in 24 months and have $200ish each month that will go into building an emergency fund if not needed each month.

I know $500 rent/utilities sounds cheap and it is. Once my divorce was finalized and I was allowed to break our lease I moved in with my Uncle who is also going through a divorce and needed help splitting the bills. We have averaged less than a combined $200 in utilities since I moved in last September. I'm not sure what I would have done had it not been for him welcoming me into his home and helping me when I needed it the most. There wasn't any way I could have made my old lease payment and even thought about paying any of this debt off.

I've been utilizing 0% interest transfers on the credit cards as best as I can.

Chase Slate | 18.24% | $0 | $4,000 |

I'm currently making the minimum payment on all the cards with a balance and then whatever is left from the budgeted $1,200 I apply to the highest interest rate, which is currently the non-balance transferred Discover It.

If anyone has an advice and/or suggestions, I'm all ears. I'm a little worried about the upcoming rate hikes on the BoA Platinum, haven't decided if I want to eat the interest until it's paid off (4ish months) or take the 3% hit and move it to the PenFed card. I planned on crunching the numbers once March arrives and then seeing which would cost me more.

Now as I sit here typing today I have the following *private* loans outstanding from Sallie Mae:

* $2508 @ 10.25%
* $6655 @ 9.75%
* $8959 @ 9.63%
* $7954 @ 9.13%
* $5137 @ 9.13%
* $6873 @ 9.13%
* $3376 @ 9.13%

At first glance, I can tell my interest rates are near-crippling. I may graduate a semester early (December 2017), which would lead me to only take out about $5-6k more in that period of time. 

As far as income goes, it really isn't consistent as far as check-to-check value is concerned. Working part time at 3 different positions at school has yielded me a W-2 just north of $4000 for 2016, so this is a fair assumption for what I may make at school in 2017. It's safe to say that my pay stubs are usually greater than $200 bi-weekly, but they usually are never higher than $350

I also have accepted an internship this summer where I will be receiving a $5000 bonus (pre-tax) and will be making north of $2400 (again, pre-tax) on a bi-weekly basis. I anticipate upon graduation I will be making a salary between $40-65k (large gap due to potential to live at home).

I have a checking account that I like to keep a minimum of around $1,000 at all times, but have no *real* savings aside from some sort of account my great grandmother left me that I have never accessed, and have told my family I do not want to access until I graduate. I have absolutely **zero** idea what she left me years ago.

A great amount of my ambiguity on how to tackle the situation also persists due to the fact that I am a first generation ""university"" student in my family. No one has really ever had to incur this type of debt that I can immediately refer to for help. Also, my grandfather is the cosigner for all of my loans, though my mother (who could not get approved) says he had credit trouble in the 80s and 90s. 

Of course, anyone could sit back and tell me that I might not have been able to afford to go to school where I do. But, I have already made it this far, and am sure with the proper knowledge and monetary intuition, I can make this a very manageable situation down the road. 

My grandfather and I have tried to look into consolidation before, but never really got off the ground with it. I am also 100% open to living at home after school to take care of finances, but my area lacks both quantity and quality when it comes to potential positions I may be qualified for. My father has told me before that he intends to pay for my entire undergraduate education, but he is what I like to call a smoke blower. There's no way I can believe him on this unless he were to actually prove it.

personalfinance,Best way to invest my 25k inheritance? Worried about Brexit.,"I'm in my early 30s and have inherited around £25k. I'm married and just had a little baby. Work in health care and earn around 35k a year. My plan for a while was to buy a second house as a buy to  let. Not to make money per month but as a future nest egg. Because of the recent change of rules with landlord regulations and all that I'd be looking at a cheap terraced house at around 90 to 110 thousand to buy. I'm not in a high priced area in the south East, as you may have guessed. So 150k buys you a fairly nice house. 100k a standard terrace house. But obviously this would leave me with little or no money left after I pay the 25% deposit. 

Should I continue down this road of looking at buying a second home to let or should I just forget the idea and put the money into savings accounts? Most accounts give such little interest that I don't see the point. However, with Brexit looming in the coming year  worried that buying a house is risky. What if the interest rates on mortgages increases? What if the housing market drops off the cliff? 

If you guys can think of a better way to invest the money then I'm all ears. Thanks.",finance

personalfinance,(CAN) Getting lump sum payment and paying off credit cards with it,"Hey All,

My wife and I have just transferred the balances of 2 of our credit cards to 1 new card and have received 1 year of 0% interest as a result. We are now getting $7000 in a lump sum payment as a pension payout since my wife switched jobs. We're prepared to take the 10% tax hit on that $7000 in order to pay off credit card debts from when we were in university. I know it's usually not advisable to do this with pension earnings, but this only took her 3 months to accrue and her new job features an even better pension.  

Now, we're wondering if we just throw all of that money towards the credit card debt immediately, or whether we throw that $6300 into a tax free interest bearing account and let interest accrue for the first year while we have the 0% interest rate on our credit card debts. We would make our current monthly payments as is on the CC debt and then apply the rest when the 0% interest period is over. Is this smart or should we just pay off the debt now and throw the remainder of the lump sum into our RRSP?",finance

**Problem**



My husband, current active duty military, will be getting out of the military soon. When he does, we will be moving to Michigan where there is no Navy Federal in the whole state so of course I will not be able to transfer. With that being said, I am unsure about what to do with my 401K.



**Questions**



* Should I continue contributing the full 7% for the employee matching since I will not be able to retrieve the amount they invest since when I leave I will not have been with the company for 2 years? I lowered my contribution in December to 4% instead of the 7%, should I leave it there or contribute less to the 401K and contribute more to my IRA (this goes with the next questions).



* Should I go ahead and roll over my 401K into my IRA? My current IRA (only $200 balance) has a rate of 0.25% which isn't too great in my opinion. 



* NFCU does have some great IRA products... One of which is a $1000 min with a 7 year term at 1.95% APY. Would it be beneficial to me to open the new IRA and roll over from my 401K into that IRA? 



* Should I rollover my 401K immediately or wait until I leave the company? 



* Will there be any tax implecations for rolling over my 401K into an IRA?



* Which would be best if I opened a new IRA certificate? A Roth IRA or Traditional? My current IRA is a Traditional IRA Plan. 



* Will doing a roll over in the full amount possible be included in my IRA contribution amount for the year? With having two IRAs does the amount I can contribute become divided into the two accounts or is it doubled? For example, I believe the amount is $5,500 (?). Does that become $5,500 per IRA account or does the amount I contribute to both accounts have to equal or be less than $5,500?



* How do I rollover a 401K from Fidelity? 



In case you didn't realize, I honestly do not work with IRAs at work often. I mainly do loan, credit card, and membership applications. I have only done two IRA rollovers and those were from other financial institution IRAs not 401Ks.

personalfinance,Buying back student loans?,"Hey there, this post is more so for my mom than myself.

For my university tuition my mom and I both took out federal loans. In her case she took out parent plus loans.

My mother is considering filing for bankruptcy and from what I understand this won't affect the student loans. Obviously this will ruin her credit, etc etc. 

I recall reading on here awhile ago that if you stop paying student loans they can then somehow be bought back for less money? Is this correct? Being that my mother's credit may already be taking a major hit with the bankruptcy, would it be wise to do this?

For reference, her loans amount to about $60k and she makes about $75k I believe.",finance
personalfinance,"From an investment standpoint, should you always pay the minimum on a student loan if you can make more from investing?",Here is my situation. I have 50k in loans. One is a parent plus at around 8 percent interest and the other 30k are in my name varying from 3 to close to 5 percent besides one at 6.8 percent which is only like 3k. So my thought would be to pay off the 8 percent parent plus loan and then the small 6.8 loan in my name before anything else while I am in my grace period or just a few months after. That means I would be left with just under 27k loans at an average interest rate of 4 percent.

Some background. We originally were going to build/buy a house this summer but decided to put a bulk of the savings in lump sum to pay off most of the 6.55% student loans. We make roughly 72K together. We have focused on maxing out of of our Roth IRAs in 2016 and are contributing to another. 

Currently have no CCs or CC debt, only debt we have is the student loans left. I have pondered going back to school to get a masters degree but not sure if It is worth it and I hate taking on debt. 

We are trying to decide and reach a happy medium with paying off of our debt vs saving again to purchase/build a modular home in the 170k range. If we build a modular we would be getting 1.5 acres of land as a gift. 

Just wanted some advice from the forum to see where people stand of the issue of buying a home when having debt and how much debt is acceptable.

personalfinance,15K debt + (15K + 5K) Windfall with a few wrinkles.,"This is a little bit complicated, and I’ve read the relevant FAQs and primers offered in this group, but I am still quite a bit uncertain as I have a few curveball variables-- also, I can’t think straight when it comes to my own money. (And this is a throwaway account because of the personal details).

I am 46. I have no money set aside for retirement. I have done a very poor job of saving, obviously, but I have periodically wound up needing to drain (e.g., 401K) those accounts for survival purposes. Historically, I have had high-paying jobs (around 80-100K), but they haven’t lasted very long and they’re punctuated by extended periods of drought (I left my last 100K job 5 years ago). 

I am carrying 15K in credit card debt. ~10K is in a very high-interest card (big named bank jacked up the rates before protection law went into effect). ~5K is in another credit card that is at a lower interest rate, but still a credit card.

My income for the last ~4 years has come from driving for Uber/Lyft. This is a pretty awful way to make money. I have more details on why this makes (a little) more sense than some other things that might seem obvious (for example, I am currently in school and the flexibility really helps), but I'll leave it out here.

Now, the good news..

My expenses are very, very low (especially given the city I live in).

I have $15.5K coming to me from a car accident settlement this week, and then the first week in February, I am due to get another $5K from VW (they’re paying off my low-interest loan on the car, plus giving me a payout of around that amount). Additionally, there are some theoretical payouts from class-action lawsuits that could arrive at some point in the future, but ignore those for now.

I don’t have an emergency fund, per se (I have about two weeks’ expenses sitting around, but seasonally, this is also an awful time to be working Uber, so I’m likely to run a deficit each week that I continue “working” for Uber until Spring, and then it’s a guess whether earnings will go back up again).

Other than the debt I’m carrying, my credit is in excellent shape (everything always paid on-time). My credit union pre-approves me routinely for a car loan (2-3% APR). However, I can't get any kind of debt-consolidation loan because my existing balances are too high/my income is low and unverifiable.

So, logically, I’d want to pay off both credit cards, and then to replace my car, borrow the money (since the APR is so low), but a part of me is very hesitant to do all of that, given the precariousness of my income. I also need to think about investments and theoretical retirement, so I’m not sure if it makes sense to divert some of that cash into a retirement account (or given my situation, I shouldn’t bother at this point).

I guess I just need someone with a clearer head to tell me my smartest move.",finance
personalfinance,What would you do with this debt structure?,"Hi all, I'm 25 years old, and currently in a little bit of debt, but not much. Here is what my structure looks like currently: 

15% of salary going to 401k $12,000 balance ($55,000 salary)

$5,200 in a Roth IRA (roll over from a previous employer)

$2,000 in a Pension (worked for the government for a while in college)

$11,400 in savings account earning 1.25% interest (this is my '6 month of expenses account). 

My take home pay is approximately $1,250 every two weeks after deductions (HSA, Healthcare, 401k, etc) 

My debts are as followed: 
Student loans = $18,500 at 5.3 % interest rate (federal) starting balance was $28,000. Min payment is $294 a month, I pay $600 

Car = $305 a month at 0 interest

Same As Cash debt (remodel on home) = $4,200, minimum payment of $105, I pay $150
Insurance = $78

Mortgage = $450 3.5% loan

Parking = $125 

Savings buffer additional= $200/month

Leaves roughly: $500 for gas, food, and other bills. 

Am I focusing my energies correctly? Should I reduce my 1.5% savings partially to refocus more energy on my student loan? Should I reduce some efforts on my current retirement to be able to kill off my student loan? That would just be a nice chunk of change to free up every month to refocus on other efforts. Should I pull that extra $50 off the same as cash payment in order to add more onto my student loan?

personalfinance,"Straightening out my finances (student loans, credit card debt and budget)","Reddit, another post regarding my finances. Much of my earlier post still applies however a few things have changed since then. 

**Background:**
In October of 2015, I stopped making minimum payments on most of my credit cards after my income didn’t allow me to continue such payments anymore. These were easily 600-700 a month total and the only income I had at the time was from being a TA at my university. Most living cost were paid for by graduate student loans. I spoke with a few lawyers who passively supported that I stopped paying. I did call each creditor to try to work out a payment plan or an economic hardship plan as well as a credit counseling agency but none of them lowered the monthly payments enough. At the time, I was also making FULL payments on one of my private student loans and $25.00 per month on each of my two other private student loans. 

After the new year, I met with a lawyer and decided declaring bankruptcy was my best chance, the debt in question was for a combined credit card debt of about $27,000. The lawyer was going to charge me $1,200 to take care of everything. I wasn’t employed at the time and was living off student loans, which for bankruptcy paperwork counted as “income”.  This was also my final semester in graduate school and I spent what money I had saved up for the lawyer to fly to California to take a written exam (two for two different counties). *Thus NOT declaring bankruptcy.* After graduation, I finally able to get a part-time job (its shockingly difficult to get a job when everyone thinks you are going to leave) and that strictly covered current expenses. 



In 2016, I had several one-time expenses.

* $3,000-$4,000 spent on transportation, hotels, food, and other expenses associated with finding a job.
* $900 spent on a security deposit for my new apartment for where I got a job in my field
* ~$275 spent on medical expenses (don’t have insurance until Feb 1st)
* $400 spent on a new bed and frame for new apartment


In 2017, I have several upcoming one-time expenses.

* $280 dollars to finish repaying urgent care.
* New glasses (I will have vision insurance from my employer)
* Furnishing my apartment including getting living room, bedroom, and kitchen items. (several other items are required)
* Replacing the Halogen Flood Lights with LED lights. (apartment was a former graphic design office)
* Finish moving (a significant amount of my stuff is back in New York)
* Professional Memberships (partially covered by work)
* Amazon Prime (might renew)

OVER by: $171.60




**Things to note in budget:**



The Gas and Electric I have over allocated because of the lack of history, I don’t think it will go over $100.00. Adobe CC student subscription ends in March, I’m not sure if I’m willing to pay $50.00 a month. FeralHosting will be dropped in a few months once I get my server moved. Renters Insurance for my previous place (where my stuff is) will be dropped once I moved everything to new place. Transportation cost are currently zero as I don’t own a car and use my work car for grocery shopping during my lunch break. I do need to buy a bike pump, a yearly maintenance and other items once the weather warms up. 


For Navient, I’m several months behind and they will be starting litigation shortly. This budget is more oriented for January 1st and onwards. The total private student loans is about $23,000 and is at 10% interest rate.  I have nearly a $3,000 loan from my mom which needs to be paid off sooner rather than later. I need to put forward more money towards that at some point. (my mother doesn’t really have that kind of mother but it was that or no job) I’m also posting an ad for a roommate (I don’t really want one) to help save some money on rent and utilities. Though I’ll just be slightly less broke than I am. Cheaper rents are available in the area but I was in a time crunch for when I was able to drive eight hours to look at apartments and when I started my job. (4 days) I just didn’t have the opportunity to look at places and as I work in government, I know what people to avoid renting from. 


**Goal** To work towards paying off my debts, preparing and doing well on the LSATs and attend several conferences in my field to foster a greater network as I want to have a new position for the start of 2018 in a city that has amenities that I wish to have. 


I haven’t spoken to a lawyer yet but I’m likely going to consider bankruptcy (again). My salary might make that difficult. As I moved to another state, I need to wait before I can file to begin with. Any advice or suggestions would be appreciated. I’m always revising my budget in Excel. Trying to make capital purchases while paying for recurring expenses. 



Thank you.

personalfinance,How to Minimize Loan Payments,"Hey everyone! I'm trying to figure out how to pay off my student loans in such a way that total interest is minimized while paying only the minimum monthly payments.

&amp;nbsp;

Here are the numbers:
&amp;nbsp;

- Loan 1 = $3,637.74 @ 3.40%
- Loan 2 = $1,566.44 @ 6.55%
- Loan 3 = $4,757.22 @ 3.40%
- Loan 4 = $1,483.66 @ 6.55%
- Loan 5 = $5,857.50 @ 3.86%
- Loan 6 = $2,253.11 @ 3.86%

&amp;nbsp;

Note:


- All the percentages are annual interest rates, but they accrue daily


- I can choose to repay back any of these loans, in any combination, in any order, as long as my total payment each month is at least $188.56

&amp;nbsp;

Assuming that I pay only the minimum $188.56 each month, in what order should I repay these loans so that my total interest accrued is the lowest possible?


In other words, I should pay off the loan(s) that are accruing the most interest the fastest; however, just because a loan might have a higher interest rate doesn't necessarily mean that it'll build up more interest since their principal balances could be lower. 


Is there a program or calculator that I could use to figure out this math? Or could anyone here show me how I could calculate this?

personalfinance,Personal loan or no?,"Hi all,

I'm new to posting but I've been lurking on personal finance for a while now. I'm a little embarrassed to admit it but I've dug myself into some credit card debt. 

In total, I have about $20k in credit card debt spanning across 4 cards. I've made more than minimum payments on time but I'm trying to find a better way to handle this. Interest rates are 16-18% on average. 

In total I make about $2600/month. I don't pay rent but I am in school and have a car/high insurance premium because of my age so that's rough $500/month. There's also other monthly expenses that are probably another $400 or less (cell phone, etc). I'm definitely going to try eating cheaper and stop buying unnecessary things. 

My question is:
1. What is the best way to handle this? Should I take out a loan and consolidate debt or should I just work on paying off the cards one by one?
2. Is it possible to take out a small loan for one card at a time? Is that a smart method?

Personally, I'm 17, 18 in February, and am going on a trip with my friends over the summer where I need to buy a flight ticket. My dad suggested opening up a credit card with the airline I'm buying from, Delta, because I'll receive a $100 statement credit, 30,000 bonus miles after I make $1000 worth of purchases in 3 months, $0 first annual fee, then $95 annual after, and then little things like a free checked checked bag and priority boarding.

personalfinance,Should I cash in these U.S. savings bonds early and use them to pay tuition or save them and take out a loan?,"So, My grandparents gave me a $100 series EE savings bond every year until I turned 20. I have 20 of these bonds. They were bought at half-value and most of them have not reached their face value yet. The ones bought in the 90's have reached their face value but are still accumulating interest. I have tried to figure out how much interest these bonds are actually earning because if they are earning less interest than I would have to pay for a loan (6.26%)  then I would like to cash them in. The bank employees didn't seem to have any knowledge of what interest rate these bonds are earning but suggested that I should not cash them in early.

Even for the ones that are much younger (such as the most recent one bought in 2011) which are only worth about $60-$70 I think are more valuable to me now than if I waited until their ultimate maturity value. If they are earning less than 6.26% interest right now then I would prefer to cash them in and use the money. Does this seem to make sense to any of you? Am I right in thinking that I should give up the low interest that they are earning to save myself from being charged 6.26% interest on a student loan? Do any of you know the exact interest that these bonds are earning?

I have tried to research the rates for these bonds but I do not completely understand which rate applies. From what I have learned so far from the treasury departments website https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ebonds/res_e_bonds_eeratesandterms_eebondsissued051995_041997.htm I think that most of these bonds are earning the long-term interest rate right now, which is different depending on when they reached the 6-year mark. The long-term rates, I believe, are fixed once they reach the 6th year mark. Any bonds which have reached this mark over the past 10 years (according to the chart in the link) vary between 1-4% for the older bonds and are extremely low for any of the more recent bonds (The link is only for bonds purchased in the 90's). The more recent bonds are likely earning no more than 1% a year interest over the life of these bonds. So, I am thinking that I would be giving up 1%-4% earnings but saving myself from a 6.26% interest rate cost of student loans. This would be a net savings of 2%-5% in favor of cashing in the bonds.

So I'm trying to understand what the benefits of this are. It can obviously be very beneficial if you have a large account and can get favorable terms.  But for reference, I was just looking at the margin application for Scottrade - there was an &gt;8% interest rate for accounts with $10,000 or less - and I can't understand why anyone would borrow money on those terms.  (FWIW, I understand you can get a very low rate just by using an IB account.)

personalfinance,Completely Lost When It Comes to College Finances,"Hello! I am a senior in high school trying to navigate college finances.  I am having a difficult time, as my parents are 70 and did not attend college, so we truly do not know what we are doing. I submitted FAFSA, in-state aid applications, and I have been admitted to various colleges. My college of choice accepted me. Unfortunately, we did not expect such a high bill. Their tuition is $65,000 per year, but they have offered to cover approximately $25,000 in grants, need-based aid, and Federal Direct Subsidized Loans.  I plan on commuting, so that would take another $13,000 off, with total tuition at this point being about $27,000. Now, that it still ridiculously high and my family cannot even begin to cover that. I do not want to leave college with crippling debt to pay off. 

This college, however, is my dream school and offers exactly the major I want: Animal Behavior. Every aspect about this college fits what I want, too. 

Despite having a rather high income, there is very little, if anything, that my parents can actually pay for various reasons. I only just found this out. I plan on working in the summers and over break, but I have to focus on my studies during school. I am applying for scholarships. Also, my father was planning on retiring next year, which further reduces my capability to pay for college. 

I was accepted to other, less prestigious and less expensive schools that offer Neuroscience majors, which I can then use to take to grad school to focus on animal behavior (I think I am planning on grad school either way). The catch is that I applied early decision (a binding agreement) to my school of choice and the acceptance/acceptance payment is due by Friday, January 6. In the meantime, I cannot apply to other schools unless I fully back out of my contract with my school of choice. 

What can I do? 


TLDR; I am lost in a sea of college finances, with a poor ability to pay for my college of choice that I applied to via Early Decision (but did not get enough aid), a swiftly-approaching deadline, and lots of unanswered questions. 

Edit: I have a 3.9 GPA and scored a 1260 on the *new* SAT, which is out of 1600. I reside in Pennsylvania. 

**Edit #2:** So, I backed out of my early decision agreement with my choice school. I'm going to be looking at the other, more affordable colleges I've been accepted to and apply to a few more. Thank you for all of the help.",finance
personalfinance,"Student account now in collections, collection agency won't take my money!","Looking for advice on this self-inflicted situation. Root cause was myself blindly taking advice of the school and then doing nothing when I couldn't pay back a debt. Anyways...!

A few years ago I went back to college to finish my degree on the advice of a school financial aid adviser. They figured I'd have enough federal loans to cover the cost of the remainder of my degree.

Half way through my first semester back, I get an email saying there was a mistake and that I had already reached my limit for undergraduate borrowing. This meant I owed my full semester tuition out of pocket, which I couldn't afford. I didn't know how this was possible, especially after I had received the ""award"" letter where they lay out what you qualify for loan-wise, but I guess it is. 

6 months or so later after not paying it back I am contacted by a collection agency who sets me up on a $150/month plan to pay it back, which worked great until I had to update the CC# on file when it expired. That has been an issue for about 6 months now and reached the point where they now placed a negative mark on my credit report (there was nothing before). I've called them and tried to use their website to update the CC for months and keep being told my account is ""on hold"" and has to be taken ""off hold"" by another department.

Last week I reached out to the school who says they've cleared up any confusion with the collection agency and that I should call back in to update my CC#. I keep doing that, I keep being told my account is on hold. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. The school and collection agency are definitely on different pages.

personalfinance,"Extending student loan repayment terms...good, bad, or neutral?","Hi PF!



I've been lurking on this sub for a few months &amp; absolutely love the wide range of ideas discussed here. Given that it is the start of a new year, I want to revisit some of my own personal plans regarding paying federal student loans. I tried searching something under this category here on PF but didn't find much discussion on what I was looking for...so I resorted to the rest of the web and found mixed opinions. I apologize in advance if this is longer than was necessary; I felt all of it would be relevant to get my question across to you all. Your input is greatly appreciated:



In June 2014, I started my first full-time job at a local government agency after graduating with a BS a year prior. So, I began to make payments of ~$250/month towards my student loans -- My grace period was over and this was the minimum payment they had set up for me...I just went with it.



I continued to make the same payment for all of 2015. Despite a 1% increment in my income and some overtime pay, I kept putting the same amount into my loans because I also had small credit card debt (accumulated through college) that I desperately wanted to get away from due to the high interest rates.



March 2016 comes around and I finish paying the credit debt which allowed me to start setting money aside for an E-fund. Three months later, I got a promotion and a 10% raise (super stoked)...so I decided to increase my loan payments to $300/month. I know it wasn't much but I really needed to concurrently save up for the E-fund.



**Now,** I want to revisit this because I came across someone suggesting that I could have the loan institution lower my minimum payment required (i.e. extending the loan term) and that any excess would be put onto the loan with the highest interest rate. I researched and it seems like my lowest minimum payment could be reduced to $170/month...but that I should plan to keep putting the $300 as I am right now. Is this overall a good or bad idea? Or, does it really not matter at all? Do I save anything up on interests? Would I really be paying off loans relatively faster? As of right now, I have $18K to go! 



A few online financial ""guides"" say to NOT do this but state it's because they have the impression that you'll actually be paying the new minimum...but what if that's not the case?

personalfinance,I really need advice; $20k in credit card debt I don't know how to escape from,"Short version:  I have $20k in credit card debt across three different cards.  I want to consolidate them in one place, with a better APR (currently it's around 20%), where I can't add to it, and hopefully a smaller monthly bill (currently it's around $560).  I got an offer in the mail from ""Personal Lending Group"" and I contacted them.  I was wondering if a) they were a legitimate company that other people know about (I had done some research but due to the vagueness of the name it was tough to find anything concrete about them) and b) if the offer they sent me made sense, and was the smartest thing to do.

Longer version: This started a long time ago when I got my first credit card with like a 3k limit.  I kept upping it since that seemed like a smart idea at the time, and I eventually ended up with a limit of $13,500.  That eventually got maxed out, and while I have been able to pay it down a bit, it always comes back up.  My girlfriend had the idea of opening up a few other cards and transferring balances that would have 0% APR for a bit, and pay those down, but we ended up just maxing all of them.

I know I need to get serious about solving this, and it has been stressing me out for a while.  My girlfriend and I are working on a budget, and I am quitting drinking and smoking which should help, but I also want to move it to some other place where I can't add to it so I can watch it get paid down, as well as hopefully having a single, smaller monthly payment.

So now to the (sort of) proactive part of the story.  I have been doing some research on what is the best step, but there are just so many options and different companies that it gets really confusing and I feel overwhelmed and mentally give up.

I got an offer in the mail from ""Personal Lending Group"" (their website is plgsavings.com).  I contacted them and someone e-mailed me (which I will copy paste below).

My main questions are has anyone heard of or worked with this company before?  As far as I can tell they are legit, but then again that doesn't mean that they are the best option.

And: Is this a good option for me?  Is there another way to go about this that am I missing entirely?

Here is the e-mail I received:

""Here is a brief summary of what we can do for you. 
At this time, a personal unsecured loan is problematic due to your credit profile.  The main problem is your debt-to-credit ratio is reporting high on a monthly basis which is causing your credit worthiness to go down.

It’s not a cash out loan but its 0% interest, and It does not leave any 3rd party black marks on the credit like credit counseling programs or bankruptcy. It will also lower your monthly payments, pay off all your debt in just over 3 ½ years, and help improve your credit worthiness again. See below:

investing,"QCP - an event driven investing opportunity (""opportunity"")","I'll preface this with I haven't done significant amount of research on this to provide an actual recommendation, but I thought someone might have some additional insight they could add if they felt so inclined. I have not done any significant investment analysis before, so this should be taken with a grain of salt. I wholeheartedly recommend you do your own analysis as I would not endorse my numbers as they are back of the napkin type calculations. Additionally, it is not something I currently have a position in, but I'm watching it to see if it drops.

Quality Care Properties (""QCP"") is a recent (October 31st) spinoff of HCP Inc. They are both REITs that hold mostly hold post acute/skilled nursing properties. Think of these facilities as where you go to get rehab done on a broken hip or along those lines. I stress at this point however, they are NOT the operating companies of these buildings and only own the real estate. Currently, this is not a business you want to be in as it is downtrending significantly (operating post acute/skilled nursing facilities, not necessarily the REIT).

HCP spun of QCP because the portfolio QCP holds is almost entirely (94%) leased to a single tenant which at this point it is unclear if they'll be able to survive. HCP wanted to stabilize the results from the more consistent portion of its portfolio and split off the more volatile section. The tenant is HCR ManorCare (HCRMC). At this point, I'll re-emphasize HCRMC is not related to either QCP or HCP. HCRMC previously owned these properties, but completed a sale and leaseback in 2011 with QCP (HCP at the time). This informs one important point – the valuations you see on QCP’s books for real estate (outside of the held for sale assets) will be at the 2011 purchase price less depreciation. This suggests that the valuations shouldn’t be wildly different now than then, though you would expect some additional impairment due to the struggling nature of the industry. This will come up later. 

HCRMC is also currently run by a private equity company (the Carlyle Group) which as far as I can tell has a negative reputation for bleeding companies dry. Currently, there have been some reasonably significant concessions on the lease to HCRMC thus far.

The TL:DR; of the above is as follows: You can invest in a REIT currently leasing to a troubled tenant and if the lease ends up staying in similar terms as to what it is right now, you’re going to have a nice return. If it ends up out of business, or the lease significantly slashed, you’re not gonna have a great time. Now, to the numbers:

For the 9 months ended September 30, 2016 the QCP unit reported annualized free cash flow of $350 million. For a company with a market cap of 1.48B, this sounds pretty fucking sick. Well, now we get to the issues. First, as part of the spinoff, QCP took out 1.8 billion in debt and paid it out to HCP. This leads to a significant interest expense going forward as well as significant debt repayments in the future. Management said in the 10Q it expects to pay $252 million in interest in 2017 and 2018, $249 million in 2019 and 2020, and $296 million after that. This doesn’t help our distributable cash flows, but it’s not the worst. Here are my expected outcomes:

Rent doesn’t change (This won’t happen, but dare to dream right) – distributable cash flow is 23% of your original investment (were you to invest today)
Rent decreases by 10%, DCF is 20%
Rent decreases by 20%, DCF is 17%
Rent decreases by 34% (this was the amount used in the investor presentation – though specifically not meant to be used as a base for anything as noted by the CEO of QCP), DCF is 13-14%.

Just to establish the ranges above, since the 10Q was filed, there were the following temporary rent reductions given to HCMCR:
November 2016 – 12.5%
December 2016 – 25%
January 2016 – 37.5%
As you would likely agree with me, this isn’t promising.

The interest rate on the debt ranges between 6 to 8%, suggesting there are…some concerns about the success of this whole mess. Additionally, the $1 billion secured loan is variable rate debt which isn’t as friendly in what appears to be times of rising interest rates. The debt is all secured by the property as one would expect. In terms of covenants, the main one appears to be a minimum debt service coverage ratio of 1.75x. This gets violated if lease rates are cut by 50-60%, so there's a bit of room to get to this point for sure. If HCRMC goes bankrupt...there will be some bargaining.

So, the return is still pretty reasonable as long as I didn’t screw my numbers up (which I very well could have and fully endorse you to review as I am not remotely experienced with this).

Another fun little equity kicker if you think HCRMC will survive for the days to come. QCP owns 9% of HCRMC which is has conservatively valued at…$0. It tracks this investment using the equity method meaning the investment will stay at $0 unless HCRMC has actual income. Additionally, the income will only be added to the investment account balance if there are cash distributions from HCRMC.

Now, one other thing I didn’t mention if the possible equity got you a bit excited which will bring you back down to a normal level. HCRMC has also had false claims suit brought upon them (three in fact!) stating they were fraudulently claiming medicare expenses. This happened in 2015, but there is very little information I can find on any possible monetary effect of this. I reiterate, this is a suit against HCRMC and not QCP. 

Now, I think we’ve established we might not want to rely on future lease payments going forward, so I’d like to calculate a liquidation value for this if we are to get to that point. My initial thought is, even if HCRMC goes bankrupt, a separate operator would step in place for a decent portion of the leases as HCRMC is one of the largest operators in the industry and you cannot simply fail to replace that service to cover all the demand. Nonetheless, a basement for this would be nice.

The 10Q puts tangible assets at 4.6 billion which gives us a nice initial barrier as that suggests the equity book value is approximately 2.8 billion giving some wiggle room to get to the current market value. 3.9 billion of this is the buildings and improvements and 600 million is the land. I’d like to think the value of the land is an absolute floor here as the price of the land shouldn’t have really decreased since 2011. However, that doesn’t really help us at this point as the land is worth less than the debt at this point. I know pretty much nothing about how much these facilities are worth, however fortunately QCP actually sold some facilities in the last year that we can try and use for a proxy for the market value compared to book value.
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, 22 out of 50 non strategic properties were sold for $219 million with the remaining 28 properties being classified as held for sale. The total impairment charge relating to these properties was $47.1 million. Now, this isn’t that bad all things considered.  An impairment charge of ~1 million per property can still get us where we need to be to get a reasonable valuation. 11 additional sales were completed in the 9 months ended September 30, 2016 and a gain on these properties of $6 million was realized. This left 17 properties held for sale which gained an additional impairment of $21 million. Therefore, the net impairment through to September 30, 2016 was $62 million. Working backwards, the cost of these 50 properties was approximately $346 million, and the expected proceeds (realized of $281 million, expected of $65 million) which had a cost basis of approximately $408 million. This is a 15% decrease in value.

If we apply this 15% haircut to the book value over all properties, the real estate assets are worth $3.9 billion. Total tangible assets becomes $4.0 billion and our floor value is $2.2 billion still $700 million above the $1.5 current market cap. Now, let’s assume the properties they sold were actually pretty nice, had those cool chairs that let you go up and down stairs without having to climb the chairs, and the remaining properties are worth even less. Let’s increase the haircut to 30%. This suggests tangible asset value of $3.0 billion and equity value of $1.2 billion. In this case, we are now less than the market cap and there are some losses to be realized. However, I view this scenario as unlikely for the following reasons. QCP didn’t NEED cash when they sold these assets. They weren’t about to default. I don’t picture these properties as model properties that they sold to stay in business. You could argue that as the industry declines the buildings will be worth less. Perhaps, but there also will be an inflection point for the industry. There are more and more seniors coming of age every day and the property value could go up just as easily.

I view the risk as relatively limited because of this. You can go a bit more in depth and see what you think of HCRMC. There is some information in the 10Q about their current operations which is unaudited so you might want to take it with a grain of salt. I think there is significant possible upside if HCRMC pulls through without huge cuts (&gt;40%) to the lease.

Now...some references.

However, i'm looking to get a job on campus soon, and since my parents have been depositing money into my checking account (Bless them), I figured maybe it's time to get a credit card and get some benefits for spending money on groceries/hobbies. Right now I have one credit card with no fees that my mom cosigned with me, but she prefers I not use it. 

So far i've only looked at the Navy Federal credit cards (we bank with Navy Federal) and the cashRewards and GoRewards have caught my eye. The cashRewards card giving me 1.5% cashback on all purchases as soon as the transactions post on my account, and the GoRewards giving me 3 points on resturants, 2 points on gas, and 1 point on everything else, with me being given the points after each period. These cards have no fee's. 

As of now I am leaning towards the cashRewards, since I only spend about 50 max on resturants a month, and the rest on groceries/PC parts. I don't have a car and don't really need one/can afford one, so I don't spend money on gas. However, neither of these cards is having a promotion to spend $1000 within 2 months or anything like that to earn 20,000 points/whatever, so I was just wondering if there's anything else going on/has been going on constantly that is better. Im only looking to get a card up to 1000-1500 a month.

Thank you!",finance

dogecoin,Why we will be little more than a joke in cryptocurrency market. Let's have a real discussion and admit some truths.,"Well here we are years later and we are nowhere where we expected to be. No big surprise here because the ""joke"" coin is still pretty much that. and the reasons are simple. 

If you want to create a currency , it has to have value. 100billion coins is one thing. but because of an error in the algorithm we ended up with a leak of minable coins ..forever.  This single issue has kept the price of dogecoin depressed more than any other. For DC to be used as a currency it has to be worth more than a fraction of a penny. 

Now there are ways to do that, but the initial value must be worth the effort of creating a stub for business to take it . But because of the wisdoms of those who could initiate a fork, won't fix the eternal leak of coins. So you are stuffed with trying to sell a cup of sand on a beach.   

People don't realize that we have a leak. the minable coins are going to be forever.   And because of it the perception of value, real or not is based on rarity of something. and the people at DC who were (are) at the controls refuse or simply laugh at the idea that increasing value would be a good thing. 

Only reason that DC exists at this point is the community . but now even that is falling off in droves. we never made the kind of investments in getting into larger markets and instead put gobs of DC into Dogecar without any real return on the investment. 

You want to make DC worth something and actually used. Get rid of the leak to begin with. But let be honest. the guy who created the coin bailed as soon as it got serious and we are fading fast.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,"IRS writes telling me I owe more money for 2015, but I disagree to some extent","Greetings folks. I've subbed to of for quite some time and learned a lot about the important numbers in my life. Short summary, I'm 23 years old and I've been investing in my 401k for a few years now. I live with my girlfriend in an affordable rented house at the moment with hopes to buy in the next few years once I finish college. We both have a lot of student loan debt but I'm still finishing school and she's set up to pay hers off in 8 to 10 years. I have credit card debt I'm working to pay off. I work full time while going to school full time.

So, I get a letter forwarded to me from my old address yesterday from the IRS detailing that they believe I owe an additional 869 dollars in taxes. This is due to two reasons. 

The first being a ""forgotten"" 1099-c. Basically I settled on some credit card debt at the beginning of 2015 for a killer deal. I know it may not have been the best choice but it was my best option at the time. Now, I never received a 1099-c from the lender, but they obviously still filled it with the IRS. This was for 1300 or so dollars, of which is now unclaimed gross income.

The IRS only wants 120 bucks or so for this, but I'm not sure if I even have to pay it. Money is tight right now as I lost my job this fall for almost 3 months and I'm still recovering, otherwise I'd pay it. That said, I own a car worth 2000 bucks, a motorcycle at that time worth 500, various other knick knacks worth 5000, and some collectible paintball equipment worth 5000 when the market is good. On the other hand I have more than 60k in student loan debt, some private some federal, as well as some credit card debt at that time. To my understanding, that puts me in a state of gross insolvency, not requiring me to report form 1099-c for 1300 as additional income. I need someone with more knowledge to confirm that and guide me in the process to claim that I am insolvent in my response to the IRS.


The second and only other thing that they are claiming is a discrepancy with my education credit, specifically box 2 of my 1098-t from my university. The form essentially says that box 1 is the official number need but that box 2 is allowed by universities, but that box 2 is just what is charged to me and not necessarily what I paid. In this case it is indeed what I paid and I checked my university's financial summary for that year to confirm.

Does this mean I shouldn't owe the 700ish dollars that they're saying I do, and that in my response I should disagree and inform them that I did indeed pay those? Should I attach proof that my student loans were disbursed to pay those expenses? From where I'm sitting it looks like I was entitled to the education credit that I took, and indeed paid the expenses to my university that I claimed I did. Any expert help or guidance would be appreciated here.


I really appreciate any help offered to me. I couldn't find much information about getting a letter like this with my specific issues when I did my research, and I'd prefer to avoid involving a tax expert just to keep costs down.",finance
Forex,I'd like feedback on some amateur analysis. USD/JPY,"I'm new to this whole thing and only paper trading, but I'm gonna give this a go.

personalfinance,"Small windfall coming, making sure I'm doing this right.","I currently have some debt, nothing crazy. 90K left on my house, 20k in credit card, and 8k in a loan against my annuity. No car payment. The credit card sounds worse than it is. I recently had the house built and it went over budget, I had no choice but to add the money in somewhere. CC interest rate is 7.5%, ended up being cheaper than a personal loan. Also 4k of that is from an emergency room visit for my dog.

I have a check that is supposed to be here next month, in the form of a lease payment for a gas pipeline going through my property. $185,000. 


My plan is as follows:

Start with 185k. Put 50k in a CD, as I'll have to pay taxes in 2018 as income. Pay off everything, so 118k. That'll leave me with 17k. 

My wife and I share 4 cars. Newest is a 99, and 3 of them are close to 200k miles. One is a truck that gets 12mpg, so I don't count that in the 'work car' rotation. Another is a van that I use for work, but gets put in the 'work car' rotation as needed. 


With that 17k I was going to get us a new-to-us spare car, nothing over 3 or 4 thousand dollars, and replace my motorcycle. We ride together a lot, and last year spend about 30 nights camped off the bike. It could serve us more, but it's time. Currently a V-Strom 650 with 48K miles, hoping to find a lightly used Super Tenere. 


So basically spend the money to get out of debt, add a bit of reliability to the vehicle arrangement, and blow about 10k on a motorcycle.


I have a pension building through work, currently have 90k in an IRA and 35K in an annuity. 33 years old. Have been averaging between 60 and 80k per year income depending on how much I travel.

personalfinance,Keep my current home as a rental or sell?,"Currently I'm planning to move out of my first home in 6 months (in late June) and either sell or rent it out. Paid $113k for the condo 4 years ago and due to a slow market may only get me $115k-$116k now if I'm lucky (2 bedroom, 840 sq ft). Of course had to pay UPMI and closing costs that were bundled into the mortgage. If I sold now, after agent fees, I would essentially break even on the home given my equity over the last 4 years pretty much made up for the closing costs and some minor renovations. I have quite a bit of equity in the home (about 18%) but right now I am looking at it as an investment home for renting. Honestly not looking for net cash flow here but rather just to have someone pay my mortgage so I can have the home in 25 years as basically a free mini-investment account for me to sell and use as a small retirement fund (and more cashflow once the mortgage is paid off).

I've done some research on the topic and it seems to make financial sense I just want to get an idea from others with more experience if this is a good idea financially for me and any first-time renting tips.

Right now the place can rent for $1200-$1400 a month. My mortgage + landlord condo insurance + HOA + out-of-state landlord taxes is roughly $900 and will be $810 next year thanks to the cancellation of PMI. I found a decent property management company in the area (30 years in the business with decent reviews) that will manage it for $75/month + 1/2 first month of a new lease. I figured that at worst by renting at the lower end $1200 I can net $315/month (after PMI is cancelled, $225/month during the first year). However I will be setting most if not all of this money into a savings account for maintenance expenses and any possible vacancy issues (vacancy in my area is about 5%). Essentially of the $315/month I would put $100/month towards a vacancy fund, $115/month towards capital expenditures, and another $100/month towards general maintenance. This might be overkill and of course if this grows large enough I will use some of it for other investments. Being a condo, I am only responsible walls-in and the HOA fee pays for landscaping, trash, water, sewage, outside maintenance (like roof, gutters, powerwashing, parking, etc)

Does this seem like a financially decent plan? I'm curious to know if what the PM company is asking is decent? I've been quoted $75-$125 by a few companies and while this is the cheapest, he has good referrals and I felt most comfortable with him after chatting on the phone (also nice to know he's been doing this for 30 years).

Appliances are all fairly new, only 4 few years old including the furnace so any major maintenance is probably at least 10 years down the line (except for maybe a new carpet which might need to be changed in 3-5 years).

I can appreciate any advice anyone has, good or bad, thank you!

I know some hate landlording, but I will be out of state and relying on a PM company to take care of it for me. I realize this isn't always the best case scenario, but where I live this is very common given the fact it is a college town and also sees a lot of tourists (many rental properties here managed by many PM companies).

At the end of the day I'm likely over-estimating the maintenance expenses and might end up netting +$100/month cash flow, but even if I do not net any cash flow, the equity built every year on the home would give me roughly 11% ROI which is decent in my opinion. If I am able to rent it out for $1400/month, that will put me in the 20%-23% ROI range which is much nicer. My mortgage interest rate is 3.25% which is locked for 30 years (26 years left for pay-off); given my score is not as decent of a shape as it was when I got the place, I probably will not have another opportunity to get such a good rate in the near-future especially with the fed hiking rates now, so I want to keep this property simply for having such a good rate that likely will long-term beat inflation.",finance
personalfinance,"I've got a statement saying I've paid off a loan, but it turns out the provider never took the money - what should I do?","Back in September, I finally paid off a £3000 pound loan that I'd stupidly gotten from a same-day loan company. That interest rate was a terrifying 99% but I was desperate. 

I took out a 4% interest lump loan last year, and set about paying off my various debts. I just went through my list and paid and paid until all the money was gone, within the space of 24 hours. I know it sounds stupid, but because I was paying off so many different people, I didn't think to check my account after to make sure the money cleared. The 99% loan provider told me it had, so I just left it at that, happy to have that huge interest off my back.

According to the loan provider's site, and my online account, the balance I owe them is £0. However, I got a call back in December from the loan company, and apparently their computer system crashed the day I paid off. Although the system says I paid it off and I got an end of loan statement, no money actually left  my account.

Now they are chasing me for that money. My question: if they sent me a statement saying the money is paid, am I obliged to pay them? Where do I stand legally on this? Although I've had a phone call and email from them stating how much I owe, when I log into my account the sum is £0. 

It's so upsetting because I really thought I was in the clear. I'm determined not to get into debt again and only buying what I can save, but paying the lump sum will plunge me into debt again. What should I do?",finance

I am fortunate enough to have no debt.

personalfinance,Which loan do I pay off first?,"First time poster, thanks /r/personalfinance for all the help you've given this lurker so far.  Hopefully you guys can help shed some light on my current situation.

I have a rather uncommon debt situation, and I'm confused as to how I should prioritize my loans in terms of payoff time.

#Background

My primary debt isn't actually under my name.  It's a mortgage that my parents took out to cover my tuition.  They agreed to cover the interest on what was then an equity line of credit while I attended school, provided that I take over for making payments once I achieved stable employment.  They converted the LoC into a 10-year fixed mortgage at 3.5%, with a payment $1,603.  As soon as the remaining balance on the loan hits $35,000, my parents take over the payments because they used the LoC to pay for my mom's Hummer H3, and everyone agrees that this is not my responsibility to pay. ^(Although, a Santeria priest friend of my folks did predict that I would grow up successful enough to buy my mom her dream car...ymmv)

Secondary to that, I have just under $16,000 in subsidized student debt split up into 4 separate loans with interest rates ranging between 3.4% and 5.6%.  That debt is consolidated by Navient under a single $178 payment (they use a 10-year payment schedule by default, but there is no prepayment penalty).

Yes, my school was WAY too expensive.  Moving on.

I also have a 4-year auto loan at 2.99% with a $603 payment.

For all intents and purposes, each of these loans is 2 years old, so the car is half paid and the student debt is a fifth of the way done.

#Question

I feel like my best bet is to pay off that mortgage as quickly as possible because it's a huge payment that isn't helping me build credit.  It's also by far the largest debt expense on my plate right now.  To that end, I plan on making prepayments as soon as I save up enough to cover the last semester of my master's.  My entire bonus for 2016 will likely end up going to this loan.

Am I on the right track with this, or should I focus on paying off the two smaller loans first?  Will my credit benefit more from seeing less outstanding debt, or from having a longer credit history?",finance

personalfinance,"30s recently divorced guy drowning in debt, need help with a plan to get out of it!!","Hello r/personalfinance. I am a recently divorced guy in his 30s that is absolutely sick and tired of being stuck in the rut of overwhelming debt that I seem to be caught in. My ex was not a very responsible spender, and I was the only source of income while she sat at home doing nothing, and it never seemed to be enough. Pair that with several other life factors, and I find myself in a cycle of debt that I cannot seem to escape. I am getting a fairly sizable bonus from my employment at the end of January, and my plan is to use that money to start digging myself out of the hole I’m in, but I’m not entirely sure where to start. I will start with a detailed summary of the debt:

Credit Cards - I have a total of 4 that are carrying balances, two of them quite large:

1 - $10,900 balance. I am most concerned about this card, because there are several balance transfers that I used to shift some debt around to lower interest rates as I’ve slowly paid down this card. Once these rates expire, the interest will be absurd. Original transfer amounts and expiration dates are as follows:

- $6,025 – 3% interest expiring on 6/23/17

- $1850 – 3% interest expiring on 7/23/17

- $2700 – 5.99% interest expiring on 2/23/18

- $637 – 7.99% interest expiring on 1/23/18

2 - $4,700 balance. This card is locked in at a permanent 6% interest rate, so my thought was to pay this down first so that I can transfer some from the larger card as those balance transfer promos expire

3 - $1,030 balance with 0% interest until Dec 2017

4 - $2,400 balance

- $1,200 with 0% interest until Dec 2017

- $1,200 with 0% interest until June 2019

Student Loans - $33,000, with a minimum monthly payment of $320. There are two consolidated loans, one with $12,000 and one with $21,000, and the consolidated interest rate is 6% from when I consolidated the loans a decade ago. I deferred the loans for several years due to financial difficulties, so interest accumulated… I’m finally paying into principle, but the payoff date will not be until 2029 if paying the minimum throughout.

Now that that ugliness is out of the way, here are other relevant details.

Take-home pay in 2017 will be approximately $3950 per month. I may move positions or companies at some point this year, which could increase that numbers, but no guarantees of that.

My monthly fixed expenses are as follows:

- $1165 – apartment rent and water

- $100 – cellphone

- $30 – gym membership

- $400 – car payment

- $160 – car insurance

- $400 – child support

- $320 – student loan

My variable expenses are as follows. Estimates below:

- Electricity - $80 - $120 per month

- Gasoline – Approx $120 per month

- Groceries and toiletries – I try to go cheap here, but around $300 - $400 a month

Breaking it out like that, That leaves me with approximately $700 remaining, which is being sunk into credit cards… then I’m short on other things, such as if I want to take my girlfriend out or get some new clothes, so back on the credit card it goes. I need this cycle to stop and need a plan that will get me out of debt within my current means. I don’t really care how long it takes, as long as I’m making progress toward financial maturity and can start accumulating some savings beyond just my 401K and company equity. Not having an emergency fund has bit me in the ass in the past, and I want to change that.

So where do I start? I estimate that I will have between $6 – $7K to devote to paying off debt at the end of this month. I know that isn’t much compared to the amount of debt I currently have, but it’s a start right? My biggest concern is the card with the large balance that has expiring promo rates, so I’m all ears as to how to best attack this debt to lessen my risk and expedite paying it off.

EDIT: I really appreciate all the responses and advice. If I came across as entitled in any of my post or comments, I apologize and that's not who I am. I'm reaching out because I KNOW my ability to manage money has not been good up to now. I'm willing to sacrifice. I should be able to cut out a lot of the cellphone very soon when my contract is up in April. 

The dates and clothes are gone... my girlfriend is very understanding about not spending money I don't have, it's usually been me feeling bad and wanting to take her somewhere. 

As for the car, I will see what I can do. A quick check shows there's about a $3000 gap between my lease buyout and my car's market value right now, so I think I may be stuck unfortunately. I have learned my lesson. 

Getting a roommate is really non-negotiable for me right now. I understand where everyone is coming from and realize the benefits, but I just can't. This goes beyond just a personal preference. When my lease is up, I may downsize... unfortunately, apartments are expensive near my workplace.",finance
personalfinance,Seeking basic investment advice; About to payoff mortgage,"Greetings PF. I've been a lurker here for quite some time and am using a burner account. We're in the 24-35 age category and my wife and I are about to pay off our $500k house that we purchased five years ago at a 3.875% mortgage interest rate (mortgage was for $400k). It's currently being rented to a lovely couple and we intend to continue renting the property long term. As of this writing there is still approximately $60k left on the mortgage as we sought to aggressively pay off the house as fast as possible - mortgage + principal payments have been in the $15k range in the last few months. We wanted to pay it all off in one swoop before the end of January 2017.

Just a few moments ago I sold approximately 200 shares of AAPL, about 4,000 shares of PKO, and about 150 shares of MIC, resulting in a little north of $100k that will take a few days to transfer to my bank account for the final mortgage transaction. I'll have approximately $40k remaining and am seeking your advice in how best to grow. Without guidance, I was going to squirrel away at least half of it in something like SPY or ONEQ or VIG, (or something else index-y), while placing the other half in an ETF that is maybe more dividend/short-term growth oriented. I got out of AAPL and MIC because I felt they were a little too volatile for my taste at the moment. I dumped PKO because of lack of faith in the fund's management after Gross' departure last year and this year's end of year dividend continues a 3-year downward trajectory, but I'm not a professional so I'm basing this all on a 'feeling.' In the next two years we're hoping to save up another $200k for a 25-40% down payment on a house at the end of 2018 and this $40k could help contribute to this goal and bump the accrued down payment to ~$250k.

Additional context: Both my spouse and I work full time and have been pushing maximum contributions to our TSPs each year into TSP's L2050. We're holding on to approximately $30k in cash for our emergency fund, which should cover us for about a year. Both our vehicles are fully paid off (and actually gifted to our parents) and we don't have any other loans. No other debt of any kind.

TL;DR: Mortgage eliminated and extra funds on hand. Retirement and emergency funds secure. Have approximately $40k and seeking PF's advice on how to grow this money. Thanks for your time!",finance

personalfinance,Looking for advice on how to balance my finances,"Hi /r/personalfinance! First off, wanna say thank you very much because the side bar has helped me tremendously in figuring out where I am, financially. It has also helped me plan out some of my financial goals, as well. Background:

- 23M, 65k (around $3800/mo after 401(k)) income
- Spend around $2200/mo
- $1200 between checking &amp; savings
- $6.6k in 401(k), where I contribute 5% and employer contributes 3% automatic - increases to 6% automatic after 4 years
- -$2400 credit card debt @ 20.24%
- -$27.5k @ 6.02% Sofi Refi Loan of 
- -$30k @ average 4.6%  Federal (Sub &amp; Unsub) Loans


Basically, I planned out how I would aggressively attack my loans and pay them off within 4 years. But then life happened and I found myself with a hefty amount of credit card debt and also little in savings. How would you suggest I go forward? Paying off high interest CC vs. build up an emergency fund vs. paying down student loans vs. investing in retirement. 

It was so much easier figuring out my ""student loan plan"" in college, before I had to go out to the real world and deal with my changing financial environment.",finance

personalfinance,Need Help Asking For A Raise,"So I don't know if this is the right place to ask, if not can someone please point me in the right direction?


I'm currently a General Manager for a store in a relatively large gas station chain. We are opening 2 new locations in town and I have been offered the bigger of the 2 but I'm not sure how much of a raise to ask for.


I'm currently making $32,000 a year (not counting bonuses &amp; benefits). This store is just your run of the mill convienent store, nothing special. The new store is going to be on a highway (most likely busier as Route 66 runs through this area and its enroute to the Grand Canyon), is going to have a sandwich restaurant similar to Subway that I'll also be in charge of, an automatic car wash, and offer bulk propane...as well as be budgetted for about 16 employees (my current store only has 7 when fully staffed so roughly doubling there.)


The town I live in also just passed a minimum wage hike going from $8.05 to now $10, jumping to $12 in July &amp; continuing about $1/year until it hits $15/hour.


Does the minimum wage increase have any bearing on how much I ask for? Anyone have any resources I could use or specific suggestions?


Sorry for the massive amount of text. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Edit: The minimum wage part was just a small small part of this, I didn't know if it had any bearing on asking for a raise when I move to the new store or not. I know now it doesn't &amp; the primary reason I'm asking for a raise has everything to do with the increased work load, set of knowledge and skills associated with the new location and virtually nothing to do with the minimum wage increase.",finance

personalfinance,26 Year Old/72K Income/Married/Baby/New House - General Advice/Reassurance?,"Hi all - I've been poking around this sub. and have found some incredibly valuable information, but most cases seem to be somewhat extreme (high debt, change of lifestyle, etc.) and I'm looking for some advice or reassurance that I'm not in over my head with my financial situation, although it can be considered a vanilla ""American Dream"" type situation.


Here are the vitals:  
Income: 72K annually (take-home of about $4.5k monthly)  
Checking: 4.5K  
Savings: 3K  
529 for baby's college: 10K  
Roth-IRA: 20K  
Car: 10K left on loan at 0.9% (pay $334 monthly)  
Mortgage: Bought house with 20% down + bought down interest rate for first 2 years of the mortgage (2% in year 1, 1% in year 2, full rate of 3.625% starts in year 3). Current monthly payment is $1250 (including taxes + insurance), and year 3 expected monthly payment is $1470).
Budget: I actively use Mint to categorize transactions and maintain  my budget of $3900, resulting in savings of about $600 per month.  

Additional Background: Grew up very comfortably, parents never worried about money or discussed it. I wasn't financially independent from my parents until I graduated college in 2012 and started my career. At that point, my expenses were a small percentage of my income, and eventually married and had dual-incomes. We never lived on a budget, but I always had saving in the back of my mind. Since then we've had a child, gone to a single income and just bought a house, and obviously priorities have changed.

My question: Is saving $600 per month enough (personally this makes me a little uncomfortable)? Is this just a perception/habit issue? I realize this is a subjective question, but I'm basically looking for assurance that I didn't get in to deep with the house I purchased.  

My savings will reduce to $400 once my full mortgage payment kicks in (34 months from now). I do expect my income to rise (traditionally 7% annually), but I'd prefer not to assume that will continue. Based on what I've read, I want to get my liquid savings up to around 14K as an emergency fund and then pay off the auto loan as fast as possible to add some breathing room on a monthly basis.

I live at home and will commute to work via railroad and subway. Railroad will cost $250 a month, subway $112.

I am on my parent's health insurance. But since their plan does not include dental, I will purchase a VERY good dental plan from my employer.

I want to move into NYC ASAP because living at home sucks.

About a month ago I spent some time reading IRS publications and worked through my Federal and State 1040s, as well as the different schedules specific to my investing and income situations (both are pretty simple since I'm new to the workforce). I used the 2015 versions of everything just so I could get an estimate and do some financial planning. Working through the forms manually was a little time consuming, but overall I enjoyed it (among other things, I've studied some accounting). 

So the question is: Is there anything stopping me from filling out and submitting my official 2016 forms manually? It seems so straightforward, the instructions are all right there on the forms, and any further questions are addressed in the publications (and CFR legalese if it comes to that).

A lot of this will be relevant background information setting up the question. I'm a freshman in college at a ~$24,000 a year state university. My dad was in the air national guard and never used his post 9/11 GI Bill benefits which had now transfered to me. 

He's saving the housing portion of the benefits for when my sister goes to college and is using the tuition assistance for me. This has effectively lowered semester payments to $4,000. Through grandparents putting money in grandchildrens accounts before their death and saving from early on, I have roughly $16,000 currently saved. This is where my question comes in.

Should I still take out the minimum FAFSA loan of $5,500 for freshman students and continue to take the loans out as I continue my education because of the low interest rates? I currently have a job and am continuing to save my money and should be able to come out of my 4 year track with minimum to no debt, but my dad is suggesting to take these low interest loans out to have money later in life. Is this a good idea?

personalfinance,Quick question about automatic payments,"I just paid off a credit card at a fairly atrocious interest rate (hooray!) and I had a few things set up to automatically bill to it.  

One of those things I can't get off, because I don't have the right password.  It's my dad's iCloud storage, which has been a lifesaver the few times he's broken his phone, so I definitely want to keep it going, but I also don't want to ask him his password because I don't want him to actually know that I pay money for this service (he's cheap and would just want to do without).  It's $0.99 a month.  

If I just leave that alone, with the card itself set to auto pay out of my checking account, is there any potential for a long-term problem?  Is there any downside to leaving it this way instead of switching the original payment to my debit card or my ""everyday"" credit card?  Will the card bank have a problem with me using and paying $0.99 every month?

To my eye this seems like a good plan because it keeps the card active which helps keep my utilization rate lower, even though I've shredded the physical card and don't intend to ever actually use it again.

I come parents of very modest means and even more modest financial know-how, and am only in the position I'm in because of (some) work and (much more) good luck.

My annual income varies, but in 2016 I made about $182k gross. I expect to make a similar amount (or slightly less, as I picked up some extra work last year) in 2017. I contributed 7% of my income to a company 401K, which I've increased to 8.5% for 2017. My employer contributes a non-fixed amount to my 401K based on company earnings, which has historically been as much as or more than my contribution. Right now in this account I have $72k. I have another $74k in a 403b account from a prior job. I have about $24k in cash (in a couple of checking and savings accounts), but about $10k of this is already committed to a new HVAC system for my home. 

I bought said home in 2015 for $180,000 with 10% down. My mortgage is a fixed rate 30yr at 4.125%.  My mortgage payment, including PMI, is $1250, and I pay an extra $200 a month towards principle. I currently owe $154,500 on the house. I still have $17,700 in federal student loan debt at various interest rates from undergrad and grad school. I've been aggressively paying this down (typically an extra $400 a month towards the higher interest rate loans). I have four credit cards, but I pay them in full every month. They're mostly used to finance work expenses that get reimbursed. 

If you were me, what you prioritize? I feel like right now I'm trying to do *everything* at once, and it's a bit overwhelming. My goals are to a) pay off my student loan debt, b) save for future home improvements ( I'd like to sell the house in 5-8 years, and I know it needs a gut kitchen renovation) c) bolster my emergency fund d) invest a bit more wisely. As I said above, I don't come from a sophisticated financial background. Would it be best to stop paying extra towards my mortgage principle until I pay off my student loans in full? Is there any benefit in rolling my old retirement account over into an IRA? Should I pay my debt off more slowly but max out my 401K contribution? I typically try to save $1500 a month out of $9000 take home -- is that anywhere near enough? Right now my emergency fund / home improvement fund are just sitting in a checking account. Should I move some of that money somewhere that I can earn some interest on it? Is there some big picture thing I'm missing? 

Again, I hope this is appropriate. I have considered going to a financial advisor and asking these questions, but I'm really reluctant to shell over $$$ for what seem like they should be common sense answers.

financialindependence,"The Over-Optimizer, Part 1: My plan for 2017.","Hello everyone!  I've been doing some fun things lately, and I think I'd like to talk to the sub about it.  I'm essentially going to embark on an experiment to obtain FI as fast as possible.  Mr. Money Mustache may not approve, but let's see what we can do!


If this is too long- **SKIP TO THE TL;DR.**


-------------------

**About Me**

I live in a smaller city.  It's somewhat difficult to *get out* of a smaller city- your money doesn't go nearly as far.  I'm also in a weird position- I'm at a well-paying IT job at a local big company that keeps jobs very stable.

In other words, I'm in a safe position.  However, I'm also in a weird, somewhat specialized, position where I'm not really useful anywhere else- i.e. I don't have much advancement in front of me.  And I'm already at one of the best IT employers in town, so I'm nervous to shop around jobs, especially when I've been maintaining specialized systems most other places don't use.  So, I've played it safe- and probably missed out on pay increases through the normal ""advancement through switching jobs"" a lot of professionals get.

So, today, I'm 28, and I make about $60k/yr.  Here, where a 3 bed/2 bath house rents for $800/mo, that's really comfortable.  But I also feel somewhat ""dead-end"" in my career, and I frankly don't get satisfaction out of it.  I'm tired and burnt out of the grind.


Over the last few years, I started going through a process of optimization of the concept of FI.

Most of you focus on optimizing savings rate, because it's the low hanging fruit- and I agree that it's absolutely the first thing anyone should do.  But I looked at optimizing the return.

""Ok, it would take me 15 years to retire at 7% interest rate.""

""What if I made it 8%?""  ""Okay, now how do I make it 8%?""

""What if I made it 9%?""  ""Okay, now how?""


**So, I'm going to tell you my story up until now.**

--------------------- 


**Optimizing my first property.**

Back in 2010, when there were so few buyers, I bought a foreclosed house off the MLS for $55k, with 20% down (so $45k mortgage).  I work full time, so I hired out the work it needed.  I spent $10k fixing it up, and slapped a renter in it for $800/mo.  Then, take off $150/mo for taxes/insurance.  And, for the sake of being conservative, let's take off 1 month's rent for potential vacancies. End profit is $7k/yr.


Total cost: $65k.

Total profit: $7k per year.

Theoretical ROI including vacancy allotment: 10.7%.

I'm beating the stock market, right?

But the bank loaned me $44k at ~4.5%. (They gave me a higher rate because I was young and it's an investment property.  I should have shopped around more, I probably could've got 4%.)

So, I only put $20k of my own money in to the property.  But I'm paying $230/mo in principal and interest.   Subtracting the mortgage payment...my $7k/year goes down to $4.25k/yr.

But my total investment:
$20,000 cash for $4,250 per year (assuming 1 month vacancy per year) - that's a **21.25% return.**

The house, meanwhile, is worth $90k after this work.  So technically, I *gained* $25k in net worth by doing this, and am making a 21.25% cash-on-cash return.

*But there's still more.*  The house also appreciates- at **least** 2% per year for inflation, but in a growing city, usually more.  I don't like to count on appreciation- over-reliance on it lead to the housing crash- so I ignore it in my calculations.  But in a flat market, houses would still get 2% with inflation, and in a growing market (which my small city is), it's even more.  That's 2% of the *entire value* of the 90k property- I only paid $20k for the property, so I'm getting, in theory, an additional 9% per year in appreciation on my money.

*And*, remember, I'm paying $230/month in principal and interest.  Technically, that's paying down the loan, so that's money in my pocket when I sell it.  Over 30 years, I'll gain $44k from principal payments, which averages to $1,333/year in principal- **if** I keep the house for the entire 30-year duration, I'm actually making an extra ~7% on my $20k purchase in principal.

So in theory, we're looking at between 30% and 37% per year depending on how long I hold the property, and possibly more if the local housing market grows faster than inflation.  22% return in direct cash, and the rest when I sell.

*And it still gets better!*  Rents in my area have increased since then, and the property is now renting at $900/mo.  That brings me up to 26.75% cash return, or over **40% per year** average over 40 years when you include inflation appreciation and paying down the mortgage!

*And* I'm not even counting the tax advantages from property ownership and interest!


**Okay, but I got lucky because this was 2010, right?**

Yes, actually, I did.  You can't go and buy a property like that right off of the MLS anymore- too much competition.  Yet, at the same time, I got better at finding better deals.  Real estate wholesalers and bird-dogs give me most, and sometimes word of mouth, and maybe soon, even auctions.  Bird dogs are people who scout and find houses that aren't listed on the market for you, and you give them a couple thousand for doing the legwork and negotiating and delivering it to you.

The trick is to have the mentality of a flipper.  You're going to buy a house you can flip, but you're not going to flip it- you're going to fix it up and enjoy the sweet, sweet free net worth increase.  Why?  Because flippers have to pay taxes and sale fees on the payout- but by holding it, you don't!

The second trick is to *not* have the mentality of a flipper- you also have to analyze the return on the rental *after* the repair.  If you buy a house for $200k, fix it up, and it's worth $300k, but it only rents for $1300/mo- you might as well have flipped it.

That leaves you with a pretty narrow range of properties that actually work for you, but you can take your time.



**But I can do better!**

Can I beat that 20% return on my cash investment?  C'mon, that's not possible, right?

But...wouldn't it be nice if I could borrow *more* money at 4-5% interest and put it in properties that are giving me 10% return (after expenses and vacancy)?

Well, it's doable.  I actually came up with this system on my own- and later found out that the investment community actually has a name for it.

The trick is to buy a house that works, on paper, for both a rental, and a flip, as I described above.

Then, *buy the house 100% in cash* (Hey, our FI savings suddenly come in handy here!).  Then, fix up the house.  Then, go to a bank, and ask for a cash-out refinance (basically, a retroactive mortgage) on the *new* value.  Banks will give up to 75% of the value.

So, if I'd done this for the first house:

Buy the house for $55k cash.
Spend $10k fixing it up.
It's now worth $90k.  I've spent $65k.
Refinance for $67k cash out. (Probably will lose 2-3k in fees.)

I have now spent between 0-1k to obtain the property.  The mortgage will be about $500/mo *including* taxes and insurance.  Put the renter in there for $800.  Total return?  Only $2,800 annually (including vacancy).  But cash on cash return?  Between almost 3000% and infinite.  Because you invested almost nothing.  And when you throw in the appreciation and the mortgage paydown over 30 years- the numbers are mind boggling.

Again- this is assuming at least one vacant month a year, which is higher than average.  I'm also not including property management in this, which is usually 10% of gross rents.  Property managers, which I'll eventually need to use, will make the numbers slimmer- but they still are good numbers.  On this house, it would cost $960 annually.


Now, it's harder and harder to find deals this perfect- I might end up out of pocket by a couple thousand, but I'm still looking at insane return rates that will be in the 70-100% range.  And if I find a property that makes sense as a flip but not rent- I'll flip it and save the money.


This strategy is called BRRR- Buy, Rehab, Rent, Refinance.

**So what have I done with this?**

I own a duplex which I live in, and the rent pays for the mortgage.

I own the first house I bought, example above.  $44k mortgage, it was worth $90k.  Since 2010, it has appreciated and is worth $120k, and now rents for $900.  $4k of the mortgage has been paid off, so I've averaged $600/month in principal as a bonus.

I bought two more properties with the BRRR strategy.  In each case, I got *really close* to all of my money back- I was only out a couple thousand dollars.  In each case, the houses rented for enough to *almost* cover the mortgage PITI twice over.  (Think $800 rent/$500 mortgage)  In each case, I gained 25% equity on the purchase.  In each case, the properties have appreciated by *25%* over the last three years.

Then, I started having problems getting more loans.  My bank wouldn't allow more than 4 financed properties.

In the last two years, I did two profitable flips.  But after realizing the appreciation gains, and after finding a local lender that will do 10 financed properties and portfolio loans, I'm going back to the BRRR strategy.



So, overall, I've done one house per year since 2010.  I've flipped two, and BRRR'd two.  The BRRR ones have blown away anything I could imagine on the stock market.  Why?  Because I was willing to put effort- or pay for someone to put effort- in to finding below-market properties.

My net worth today?  $300k.  I've never made more than $60k, and I've only been making that much for a couple years.  I'm married as well, and my wife currently does not work.  And I didn't discover the FI lifestyle until 22, and I'm still trying to implement it better every day.


--------------------------




**So, what about 2017?**

Y'know what?  I've been taking this too slow.  This low interest won't last forever.  I don't have to worry about seasoning requirements with my portfolio lender, so I'm going to go crazy.

My plan:

I'm taking out HELOCs on my primary residence and if possible the rental properties with a lot of equity.  Combined with my cash savings, I should be able to purchase and rehab two homes at a time.  My wife can manage it while I am at work.

I'll continue to live frugally, and save 30-50% of my work income.  Meanwhile, I'll save 100% of my rental income.  Meanwhile, I'll keep picking up properties.  If the rents make sense, I BRRR; if they don't, I flip.

I intend to hit 100% ROI on my cash overall.  If I end up out $3k on a property, I should be bringing at least $3k/yr in profit.  This is without a property manager, whom I might hire at some point and accept a lower ROI.


My goals for 2017:

*Flip or BRRR at least two houses, maybe three.* **or** *Pick up an apartment building.*

*Increase net worth by $100k.*


If Reddit is interested, I will continue to post updates with each property and track how much work it takes me and how fast it goes.

**Pre-emptive rebutal:** ""But this is how we got a housing crash- investors betting on appreciation and overleveraging themselves!""   That's not exactly what I'm doing here.  I don't account for appreciation when I buy- I only buy properties that pay for their own mortgages *and then some*.  Even if the housing market crashed, they have a safe cushion.  (And rents don't always crash when values do.)  

The main difference is, frankly, that I'm borrowing money at 4-5%.  I want to gobble up as much as I can before rates go up too much.  Before the housing crash, people would borrow money at 7-8%, and barely cover their mortgage with rents but count on appreciation.  When the houses declined, they were underwater on value and losing money on the mortgage.


**My current status:** $1600/mo in rental income.
 
**My overall goal:** Generate $4-5k per month in total rental income.  Set aside $1-2k/mo for expenses and vacancies, $500/mo for health insurance, and live on $2.5k/mo.

Once this is achieved, I'll declare myself FI.

I'm starting the timer on myself today to see how fast I can get there.  I need to do it before rates are too high. And I'll post here to keep me honest.





**tl;dr:**  I buy distressed houses, fix them up, put a renter in, refinance to get my cash out, and I have a free house that cost me nothing and pays for it's own mortgage, plus some cash in hand and a $20-40k net worth boost.  I'm building up systems to be able to work on multiple at once.  I want to pick up multiple houses in 2017 while spending $0 from my pocket at the end of the day if possible.",finance

the past 4 years, I have been paid $1120 per month from a part time second job.  which made my yearly income a little more than $54,000 per year  I have since lost this job which drops my income to $39,000 per year.  I am able to pay my bills with this loss and I have a healthy savings.  besides my bills, which are as low as I can reasonably get them for this area, I pay $435 on a loan which is now about 11,000 remaining.  also I have a credit card with a $1200 ballance.  I am possibly going to be out of a job in the next 6 months due to my company being sold.  if this happens, I am going to move to another state where unemployment and cost of living is very low.  in this case, I want to refinance my loan to extend it out another 5 years, cutting my monthly payment in half.  should I refinance this now, while my reported income is still $54k per year, or wait till I find out if I will be fired, when my 6 month income is 39k per year?  


my credit score is about 800 points.  I also have a car loan with about 4k left on it, monthly payments are $120 per month.  I think I should leave this loan as it is, since the interest rate is 2.25% vs my loan which is currently 8%.",finance

personalfinance,Is there a way to get one bank to buy a specific mortgage note from another bank?,"Hi, /r/personalfinance!

I'm in the process of a divorce and I want to keep my mortgage terms the same. Unfortunately, my rate is 2.75% for a 15-year loan term, and rates have gone up since I bought the house. I just want to get my wife's name off of the mortgage without having to eat $5-6k in closing costs and/or suffer from an interest rate increase.

So I figured I would ask my bank to just take her name off of the promissory note, given that I've been making the payments on my own for the last year with no trouble. Unfortunately, they told me that they can't do that and the only way to get her off the mortgage would be to refinance.

Maybe some of you are aware, however, that banks sell mortgage notes between themselves. And some banks might be willing to remove my wife's name from the mortgage/promissory note without changing the terms of the loan, if it means they keep getting those sweet interest payments. 

So my question is, is it possible to get another mortgage lender to buy my specific mortgage out from my current mortgage holder? I feel like this should be possible but I'm running into brick walls talking to different lenders. Any help from you guys would be greatly appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,20. I'm a student dealing with a volatile home situation and need to move out of my parents' house,"Some background: 

I'm currently 20 years old. I attend community college in NJ. I used to attend Syracuse University and my dad took out a Parent PLUS loan to fund it. After a year of extreme depression and average grades, I decided to move back home. I currently work two jobs for a total of 30-40 hours a week and am a full-time student.

My dad is an alcoholic. He is drunk every night and has a history of causing family problems. Recently he's started to target me during his drunken rages. I would rather not go into details, but my life at home has been made a living hell. Due to the constant abuse going on in this house, I can't live at home anymore for the sake of my own mental and emotional health. My mom and sister support me 100% in this move.

The problem is that I take out loans to afford college and my dad also has a huge loan taken out in his name from my one year at Syracuse. These weren't smart financial decisions at all, but I'm trying to dig myself out of a hole and need your guys's help. 

I need to move out as soon as possible, but I need to do it in a way where I don't end up coming back home after a crash and burn. I also need to get a car so that I can get myself to and from class and work. Additionally, I need to help my dad pay off my Parent PLUS loan. Payments won't be due till I graduate (which isn't for another 2-4 years), but I want to make some headway and the sooner I pay it off--the less power my dad has over me.

Here's the financial breakdown:

* I make $15.50 an hour as an administrative assistant at a nearby non-profit. I am allowed to work up to 30 hours a week, but based on the work available for me it varies from 20-30 hours a week. 
* I also work as a delivery driver 2-3 nights a week (as much as I can), where I make anywhere from $12 to $20 an hour.
* I currently owe my sister $210 because she helped me pay off a financial hold at my college.
* I owe my dad $600 because he helped me with a tuition payment. He's allowing me to pay it off in increments of $100 from January to June.
* I pay $22/month for a gym membership, and $25/year for a music streaming service.

Here are the loans taken out in my name:

* Direct subsidized stafford. Principal: $3500. Interest rate: 4.66%
* Direct unsubsidized stafford. Principal: $2000. Interest rate: 4.66% Interest balance: $203.65
* Direct unsubsidized stafford. Principal: $5500 Interest rate: 4.29% Interest balance: $241.83

Here are the loans taken out in my dad's name: 

* Direct Parent PLUS 1-01. Principal: $43,222.00 Interest rate: 7.210%. Interest balance: $6,812.80
* Direct Parent PLUS 1-02. Principal: $2,818.00 Interest rate: 7.210%. Interest balance: $3,170.23

Here are steps I've already taken:

* Minimized my expenses. I found I was eating out a lot and buying frivolous shit that I shouldn't be eating. Now I try to keep it so that I can eat out once a week, no more.
* Meal prep / doing groceries. This is pretty self explanatory but changed my life around.
* Stopped making frivolous trips and using up more gas than necessary (I used to be obsessed with my social life)

I've been lurking this sub for a lot, and I understand very well the concepts that are on the road to financial literacy, but I need help putting together a roadmap of what to do, how much to save for a car, how much to save for rent, when I'll be able to feasibly move out, etc.

If you guys could lend me any advice, that would be greatly appreciated.",finance

______

Notes: 

I Just cut down my auto insurance as much as possible to (100/300/100) without leaving too much risk got this to $112 per month for 2 cars one with collision. Also this is assuming I cancel my LTD insurance policy which is $43 per month. I don't absolutely need it since I have a policy at work. My term life is $36 per month for $1M I am planing to keep that.

By far the biggest area is the Other / Spending Money. This budget assumes I cut that back from the current $1,600 per month. I know that sounds crazy maybe I didn't realize how crazy until I sat down and figured this out. It is basically money for any and everything that is not explicitly budgeted above (Gas, eating out, entertainment...). I am sure the first recommendation is going to be to cut this even more lol.

The cell phones are for two phones including paying off the phone themselves. There is nothing I can do about these until the contract runs out / gets paid off.  

-------

Assuming the budget above I calculate it will take two years to pay off the credit cards (dam that is a long time). Which would leave about another year for the student loans. 

This fall my wife is going back to work full time so the income should go up by about $1,000 per month. Also next summer we will are planning to move which will increase the home costs but will eliminate the child care expenses (since we can use public schools). That should also be a net gain or at worst about even. 

I was going to pay the highest rate stuff first. The one card at 23% has the lowest balance anyway so that was a no brainier.

personalfinance,Advice needed: barely start to save for house down payment now or aggressively pay off car first?,"Hey, Happy New Year! It's my first post but I've certainly learnt a lot in my 1 year of occasionally reading posts in here. About me: 25/M, DFW area TX, Salary ~ 40k gross (plus ~10k from OT). Rent + Utilities ~ 25% of salary (shared house). Car ~ 10% of salary if minimum payment (15k owed and 4 years left). Credit cards are usually paid off or Utilized below 10% . 3 month emergency fund (plan on increasing this to 6 months this year). No dependents. No student loans.


Exactly 1 year ago I bought a new to me car (it's 3 years old) and despite having a low interest rate (3%) for a first time buyer with no cosigner I hated seeing that i owed that much so I was aggressive with my payments and spent ~20% of my salary on car payments.

Well now I've changed jobs (same salary) and i commute a lot more (65 Miles round trip) so anywhere between 1-2 hours of my day is gone pending traffic. I'm thinking about moving closer to work (Downtown Dallas) but anything even remotely decent is 35% of my salary or more. And I can't commit to spending that much money on rent knowing there's no future returns or tax breaks to be had.


So I am thinking about saving for a house down payment in say 2-3 years. The TX minimum down payment is~4% but I'm thinking 10 maybe even 15% down would be nice.

personalfinance,Future/Current College Students &amp; Loans,"Hello all,

I generally just browse this sub, but i felt like this needed to be posted for all the future or current students planning to take out loans. The simplest way i can put this to all students: (TL;DR) PLEASE HAVE SOME KIND OF HAND IN YOUR LOAN ACQUIREMENT PROCESS. 

I know this sounds like the most simple concept in the world, but hear me out. 

I graduated in 2014 with just under $90,000 (5 years) in loans. During the loan process both my parents told me to take it easy; loans would be set up by them and I should just ""have fun and focus on school"". Clearly the latter didn't happen as they had envisioned it because I was there for 5 years, but I digress. My parents are divorced so they ultimately decided to rely on my mother to handle the bulk of the responsibility- she would be able to acquire more aid due to financial hardship. 

My mother is a beautiful woman and I mean that, but she really fucked up. Out of the $90,000 in loans, $62,000 of that was private loans from Navient. Not even private student loans. Just Private. My interest rates for that loan range anywhere from 7.5-10% and I pay $400 a month JUST on interest. I'm sure my overall would be a little less, had there been more federal loans. I'm sure I accrued some interest while waiting for school to end.  The real kicker about these loans is that no one wants them. Not a soul wants to take them head on. Consolidation methods are futile, as is getting Navient to lower my monthly payment or interest. In fact, I recently had a change in jobs where I would be making slightly less than my last. After cycling through 6 different Navient representatives they decided to see if I would ""qualify"" for lowering payments or interest. Guess what? I didn't qualify. My only solution at this point for those loans are finding a sugar daddy but I'm not holding on to hope. 

So between Navient, Federal Loans, Car payment, insurance, living expenses, and what was rent (quickly learned that isn't feasible for the time being) I have roughly $100 a month to live on. I can get into details if anyone is interested but that isn't my point. 

MY POINT IS- pay attention to your loans. Don't turn a blind eye. It will hopefully save you some money, enlighten you on how loans work, help you adult at an earlier age, and give you an opportunity to live a life after graduation (by this I mean travel, treat your gf to something nice, buy VR for porn). God speed to anyone in this situation and good luck.",finance

personalfinance,Need advice on tackling a massive amount of debt. Also looking for info on financial resources for veterans.,"My husband and I are in serious debt. He is an unemployed veteran and I am a mid-level manager in customer service. Here's the story with incomes. 

When we were married we were at $80k combined with $10k saved (2010). Our station got changed and we ended up in temporary housing for six months and then moved across the country. I struggled to find a job for about three months and then landed a decent-paying job in sales that I hated. Savings wiped out but combined $90k. (2012)

We got our savings up to $5k when my car died. Spent $4k for a great car that still runs (paid in cash). This car is my one and only asset besides retirement, stock etc. I switched jobs and finally found one I hated less at $35k. 

We went on a ""free"" cruise (there's no such thing). Ended up -$1k.

My husband got hon discharged and took a pay cut at the new job (2014). Now we're at $85k, but that's a lot less than what he was making in the military given the lack of taxes on the majority of his income during that time. We struggled to adjust our income and over the course of two years ended up at -$8k. I had a mental health crisis which brought us to -$13k (2015). Then my husband lost his job last May. Obviously we were overspending for a lot of this; I'm aware this isn't a sob story about how disenfranchised we are.

We started having to pay for necessities with credit cards in about September. In December, my husband moved to the Pacific Northwest because there are more IT jobs there. I am staying here so that we have some income. Right now we are sitting at -$45,000. I made $40,000 last year, including bonuses and overtime.

By some miracle, we haven't missed any payments. I bring home about $980-$1040 every two weeks. I also contribute to my 401k up to the 5% match but I've been considering dropping it for now. My husband is a network engineer with a strong background and he has already been approached by several recruiters since he moved, but the hiring process can be long and we obviously can't bank on anything. He enrolled in school so he will be receiving the GI Bill (and getting an education, yay!) which will be about $2075. That starts Feb 1. He has no expenses other than gas, thanks to his wonderful family.

My first question is, are there any resources out there for veterans in this situation? A lot of the websites addressing this are defunct and he has been out of the military for two years at this point so we don't have contact with anyone on base. Plus there are no bases anywhere near where he's going. He is in contact with the VA through the school but if there are any other resources for veterans in financial difficulty out there, I'm very interested. He is disabled, but has not gone to get his rating yet, and I don't want to force him to if he doesn't want to.


Here is the breakdown. Income is about $4000 starting Feb 1.

Rent: $725

Electric: $75

Internet: $66

Netflix: $10

Car insurance: $110

Cell phones: $170


Credit Cards

USAA 1: $11554, min $219, 11.4%

USAA 2: $10709, min $198, 8.4%

Citi 1: $2231, min $30, 0%

Citi 2: $1656, min $34, 0%

Citi 3: $2775, min $67, 18.4%

Amex 1 and 2 (can't get specific details right now): $8207, min $200

Discover: $847, min $30, 14%

Chase: $2696, min $33, 19.24%

Car payment (for his car): $225

That puts us at about $1800. I also have medications I need which cost $200 every three months. My husband also went to the ER and I guess my crappy health insurance doesn't cover that, so we also have a $4,000 medical bill that will appear soon. As far as the GI bill, you don't get it year round, just when you are in school. The hope is that he will have found a job by then. The average income for his position where he is now is $80k and the jobs are abundant.

We are already working on seeing if we can lower internet and phone costs. $725 was the bare minimum I could find in this area where I wasn't probably going to get shot. I still feel unsafe in my current area but I'm living with it. I should have gotten a roommate, but the only people who contacted me/returned messages were guys and I really wanted to live with a woman instead. At this point, breaking the lease would be $1000 so I don't know if there's much I can do about the rent situation.

As far as food, I've been spending about $50 a week but I have gift cards/Christmas checks that go to that. I was originally using them for coffee but obviously I've cut that shit out. I have about $300 left for this purpose. I'm aiming for $30 for food per week. My boss buys us lunch, coffee etc. a lot and our breakroom has things for sandwiches/lunch at all times. He's a really generous and awesome guy. He has no idea he is basically keeping me out of poverty, lol. I really like my job which makes all this bearable. I don't think I could handle a second customer service job where I had to face people. I don't want to devote time to a trade right now because ideally I'll be moving to where my husband is soon. I don't have a landline which exempts me from a lot of at-home positions. I don't really have any marketable/creative skills. I don't drink so I have that going for me I guess. I'm trying to keep my mental health on track.

Like I said before, we don't want to declare bankruptcy. Mostly because it would be very bad for his career, and the majority of the debt is in his name (only about $4k in mine). No negative marks on our credit at all with the exception of high utilization; his is 670 and mine is 730. We have $70k total credit which has been keeping the utilization manageable. I have no idea who thought we should be allowed that much credit. Rofl. Fuck.
 
Where should we go from here? Is debt consolidation a good option for us? What search terms should I be employing now? Who should I be talking to? At what point should we give up (when we start missing payments? after that? when payday loans start to look appealing? when we get sued?) I realize that people with less debt have struggled more than us, so I'm not sure how we've managed to come this far relatively unscathed. Most of our interest rates are fairly low; thanks military.

Any advice is welcomed and appreciated, we have no pride/dignity left anymore. Being in this much debt is a numb feeling.",finance

personalfinance,"after a year long effort to recover credit, one thing keeps failing to delete from experian","Hi PF,

Around May of last year I committed myself to repairing my credit, I signed up for some services, got some stuff deleted, contacted the creditors of the stuff that couldn't be deleted with letters and disputes, and paid for deleted all remaining credit items.  My credit score went from a 615 to a 750 on all 3 bureas [ http://imgur.com/a/V4Akn ](except experian which jumps up to 750 and down to 683 bi-monthly due to the problem listed below...)

One particular creditor, Cal Coast Credit Service, is giving me hell, they have (had) an old medical bill of mine. It turns out my SHIP insurance from the UC system didn't cover an office visit and I got stuck with 3 visits with no insurance adding up to ~$500. In college I was moving around a lot due to an extremely financially turbulent senior year of college, so I never got the bill. As I was going through my credit report via one of the services I paid for I found them, and their 1800 number. I contacted them, found out what the bill was for, unpaid medical bill from doctor x etc.. Then contacted my old doctor after a quick google search. They told me that the bill I was paying was inflated and apologized that things worked out badly with my insurance, I offered to just pay the bill outright if they would write a letter to get the collection agency to reporting it. They happily agreed and even sent me a little gift in the mail with a copy of the letter they sent the creditor. yay! the letter basically said that there was a mistake on their end, and they sent my account into collection by accident (as a result of the insurance snafu), and that they should stop reporting and cease all collection activity. I contacted them with this letter, they verified it with the doctor's office over the phone, then had the nerve to charge me interest on a portion of the debt in exchange for deleting it. It was a pretty small amount, and I paid it, I think like $15 or $30, can't really remember at this point. They agreed to stop reporting at that point. A month goes by, nothing happens, so I contact them again. They tell me I need to dispute all 3 to trigger the deletion process, so I did. It was then deleted from all 3 bureaus temporarily, but without me realizing, it popped back up on experian. I found this out as I was getting approved for a home loan today, it knocked my interest rate up 2.5% (Experian 703, transu 754, and equifax 752) Because of the experian score falling below 730 I was screwed into an interest rate I don't want to afford.

So at this point I am irate, I can't take the loan at the offered rate, so the purchase I was looking to make may fall through entirely. Naturally I pull my credit the moment I find out about the score, and low and behold it's Cal Coast again (I don't think I emphasized enough how many times I contacted them above). I contact Cal Coast again, and the guy I have been working with tells me there is nothing he can do. It's on Experian's end. I reach out to Experian, they say it's on Cal Coast's end. No one is willing to help. I contact Cal Coast further and explain to them how badly they are hurting me financially for something that was supposed to be deleted according to them and the original service provider. The guy tells me he is talking to someone, and she will take care of it, I think he was lying to get me off the phone, but I am not really sure.

After that I attempted to dispute the item again on Experian. It told me that due to some act I am not entitled to a redipute, but gave me the option to attach a secondary reason, and it seems like a dispute processed, I'm not really sure. I am probably going to contact Experian again and follow up  with them directly, but doing that in the past has been pretty useless, they won't even accept letters showing the debt should be disputed or phone numbers of the people they need to verify the debt is invalid.

Anyways, sorry for the wall, anyone have any further recourse? I am running out of patience for this and it's the very last negative item on any of the three credit reporting bureaus.

personalfinance,[Other] Help with a disputed charge on a Chase credit card.,"I filed a chargeback with Chase after a merchant missed a guaranteed shipping deadline on goods ordered for a special event on a specific date and would not refund my money. The goods came after the event; I wanted to refuse delivery and informed the merchant I expected a full refund, they told me to keep the goods. They are still unopened &amp; I am still willing to return if merchant pays the international return shipping.

Chase's chargeback policies specifically indicate that ""goods which arrived too late to be useful for a specific purpose"" is a qualifying cause for a chargeback. 

Chase issued a temporary credit to me and waited nearly 60 days (but not quite) to send me a certified letter on 12/23 (arrived to me 12/27 due to the holiday) notifying me that the merchant had provided delivery confirmation - which confirms delivery occurred after the special event - to prove that I received my goods, and therefore unless I provided additional documentation my account would be rebilled. They enclosed a UPS overnight envelope and asked I mail additional documentation for my case by 12/31.

I spent quite a bit of time printing out emails, invoices, and various communications confirming that the merchant had guaranteed shipping by a certain date, had not shipped until 5 days later (they didn't even *ship* my goods until the day of the event they were guaranteed to arrive for). I ended up with 12 separate pieces of documentation, so I numbered each and provided an index of documents. Feeling pretty good about this, I mailed the envelope 12/29.

On 1/2, Chase called me twice while I didn't have my phone on me, left an uninformative message, and when I called back, I was only able to reach first-tier Disputes support, which is unable to see the full case history - I couldn't reach the woman who called me. As far as I can tell, they rebilled my account because they didn't receive my documentation by 12/31 - the letter they sent me said to *send* it by 12/31, and of course there was a federal holiday in the middle. I don't know if they have now received it.

Chase support promised me a call-back within 48 hours from the higher level dispute support who can actually make decisions about my case. 48 hours have passed with no call. My account still has the charge &amp; I've been billed interest charges for the 60 days it was temporarily credited.

What are my next steps here? I'm willing to retain an attorney to fight this if necessary. It's a large amount and I used my Chase card to purchase specifically because I had suspicions about the merchant's ability to meet their guarantees for ship date on a tight turnaround &amp; knew that Chase's dispute policy covers items that are not shipped by a guaranteed date.",finance
personalfinance,Receiving a medical bill from the USA as a Canadian Citizen,"I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit, so please let me know where I should post if it's not. 

I'm Canadian who was on vacation the US in November. I had to make a medical clinic visit and paid the total bill out of pocket, and in full (I had travel insurance, but the cost was less than my deductible--that's a whole other story). I ended up paying about 300CAD for that visit. 

Anyhow, I received a medical bill in the mail today for a test that they did after I left the clinic (ie, urine culture) AND after they had already prescribed me antibiotics (so the urine culture wasn't exactly necessary). I'm hesitant to pay it as I thought I had paid the medical bill in full at the clinic; and I'm not even in the US anymore. I'm also a recent grad with lots of student loans and have just started working, so this surprise bill will put a dent in my budget. Oh, and my federal health care will only, and maybe pay a maximum of 75CAD for out of country medical bills.  Is the clinic allowed to do this? Any suggestions on what I should do?

personalfinance,Maxing out 401k before moving out?,"Hi,

I'm 26 years old and I accomplished a lot last year (2016) financially:

1. Refinanced private student loans (from 7.35 percent interest to 5.125%)
2. Reduced principal amounts for my high interest loans
3. Started and maxed out Roth IRA, maxed my HSA for a second consecutive year (while funding health expenses out of pocket), made some Roth 401(k) contributions (about $1,400, mistook it for IRA but not worst thing), and I contributed 6 percent of my salary to my 401k to maximize my company's 50% match up to 3%.
4. Grossed $63,800 with benefits, roughly $57,000 regular earnings+bonus.

For 2017, I enter with $87 K in student debt, but at great rates ($73 k private @5.125%, federal debt of $3 K @4.25% and $11 K @3.15%). Still living home, assuming $56,000 salary but it will likely be closer to $65,000 when factoring bonus and raise April 1st.

My goal is to max out my 401k asap, but I am currently $1,220/month short with contributions. How should I go about bridging this gap while also having money for 3-6 months living expenses, and an additional savings that I want to build over years for a house down payment? Keep in mind following liabilities:

Roth: $458/month
Student Loans: $759/month

After taxes, I'm taking home roughly $2,916/month. Maxing out would bring this to roughly $1,976/month. 

Raises are a big factor and I know that moving out would make maxing out at this salary a temporary exercise (while still home), but overall, how do I get to a point in which maxing out is a feasible option that doesn't hurt my ability to move out, accumulate liquid assets, and not live a lifestyle that is unhealthily modest? The obvious solution is a raise, but is there a number I should target? There'd be merit to it too because I'm doing well with my work.

personalfinance,[Investing]What traits to look for while choosing IRA?,"Hello r/personalfinance , long time lurker, first time poster. 21m from Poland, starting a career and want to save a bag of nickels for early retirement/financial independence. I've been lurking FIRE-oriented subreddits as well, but I feel the advice I need belongs here.

Over the next few days I will be looking for an IRA(it's IKE in Polish, it translates the same though). My concept about it is:

* long-term - not huge, monthly payments over the course of 25-30 years

* not the only one - I am planning to open second one(if it is allowed, I'm fresh to the topic) and max out both, as well as open IKZE(it is more restrictive and the annual limit is smaller, but it is free from 19% interest tax)

* I WON'T be claiming the money before I absolutely have to - that being said, I don't mind a bit of ups and downs throughout the years as long as IRA is profitable in the long term. I once heard a quote regarding investing that ""you only die in the rollercoaster if you jump out in the middle.""

What information should I look up before choosing the proper IRA for me?

Other information that may be useful:

* I have established a 3m emergency fund. I will toss it on bank accounts with high interest rate - I'm doing it on Tuesday towards an account with 3.5% annual interest rate over the first 6 months, and keeping the trend like this.

* The aforementioned leaves ~150$(600PLN, for comparison my annual limit for IRA I checked is 12000PLN-3000$) for further savings. I don't earn much monthly in my job - current SR varies from 40-60%.

* Got no debts to pay",finance

personalfinance,"I recently discovered Navient was incorrectly applying my Auto Pay payments, and they might be doing it to you as well. Please keep an eye on your loan payments, student and other.","**Edit with a semi-solution**: I just got off the phone and the customer service rep (who was very helpful by the way, so I'm really not too mad at Navient) told me to make my extra payments ON the due date. Basically what's happening (as I think some have pointed out in comments) is their payment system is trying to adjust the auto pay amount to account for my extra payments so that the loans will all get paid off on the same day. This is maybe good for them, but not good for me. When the auto payments are applied equally regardless of the extra payment, the principal will decrease a lot faster than if they changed the amounts. SO, bottom line is if your loan provider does this, make sure you pay your extra payments on the same day as your auto pay so that it won't adjust next auto payment. I'll try this and see if it works.

**Original Post**
Hi guys, I am just posting this as a warning to anybody that lets Auto Pay pay their student loans or other loans each month. I am a Navient customer and I use Auto Pay in addition to extra monthly payments. When I pay extra, they give you the choice to have that payment extend your due date or to have the next Auto Pay be deducted as normal. I always choose the latter, as I am trying to pay these loans off early. Additionally, I pay all my extra money to my highest interest loans, hoping to pay them down faster and save some money.

However, a month or so ago I noticed that after making extra payments, my Auto Pay was NOT being deducted normally. It was being deducted for the full amount, but with a HEAVY weight on my LOWER interest rate loans. My HIGHER interest rates loans were receiving almost no money paid towards them.

[Here](http://imgur.com/a/fZIVO) is two photos of the issue, the first indicating what SHOULD happen (from correspondence they sent me) and the second indicating what is actually happening. You can see that my higher interest loans (loan 1 and 2) are receiving almost no money, and I think something like $0.16 is being paid towards principal. Had I not caught this, I basically would have never paid these loans off.

I called customer support and they agreed it DEFINITELY is an issue and they re-applied the payments that had errors. They said they would talk to the technical support team and see what the issue was, but their explanation was that even though I selected the correct choice when making extra payments, the system was reverting that choice to the one that essentially says extra payments SHOULD affect auto pay deductions.

**Edit for clarity**: Navient fixed past payments when I called last, but I checked my account this morning and it is still happening, so it looks like they're not paying enough attention to an issue that could cost their customers a lot of money in the long run.

Bottom line/TL;DR: Keep an eye on your loan statements and make sure the correct amount is being paid, or you might end up paying your loans off forever!",finance
personalfinance,Newbie here trying to build credit/move forward.,"Sorry if this is a giant rants guys. 

Late 20s here. Obviously a bit behind the ball compared to most but I'm ready to make some changes/different moves. 
Was a bit of a dumb kid in my younger years. Didn't really rack up any credit card debit but had a few outstanding bills that I had to run a credit report and couple years ago and after a few months had all cleared up. 
Currently I'm working full time. Making 35-40k a year depending on over time. Don't know too much about my 401k (can update later) I invest 5% of my check I believe and at the end of the year company adds 10% of my yearly income to it (pretty sure?). I go to school part time (automotive) which I pay for with student loans mostly. The loans are federal and fixed at 2%. Bank with a reg. Bank and have a small rainy day fund of about 1,000
      Now since I've done my credit check and cleared up my debt I got a secured credit card.  Probably had it for 2yrs? And my limit is 600. I Pay it off every month in full.  Credit car company (MasterCard) says they can't up my limit on a secured card though. 
Haven't ran a credit report in atleast a year but the cc has a credit tracker app. That rates me at 685 and the beginning of last year rates me at 640. 


My questions are should I open up another card to increase my total credit? What cc's are my best option? 
Do I close my secured cc when I do? If not how should I go about using two? 

What's the pros/cons of switching to a credit union? Pretty comfy with my bank now but doubt they'd ever give me a loan or anything.

personalfinance,Private Debt Settlement Service - Legitimacy?,"**TLDR: $71k in private student loans - asking about company offering debt settlement by negotiating w/ lender on my behalf for significantly less than the principle amount while I build settlement money in a trust account in my name.**

Hello. I apologize for the long post but wanted to provide all relevant details. I currently have ~$71,000 in private student loan debt serviced through a private lender (this was consolidated less than a year ago from about $30k private student loans + $40k federal, and now both fall under the private lender). I have never defaulted and am current on my payments, which fall around $480/mo at 5.25% variable interest (and are causing some financial difficulty when coupled with my currently salary and other expenses).

Recently while researching debt relief I came across two companies I've spoken with that offer similar programs (National Debt Relief and Pacific Business Management). I'm writing to ask about the veracity and legitimacy of the programs they offer: 

Each essentially promises significant savings on the overall principle loan amount by suspending payments to the lender and instead putting money in in an FDIC backed trust account (in my own name) for a period of 47-59 months (or less if you contribute more), using that money as a settlement offer. In the meanwhile the company negotiates with the lender on my behalf for my financial hardship. This of course damages my credit (and I'd imagine puts me in default?) until the settlement is negotiated – a free credit repair service is offered at the end of the program. Is something like this a legitimate? Is this an instance of a company taking money to do something I could elect to do on my own for free? I’ve copied one of the company’s explanations about the service below. Thank you so much in advance for any help or advice.

*‘PROGRAM RECAP  In regards to our program, what we will do is negotiate and settle with your creditors down to a fraction of what you owe by having you make an affordable monthly payment into a trust account opened in your name. Now, this trust account (which is FDIC insured and you are in control of all transactions) is a savings account; and the money you save is what’s used to negotiate with your creditors. So, while you make your monthly payment into your trust account, you no longer make your monthly payments to your creditors. At the same time, we call your creditors and inform them of your financial hardship (decrease in income and increase in expenses). As a result, we are able to encourage your creditors to settle your accounts for significantly less than what you owe.* 

*For the record, you are fully protected throughout the program. That is, the trust is your account which you can close and receive the full balance at any time. Moreover, all settlement offers must be approved by you. Additionally, you can cancel the program at any time – no obligations &amp; no penalties. More importantly, the program is performance based, i.e., we do not receive a penny in fees until we settle the accounts to your satisfaction. With that said, our fee is already included in your monthly payment; however, we cannot legally receive our fee (in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission guidelines regulating this program) until we settle your respective accounts.’*",finance

Available credit: $25k

Outstanding debt: $85K. 
$80k in student loans from Navient and Nelnet. 
Between $5k and $10k monthly utilization on Chase Visa. Usually paid in full - (work travel which gets reimbursed and vacations). 

Negatives:

Collection charge off of $700 (probably an old medical bill, appeared suddenly)

Federal tax lien in public records filed 2015. Paid it in full, in person immediately. Tuned out to be accountant error. 

Payment history is perfect going back 3 years, a little sketchy before then. (illness and unsuccessful self-employment)

Combined household income at $300k. Partner has excellent credit. 

So what's holding the score back? It's supposed to rise over time. 

Looking for some advice on how to jog it loose:

Considering getting a personal share-secured loan at a credit union. These are supposed to help with your score, but they're not free. Everyone says that paying to get your score improved is not worth it, because your score is supposed to rise over time. 

Considering applying for another credit card. Would a 630 score even get another card, or would the inquiry just do more damage. Have been waiting for the score to recover a bit before applying for additional credit, but that strategy inst working. 

I have read the wiki and think I am doing everything correctly. Any advice would be appreciated. Happy to post more info if you need it.",finance

How much would be a good idea to put in as down payment? We have an accessible capital of about $230-250k right now and plan to save up more throughout the year. I just want to make sure we put enough down to have as low monthly cost as possible. But also want to make sure we have enough left for any unforeseen costs and emergencies..

Also trying to figure out the loan rate:
There's the fixed 30 year option. But I'm also looking at variable (5/1 ARM?).
When I owned property in my home country I just had a variable (3 month cadence) mortgage (had a choice of 5-20year fixed otherwise) and ended up saving a bunch of money because of that. Know it's more risky if the interest rates go up but wondering if historically there has been benefits to go with non fixed? Are there generally more pros/cons to go with a long term fixed?

Any insight to this would be really appreciated. Especially hearing others who were in a similar situation before.

Thank you!

personalfinance,Seeking Financial Advice - 24 yr old young professional,"I started working around August 2016 as a software engineer in San Diego, CA. My salary is around 65k, and I am expecting a raise to ~72k within a couple months. After taxes and deductions (health insurance, 401k), I come home with around $1550 every two weeks. I put in 6% of my paycheck into a 401k that my company matches. 

My rent is around ~$1100/month (including utilities) and I have around $34k left in student loans at a 4.5% interest rate after I paid off a $2k loan in full that had a 5% interest rate. My only other expense really is eating, and I like to eat out often so I spend around $400-$500/month on food. This leaves me with around $1500/month to work with. 

My monthly payments for student loans is around $300, but I am planning on paying $500 to pay it off faster. Is this recommended? Or should I keep paying the minimum and use that extra $200 elsewhere? Where should I put the rest of my savings? I was thinking maybe $500 into my savings account and $500 to invest elsewhere, not sure where. What would you guys recommend?


Edit: I should add, my goal of course is to save up for a house which seems impossible to me at the moment in San Diego. I am open to moving, and as a Software Engineer at a Defense Contractor with a clearance, I think it would be fairly easy to find opportunities in cheaper areas, but I really enjoy the food in Socal :).

I have student loan debt. About $30,000 in private/federal loans. However, I never graduated. I didn't have any way of paying for it anymore. Went to university for two years and have both federal and private loans. Currently paying Navient monthly about $250. I NEED to go back to school to start a career. I'm waitressing as of right now. Another huge problem is that I still owe about ~$7000 to the school, which I'm sure has increased due to the interest because it's now been 5 years since I left. Couldn't ever get a loan to pay that off. 

How do I pay them off to get credits for the semesters I did complete? And how should I go about trying to return to a local community college? 

Another huge debt I have is a loan for my car that was totaled a year ago. Please don't judge me. I fell asleep at the wheel after working 13 hours at my waitressing job, problem was that I had a 5 day gap between changing insurance companies. I owed $10,000 still and it was the only accident/crash I've ever had and obviously I had no help from insurance as I had literally just cancelled my old insurance as I was paying $350, was switching to be on my moms insurance so I only had to pay $200. Again, please don't judge me- I tried to ask for advice on here when it happened and most people told me how stupid I was for driving with no insurance. It made me more depressed and wasn't helpful. I hate myself for it every day. I just simply stopped making my car payments on this because I don't know what to do. I have since gotten a leased car (used dealership) that I make monthly payments on.

I was told by a few people that I should open up a secured credit card to help improve my credit score, which is very very very low. Other people have told me to file for bankruptcy. 

I just really need advice on what I should do from here. I make about $1400 a month waitressing. I live with my mom and pay little rent so I can try to gain control of my finances. I pay ~$1100 for bills every month (car, insurance, phone, gas, groceries, rent).

personalfinance,"House purchase: already have large sums available, but considering a mortgage to allow future investments -- risky?","Hope this is the right sub for this type of question.


We're getting our first home (renting now), which will cost around 600K. We've already saved up a lot over the years, and are lucky enough that we could pay for most of that in cash.


However, the interest rate is relatively low right now (at about 1.5% to 1.9%, depending on whether we borrow for 10/15/20 years).


So we're considering borrowing about 300K, or even up to 400K. The advantage we see in keeping a lot of our current money to our own, is that it shouldn't (in theory) be too hard to make that our money earn us more than 1.5% to 1.9%, by investing it.


But what's keeping us back is that there's a difference between theory and practice. Just because it shouldn't be too hard to beat the ~1.7% return rate, doesn't mean we'll spend the necessary time doing so (life keeps us busy enough).


Because investing in stocks/ETFs/etc. is a continuous process which takes time (meaning it's easy to stop doing it, which would make us not reach the &gt;1.7% in returns), we're considering buying a second house in 3 to 5 years or so, and renting it out as apartments or student rooms. Long-term ambition is to become FIRE through real estate.


Is this a decent idea, or is this taking too many risks/too much needless debt and should I just acquire our house in cash?",finance

personalfinance,Student Loan Opinions and Help,"Hi everyone! I subbed to this subreddit a long time ago knowing that someday I'd post.
I need opinions on how to start paying my student loans.

I went to a for-profit school (sad face) and have since graduated. It was back in 2013 and have since been ignoring my loans (forbearance, etc.). I set my 2017 resolutions to start doing something about them but don't know where to start.

I had no idea I had two loans (school did a poor job of telling me I had two loans). One is with Fedloan and the other was with NSLDS?

The one with NSLDS defaulted (had no idea I had this loan or that it was different from the fedloan one).

They garnished my tax return one year and we made a deal to make a monthly payment to get the NSLDS loan back to good standing.
Since then, the NSLDS loan has been passed on to Nelnet (guessing they bought my debt).

So my question is: Do I start paying fedloan first or Nelnet? Should I do both at once? (Fedloan forbearance about to end, Nelnet needs to either start being payed or I extend forbearance).

Another thing I've been wondering, I read a story from CNN lately saying that DeVry (the school I went to) was going pay students for false advertising? (https://twitter.com/cnnbrk/status/809510971995815936)

I graduated December 17th (Whoop!) and just began working full time this week (officially on January 3rd). However I interned with the company last semester beginning on August 22nd and you have to work for a year before 401k eligibility. Meaning I don't get 401k contributions until August 2017. SOO I'm not entirely sure what to do here. I was planning on doing the 5% that they match and paying off my debts as much as possible. So here is the low down of my situation:

__Salary:__ $21,600    
* This is my base + Commission (my boss said that I would easily make 40k this year &amp; all of the other sales people are laughing at me because thats what I thought I would be making. So will probably be higher!)*$400 Monthly Car allowance    
* $70 Monthly Phone allowance    
* Monthly take home pre-tax = $2,270 + Commission

__Debts:__    
* ~$35,000 in student loans. All federal unsub. Payments begin around June/July (school hasn't notified them yet. ugh) There are 4 total loans with interest rates ranging between 3.5 - 6% (only 1 at 6%, mostly in the 4%)
* ~$30,000 Car Loan @ 4.09% &amp; already made first payment in December. Planning on getting this refinanced at the credit union I use in 6 months (that's when they allow refinancing).

__Monthly Bills (not including groceries/gas):__    
* ~1,700 (this is pretty rock solid, I have a budget and have been tracking what my bills are)

__Credit Score:__ 654

So I was originally planning on contributing 5% to 401k and building an emergency fund during my 6 month student loan grace period, and then contributing like 1 or 2% to personal savings? I'm not really sure what to do now.

Can I get a credit card for gas? Do you think I would qualify? I've been working really hard to be on up of the game, but now that the time has come I am slightly freaking out on getting a game plan together. The reason I want a credit card for gas only is because with my job I am required to drive 1,200 miles per week and so that would be a good way for me to build my credit since I will be spending the money anyways. I just don't think I would qualify for one. Any and all advice would be great.

personalfinance,Changed withholding from 0 to 2 but taxes are coming out similarly on paycheck,"After doing a little research, I realized my tax refund is higher than I would like. Last year I received $1500 for my 2015 federal and state refund combined. My withholdings have always been set to 0.

Some time mid-November last year I decided to change my withholdings so that I can get more out of each paycheck and try to break even for the 2017 tax season. I changed my federal and state withholdings from 0 to 1. When the next pay period came around, I noticed that I was being taxed similarly. I even bumped up my federal withholding to 2, and it's still the same. To put it into better perspective, here is what is shown on my paystub:



11/25/16
Allowances: Federal 0, State 0

12/09/16
Allowances: Federal 01, State 01

personalfinance,Buying a house vs. paying off student debt + buying a car,"Hi /r/personalfinance! Long-time lurker, first-timer poster looking for advice on what to do with my savings once I graduate.  
  &amp;nbsp;  

Just the facts:  
  
- Location: Jacksonville, FL (house would be in St. Johns county for USDA RD loan)
- 18k in cash
- 20k in student debt (avg. of ~4.5% interest, all DOE Gov't.)  
- ""Excellent"" credit (&gt; 750 all bureaus + FICO)  
- Monthly cost of rental: **$1,100**  
- Estimated monthly cost of a (larger) house (including HOA + property taxes + etc.): **$1,550-$1,650**  
- Estimated monthly cost of a new car (0 down, 60m @ 2.75%): **$375** 
- Estimated monthly income (after taxes, SS, etc.): **$3,550 - $4,072**  
- Estimated monthly ""essential"" expenses (utilities, food, gas, car ins., internet): **$850**
- Estimated leftover cash for rent/mortgage/car payment/student loans (income - essential expenses): **$2,700 - $3,222**
  
  &amp;nbsp;  
  &amp;nbsp;  
  

Estimated closing and moving costs are around 15k if I go the homebuying route, but interest rate would be 3.75% under the USDA RD loan program (also pay 1%-of-loan fee annually instead of MI, which ends up being a bit cheaper). I believe the area I'm looking in for a house to be a good neighborhood with well-maintained properties within reach of a metropolitan area, beaches, shopping, etc. and do not plan on moving out of the house really at any point. I'm not married/don't have kids but the house has enough room for all of that ""anticipated growth"" down the line. The idea is to absolutely stay in the house and not to ""flip it"" or turn a profit anytime in the foreseeable future.  
  
  &amp;nbsp;  
  
I have some concerns about the housing market/the political scene, but in general I don't expect Trump to wreck the economy to 2008 proportions (I believe most Americans don't have a great understanding of what the President can and cannot do/what other agencies such as the Federal Reserve do that impact the economy, but at the same time I'm not very enlightened in that area myself so frankly I don't know how realistic it would be for me to buy a house, and then Trump do something, and then my house loses considerable value- all within a few years.). I am also very temped to pay off my student loans shortly after graduating using most of the 18k, say 15k (need to maintain an emergency fund of course), and then using surplus income (1k-2k/month) to pay off the other 5k in 3 months or less. I may however need to renew my lease (current lease goes through May 2017), meaning I wouldn't be able to buy a house until ~May 2018. During that time, I would be able to save more since I'd be paying ~$1,100 for rent versus ~$1,550-1,650/month for a mortgage (that figure also includes lawncare, trash service, HOA dues as mentioned).  
  
  &amp;nbsp; 
     
I've been wanting a new car for years, and could afford a new car for years, but have been saving for whatever post-graduation life may hold (i.e. buying a house or moving across the country for a job). My current car works perfectly-fine mechanically and other than not looking as cool or being as advanced as cars today, has no issues. For that reason I would rather buy a house than buy a car, but I would like to do both ASAP. If I were to buy a house *and* buy a car, depending on where I fall on that monthly income range, it could take ~3-4 years to pay off the 20k student debt, and that's with most/all of my leftover income going towards it, so I know that at most I should only do two of the three at a time (house, car, student loans). If I were to buy a house in May 2017, I would hold off on buying a car until the student loans were paid off (which would take about a year). 
  
  &amp;nbsp;  

I am also well-read on the ""renting vs owning"" debate, including that if I buy a house, I will have to pour money into it indefinitely over the years for things like power-washing the outside, buying a new roof, new appliances, ideally smart appliances and solar panels some day. Basically once it becomes part of my monthly expenses, it will always be part of my monthly expenses. I plan on not having to sink any money into the house for those things in the first year or so, so when I say student loans would be paid off in 1-2 years if I don't get both a car and a house, that's also assuming the AC doesn't break or I need a new fridge (but if I did need to pay for a new fridge or something like that, it would come out of the $1,000-$1,500 or so/month I'd be paying towards the student loans, so only a minor setback really, an extra month to pay off the student loans).  
    
  &amp;nbsp;
  
I'm at the same place I've been at for over a year job-wise, and am happy with the compensation, expected compensation when I go full-time/salary, the work itself, coworkers, etc. and do not anticipate leaving that job in the foreseeable future (years). If, however, I need to work elsewhere, there are no shortage of jobs in the metro area I'm in, so losing my job would not be a huge issue as far as being tied down to a house goes.    
  
  &amp;nbsp;
  
Summarizing, I want to get a headstart on a house like most people get a headstart on their 401ks (also doing that btw!), don't want to ""throw money away"" on rent, hate not being able to do upgrades on my rental, but also haven't even graduated from college yet, and have the rest of my life to buy a house, particularly when I'm splitting the mortgage payments with a special someone. I think that while it sounds almost like a no-brainer to pay off my student loans ASAP, the opportunity cost would be sinking potentially another $13k or so into another year of renting, when I could have spent that money on a mortgage that would eventually become $0/month, especially when I know (""know"") I'll be staying in the same area, at the same job, indefinitely (for at least a few years).  
  
  &amp;nbsp;  

**tl;dr** Have 20k in student debt (4.5%) but also a good opportunity to buy a house at a low interest rate (3.75%) with 0 down, paying more than I pay now for a townhouse ($1,100) but less than what it would cost to rent a house ($1,800-2,100). Not sure if I should buy a house now and pay off student loans later, or use the closing costs of a house to pay off my student loans within a couple months of graduating, and then buy a house a year or two later.",finance

personalfinance,"Relatively complex inheritance situation, looking for advice.","investing/windfall/taxes

This is long winded and somewhat in depth, thanks in advance for seeing it through! I have had some windfalls looming for several years.  The first was a trust fund set up by a grandparent to be managed by a parent until I turned a certain age.  I came to be this age in the past year and have been trying to gather information before I act. Parent thinks I don't have what it takes to manage the fund and is not open to helping me change the title.  I am planning to consult some type of attorney on my own to find out how to go about changing the title.  Is there a specialized type of tax attorney to approach with this issue?  

I have felt more urgency to do this after meeting with the ""classic family financial adviser"" overseeing my accounts.  My parent got their other family members involved and they seem all in on this adviser who is a life insurance/estate planner/ investment manager/etc.  He has the titles of CLU/ChFC/IAR.  I don't feel like he is the worst choice in the world, but after looking at the investments I've become alarmed. They are split into 2 different funds.  Both have high ERs (1.2) and one had a front load (3.0) that my parent agreed to. The other one has sliding withdrawal fees due to go to 0% in 2 years.  Over the 6.5 years the total investment has gained 22.8 percent in value. This is 3.8 percent a year. Not terrible, but without those fees it could have been a lot better considering everything was invested after the great recession.  I thought about asking him about the title change in our first meeting, but I was too overwhelmed by everything else to bring it up.

I tried reasoning with the parent, but ""they know best"" and ""have made a lot of money"" for me.  I am very grateful to be in the position I'm in but I get sick thinking about the total sum of all my family's investments going through one adviser when they probably don't even think about the fees or ERs.  All of our family's eggs are literally in the same basket LOL.  Millions of dollars.

Anyways, the sliding back end fee account is 80% bonds, 20% stocks.  It is labeled as an annuity account.  The stated reasoning behind this was my parent could pull money out for me if I needed it.  It also has a guarantee attached to it.  There is a minimum amount that I am entitled to even if the fund performs poorly.  I think this might be a good position for my retired parent's fund, but the additional fee for that doesn't seem good for me.  I do not plan on needing this money for a long time. 

Clearly I don't want to pull out on the guaranteed fund with the sliding fee until it clears the fee period. The good news is it appears that I can move some of this money to a lower fee index (.65 ER, high for index I know) and keep it there until the back end fee schedule is cleared.  

Account that I don't face withdrawal fees on is almost all bonds.  Yes it has a 12b-1 fee... Someone has to pay for their ads right?!

Essentially I am in 90% bonds overall.  The reasoning I got behind this was for tax purposes, to shelter me from taxes. Given the expected rise of interest rates, I'd like to change that before 2018.  I'm young, there is no reason to be in such a high percentage of bonds or pay so much in fees.  This has brought me a lot of stress over the past year and I feel like I have to face it soon.  I want to take control of my finances and I have enough money in my own bank account to get an attorney, a different financial adviser and I am ready to get out of such a conservative/high fee investment. I think I can afford the tax consequences but I feel the need to consult a tax professional to be sure.

I also have a separate trust eligible to come under my control.  It is from a small stake in a dissolving LLC.  That is also under my parent's control and again I will have to take action to re-title. The parent said it could not be invested unless it was with our current guy.  I said definitely not I don't want to be locked into sliding fees for the next 8 years or pay 3 percent up front, 12b-1 etc.  I am trying to convince the parent to get the check moved from a savings account to a short term CD until I figure out how to take control of the situation. 

To summarize the situation:

100 in 80% bond/20% stock (classified as annuity, sliding back load, ER ~ 1.0)

100 in 95% bond (ER 1.2)

100 in trust from dissolving LLC (would like to move it to a 6 month CD for now)

I currently work PT, have 30k personal savings and an emergency fund from working a ton in the past.  While I have the luxury of PT work, I want to use the extra time to deal with this situation.  In the long run I feel I could keep working part time and think of investing my windfalls as another PT job.  At the very least I would like to transition some of these funds to a vanguard type index  with low fees.  If I got the title under my name, would it be as simple as getting the money paid to my bank, paying taxes on the returns and then reinvesting through a website like vanguard?  I also plan to put .05 percent of my net worth into stocks that I feel particularly excited about.


Thank you for reading, regardless of the responses it feels good to write things down.  I am grateful, yet stressed.  I know I am lucky. I feel smart and responsible enough not to spend a dime of this money, but so much has been made of fees eating up returns lately that I feel compelled to do better with my windfall retirement fund.",finance

Some details:
The house we all like is $400k.  My wife and I can afford $1100 / month mortgage+taxes comfortably. My credit score is somewhat low, ~690/700.

We have about 50k equity in our current home and do not really have anything to put towards a down payment (still working on getting out of debt). The in-laws are aware of this and can afford the new house while we continue to try and sell our current home. We are well aware that this new house is not something we can afford without substantial gifting and consider ourselves extremely blessed and fortunate to be in this situation, though we're not sure what our options are?

The parents can pay for the property outright, or take out a mortgage (with easily a better interest rate than I'm capable of securing).  They could also gift us a sizable down payment.  I guess even some kinda weird rent / paying on the side / etc thing would work?

However it works out, we want to be paying at least what we can.  What's the best way to set something like this up? Thanks!",finance

She's 27 yo and apparently ineligible for medicaid because she doesn't make enough money and isn't disabled or a parent etc. She wants a medically necessary bariatric surgery. 

She **does not qualify for subsidies in the exchange and does not qualify for Medicaid**. According to healthcare.gov, the cheapest market plans would cost around $295/mo for an estimated yearly cost of $10,000 (bear in mind that she makes $8,000 total per year). However, these plans don't seem to even cover bariatric surgery. Even the $400/mo Gold star plans say *In network: bariatric services not covered*. I believe some states are required by law to cover bariatric surgery, but SC isn't one of them. 

As for medicaid, I think she is ineligible regardless of how much she makes because she is a childless adult (not sure). Even so, apparently only 8% of bariatric patients pay with Medicaid because most surgeons won't take it. 

It looks like she's going to have to either move or pay out of pocket. What's her best strategy going forward? She has a BMI around 55. If she doesn't get surgery she will die.

We have 6k in savings and plan on trying to buy a house next fall with an FHA loan. The savings goal is 20k. I know the gold standard is 20% down, but we are looking to start a family soon and don't forsee saving for a few years. We also don't want to get screwed on interest rates as they rebound. So it will most likely by 3.5% down. Our house price ranges would probably be around 225-250k. 

My question is, should I be maxing my 401k this year or wait until after we buy a house? Ideally I know I should, but with the tighter time line to purchase a house, the savings might be better for a down payment? 

Additionally, my wife doesn't have a 401k but her employer offers stock sharing options. When we get a spare 1k, I'm planning on setting her up with a Roth IRA from Vanguard. 

Does my logic sound okay? I think the best answer is to save until 20% for a down payment, but I just don't think that will happen.

key takeaways 

- The U.S. has again become the beacon for positive change and will be the engine for global growth.

- .....we expect that the market multiple has peaked for the cycle as interest rates rise. Second, we expect that earnings estimates for the S &amp; P, and especially the reflation beneficiaries, will be revised significantly upward giving upside for the market as a whole.

- Investors still remain caught having significantly over-weighted bonds in their portfolios while under-weighting stocks. Digging deeper, bond investors have lengthened their maturities over the years as the short end earned virtually nothing while stock investors over-weighted defensive and yield stocks.  That is a losing hand on all counts in a reflationary environment.

- ....stay long the dollar and consider owning industrial commodities.

* My account fee right now is only 1%, plus a 75 dollar account fee per year. 
* There's ""no way"" vanguard can offer a target date retirement fund with a .16% expense ratio and a 25 annual fee. He said there must be some kind of other expenses in ""asset management sleeves"".
* I won't have anyone to talk to at Vanguard, whereas I can call him whenever I want.

During school, my husband and I want to start saving for a house (I will work during school). My fear is that we'll work hard to save some money, and when my loans go into repayment, the loan servicer will consider the savings fair game for the taking. The forms always ask what assets you have. We would put the money in my husband's account, but even filing taxes separately, they ask what your spouse has too. We are in our 30's and don't make a ton of money, so if they consider the savings up for grabs, it will be very hard to replace. Buying the house before the loans are due is not likely.

Is it possible to save for your future when you have loans like this? Do you have to hide your money with a relative? Are we just the generation doomed to rent forever?

personalfinance,Pay off $43k @ 4.7% student loans or contribute heavily to (Roth) 401(k)? (Long read),"Hey PF, long time reader, first time poster. Sorry for the long read, but you’re welcome for the details.

I was wondering if it might be beneficial for me long-term to load up my 401(k) w/ or w/o Roth while paying the minimums on my student loans. Currently, I have about $3800 in CC debt, however it is all at 0% (at least until May) and I have a plan in place to pay it off in the next couple of months. Currently I am also setting aside money for an emergency fund. I am 26 and work as a process engineer. 

My expenses are very low as I live at home right now, but it is possible that I might be splitting an apartment with my SO later this year. 

Currently after taxes, healthcare, and putting 7% toward my Roth 401(k) (w/ 100% match up to 6%), I bring home about $1300 every 2 weeks (depending on overtime worked). After monthly living expenses and squirreling away some savings, I figure I should have about $1100 to either pay toward loans or stash away in my 401(k).

I have $43k in student debt after paying a tad over the minimum for the past year. My loans are as follows: 

* $4300 @ 4.41% (10 yr fixed)

* $16600 @ 3.5% (**20 yr var**) 
* $1100 @ 5% (5 yr fixed)

All of the 10 yr fixed are through Fed Loan. The average interest rate (weighted for amount) is **4.74%**. Through my research, it seems I got in and out of college at a decent time, as this seems relatively low overall. Last year was a great year for my (tiny) portfolio, as it pulled out an amazing 2nd half of the year and ended earning around 15% ROI. I know this is not sustainable long term, but given the average long-term returns around 7%, I am pondering the decision to stick as much as  I can into my retirement account (12k/yr+match=$15500/yr. @ 62 years old this gives me $2 milion, and that’s really without increasing my income very much at all.)

I am conflicted, however, because I’d also like to save for a home. I loathe the idea of paying rent. Fortunately, comfortable starter homes in decent areas around me (metro Detroit) can be found for $50-60k. I don’t plan on having kids soon or at all, so school systems are not a huge priority.  My credit score is just above 700. 

I understand the mental victories of paying down the debt, but I don’t like missing out on opportunities, and I feel as through being able to probably get 7% while paying back 4.74% is somewhat of an opportunity. 

With my spreadsheets and amortization tables, it looks like $43k with 9 yrs (108 months) left is $490/month. However, putting an extra $1000 toward it every month reduces the payoff period to just 31 months…which is very attractive as well. It also reduces the amount of interest I would pay from $11k to just $2700. 

Additionally, if I do go the build-up-my-401(k)-as-much-as-possible route, do I go **401(k) or Roth 401(k)**? Currently my tax bracket is lower than the only I plan on being in and withdrawing from when I retire so I contribute to Roth 401(k) now. Right now, I only have $4000 in my retirement after a year (don’t get the match until February). It is my understanding that withholding the tax until retirement+tax deductions from loan interest might be more advantageous and would reduce my overall taxed income significantly. 

One caveat that worries me is the **$16.6k @ 3.5% variable rate** loan (was through CitiAssist, now through Firstmark). The rate hasn’t changed, but if the economy tanks or something and they decide that they want to hyper inflate rates, I don’t want to drown paying 20% on a huge loan like that. 

If you need any more information, I’ll be happy to provide it. Again, sorry for the long-windedness, just wanted to hash out everything in advance.

personalfinance,Save money in my savings or invest in IRA or pay off loans?,"I'm 23 years old in CT, making $80k doing a job I enjoy. I probably have more money in my savings account (about 8 grand) than I need for an emergency fund (prob around 4-5 grand for 3 months). 

I don't really add to my savings at this point. Each month, I save about 1-1.5k which I immediately throw to my student loans. I've paid around 12k of my 30k loan already (highest interest rate first), with 18k left at about 3-4% interest. Sometimes I'll pause on the extra $1k payment if I decide to treat myself to stuff like a nice watch, a tv, or tickets to Scotland, etc., but I'm pretty confident i'll have paid off the loan within the next year and a half. 

Initially, I planned on paying $1k extra towards my student loan each month this year, and then paying the remaining 6k off with my savings just to be free of the loan. But I just saw a post on the front  of /r/personalfinance saying that you can still contribute to the 2016 IRA till April, so now I'm debating whether I should invest 3-4k from my savings into the IRA (close to max, I put in $1k last year).

I like to think I'm pretty good at investing my 401k/IRA: I got 19.5% gain on my 401k for 2016.

So should I keep the money in my savings as an emergency fund? Invest/max out IRA? or save the money to pay off student loans?

Oh, and doubt it will matter, but my savings account is with ally, so I get 1% interest.

edit: my company also pays for grad school, but due to the timing, I might have to pay for the first semester in September before they start covering it (100%). Should I save the money for that instead? For 1 class = 3 credit course, I would imagine the fees to be around 4-5k. This isn't 100% set in stone since I haven't gotten accepted yet or asked the company what would happen in this scenario. If the school can defer payment for a month or do a payment plan type situation for the first semester, I can get the rest covered by the company.",finance
personalfinance,Transfer of Annuity Claim,"Hello All,

To keep things simple, my grandmother passed away not too long ago and she left me, along with all grandchildren, an annuity claim. Now the account is still under her name (I think, or my dad's since he was the Power of Attorney) and will be changed in the following few days. I am quite curious as to what I should do with the account. 

Total amount within the current account is $11.2k, not a lot, but it's a good chunk of change to ""play"" around with.  After reading the packet I was given by my FA I have come to the conclusion that there are two options that I must consider. 

**One**: Do I keep the money and leave it in an IRA with a solid interest rate and let it accumulate wealth for me until I retire? I am 26 years old and I have plenty of time for this to max out. **OR Second**: Do I open up a John Hancock - Safe Access Account and pay off some debt ~$2,500 and then move the money into an IRA? 

From my research the JH SAA allows me to write checks using this money until all money is exhausted from said account, or until the balance reaches lower then $250 and then said amount is sent to me plus accumulated interest.

I want to keep the money in the account and never touch it, but if I have the option to pay off debts immediately and start ""*fresh*,"" I don't see the negative. However, I am not finance savvy like you great people and I need some help in figuring out what to do. Please help!",finance

I hate the idea of going into debt to pay for it, but it also seems like a bad idea to become cash poor because of it.

* Take out a home equity loan
* Take out a personal loan from a credit union
* Sign up for a low interest credit card and pay it off before the interest goes up

We're looking around at new interest rates, but have a question regarding the interest already paid. Having paid 18 months so far on a $32,000 loan, with an interest rate of 7.75% for 72 months, she has paid a total of $9,900 so far. Of that, $3,368.79 was paid just in interest. The remaining $6,531.21 went towards the principal.

My question is would refinancing the loan essentially waste the payments in interest that she has already paid, or would that interest still be accounted for? Also, she would like to not increase the length of the loan, so is it possible to get a payment plan for 54 months, or just the typical 48 or 60 month plans? Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,FUBAR'd filing of 2013 1040X: just admitted to the IRS I received too large a refund.,"I filed our 2013 tax return with an extension in July 2014. Due to our financial circumstances (&lt;$100K income, standard deductions, etc), we file a 1040EZ using online TurboTax, expecting the usual not large refund (&lt; $1000) as an auto-deposit to our bank account.

In 2013 my wife's mother died and left her a IRA. The fund admin rolled the IRA over, but offered my wife a small cash balance. So she was sent a check, which was supposed include the balance amount minus 15% withheld for federal taxes. My wife received the check and deposited it. 

We filed our tax return electronically and everything seemed rosy. In mid August we received a letter from the IRS indicating we were ""missing required information."" I called several times, finally getting someone who could only tell me there was some undeclared amount, and that our return could not be processed. But we could not be told what the nature of this missing information was, nor how much.

So essentially we had no reason to believe we got a refund, as the IRS said they did not finish processing our return. We had all the 1099-R's we knew we would receive, so left the matter at that. We checked our records and could find nothing missing.

A while back, my wife was cleaning her desk, and lo! found a missing 1099-R. This was the one for the IRA balance, and it indicated that no withheld federal tax on the amount, as my wife had been told would be done.

So I went to the IRS site and pulled the 1040X PDF to amend the submitted form and get at least something back from the IRS. After going through the numbers, I figured we'd get half our usual refund to account for the cash balance that we had not declared before. I filled out the 1040X including a copy of the missing 1099-R, and mailed off the package to the IRS.

Something nagged the back of my mind about this whole matter, and so went back to the bank. I asked for a detailed statement for our bank account for 2014. And I've just discovered we in fact had received an auto-deposit for the refund, for the amount on the original 1040. It was deposited in our account two weeks (late August) after we received that IRS letter saying they could not process our 1040. The problem is that the bank had mismarked the deposit as a ""Treas Dep"" rather than the normal ""IRS Refund"" like they had in the years before and after.

We had called the IRS several times after that deposit date, and nobody there (if we could get someone on the line) ever said a thing about us actually receiving any refund amount, we were still being told the IRS had not yet processed our 1040 due to the missing information.

Inattentively we just never noticed we had actually received our refund, as during that time we had a number of deposits. And so now I've just admitted to the IRS that we should not have received an extra $450 in refund money, once they get and process the 1040X package. And I know they have already received it, I tracked the package to their Austin office.

So now exactly how much crap did I just step in by sending that 1040X and admitting we were overpaid on our refund?! How can I tell them, ""Oopsies!, never mind that 1040X you just received...""?

TL;DR: Told IRS with a 1040X we received too large a refund, a couple years after they told us they had not even processed our original 1040. Never knew we really did get the refund, although we should have only gotten half of the original amount.",finance

gaming,One bothersome practice that makes no sense: Nerfing in single player games.,"Multiplayer games warrant constant evaluation and adjustment, because there is a real risk of having an item, combo, hero, gun, armor, etc, that is so outlandishly broken that it would simply put the game as a whole into a rut, running the whole community into the ground (if left unchanged long enough). I understand it and I appreciate it. Sometimes the nerfs come far too hard and swing the subject in question to the other extreme, but by and large, nerfing in multiplayer is done with the intention of benefiting the health of the community. 

When it comes to a single player game wit ZERO multiplayer prospects, this is where I am baffled when (insert subject here) is nerfed. Why? Why bother going the rigmarole of releasing a patch just to make something worse for a game where only the player and the game itself are the subjects? Now, when I say nerf here, I don't mean fixing things that are clearly broken because of coding errors, like a gun with infinite ammo, even though it clearly should be using up the consumable ammo. I mean small things like changing the values on a weapon to make it worse or extending the cooldown on a skill arbitrarily. 

If the (subject) is making the game ""too easy,"" then it is up to the player if they want to use it or not. The developer does not need to go in and change the (subject) which some people might have found legitimately fun, funny, interesting, whatever, just because another portion whines about its existence and calls it too strong. They could just not use/abuse it then.

I will admit I have a bias to breaking games and doing stupid stuff. If I wanted to be reminded how underwhelming of a gamer I am at times, I would play a multiplayer game and learn the meaning of ""git gud"" there, not in the vacuum where no outside influence is going to be affected by the silly interactions this item, or the strangely over the top nature of that skill.

personalfinance,Help me choose my new bank?,"Hey /r/personalfinance friends!  I need help making a choice here.  For background, I've been with the same small-town local bank for nearly 8 years (since I moved back home from Seattle), but over the last year, I've felt like things have to change.  It's a very small bank, so the services they offer are minimal. And over the holidays, I went in there to ask for a replacement debit card (as mine was about to break in two), and was told they charged $5 for a replacement.  Plus, their online banking was screwed up for 2 days, and I rely on online banking to keep track of things on a day to day basis, know how much is coming out, and how much I have available to me.

I had already set up an Ally Savings account for the high yield on interest, and was planning to store my E-fund there.  So, when I finally decided to make the change I'd been thinking about for a year now, I decided I'd just set up an Ally checking account as well.  So I did, funded it with $50, and was waiting for the checks to arrive.  Today my debit cards came in (still no checks), and I was shocked to find out that my Ally Debit cards were sent without EMV chips!  Come on guys, this is 2017!  Security on EMV chips is much better than the mag stripes, and while I know not all vendors are accepting them yet, I much prefer to have the option rather than have to swipe.  As far as I'm concerned this is a deal breaker, and I'm not planning to keep the Ally checking - I may keep the savings for my E-Fund due to the good interest rate on it, or I may not, depending on what other options I can find.  I have a savings and checking with Alliant CU - the savings is where I stash my self-employment tax payments, and the checking is where I do anything where I actually have to write out checks - I don't like doing actual checks from my main account, because the 3 checks I have to write every month always take forever to clear - my landlords have been known to wait a month to cash my rent checks!  My wife is a teller for a local brick and mortar bank branch, and I am joint on her account there, so i have that option if I need to actually visit a branch for anything, which means me having an account that I can only work with online is just fine.  Here are what I feel are my firm requirements for a new bank:

* Chipped Debit Card
* Easy ACH Push/Pull from the website
* Low or no fees, no matter the balance - Free checks a bonus
* Good mix of products, with good rates (CD's, loans, etc).

Having a good high-yield savings account available to me as well would be a bonus, but I'm perfectly fine with leaving my E-Fund at Ally for the time being, or maybe moving it into a separate account at Alliant.

There are no local CU's in my small town - the nearest is a 45-min drive away, and their online banking has no ACH capability, so I've ruled them out.  I've also ruled out any of the other banks local to me for similar reasons.  If I can't find an alternative, I will probably stick with Ally, switch the current function of my Alliant checking to the Ally checking, and switch my direct deposit and auto-paid bills to the Alliant account, but I'd like to just close the Ally checking on principle, as I feel not providing EMV cards at this point is reckless and irresponsible, and doesn't instill me with a whole lot of trust.  So I'd actually like to find an alternative to Ally entirely.

So have you wonderful people got any suggestions for me?  Thanks in advance!",finance

Would appreciate some insight about how much insurance will compensate and whatever aftermath will come from this.","The car is done, bought it during the summer and made the mistake of getting an add-on warranty on the electric panel which hiked the price up by another two grand. It was my first financed car, but made the mistake of driving it (under less than ideal circumstances) and now it's totaled. I've got roughly $8,800 left in payments.

I'd appreciate help on what kind of compensation my insurance company (Geico) will provide for my totaled vehicle. Should I expect to continue the usual payments on the car for the next three years or will Geico be lending a hand? And what should I expect with my monthly premium (pre-collision rate being $135/mo)

* My student loans are currently on deferment due to enrollment in Grad School, for which I am receiving tuition reimbursement from my employer. I am receiving $2,600 in disbursements each semester (4/yr) and $4,164 (before taxes) back from my employer (up to a max of $10,500/yr). In addition, $16,000 of the Govt Loans are fresh from Grad School.

&amp;nbsp;


I have $2000 in Savings, $2700 in checking (due to a recent disbursement), and $7,700 in my company matched 401k (I have been putting 4%, but they will match up to 8%). My 401k is accumulating around 16% based on the 12 month rolling average they provide.

Personal Finance: Please help me make sense of this mess! I have around $500/mo income to put toward the debts listed above. My amateur understanding tells me I should be taking the disbursements and reimbursements from grad school to pay my CC debt down as fast as possible, since it's the highest interest rate, but my complete lack of an emergency fund makes me nervous.

Our take home is about $8,500 (“extra” paycheck months averaged in). Depending on the month, we end up with around $3,000 left over every month. We need to do better sticking to budgets to get that up, but it’s a process. 

Recently, I’ve started splitting the end of the month left overs 50/50 between regular savings and additional payments to student debt using Avalanche method. We’ve also got recent annual raises which pushes our non-3-paycheck month take homes beyond $8,000 which is the magical number where we are universally comfortable from a cash-flow point of view. 

**Two questions:**

* Is there a more optimum method of handling my left-over savings every month from an interest/tax perspective? 

* How should I handle the annual raises that we don’t need for regular household income? Increase 401k? Contribute more to student loans? Roth IRA (We will cut close to income limits depending on how bonuses come out)?

personalfinance,College Debt vs. Potential Earnings,"So I am looking at 80000 dollars in debt for a four year college, with about 75 % of that being at 6.5% and the rest being federal loans at around 4%. The college claims that the median salary for a four year student leaving the major I am in(computer science) is 95,000$ a year. This college has connections to google, microsoft, red hat, and basically a plethora of other companies.
The amount of debt that I have makes me uneasy. I have enough of everything that I never have a problem functioning as a person while having as little as I need to avoid clutter and not spend unnecessarily. My main frivolous spending is on social events, which I spent 23$ on last semester.. In no way am I a monk, I just get my contentment in life out of interacting with other people primarily. But anyway I am rambling.
My two main questions are: Why should or shouldn't I believe their income claim, considering that the study is publicly viewable?(not going to link, I'm already too easy to dox)

Based on the previous answer, what financial situation am I looking at when I get out of college? In your mind, what it be worthwhile to consider going to another college instead?",finance
personalfinance,"Soon to be married couple - Question on whether we should pay off loans, or save for a house.","My fiancé and I have been going back and forth lately about what would make most financial sense for our future. We are planning on getting married this July, currently living together in an apartment. We'd like to move into a house as soon as possible, and start a family (after a year or two). But we have about $83,000 in loans (that's our only debt). Here are the facts:

Total salaries: 123,000
Total monthly take home pay: 7,000
Total monthly expenses: 3,000 (including 900 going towards loans, and 875 going towards rent)
Total student loans: 83,000 (lots of different interest rates, only a couple at 6-6.5%, lowest at 3%)
Money in savings: About 8,000

Basically it comes down to we could either:
1. Pay off all the loans by May 2018 (at the latest)
2. Move into a house sometime before the end of summer, then pay off the loans. 

We live in Wisconsin, so cost of living isn't insanely high. We'd look at getting house somewhere in the 150,000 - 200,000 range. We have enough money set aside for the wedding, so we're not worried about that. 

We do have two cars, one 2011 Ford Focus, and one 2008 Honda Civic. Both are in good shape. We thought about selling one (since I work from home), but ultimately that might just cause more trouble than its worth (we'd get somewhere around 4,000 for either). 

I don't get a company match until next year, so I'm not putting anything towards retirement. She's putting 5%, to get her company match. 

We're leaning towards just cleaning out the loans at first. But since we can save up enough for a down payment so fast, I'm wondering if it makes sense to do that and start putting money into the house, instead of rent while we pay off loans? From what I've researched, if we had a house the mortgage/property taxes would even out to be about what we pay now in rent (somewhere a little less than $1,000/month). There's obviously a larger risk though with home maintenance. 

What are your thoughts?

Edit: Made a goof. Take home pay is 7000, not 5000. Regardless, sounds like my suspicions were confirmed and it would be wise to pay the loans first. Thanks everyone!",finance
personalfinance,PSLF/Aggressive Savings OR Aggressive Payoff of Student Loans? With a Ch. 7 BK...,"Longtime lurker, have some questions I'm hoping for thoughts on that I figured a new year was a good time to ask! Standard 'pay off loans or save for house' question, but with a few additional complicating factors.

26 M, living in low-ish COL college town, have ~$66k in student loans remaining from UG and uncompleted graduate studies (have no intention of going back). I currently work at a major U and just switched roles so that my salary will now be $62,000/year starting next month. As of now, I pay about $133/month on my student loans, which is an IBR payment (may go up once my new taxes are factored in) that counts towards PSLF - I have 11 of the required 120 made, so I'm really just getting started.

After I contribute to a joint expenses account my girlfriend and I share (out of which we cover rent, food, utilities, etc.), I will have about ~$2,200 left each month. That's also after I max out my retirement into a 403(b) - I put up 5% and my employer puts up 10%, which means after starting this new role it'll be almost $800/month. It currently has a balance of about $11,000.

The payment I'm currently making on my loans isn't even enough to cover interest. Here's some specifics on the balances:

* Sub Fed Stafford - $3,462 (6.0% interest)
* Sub Fed Stafford - $4,812 (5.6%)
* Unsub Fed Stafford - $2,989 (6.8%)
* Direct Unsub - $10,554 (6.8%)
* Direct Unsub - $7,689 (6.8%)
* Direct PLUS - $10,454 (7.9%)
* Direct Unsub - $25,730 (6.8%)

All but the first three are eligible for PSLF, and I don't have any interest in leaving my employer or perhaps some other University/nonprofit in the next 9 years. But, as a 26 year old, I'm worried I should be saving for a house/other nest egg besides retirement. 

**COMPLICATING FACTOR 1:**

Several years ago I got a small unexpected windfall: so I do have several additional assets right now:

Roth IRA - ~$11,800
Betterment - ~$8,000
Liquid Savings/Emergency Fund - $5,000

**COMPLICATING FACTOR 2:**

The REAL complicating factor here is that several years ago, before getting my life together after college and before my windfall, I had to file for a Ch. 7 bankruptcy, discharge date of December of 2014. 

So, that was a bit over 2 years ago, but I know that will stay on my credit for another 8 years, and may make it hard/impossible to purchase a house before that time (also about when my PSLF would be complete, if the program stays untouched by Congress).

**Am I better off stocking away as much as I can of my ~$2,000 discretionary income each month into Betterment or something else to have a big down payment available in 8 years when my bankruptcy is done and my loans are hopefully ready to be discharged, OR aggressively pay off the loans first (looks like if I paid $1,500/month, they'd be gone in about 5 years) to get rid of that albatross earlier, even though the bankruptcy would still be reporting?**

Alternatively, should I pay off the three non-PSLF loans (combined balance of $11,263) that wouldn't be forgiven, and continue to make minimum IBR/PSLF payments on the eligible ones until they are forgiven?

I don't have any additional debts other than my student loans, and at this point we are relatively frugal in terms of our basic spending and how much we can save/spend a bit discretionarily.",finance

personalfinance,Worth it to take a perm/full-time GS-5 position with no promotion potential?,"So I'm an active-duty military paralegal with 3 years of paralegal experience, and I'm getting out of the service in the near future. I also have a BA from before I joined (if anyone's wondering why I didn't go officer, I enlisted specifically for job training in the paralegal field; there are no officer paralegal positions).

I'm being heavily considered for a permanent/full-time GS-5 legal assistant position on another military base, but I have a lot of reservations about it. Mainly due to the fact that it begins and ends at GS-5, so there is no promotion potential. The duties as they were explained to me during the interview sound more akin to a receptionist than a paralegal, so I don't know if I would be challenged enough; I didn't work this hard only to answer phones and greet clients. The salary at that level would start at  $32k (substantially less than my current military pay), however the southern state where the job is located has a much lower cost of living than where I'm currently at.

Basically, I'm not sure it would be worth it to move across the country for a job that pays so little and has no promotion potential, even if it is a federal position in a place I'd really like to live. I'd be looking for something better almost immediately, which wouldn't be fair to my employers. Then again, I've read a lot of advice online that if you want to work for the feds, you get in wherever you can and it's much easier to land new positions once you're in the system.

I'll also mention that I've been referred for several other legal assistant GS positions with promotion potential, however I haven't been contacted for interviews yet and that whole saying about 'a bird in hand,' etc.

**Explanations**

So long story short... I'm finally feeling like I am getting on my feet but I don't know where to go...

Sadly, I was always behind on my taxes (thousands and thousands of dollars) ever since I started working. I worked freelance since 16 years old. I hunkered down my finances, saved money, and aggressively paid my debt down.

I happily purchased a home for my family when I was 23 years old. But due to what I do for work, my only option through any bank was 20% down. I bit the bullet and did it. Its not a decision I regret at all, but that killed all my money in savings. I've had to put work into the house for ""this n that"" over the last few years... I bought an older home, not a brand new one, so I was expecting this.

My wife finally works now since the last 6 months, so with her working, and me paying my taxes on time finally, I've been able to get some sort of savings ($6.5k) back on the go and pretty much all credit debt gone (previously owed $2.5k now I owe $500).

The money is sitting in a regular bank savings account and I don't know what to do with it? Many people have told me to consult the bank but is that the best option? I'm clueless!

For future foresight on my goals... when I renew my mortgage, I'm going to be applying for a hefty sum of money to redo the basement and floors here, estimated at $40k+. So I'd like so save up over the next couple years to put *something* towards that.

Whats my best option for the savings I'm building to make it grow better? I know my current savings may be a small, laughable amount to some people but I'm trying! :)

personalfinance,"I'm 21, 25k to invest, trying to make sure my plan is sound.","Hello /r/personalfinance, 

I am 21, live with a roommate, and currently am working full-time. I have ~2.5 years of undergrad completed and plan to enroll in January 2018 to finish my degree which should take ~2 years (I assume some credits wont transfer over with ease and some classes may have to be re-taken). I have a vehicle paid off in full and $20-25k that I wish to invest. In approximately one year, I will have an additional ~$35k to invest (non-working related). I have no debts.


I frequent this sub and have read the majority of the wiki regarding investing, savings, etc. I post here only to ensure that my plan is sound. I think/hope it is but I want that confirmation and to not place my money in bad situations.



Plan:

* Invest the maximum $5.5k in 2016 Roth IRA through Vanguard ($1k already invested). My understanding is I can still place money in a 2016 Roth IRA account until sometime in April. I do not plan to ever touch these accounts until retirement. 
* Invest the maximum $5.5k in 2017 Roth IRA through Vanguard.
* Invest the remaining ~$9-14k in a Vanguard Brokerage account.
* Invest any additional money in the future to balance with the percentages listed below


All three accounts will have the following distribution: 

* 25% international stocks
* 10% US government bonds
* 65% US stocks


25% will be invested in Vanguard Total World Stock Index Fund Investor Shares(VTWSX). However, what is the advantage or disadvantage of investing in Total World Stock ETF? Should 100% of my money allotted money for investing in international stocks be held in one of these two accounts (in other words, should I diversify my international stock holdings or is an index fund or ETF enough in regard to diversification?)

10% will be invested in Vanguard Short-Term Federal Fund Investor Shares(VSGBX). However (same question), what is the advantage or disadvantage of investing in Vanguard Short-Term Bond ETF? Should 100% of my allotted money for investing in government bonds by held in one of these two accounts?

65% will be invested in Total Stock Market (VTI).

I'm not sure I fully understand the difference between an ETF and an Index Fund. I've seen that both are recommended (I believe) frequently, but I don't want to make the wrong choice for my situation.

What are your thoughts? What needs to change? Does more information need to be provided? Is any of this foolish?

All help and opinions are welcome.

Thank you.",finance
personalfinance,I'm 24. Is it time to buy a house? Will I stay financially stable in my desired range?,"I have no idea what I'm doing financially. (*okay, maybe not literally) I've just been going with whatever but it's time to ask out. This is mainly about buying a home, but I'll have other questions included.  

&amp;nbsp;

Background: I'm 24, made $60k/yr out of college (bachelors degree), moved to another company making $85k+/yr but with 95% travel time for a while, but I adjusted back to $60k/yr with a local company and growth potential for personal reasons.  

&amp;nbsp;
  
Financial: My money is a bit wonky. I'm just not a big spender and I probably don't get out as much as I should. (I'm healthy though!) I have $30k in checking, $3.5k in savings. (I should probably reverse the numbers, but doesn't withdrawing from savings have a negative impact or something? What if I have an emergency situation?)  I consolidated my student and auto loans with my bank at a lower interest rate and pay $500/month on each per month. My credit is okayish at average 760.  

&amp;nbsp;
  
Remaining Loan Balances: Auto - $14k || School - $17k  

&amp;nbsp;
  
Housing: I've been living in an apartment for the past 3 years. I absolutely hate the idea of paying ($890/month for just the rent) into a pit with no actual investment. I'm thinking it might be time to get a house, but I'm extremely cautious on spending big. I'm not sure my price range, but homes are reasonably priced (i think) in the area I live. I had tossed this idea around a year and a half ago and was approved by my bank for a $200k home loan, but never went through with it. The homes around me that I like are about 165k average.* (2+ bath, 3+ bed)  

&amp;nbsp;
  
Am I okay to make this jump? Any alternatives or suggestions on what to do?  *What kinds of benefits can I get for a first time home buyer?

personalfinance,Question about student loans.,"Hello! So, I am currently in college, and thought my grades for the last semester were poor enough Id lose some scholarship money. In anticipation of this, I took out $3,500 in subsidized federal loans. But somehow I managed to keep my grades up, keeping my scholarships,  making the loan unnecessary! This loan do not accrue interest while I am in college, so there is no rush to pay it back.
The way I see it, I have two options. I could pay it all back immediately, as I dont need any of it anymore, or could open a new bank account, put it in there, and make monthly payments over the next two years (when I graduate), to improve my credit over time. My question is, which option is more wise?",finance

When filing federal taxes, there is a $100,800 foreign income exclusion that applies to her income but not to mine, which would bring us back well within the range that would allow us to contribute to our Roth IRAs. My question is if that is a valid approach or would her foreign income count against the $196,000 limit?",finance
personalfinance,"CAN going back to school in the US, wondering best way to utilize student line of credit","I'm 26, with a bachelors of arts from a Canadian University, and am going back to school this spring to take some of my remaining undergrad prereqs for the masters program I've finally decided I'm interested in pursuing (Occupational Therapy for those interested.) I've spent the past few years since graduating working in a restaurant to pay off my undergrad student loans, travel, and save some money. I live debt free and don't have any large assets in my name, but have around $20k CAD in savings, $4k CAD in mutual funds (that ideally I don't want to touch) and have a $15k CAD per year student line of credit that my dad cosigned with me from TD.

Here's the catch: I was saving with the intent to go back to school in Canada, which would be the smart thing to do financially. However my boyfriend is American and he's just started a career at the moment and has a legal issue he's dealing with (family stuff) that makes it hard for him to come to Canada. Both of us are sick and tired of doing long distance so I got a student visa and am moving to New York to do my prereqs there starting at the end of the month. I know this is a bad idea as I would be spending a fraction of the cost to go to school at home, but whatever. Get over it. That decision has already been made.

Here's what I'm asking: what's the best way to take advantage of my student line of credit? I won't be able to work (legally) when I'm in the states because a student visa doesn't allow it except for very strict circumstances so unless I get creative I won't have a regular income anymore. As someone who worked almost full time throughout the rest of her undergrad this makes me nervous. I'm trying to come to terms with the idea of putting myself into some debt by the end of this, and I know I will be able to pay it off because the job market is still looking good for OTs for the next few years, but I want to be smart about it from the get-go. My undergrad loans were your run of the mill federal student loans so I never had very much choice in the matter.

Tuition and fees per year are quoted at just shy of $14k USD

My current assets (savings and first year of line of credit) with the unfortunate exchange rate work out to about $26k USD

I have a year and a half, maybe two years of classes to take. Ideally after the first semester I qualify for some sort of merit scholarship (as I did during my bachelors) but I don't want to count on that. I plan to live as frugally as I can - I'm moving in with my boyfriend rent free, which is a huge help and his way of thanking me for doing the moving - but want to know the best way to maximize both savings and credit. Should I pay my tuition outright with my line of credit since it's my biggest expense? Should I be trying to stay away from the line of credit as much as possible and only start using it once I need it? Should I take it all out and invest some of it in a GIC so that it makes money while I'm only paying interest on it? Debt is scary, help me!",finance

personalfinance,Should I ask my bank to increase my credit card limit to reduce % of debt (debt compared to higher limit) whilst paying down or should I just continue to pay down as is? (UK),"Hi. I've got 2 credit cards, both with different banks. One card is near my limit but previous good payment ratings means I have got 0% interest on it for about another 9 months. I will be able to clear this in time.    

BUT my 2nd card is about 30% - 40% of available credit in debt, with a 34% interest rate. It would take me 3 months of living on toast to clear this debt (uncomfortable but not impossible).

Is there any benefit to asking for an increase of credit on this card (previously good payment records, still receiving mail asking to transfer debts across from other accounts for 0%) so as to reduce the percentage of debt to credit available?

personalfinance,Vanguard Roth IRA / Vanguard 401k questions,"Hi, I am a 25 year old male living in NYC, about 3 years into my current job and I am just now getting my life into some kind of order and personal finance has been my focus as of late.

Question 1, My job offers a 401k through vanguard so I made an account today, or when I tried too apparently I had already done so and their is $730 sitting in the account I'm not even sure from where since I've never contributed anything. The account is a ""SUPPLEMENTAL RETIREMENT SAVINGS PLAN"". Is this my 401k? It is at 35% stocks and 65% bonds as of now, I was able to put the money other funds to switch the ratio to 90% stocks, 10% bonds, but it still hasn't gone through.

Question 2, I was able to open a Roth IRA through them as well today, which I thought required $1000 to open but it never prompted me to do so. So now I am worried I opened the wrong account, it is called a ""Roth IRA Brokerage Account"". 

Question 3, How do I contribute to my IRA? When I go to the contribute page, it just ask me for an amount and gives me a default ""Federal Money Market (Settlement Fund)"", or the option to add another fund. Should I just use this one and max out the $5500? This is all quite confusing!

personalfinance,Question about taxes (mom wants to claim me?),"Sorry if this is the wrong sub, I'm very confused.

2016 was kind of a weird year. I lived with my mom for more than 6 months of the year while she fully supported me. I'm currently 22 but was 21 at the time.

In April my mom lost her job. I then got a job in March and my grandma and I moved to a smaller apartment that I pay half the rent for plus the pgne. My mom crashes on our couch. She does not pay for anything, and claims to be homeless to recieve benefits (For anyone who thinks it's cruel that we make her sleep on the couch, it is a 2 bedroom with 6 people, my two cousins in one room and my grandma and I in the other. I even sleep on the floor because I can't afford a bed.)

In 2016 I made around 9k (not sure of exact number), I also have 0 federal or state (ca) exemptions, though I'm not sure what that means.

My mom now wants to claim me as a dependant, arguing that she did fully support me for 6 months of the year (though I'd like to point out, I now support her and my 8 year old sister as well acting as a caretaker for my grandma). I'm worried about how this will affect me? 

Will I be required to pay more taxes because of this? How does paying taxes even work? I know taxes are taken out of my checks and that my coworkers are excited about getting their refunds, but will I even get one if my mom is claiming me?

Sorry, I'm very confused since this is the first year paying taxes (before this I was a student, but had to drop out to take care of my grandma when she had a heart attack in December 2015.)",finance
personalfinance,Trapped on a high interest loan,"Hello PF.
First and foremost, i would like to thank every single person here. I am a long time lurker who has gained tremendous knowledge from all the helpful members who contribute on this sub. I would like to apolegize in advance for the formarting of this post as well as the spelling, first post created from an iPad.

i am spending time with a cousing of mine who has recently confided on me his financial situation and specifically the stress he's carrying with paying a high interest rate loan on car that's constently having mechanical problems. Before i begin i would like to provide some background information on that's relevant to where my cousin stands. 

25/Male/52K salary. Two years ago he used to lease a brand new Honda Accord for $500/month (crazy right?) defaulted on the 6K that was left on the lease, car got repo'd and his credit got hit with a 480 score. Six months later of being without a car he decided to go to a used car dealership and proceed to dig himself further on the hole. 

Took a 6 year loan on $14,459 Honda Accord 2010 (52K mileage) with a 21% rate interest rate and $3,000 down thats not going to the principal. Below are th numbers.

Car valued: $14,459
6y @ 21% interest / 452 monthly payments which totals to $18,489 just on interest alone! 
To sum it all up, the principal + the interest = $32,948

This is text book predatory sub prime loan which was exactly what John Oliver was talking about a few months ago on his show. I am not here to blame the dealership or the bank because with my cousin's horrible credit score and credit history he was basically asking to get rape. At this moment the car needs around $600 on body shop repair and with my cousin's credit score so low (432) he is again thinking on defaulting on the loan. I know this is terrible and im trying my best to guide on the best decision he can make but i wouldn't be posting here if I did not needed your help. 

I have done everything i can to make clear to him that he needs a whole re introduction to money and how to be responsible with money. He appears to taken this situation serious and he's willing to change his way. So, there it is... what do you guys think? What would be the best course of action he can take to save the most money? He doesnt appear to care much about his credit score.

My question is, now that it's paid off, what's the next step I should take? I'm already going to call and ask for a lower interest rate, as well as a higher credit limit to help increase my credit score (which is at a pretty poor 593 but is climbing since I started paying off the card). 

I've heard the Quicksilver is a good card - should I apply for that one and keep two cards? Should I see if I can get back in with Chase? Neither (and just keep using the Platinum as a debit card to increase my credit score)? Or should I never use the Platinum again?

My choice is to get a conventional home loan with a minimum 10 year term and $2K in closing costs.

Literally ended being my dream job, doing product design, testing, etc, along with travel and field work. I'm currently living with my parents, about a 45 min commute from where I'll be working. I plan to live with them for a few months, to pay down some of my student loans and build up my savings. I'll need a car at some point, but that's for another time, as I can use one of my parents for now. Just checked my credit score, and it's a 684, with no open credit cards (yet). With that info out of the way, time for details and questions.


**Salary/job details**

* Base salary of $62,500 a year
* Projected bonus of $6,000 dependent on my and the companies performance
* 401K is profit sharing, also the company matches 100% of the first 3% of my salary, along with 50% of the next 2% I put in. Max of 18k can be put in a year.
* Pay is biweekly, 26 payments of $2403.85


**Student Loans**
Note: my families financial situation changed **a lot** while I was in school, resulting in me ending up with way more student loans than planned when I started school.


**Federal Loans**

Type | Amount ($) | APR (%)
---|---|----
Perkins | 2625 | 5
Subsidized Stafford | 3513.67 | 3.4
Subsidized Stafford | 2297.39 | 3.4
Subsidized Stafford | 4607.66 | 3.86
Subsidized Stafford | 2764.71 | 4.66
Subsidized Stafford | 5527.09 | 4.29
Unsubsidized Stafford | 2084.99 | 4.29


**State Loans (NJ HESAA)**

Type | Amount ($) | APR (%)
---|---|----
HESAA | 25460.54 | 6.2
HESAA | 11443.22 | 6.65
HESAA | 9162.92 | 5.49

**Other** (Had to repeat a class)

Type | Amount ($) | APR (%)
---|---|----
Sallie Mae | 3281.57 | 8.625



Now that that's out of the way (with the tables hopefully working correctly), I'll outline the basics of what I plan to do:

* Get rid of the sallie mae loan as quickly as possible, then the NJ state ones, then the government ones
* Input into the 401k as mentioned above (employer matches 100% of first 3% of salary I put in, then matches 50% of the next 2% I put in
* Have 20% of each paycheck go into an emergency savings account
* Have 20% go into my regular savings account
* Have 15% go into a ""spend"" checking account. (Eg for a new computer or whatever)

**Now for the questions**

* What else should I be doing?
* What ***should*** I be doing? If my plan is wrong, please correct me.
* Where should the extra money from my paychecks be going? Should it go straight to the loans or should I be doing something else?
* How much should I be putting in the 401k?

**I'm pretty clueless about what I should be doing, having never really learned about this, even after reading through everything on the sidebar, so any advice you guys have would be greatly appreciated!**

""The interest rate is the cost of borrowing money. As interest rates rise, the cost to borrow money goes up resulting in less demand for money and credit. Alternatively, as interest rates fall, the cost of borrowing money declines causing higher demand for money and credit.""


So one source says higher interest with cause price to rise. And another says higher interest will cause price to fall. Am I missing something here? I'm probably missing a detail or overlooking something obvious. Thanks for the help, fellas",finance
ethereum,"How to follow, study and keep up to date with the Ethereum project. This info or link might help with newbies or people you would like to send info to regarding what ethereum is.","Iv been asked to put together some info / links on the Ethereum Project by a few people lately that iv met or talked to and since its Sunday and i got a half day from work here it is: 

I emailed them and then pasted it here so sorry if its a bit clumped together. Cant get the grasp of how reddit breaks up sentances 8-()

https://www.ethereum.org/
Ethereum is a  decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third party interference.

These apps run on a custom built  blockchain, an enormously powerful shared global infrastructure that can move value around and represent the ownership of property. This enables developers to create markets, store registries of debts or promises, move funds in accordance with instructions given long in the past (like a will or a futures contract) and many other things that have not been invented yet, all without a middle man or counterparty risk.

The project was bootstraped via an ether pre-sale during August 2014 by fans all around the world. It is developed by the  Ethereum Foundation, a Swiss nonprofit, with contributions from great minds across the globe.

Ethereum Blog: https://blog.ethereum.org/


Note: This is not investment advise, This email is just to show you what Ethereum is, what these 1000's of computer scientists, developers, programmers and hackers are building. A whole new internet run from millions of peoples computers all over the world to create the ""Ethereum Virtual Machine"" or world computer that 7 Billion people can log onto at the same time. It is censorship resistant, encrypted and the Ethereum Blockchain can not be hacked. This is going to change the world as we know it.

There is a built in currency called ""Ether"" or ""ETH"" and can be purchased from any of many exchanges listed below.

Note 2: ETC or Ethereum Classic is a smaller blockchain project that also uses the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) and id advise to stay away from that project, it has not got the 1000's of developers building it like ETH does, it apparently has one or 2 developers that went their own way, The EVM can also run private and consortium blockchains that alot of big and small companies are building on for their inhouse private operations. Like a Intranet (intranet is a private network that is contained within an enterprise) 


Its very hard to understand at first what exactly blockchain is so here are some videos that i think explains it well:

Ethereum and other blockchain project prices http://coinmarketcap.com/

There are many exchanges that trade Ether around the world http://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/#markets

Some ones i have used are:
www.kraken.com Accepts Euro, Dollar, GBP etc.. by SEPA or international bank transfer and you can buy Ether

www.poloniex.com (does not accept fiat but it is the largest volume for trading crypto pairs, I have used www.bitstamp.net in the UK to buy Bitcoin and then send them to Poloniex to swap for Ether )

www.yunbi.com A very good exchange based in China and have listed a few ethereum tokens, you need to swap through CNY (Chinese Yuan) but its easy and very good support.

www.bittrex.com No Fiat but also lists some Ethereum Based tokens

www.gatecoin.com Based in Hong Kong and you can send Euro and Dollar, Also lists alot of Ethereum Based tokens, Volume is very low at the moment as they recover from a hack but they offer very good support.


The safest place to store you Ether is on a hardware wallet like this one https://www.ledgerwallet.com/products/12-ledger-nano-s. 

You can also store all you Ethereum based tokens or shares on this device https://ledger.groovehq.com/knowledge_base/topics/how-to-secure-your-eth-tokens-augur-rep-dot-dot-dot-with-your-nano-s


The way ""I view"" the incentive to keep Ether (ETH) is the following and the reason i think it will go up in value is because of ""The velocity of Ether moving through the Ethereum economy (Platform)"". So the more Ether is used the higher the price will get and in a number of years will see us move down to the lower units finney, szabo, shannon, babbage, lovelace, and wei as the digital economy grows. Ether has 18 decimal places 1,000,000,000,000,000,000. Because after POS Ether total supply will be set at approx. 100 Million with a small inflation of 1 to 3% that pays the computers running it.

So ether will be more like the reserve currency and trade currency between all the other currencies, contracts and Dapps interacting in the Ethereum digital economy. But its main function is like a gas to run the network. Every transaction you have to pay a tiny amount to the network that goes to all the computers running the network. less than 1 penny.


Ethereum Based Tokens / Synthetic assets (What is a Synthetic Asset https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=St9DBpNBP1Q)


On coinmarketcap.com you can see there are 642 other Blockchain projects listed and some like Bitcoin are 8 years old. 90%+ of these projects are junk projects developed by 1 or 2 people and are just copies of Bitcoin. Some have added extra functions over Bitcoin and Bitcoin is a very secure but slow payment DAPP but cant do much else besides payments.

Ethereum was built from scratch and is built like lets say ""android or a smart phone"" so that DAPPS can be plugged in as you should have heard from the above videos. So there are now a good few DAPPS that are nearly completion that were built on the ethereum blockchain by different groups of developers. There are alot more but 328 are listed here: http://dapps.ethercasts.com/. So there is not just 643 blockchain projects there are over 1000 but all the ones on Ethereum can communicate or interoperate with eachother. Some notable ones you can see listed on coinmarketcap are Augur, Iconomi, DigixDAO, Golem, SingularDTV etc..... All these because they are built on the Ethereum blockchain can interact with eachother but the other 600+ blockchains can not. This is what makes Ethereum different from the rest.


As DigixDAO is the one i have studied most ill give an example of a DAPP thats built on Ethereum and why a DAPP would be usefull

In industry most work is automated, the operators no longer have to take process samples manually and send to the lab or go and top up a tank manually with certain additives, This is all done by automation, When the process is at a certain temperate, level, viscosity etc.. the instrumentation measures this and adds or pumps the necessary ingredients / additives to make sure the final product is made correctly. This automation has saved alot of costs and manual labour in industry.


What Digix / blockchain is doing is automating alot of the back office paperwork, accounting, agreements etc... Example: company that owns a gold vault (Like Silver Bullion) have employees handling paperwork / sales etc and when people sell and buy gold it changes hands or changes registered ownership and the employees have to manually do this paperwork. What Digix provides is automated software that does all this automatically in 14 seconds. For billing / storage if you have gold stored in the vault you pay about 1% a year so you know if you have $10,000 worth of gold then you need to pay about $100 a year which you pay by topping up your gold (DGX) by $100 and its taken out automatically each day by a tiny tiny amount. 


The good thing is that if you have Gold Tokens as your savings instead of Fiat and you need to borrow $ short term you can borrow $ by agreeing to lock your Gold Tokens in a smart contract in the software and pay interest for that loan. If you pay back the loan over 3 months then the gold tokens are automatically returned to your address and you havent missed a gold rally or a Fiat devaluation. If you dont pay it back then the person who lent you the $ gets all your gold (or the % not paid) Again this process is automated in a smart contract and the bullion employee didnt have to settle all the paperwork, transfers of gold or get contracts and agreements signed by both parties, This is done by digital signature / agreements and saves the Vault operator alot of costs.


The vault operator can also earn a bit of the loans interest and $ can be provided by them or even 3rd parties.
Using the Ethereum blockchain this can be done for lots of different industries from banking, stocks, insurance, gambling, pritty much everywhere


Other non Ethereum related Youtube people i follow, mainly Economics, Geo-politics, Gold / Silver etc.... These people give some very good info that you wont get from the big media companies or state media. Maybe this will help you understand why you should not keep 100% of your wealth in $ and maybe a few % is worth keeping in Crypto or ever Gold Physical or easier DGX (DigixDAO) or DGD.

personalfinance,Roth vs regular 401K for a specific situation?,"Hi,

Firstly, thanks to all the contributions in this thread. It has been very useful and helped me take wise decisions.

**Current situation:**  
No Kids  
*Tax bracket:* Filing jointly 25%  
*SO:* Regular 401K with company match (current balance less than $4K)  
*Myself:* regular 401K (less than $1K) with the previous company. ESOP (less than $1K) from previous company rolled over to Vanguard account and currently in VANGUARD FEDERAL MONEY MARKET FUND (Settlement Fund). My understanding is this ESOP fund is before tax.  

**Future state (2020 onwards):**  
Maybe Kids  
*Tax bracket:* Filing jointly 33%   

**Questions:**  

* **Should we contribute to Roth or regular 401K?**  
* **What should I do now to the 401K and IRAs that I have currently to enable a tax-free Backdoor Roth IRA in the future?**
* **Should we do a Roth In-Plan Conversion?**  


After reading various threads, I believe we should be making ROTH 401K contributions instead of regular 401K as we are in a lower tax bracket compared to future income. Correct me if I'm wrong. I'm doubting myself because I'm wondering if I should only consider the expected tax rate at the time of withdrawal while deciding between Roth and regular 401K. I'm expecting our withdrawal would be in 15% tax bracket assuming that the tax brackets increases in the same proportion as inflation.

On back-door Roth IRA, I read this [article](http://whitecoatinvestor.com/backdoor-roth-ira-tutorial/) and figured out I need to get rid of the rollover IRA that I got through ESOP. Again correct me if I'm wrong. What steps should I be taking and when?

Thanks",finance
personalfinance,Looking into a school that doesn't offer financial aid. Need advice!,"The school I want to attend requires you to budget $20k to $30k for tuition and expenses. I'm looking for information about the best way to do this through personal loans. It's my understanding that the interest rate is much higher for personal loans than a student loan and financial aid. 

I used to have good credit, (730), but in the past couple years my ex racked up my credit cards and my score dropped to its lowest of 590 in November. I've been working hard to build it back up, now I'm at 641. My total balances are still about $7k, which is 55% of my available credit.

I'm wondering if I should keep working to build my credit back up and clear my balances before I start thinking about personal loans of this size. What else can I do to help? Any suggestions are much appreciated!",finance
personalfinance,Student loan consolidation options,"Hello reddit so my wife has around $20,000 in student loans that have around 6% interest on them, and despite her making her (minimum) payments monthly to these, they are seemingly not changing and she believes increasing. I'm trying to help her get her debt in check since we're hoping to buy a house this year. My question is what are our options in getting these loans all consolidated at a lower interest rate? I believe if she had a single bill to pay monthly it would be easier to manage. Does anyone have experience in this, or have a company they'd recommend?",finance
personalfinance,Choosing an Acceptable Emergency fund.,"It's my 2nd year out of college making 60k base. Rent is $600 plus utilities its $700. Already living with roommates. I drive an acceptable old car in goodish condition (2001 honda civic with 140k miles). My job setup is good as they pay for phone, gym and most of my food since I travel alot. I get reimbursed for mileage so I rake in an extra 1k to 2k every month in exchange for car depreciation. I'm putting all of that into a new car fund which is at 4k right now.

Right now I have 11k in a savings account(separate from new car fund). I however have 33k in student loans. All of it is federal thankfully, however about 6k of it at 6.8% interest. Everything else is very low(sub 4%). I am currently have to pay $350 a month, I pay $400 and send $50 to the higher interest loan.

My main question is this: How much of my savings should I keep as emergency fund vs putting towards debt?

Additional info:

1. 401k matches 4% and gives another 4%. So I put in 4% only. Should I put in more?

2. I want an acceptable 2010-2014 car by next year. I assume that would cost 10k-ish. Once I get that, I'll put my mileage money towards debt.

3. I spend a lot of money (3k to 5k) every month for my company on my credit card for which I am reimbursed. I use a highish cashback card for those to get some nice rewards. Are there additional ways to monetize this spending.

Thanks,",finance

personalfinance,Full Income Reported on W2 in two States NY &amp; NJ,"I got my W2 today from my employer (employer based in a third tax-free state) and I had (almost) my full income reported in box 16 of my W2 for two separate states.

I moved from NYC to NJ as of Jan 1 2016. My payroll wasn't updated for that first week so on my W4 I have NYC and NYS taxes withheld for my first week of income (paid weekly).

So my W2 now has two sets of reporting for both NY and NJ and using hypothetical numbers reads something like ""total federal income $150K"" ""NYC reportable income $2,500"" ""NJ reportable income $147,500"" and NYS reportable income of ""$150,000"" on a second set of W2 receipts.

I lived in NJ for 100% of the year and other than the first week where NYC &amp; NYS taxes were withheld, all state taxes were withheld in NJ. As this reads I'm extremely concerned that in the eyes of NYS I have taxable income of $150K that I haven't paid anything towards.

Obviously Im mainly concerned at this potentially huge tax liability in NYS. My NJ state income is also now under-reported by that one week that was allocated to NJ - for some reason that was properly pro-rated according to the data ADP had, as was NYC, but NYS reported my full federal income.

How, if in any way, would I handle this when filing my taxes to indicate to NYS I should not owe any state taxes? Do I file for both New York and New Jersey? Is one a resident return and one a non-resident? Should I increase my taxable NJ income for all 52 weeks even though it is reported on my W2 as being for only 51 weeks?

As an aside, NYC is one of the few municipalities that requires you to file a form that you are no longer a resident for tax purposes, and I did so at the end of last year with my 2015 taxes stating I was moving as of Dec. 31, but that was for the city not state.
Thanks so much for any help - I'm quite concerned and any help would be appreciated.

investing,2017 Macro Predictions - The S&amp;P 500 Will Close at 2400,"http://tradethumb.com/the-sp-500-will-close-2017-at-2400/

The S&amp;P 500 Will Close 2017 at 2400
2017 is here and comes with it a glut of economic changes and predictions. With the “Trump Rally” on full speed, markets are continuing to reach record levels. Given a new presidency, a Republican led congress and higher interest rates, the bull market has much change ahead. Here are the official 2017 TradeThumb predictions of what’s to come in the year ahead.

Prediction 1: Corporate taxes will be lowered by Trump and the Republican led congress.

As part of the rhetoric of Trump and the Republican led congress, the lowering of corporate tax rates has become a key component of the Trump tax plan. Not only has lowering corporate taxes been boasted by the president-elect, but it’s likely been a major catalyst for markets during the recent weeks. I’m predicting corporate taxes will officially decrease during Q3 of 2017.

Prediction 2: Issues regarding policy will create periods of increased volatility regarding the Trump rhetoric.

As with much rumored news and expected policy, not everything ends as expected. In 2017 we believe Trump’s transition will not be as smooth as Wall Street hopes. While corporate taxes will likely be lowered in 2017, we believe other policy will take longer to solidify. Among many of the expected changes given the new presidency, change is still bureaucratic. Overall markets may experience volatility given any stagnation regarding the complete Trump rhetoric.

Prediction 3: 2017 will see more waves of anti-globalism and nationalism.

In 2016 we experienced Brexit, the Italian referendums and the Trump phenomenon. In 2017 We’re predicting more nationalism in parts of Europe and elsewhere in the world. While many of these issues are thought to be related to economic frustration, globalization has played a significant role in evolving current economies. While acts of nationalism may relieve certain issues related to jobs and local economics in the short term, it is difficult to see a positive impact moving forward.

Prediction 4: Earnings growth will drive future market performance.

Since the election, markets have been pricing in a Trump presidency and a Republican led congress. In the midst of lower corporate tax rates and the easing of regulation, earnings growth is being primed. Since the end of 2014, markets have seen negative earnings growth in conjunction with strong multiple expansion. In 2017, as multiples have reached historic highs, we’re predicting the return of strong earnings growth from Q4 2016 onwards. An important facet in regards to valuations and EPS growth is however that historically markets have underperformed during times of EPS growth when compared with times of multiple expansion. BMO Capital markets and Bloomberg report that the average trailing 12-month return for the S&amp;P 500 is 14% during P/E driven markets and 4.2% for EPS driven markets.

Prediction 5: Stock pickers will outperform.

Given a market driven by earnings growth, volatility is likely to remain in 2017. In addition, shifts in policy typically create winners and losers. Overall stock picking will be a major theme in 2017.

Prediction 6: The Fed will hike interest rates in 2017.

The Federal funds rate was increased to .75% in December of 2016. With earnings growth expected to increase, continued wage growth and inflation churning higher toward 2%, we’re predicting a more hawkish Federal Reserve in 2017. We’re targeting a Federal Funds rate between 1% – 1.25% by the end of 2017.

Prediction 7: Silver will surpass 2016’s level of $20.00 per ounce.

The gold and silver trade has been dismal since Q3 of 2016, however we remain bullish on silver specifically. Given reflation and the inflation-bound Trump, in addition to a generally hot scene geopolitically, both gold and silver remain go-to hedges. Silver however fundamentally trumps gold. Silver supply continues to lack that of demand, and demand continues to increase. More than half of silver production is used within industrial applications such as solar panels and other electronics. While interest rates look to continue their gradual rise, silver remains a viable play given current price and market conditions.

Prediction 8: The S&amp;P 500 will close out the year at 2400.

We are generally positive on growth and U.S. markets in 2017. We’re predicting inflation and interest rates to grind higher complimenting continued economic growth, wage growth and new policy brought on by Trump and his government. Overall there’s much in store for markets in 2017. From the Trump Presidency, the return of earnings growth, the strong dollar, Brexit fallout and reflation, volatility likely remains a core theme of 2017. We’re predicting a modest increase of the S&amp;P 500 to 2400, a 5.25% tick higher than today’s level of about 2280.",finance
personalfinance,Student loan payments on $45k about to start!,"Hi all, 
I've been lurking on PF for some time now. My student loans have started repayment so I figured I'd post to get some advice in addition to my plans. 
I went to a private college (unfortunately, first one in the family to attend so we didn't have a clue) and now I have a nice mountain of debt. I'm not to concerned with my Federal loans, the interest is low, and the terms are too good to give up. My private loans through Sallie Mae are terrifying though! Here's a breakdown:
1:$10,420 @ 11.5%, 96 months, estimate payoff 10/2024 
2:$12,745 @ 9.375%, 120 months, estimate payoff 10/2026

4:$10,740 @ 11.75%, 144 months, estimate payoff 10/2028
5: 2,098 @ 8.875%, 90 months, 5/2024.
I take home about $2,600 a month, and splitting with the SO my rent is $400, with other bills (electric/internet/phone) about $120/month.

I have about $9k in combination between my checking and savings, which I'd like to save the majority of with the fact that I plan to go back to school full time in the next year or two for my masters.
Thinking about my budget and being new to this, I am hoping to pay extra on my loans. How much of my monthly pay should I be allocating towards my loans? Any other helpful advice is appreciated too!",finance

personalfinance,"How can I maximize my credit score, and which cash-back credit card is best for me?","My credit score is &gt;720, but I'd like to maximize it for interest rate purposes and figure out how to get more cash back from my credit cards.  Please help me, /r/personalfinance!

1. I have a credit card from my credit union from when I was 19 or 20 that offers pretty much zero incentives, but it was the only way I could start building credit at that time.  Nowadays I rarely make any purchases on it and just keep it open to help my credit history, since I still don't have any credit lines that are 10 years old.  Is it fine to keep this credit line open even though I might not make any purchases on it at all in a given year? Would it help my credit any more if I made at least one purchase per year or per month on this card?

2. Is there any difference to my credit score if I pay off the entire balance of my credit cards each month before any interest accrues (which is what I have been doing my entire life), or if I pay it all off except a minimal amount (say $5) to let a tiny amount of interest accrue? Would that tiny amount of interest help my credit score in any way or do creditors not care if they make any interest off of me beyond the processing fees they make from the merchants I am buying from?

3. My only other credit card is a CapitalOne Platinum card, which I've had for around 5 years.  I spend $500-900 on it most months and pay it off entirely each month.  It gives a tiny amount of cash back.  I'm not interested in airline miles or hotel points, but I'm very interested in getting more cash back and was looking into the CapitalOne Quicksilver card since 1.5% cash back sounds pretty good compared to most cards out there.  Can I get the Quicksilver without closing my Platinum account (I want to keep the Platinum account open to help my credit score)?  Can I convert the Platinum account into a Quicksilver account and end up with a Quicksilver account that is 5 years old? Is there a better cashback card than the Quicksilver? 

I will be responding to posts for at least the next 6-7 hours before bedtime and again tomorrow morning if anyone needs more information in order to give me better advice.  Thanks in advance",finance
economy,impossible debt burden on future generation. THIS NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED!,"What happens when a country admits or declares that it cannot effectively pay back its national debt. At $20,000,000,000,000 our debt spreads out to over $60,000 per citizen. the new budget being put forward will push us to $29 trillion by the end of 2026. Who will hold accountability for this massive burden being passed on to my generation? Debts must be payed back and it seems as if the people who have been racking up the most of it have no plan to eliminate it before their generation dies off. We have a massive college debt problem that has acted as economic shackles to imprison our future work force. Millennials (I hate the term) are not saving due to ridiculously low interest rates that mean you are losing value to inflation when you are not spending your money and keeping it in a bank. With baby boomers and gen X ers aging you can also consider the irony that our upcoming generation will be paying social security to support their retirement on top of working to pay back their impossible mountain of debt they will be leaving behind. This system is finite. It CANNOT support it self. The older generation and those before them have rigged the game badly it has become impossible for the new players to beat. This IS a very big problem for our future. This is the world you are raising your kids to grow up in. They will be a slave to the debt you left behind. Some how nobody seems be able to even just admit that this is a problem worth seriously considering. People know we have debt but have become so accustomed to the idea that borrowed money holds no consequences that we shrug it off and say we will worry about it some other day. What day? When do we plan on fixing this? Every year our debt rises. If we can't even slow it down how do we plan to reverse it. We don't. We can't. A day will come in the future when the very last of the dying generation that put us here says ""sorry, we cannot fix this for you."" Consider this. If that day comes, and we fully come to an agreement that our debt cannot be payed back and that our nation has become bankrupt, what happens then?",finance
personalfinance,Working on raising my credit score.,"For the past year I have been working on my credit. I started at 584 and was unable to get approved for any credit cards, and could only get car loans with ridiculously high interest rates. So I opened a secured card and used less than 10% of the balance for a year. I am also making payments on my first ever car loan. The two have made my credit go up to a 718, which i think is pretty good given where I was this time last year. 

However, I have a hospital bill that went to collections. It's $1900 and there was a court ruling to to garnish my wages. I quit that job and they never came back after me. I recently tried to refinance my auto loan through my bank because I found out a 23% interest auto loan is really high... I got denied because of this collection and court ruling. It was the only reason.

Since my credit score shot up recently I decided to apply for one credit card. And I got approved with a pretty high limit. I was reading the info packet the card came with and noticed it has a 14 month 0% interest balance transfer offer. 

I was wondering if the good folks here at r/personalfinance could help me figure out if it would be a good idea to transfer this collections account to my new credit card.

My thought was I could move this balance to my credit card to get the collections account closed and the court ruling removed. Then I could actually refinance my car at a lower interest rate.

personalfinance,Comparing debts over time or fixed time period? Which costs more in the long run?,"Hi,


I've always believed that it's financially best to pay off the debt with highest interest rate first but after doing some calculations I'm not sure - I think I've confused myself.


Let's say I have £5,000 to deposit on one of two loans;


**Loan 1 (Mortgage)**

 * £125,000
 * 1.84%
 * 320 months

**Loan 2 (Car)**

 * £8,000
 * 10.9%
 * 40 months

Looking at the entire duration of the loans;

 * The total compound interest of £5,000 using details of loan 1 (1.84%, 320 months) is £3,166.92.
 * The total compound interest of £5,000 using details of loan 2 (10.9%, 40 months) is £2,190.19.


So that says I'll save £3,166.92 if put £5,000 on my mortgage today, but only £2,190.19 if I put the money on the car loan.


However, that's not comparing the debts like for like due to their different time periods.


So looking at it for a single month;

 * The total compound interest of £5,000 using details of loan 1 (1.84%, 1 month) is £7.67.
 * The total compound interest of £5,000 using details of loan 2 (10.9%, 1 month) is £45.62.


So I'm confused here. Month by month the car is a higher interest rate and costs more. But comparing the entire duration of both loans it seems like it might be better to put the money into the mortgage.


Am I missing something here?

investing,How is the DJIA so high?,"On a macro-economic level, how is the DJIA so high? 

So right now, it's about ~19,963, and has trended up the past 8 years from a low of ~6,000 in 2009. Let's say it was unusually undervalued then, it's still difficult to see how up we are vs the peak in 2007/2013 (~14,000). Intrinsically, has the ""true"" value of the US economy (or companies) expanded roughly 33% in the past 4 years? Even with quantitative easing and lower interest rates, would it have that big of an impact? And if so, once things begin to let up, wouldn't we likewise expect a pullback?

I've been contributing to index funds fairly regularly the past few years, but as I'm looking to do my lump sum for 2017, I can't help but feel some doubt as to whether this is sustainable. I know, I know, you can't time the market etc etc, but my natural inclination is that there's no way we don't see some sort of significant pullback in the near term future, right?

Student loan is ~35k @ 4%.  Payment is $237/mo for 20 years.  These are not federal loans, before all the debt relief crap started we rolled all her small federal student loans into one loan with wells fargo so we only had one smaller payment.

Home Improvement loan is about 20k at ~7% (I know, I know).

I have 30k in an emergency fund.  So I can make a pretty large impact on our debt.  I also have a summer side job that lands me anywhere from 30-50k every summer.  This is a significant part of our yearly income however so its not all available to throw at debt.

Is it a wise move to dip into the emergency fund to pay down these loans to where the amortization schedule switches from paying more towards principal than to interest?

personalfinance,Refund for 2015 stolen because employer leaked W2 information,"Hey,

In March 2016 I learned that someone else had used my W2 information to file taxes in my name. I learned this from my employer when all of my co-workers were struggling to efile: as it turned out, the reason they couldn't efile is because someone had already filed for them. And me.

I was (and am) expecting a refund of ~$2500. Obviously I couldn't efile. So after putting a hold on my accounts with the various ratings agencies I paper filed in April. 

A few months later my paper return was sent back to me. Like an idiot, I'd forgotten to sign the return because this was the first time in my life doing taxes on paper. Ok whatever, sign it and send it back.

Sometime in November I checked my return status by entering my zip code and expected refund amount. At that time, my return had been received and was being processed. It's been two months and I haven't received my refund; furthermore, when I go to check my refund status the IRS now no longer has record of me having filed that return.

I'm getting fed up with this.

I left that job for a new one in April 2016, shortly after learning they (or their payroll processor) had allowed everyone's personal information to get stolen. I never signed or accepted anything (eg, Life Alert monitoring (not that it was offered)) that would limit the company's liability on this matter.

Because I left I have no emails proving their acknowledgement of this issue. I also have a weird relationship with this company because I worked in a satellite office with one executive level employee who has since also left the company.

I've gotten the run around from the IRS whenever I've tried reaching out. At this point I don't even care if I get all of my money back. If I have to pay some lawyer $2000 so that I can get back $500, then so be it. But I'm not going to let this company essentially steal money from me like this. Additionally, I'm expecting a return of ~$3000 for 2016 and it's critical that I receive this money sometime before June. I plan on filing that return as soon as I receive all relevant documentation.

gaming,Server Owners: Why not GIT?,"Hey, I've been a developer for only a few years. We use this great tool called GIT(Source Control). If you're not familiar, plenty of online resources to get yourself started. What I want to introduce to you guys using GIT, not for your coding projects, all your server needs. 

# Controlling server updates

Don't you hate it when games update and now your whole dedicated server goes down? Or have you updated only to find your map doesn't work anymore? Using GIT you can keep track of server changes, updating on a branch and check if the update is functional, simple checkout the old branch if its broken. 


# Keeping track of saves

Have a whole folder filled with ZIP files? Have to keep coping all the files over and over. GIT allows you to simple commit your saves at anytime. Some games require the server to close, but you already do that for the ZIPs. Just like server updates you can roll back. Base totally covered in Lava? Getting griefed, no problem. Revert back to your last commit. Feature branch is a great thing. Try out some nice new mods, they work nice. 


# Remote backups? 

Your own server. All your changes are safe. I've been informed most sites don't allow game commits. So local repository or hosting own servers. 


# Enjoy

I hope this helps someone.

personalfinance,"Evaluate my financial plan/what to do with my savings - 27, $125k+/year, Bay Area","First, thank you all so much for the great information and discussion on this sub reddit. I am very sorry to say I didn't start to educate myself and get serious about personal finance until less than a year ago, and this subreddit has been very helpful in getting me on track and less nervous about investing.   

As of this year I earn $125k+/year gross in income ($95k base and $30k+ bonus) - hopefully $10k+ raises each year, and my all-in expenses are about $35k/year, so I think my savings rate is pretty good. I have no debt and pay off credit cards in full every month. Here's what I have now:  

* $60k at BoA (I know this is not good - legacy of prior mindset)  
* $37k vested in current 401k (yes, I am maxing contributions going forward)  
* $6k vested in old 401k  
* $11.5k in Roth IRA (yes, I am maxing contributions to some type of IRA going forward)  
* $11k in Taxable Investing Account - 90% Stocks  

Over the next few years my boyfriend and I are planning big, expensive life events including purchasing a home in SF (yes, we'll be getting married first) - which means our price range needs to be about $1 mil, which means a down payment of at least ~$200k. He earns ~50% more than I do but I'd like to pull equal weight in our expenses and contribute at least $100k of the down payment. Quickly following the home purchase will be having kids, another big expense. 

Here's my plan for re-structuring current savings:  

* $5k in BoA checking, maybe $1.5k in BoA savings  
* 17k 6-Month Emergency Fund in Ally Savings Account (1% interest)  
* 17k in Capital One 360 18-month CD (1.35% interest) - *does this make sense or should I keep liquid in Ally Savings at 1%? I'm nervous to tie up for longer than 2 yrs.*  
* $10k in I Bonds - $5k now (currently 2.76% interest), $5k in I Bonds in May *(the fixed interest rate on I bonds will likely by greater in May than the 0% it is now since the Fed just raised rates, right?)*  
* Additional $10k in Taxable Investing Account - 90% stocks  

Moving forward for additional savings:

* $1500 pre-tax/month to 401k  
* $750/month to Taxable Investing Account - 90% stocks  
* Remainder/month (~$750-$1000) to Ally Savings Account  
* Bonus of $30k+ split 2/3 to Ally Savings Account, 1/3 to Taxable Investing Account and IRA  
* Will continue to buy the maximum of $10k in I Bonds/year as long as they make sense

3) If provided, purchase ESPP.

Above is something that I do on a regular basis. 

My problem is that I do have 6 digit $$ sitting in the bank. I am in my mid 30's and earn well (tech sector, more than twice the average US household income). I am okay with taking risks that come with investments.

Banks give negligible interest rates (0.02%). 

I am a DIY kind of person. Dont mind learning, doing the hard work, but would rather not have a money manager to do this. 

I have been thinking of investing in index funds as a first step. I rarely buy and sell stocks other than ESPP.

Would you suggest some investment strategies/suggestions? Okay if suggestions have pros and cons so that I can weigh what works best.

personalfinance,Debt Reshuffling - Is this a bad idea?,"Hello! My husband and I are planning on doing some debt reshuffling in the near future, and while I think I have it all figured out, I'd love a second opinion. Please let me know if I've left out any pertinent info. 

Current monthly bills include (but not limited to):
Mortgage: $983 (plus $300 taxes and $150 insurance), 
Car payment: $465, 
Student loans: $1350 ($800 public, $550 private)

We have a good amount of equity in our home and are planning on selling soon in order to get into a better school district. We will realistically walk away with about $140k and were originally planning on putting the entire amount down on our next house, but I think that it might be a better idea to pay off our private student loans ($55k) and car ($11k) which will reduce our monthly payments by $1015 a month. This will leave us with about $74k to put down on the next house. The mortgage on a $350k house with $74k down will have a payment of about $1240 (plus $756 taxes and insurance). Our monthly expenses would actually decrease in this scenario, and we'd increase our mortgage interest deduction at the end of the year while still maxing out our student loan deduction. 

The two downfalls I see are: 1) securing unsecured debt, and 2) essentially extending the term of our private student loans from 10 years to 30 years. (Interest rate will probably be about the same.) We could always make additional principal only payments with the money we're saving each month to help reduce the overall interest paid. 

Are there any red flags I may be overlooking? 

Thank you!

personalfinance,"(AUS) Assessed for personal loan for debt consolidation, interest rate through the roof. What causes this?","Hi reddit,

Last week I was assessed by the commbank for a personal loan for the purposes of debt consolidation.

I have an existing personal loan with $17,000 outstanding, interest rate sitting at 13.5%. Existing credit card debt to the tune of precisely $6000. Home loan with $125,000 left outstanding. All repayments are ahead. These are literally all of my debts, I have nothing else, no store credit cards, no other loans, nothing.

Gross salary $3235 per fortnight. Mortgage repayments $199 per week. Personal loan repayments $330 per fortnight.

I enquired about another personal loan through commbank for the purposes of debt consolidation, and the newly assessed interest rate has gone up to 16.5%. I understand 13.5% isn't that low to begin with, but what specific circumstances cause such an increase? I've been informed that there is no way, under any circumstances that this can be lowered. Even the bank manager that did the assessment was shocked and has no explanation.

Is it worth approaching another bank for a different assessment? What other options exist?",finance

personalfinance,Upside down on an auto loan by almost 8k and need advice.,"A year ago I bought a 2012 Nissan Sentra base model from Carmax and in the end I owed about $13800 with a 20% APR. I pay $336 a month and within a year the total I owe now is down to $12600. On Kelly blue book my car's value is around $4000 - $4700 leaving me about $8000 upside down on my auto loan.

I wanted to refinance to drop down the APR but after reading many of the other auto loan horror stories I have realized that nobody would be willing to finance it that far upside down. 

There's a Honda car dealership near me that I called a few days ago that told me that they would be able to give me some extra trade-in value and offer rebates on their inventory but I have to still bring my car by for an inspection so I don't know how much they would offer me.

The reason I called was because I was thinking I could trade in my car for a newer car that way I could get a lower interest rate and hopefully get a car that would be worth more so I wouldn't be as far upside down (I'm not entirely sure if this logic makes sense but if it doesn't please correct me.)

Any advice would be great, if I'm missing some critical information let me know and I'll edit the post to add it.

$1,300.00 | $15,600.00 | 42.76%

&amp;nbsp;

**MY LIFE SITUATION**

&amp;nbsp;

So I accrued all of this by going to an expensive Art School.  Blah.  Well it's been roughly 8 Years since I've graduated and I was extremely fortunate enough to have the best parents in the world that have been making payment while I was working myself through my career.  They are continuing to make these monthly payments and above is where they are at right now.  (My loans were over $100K when I graduated!!!)

Now, I'm long overdue to be responsible of my education so I want to start contributing towards that, and I want my parents to prepare for retirement.  They insist that it's their job to pay for my education, but I'm not having any of that.

I currently work overseas, at a salary of roughly $75,000.  I'm not taxed since I'm making under $97,000, so all of this money goes towards savings and bills.  Here's what my situation looks like:

&amp;nbsp;

Expenses per month | Amount
----------|----------
Rent | $1,301.37
Bills (Electricity, Water, Internet, Phone) | $500.00
Food | $1,200.00
Recreational (Dinners, girlfriend, gifts, etc) | $1,000

&amp;nbsp;

**Salary per Month:** $6,250

**Total Left:** $2,248.63

&amp;nbsp;

**SAVINGS &amp; POSITIONS**

&amp;nbsp;

**Savings Account:** $6,078.00

**Stocks Cash Balance:** $2,840.93

**Stocks Positions:** $485.92

&amp;nbsp;

So, I have roughly $9,000 immediate available funds, and I should be able to maintain to generate $2,000 per month towards the loans.  I don't see a raise coming any time soon, but I do think that my rent might increase per month.  (It could go up to $1,400 or $1,500 - but I'll try to keep it down)

&amp;nbsp;

**THE MASTER PLAN**

&amp;nbsp;

The first thing I want to do is get rid of the loans that have a high interest.  I would put all of my savings to slash **10 - Signature Student: $8,089.25, 10.25%**.  And then start working on the unsubsidized 6.8% small loans and get rid of one or two every month while my parents are maintaining their monthly payments.

In around 8 month to a year (depending on any hiccups or speed bumps) we should be left with only 3 Loans:

&amp;nbsp;

Loan | Balance Due | Interest Rate | Cost per Year
---------|----------|----------|----------
11 - Signature Student | $13,338.90 | 9.25% | $1,233.85
12 - Signature Student | $14,017.80 | 10.25% | $1,436.82
13 - Signature Student | $18,621.56 | 12.75% | $2,374.25

&amp;nbsp;

These would obviously be less since they will be adjusted during the year as my parents are still making payments.  

&amp;nbsp;

From there I would pay as much as I can (it's looking like ~$2,000 per month) and start from the bottom up because of the interest rate.  I guess I should revisit the plan and my situation with my parents at that point to see what the best way would be to take these on.  This is actually where I'm a bit stuck at.

&amp;nbsp;

How can I get rid of these three while generating the least amount of interest in the shortest amount of time.

Also, if anyone knows any tax information that will help me alleviate these payments by making lump sums, or loan information that would make sense to consolidate them or something?  I am really uneducated about these two fields since I've been very disconnected with USA for almost a decade by working abroad.

**Loan 1**
Current Balance:  $11,842
Interest rate:  3% variable
Minimum Payment:  $147.11

**Loan 2**
Current Balance:  $12,226

Minimum Payment:  $113.82

I make a decent salary here, with the ability to put away about 2,000€ a month, and have about 40,000€ in liquid cash sitting in a checking account (no investment options for US citizens).  Every 3 months or so I transfer $1000 equivalent back to my US bank account to pay these loans, but I'm sick of doing that and I know I have enough cash to just pay them off in one fell swoop without breaking the bank or dipping into my emergency fund.

So why the hell am I worried about it?  Well the exchange rate EUR:USD has been crap lately.  I know it's impossible to predict where it's going to go in the future and it's just as likely to continue its tumble as it is to recover.  But when transferring $24,000, the difference a few cents makes toward my cost is huge.  (22,900€ at today's rate vs. 21,800€ if it goes 0.05 higher).  Maybe I'm still a bit pissed about all the money I lost when moving here when the exchange rate was $1.30:1€ and I had to convert all my savings.

What can I do to feel better about this, PF?  I was thinking of paying one off now and waiting another year or so to see what happens before paying the other off, but the PF-reader inside of me is kicking me with that line of thinking-- why the hell should I continue to pay interest with potentially no benefit at the end?

personalfinance,State vs. federal tax exemptions and additional withholding and their effects,"Hi, 

I have some questions about exemptions at the state and federal level. My HR department has us fill out a form for our federal/state exemptions and ""additional withholding"". I am single and have no dependents. I live in MA.

So, I've recently moved out of my parent's home. If my father was claiming me as a dependent, how do we go about giving me an exemption? Should I wait till he changes his number of exemptions, and then put myself as having 1 exemption, or can I just go ahead and change it? Do we have to wait until April to change this, or can we do it right now?

I'm also curious as to how much money claiming exemptions will actually save you. I believe that claiming 1 exemption makes it so that you don't pay tax on $4000-ish, but how much money does that save really? Trying to figure out how big of a priority this should be for me.

Also, are exemptions and withholding different at the state and federal levels? If I have 1 exemption at the federal level, does that mean I will have 1 at the state level, or are they totally different? Same for ""additional withholding."" When I fill out my W-4, is that just stating how much withholding that I want at the federal level only?

How much effect can having correct federal/state exemptions and withholding have on the amount of money I have immediately available to me? For example, let's say I make $6000 a month in MA. If I had 1 allowance and 1 exemption at the federal level, how much more money would I have immediately available to me, instead of having it returned at the end of the year?

personalfinance,Questions about debt and qualifying for funding for grad school,"**Backstory/ Useful information:**

My credit score is 625, now consisting solely of medical debt. At this point, they total approximately $10k. 

I'm currently in an undergrad program, hoping to get into med school once it finishes. I am using federal subsidized and unsubsidized loans coupled with the pell grant and a very small (500$ per semester) scholarship to pay for school.  My main concern at this point is whether or not I'll qualify for PLUS loans, particularly with a current financial crisis. 

Besides medical debt, I have currently 4 credit cards, a car loan, and a personal loan I took out when injured on the job but my boss refused to report for workman's comp (I did not seek legal advice at the time, just over a year ago, and I regret it). 

My car loan balance is 22832.15 at 7.5% (approximate, can't find it on my statements or online anywhere) (about 8k over the actual value)

The personal loan has a balance of 5075.57 at a 33.99% interest rate

The highest balance credit card has a balance of 4571.46 at an interest rate of 21.74%

The next highest is 927.87, at a rate of 18.74%. 

The other two cards are under 500$ combined, both high interest, however I am not worried about paying them off at this time as they are manageable. 

**My current problem is this**: I moved across the states to escape an abusive situation.  I am not employed, and I am having trouble finding work as I do not have a sitter for my daughter after/before school, and cannot afford daycare costs on my income when I am employed. My boyfriend watches my daughter during my schooling in the evenings, but he cannot during those few hours before and after her school because of his job.  The jobs I've had are mostly delivery driving, gas stations, or call center type work. I can only work part time as school is a large part of my focus and I do not want to quit. 

I have been using my school loans to get by. I am currently unable to sustain this, as my car note alone is $420.83 and the cards and loan add up to $437, for a total of $858~ plus my phone bill (30ish dollars). My stipend is $1012 every three months (I attend Kaplan, so our semesters are 10 weeks). I don't want to use school loans for living expenses, but I am trying to stay afloat and not further damage my credit. I will completely run out of money this month. 

Currently my boyfriend is allowing me to not pay rent/food costs for my daughter and I, so I don't have those expenses.

**My questions are:**  

What options do I have for getting rid of my car with minimal impact to my credit, assuming I cannot sell and take out a loan for the 8k difference because of my credit score? 

Are there loans that I might qualify for that will help me float until I can find work, or is that an even worse idea (leaning towards it being much worse)?

Should I pursue personal student loans for living expenses? 

If I let my car go back, and took the hit to my credit, what are my chances of qualifying for graduate loans for med school?

Should I be considering bankruptcy, and if I did, would I have to wait 7 years to get graduate loans? Would I even be able to do so after those 7 years?


**The gist of the situation is:** 

I want to get my doctorate, but I will need loans to attend school. I am worried I cannot get these loans as I can no longer pay my bills and believe I am about to ruin my credit further by losing my car and being unable to pay my credit cards and loans. I am in no danger of being homeless or without food.

personalfinance,Ex-Wife Student Loan Debt - What should I do?,"Hello PF,

I am normally a lurker on this sub, but I'm having a serious problem right now and I think this is the best place to ask for help/advice. About 5 years ago I co-signed on a few student loans for my (now ex-) wife. Yes, I know this was dumb, but at the time it made the most sense for our situation. These loans through Sallie Mae total close to $40k. Well she is out of school now. I'm not sure if she graduated or decided to call it quits, but either way, she is no longer enrolled and payments are due.

Leading up to the first payment, I sent her multiple texts and she told me she was handling it. Suddenly it's 15 days after the due date and no payment has been made, so to avoid fees I end up making the $450 payment. The interest rate is nearly 10% and variable, so that's a huge red flag for me. I have already looked into re-consolidating and removing her name from the loan. This would get me about 6% interest rate fixed and remove the last connection from her that I have. With the new terms, my payments would be $300ish/month for 15 years. I'm not thrilled about the length of the loan, but I have to consider my excess monthly income and this is already pushing it.

However, a guy at worked mentioned that maybe going into default is the better option. He said he would never pay for his ex-wife's loans and the collectors would stop after a few years. Credit reports would be affected for quite a while, but after 7 years it would be fine. Currently my credit score is about 770 and I plan to buy a new house in about 4 years, so I'm not sure if this option is really feasible/responsible.

I'm sure there are additional needed details, so let me know.

We have a 6 month emergency savings account in place and about 25k in cash. We have 60k in retirement accounts(4 total, all index or target retirement funds). We each have a Roth IRA. I have an account through work which I contribute to the maximize the match offered. She has another account through a previous employer and I have a small E*TRADE account to dabble in stocks. We own our townhouse, $730 a month is the mortgage. We own both cars. We have great credit scores. 

I have 340k in loans at about 6.5% and have made income based repayments for almost 4 years now, each payment is on time.

My wife has 200k in loans with 6.5% interest, also making on time Income based repayments for the last four years. We have not yet had to ""renew"" our IBR, but when we do, her payments will increase given her significant change in salary.

We have no credit card debt, pay all our bills on time. We have disability insurance for my wife and will be getting life insurance for myself and her. We have a baby on the way. 

I have multiple questions about our situation and am looking for anyone who is knowledgeable. 

1.) How do we go about tackling this massive debt?There are smarter ways out there than the traditional ways, such as lenders like SoFi. Anyone out there have experience with this? I will definitely be moving her debt to a lower interest rate lender, but not quite sure where to begin. 

2.) The wife works for a small employer who does not have a retirement plan through work. Not ideal, I know.  What would you recommend for her retirement? 

3.) What are the recommendations for life insurance? What total amounts are recommended. 

4.) Any specific changes we should consider because of the baby? 

5.) Should we file our taxes as joint returns or separate? My loan repayments could sky rocket if we file together

personalfinance,"28 yr old, rolled over 401k, should I reallocate?","Just got a new job, so time to look at where I'm at. 5 years ago, I just picked VDIGX [Vanguard dividend growth] and started chucking money at it. Emergency fund for 6 months of rent, food, expenses already setup.



Current allocation is as follows:

**Taxable (""Save for house, car, etc"")**: $47k VDIGX
Currently stopping contribution here and directing whatever I can to the new 401k. I believe about $50k is enough for whatever I might need in the mid/long term. I don't have any direct need for this money, but I didn't want it in a retirement account I couldn't touch until age 60.

**Traditional IRA (rollover from old 401k)**: $28k Federal money market
Just had this setup- it's the rollover from the old 401k. Needs utilized ASAP. No additional contributions will be happening here.

**Roth IRA**: $47k VDIGX
Maxing out every year since I started working and will continue to do so.

**New 401k**: $1.5k Target Retirement 2055
Currently contributing 20%, but could up to 25% in the future. Just moved out, so I'm seeing what it actually costs to live. This I won't be moving.



First thing most of you are going to say is, why not just stick it all in the total stock market index and be done with it. Given about 1/3 of it's in a taxable account that makes about $2k in taxable gains each year, is this wise? I was thinking of moving the amount in the taxable account to VTMSX to cut down on the taxed gains each year and have some exposure to small cap. Plus, I'm hitting a .33% expense ratio with VDIGX. This would be .11% This would expose me to small cap stocks.

That leaves the $28k of the traditional IRA and the $47k of the Roth IRA. What should I do with these? Total stock market funds? Three fund portfolio because I'd already be exposed to small cap with the taxable? Any bonds at all?

personalfinance,401k Loan to pay off student debt?,"I was wondering if it would be a good idea to temporarily change my 401k investment to 50% (company matches 4%, I currently invest 10%) in order to pay off my school loans.

I have over 11k in credit card debt spread over 5 different credit lenders.

I have about 1k in a savings account and 5,892 in 401k with an additional 2964 in employee match. 

My current 401k is ending due to a new owner in our company and we're switching to a 401k with no matching. I actually have no idea what to do with the money on this account whether i should roll it over or not. I was thinking about holding off on signing up while paying my debts off.

I started out doing the snowball method for debt but I noticed some of my higher interest payees accruing some hefty charges.

I realize that this debt is 100% my fault and I have a problem with spending. I'm making changes to spend less and focus on paying debt/saving.

personalfinance,Parent offering me a name on an investment rental home title. Seems like an amazing opportunity. How does this sound?,"Hello PF! I’ve been a long time lurker but I’d like some of your thoughts and advice on an upcoming situation.  Here’s a summary of me and my situation: I’m 29, working in a software support / technical troubleshooting position making $59k before taxes. I live in Austin, Texas. I’m almost 4 years out of college and have around $10k left of my ~$35k student loans (I was making substantially less when I started out). I’m living in a 2x2 apartment; my rent is $785 a month (including garage space for a woodshop). Utilities are decent for the area, between $90 and $150 each a month depending on how hot it is in summer. 

This sub has helped me come a long way from having little-to-no financial wisdom right out of college to helping me build up a savings acct, contribute to a 401k, and pay towards my loans. **I’m looking for advice and thoughts on a potential investment opportunity.**

My mother and grandmother own a few houses and are looking to purchase a 4th in the South Austin area. The housing market in Austin has been rising for years and is projected to continue rising for a long time. The house they’re looking to buy will be sold under-market for $185k. This same home plan down the street in an updated condition was recently sold for $265 and the homes in the area are in the 200-300k range. The opportunity and value come from the owner wanting to sell for personal reasons, so she is OK selling under market because she doesn’t want to do any work to get the house sell-ready. She wants to sell to us as family friends.

The home would be intended as a rental property. Grandmother would put a down payment &amp; secure a low interest rate, she’s hoping for 4-5%. My mother and I would put in the work to repair and renovate, then rent out the unit. We would work out on paper an estimated contribution and ownership % and distribute the rental income this way. I would not be expected to contribute monetarily, rather I’d be doing a big portion of the maintenance and repair work (cabinets, walls, doors, trim, etc) and that’s how we’d decide how much % I ‘own’. I’d be 5-10% on the low end if I did almost nothing, 20-30% if I put in good work. 

The purpose of including me would be exclusively for my benefit (and whatever help I can provide). Grandmother expects to die in the next 5 years or sooner and this is her way of helping the kids / family. Mother plans on helping me financially by allowing me on the title.

If things went to shit, we believe we could sell the home with little-to-no loss, or possibly for a profit. Obviously, if I’m on the title I also own part of the risk. Am I being naive to think in such a seller-happy market this deal is too good to pass up? I trust my mother and grandmother, so being screwed in the deal will likely not be a thing. I welcome any feedback though. What are some reasons not to jump in at the opportunity? The only major thing I can think is that I’d like to purchase a primary residence for myself in the next 2-5 years. My family thinks that if I have proof of rental income on an investment loan this won’t hurt my chances for getting a primary residence home loan. PF thoughts on this specifically?

**TL:DR - Home is selling well below market. We get first dibbs as family friends, and owner is personally motivated to sell. House will need cosmetic repairs, and my involvement would be doing those repairs. Grandmother provides down payment, Mother provides finances, I provide manual labor. We split the ownership / rental income. We think the home has a 40-75k built-in equity and will only increase. Austin is also a huge growing market. Sounds great, but I'm looking for thoughts!**

personalfinance,Purchasing a car with poor credit and bankruptcy,"I recently filed bankruptcy and my credit score is the worst in history sitting at around 520. I expect that to go up after some of my credits are discharged and I get a secured credit card. However none of that is going to leap it up to anything more significant before I purchase a car (I'm thinking April). 

As with filing bankruptcy you get a thousand letters in the mail of people who can finance you even with a bankruptcy.  Around four of the letters are from dealerships I've actually heard of so thats encouraging. 

I'm not sure even if this is the right place but I figured it'd be a good start. I don't want my credit ran right now as everything I have read says ""don't let them run until you're sure you're going to buy from them"" or atleast pretty sure. 

So I've been calling around trying to get an idea of what my interest rate is going to be with someone in my credit situation. I've been asking how much money down I'm going to need. How much they can finance me for. While I understand that they can't give me exacts I'm looking for just some sort of general idea. 

So far I've gotten ""bring as much cash as you got"" and ""I've seen anywhere between 15 and 23 but we can legally go all the way to 26"". 

The other issue I run into a few years back before I field but still had shitty credit is that they came back with one or two cars on the lot they would offer me. 

Purchasing a car with bad credit is just about the worst experience ever. I really don't want to fill out a pre app, then go to the dealer, fill out another app, wait around for two or three hours only to be told they can offer me one or two cars on their lot at 23 percent interest. 

Living in St. Louis I luckily have no shortage of dealerships to call around to but maybe I'm not phrasing my questions right or maybe my expectations are too high. I'd ideally like my interest rate to be around the 10 percent mark and I'd rather not put down more than 2 grand. 

As far as my finances I take home between 2800 and 29000 a month. Ideally I'd like to get a car between 10 and 16K, put down 2 grand and have a maximum payment of around 300ish dollars. 

How big of a pipe dream is this? What kind of situation is more realistic? Any help or advice? Calling dealerships all day and getting no information has felt like death and I'm dreading spending hours and hours going from dealership to dealership having them run my credit until I find that ""goldylocks"" dealerships thats just right.",finance

personalfinance,Minimal Retirement Fund - What's my best strategy?,"First of all, I know I'm behind.  I'm currently ~38 years old with almost no retirement saving. I have around 10k in a roth IRA account (with Fidelity) that's not currently invested in anything (just cash value).

So I want to start now (better late than never I guess), so I want to know what's my best strategy?

I've been lurking in this sub for a while and read the FAQ, so I do know some basics, so here is my current situation:

* 1.  I have no major debt* other than my mortgage at an interest rate of 3.75*
* 2.  To be clear, I do have two other debt, but they are both at a 0% interest rate, and while I do have the cash to pay them off, I don't see a reason to, so those money are sitting in my bank account.  Those totals to be around $9k.
* 3.  Not counting that ""9k extra cash"", I do have enough emergency fund equal to about 6 month worth of expense.
* 4.  I have two car that's fully paid off, which I hope to last me an additional 5-10 years without needing to replace them.
* 5.  Unfortunately, my current employer do not offer any kind of 401k or retirement plans, so I'm on my own on that.
* 6.  I don't have a lot of extra money to invest, so what I want to know is which option makes the best use of the money that I have.

So first of all, I know I need to actually ""invest"" in something on my IRA account.  So this is an incredibly newbie question...how do I actually ""invest"" it?  I log into account and looking for the option I have and I'm not sure where to go.  I see a ""trade"" button and once I click that, it asks me to choose ""stock"" or ""mutual fund"".  Based on this sub, I guessing I should pick mutual fund?  It also asks for a symbol, which I guess tells them which fund I want?  I read about picking one that's ""low"" expense, but I don't know how to check that?  Again, extremely noob at this, so if someone can step in and explain to me, that'll be greatly appreciate.

Second question that I have is that based on the investing FAQ, since I still have some decent time left (~30yr if I retire at 67), it recommends that I should invest majority of them in stocks.  For example, using one of the rules they have (110 - age), my portfolio should about around 73% stocks and the rest in bonds of some sort.  Since I'm ""behind"", should I be more aggressive and have higher stock like 90%/10%?

Also, another question I have is how much of the extra money I have should I use to prepaid my mortgage?  So let say if I have $5,500 for 2017, should I just throw all $5,500 into my roth IRA and invest that, or should I use some of that money to pay down my mortgage?  I guess paying down my mortgage has a guarantee return of 3.75%? vs stock where I could get more (on average), but could be less as well?  Is there a way to decide which option is better?

I'm sorry if my question seems scattered, but part of the reason why I didn't start earlier is b/c it's kinda confusing.  But one of my resolution for 2017 is to finally do it, so here I am...

Any help will be appreciate and if you need more information from me, please feel free to ask.

(The whole situation is horrible on my part, I know). 

When I called the collection agency they said they want me to repay the loan in full or else it's going to effect my credit score. Also, if I can't get the full amount they recommended I take out a loan to repay this one. 

The loan was originally for 15,000, but with interest rate when it was passed on to the collections agency is 18,200. They are offering me to pay off 16,900 until Jan 10th. 

My questions are:
Do I have any options to repay the loan monthly to them without it effecting my credit score, they say I don't, I have to repay it to them in full?

personalfinance,"Saying: ""I don't want to save, I want to live life and have fun while I'm young"" is just an excuse that makes you feel better about your bad spending habits.","I see this over and over in my family and friends and ironically in r/personalfinance. "" I want to live my life, not save every penny"", that sort of thing. 

**It is possible to save while still doings fun things, eating nice meals and traveling.** When someone makes it a this-or-that situation I think they are making excuses for poor spending habits or budgeting. Sometimes deferring gratification leads to the ability to have MORE fun and freedom once you've established yourself financially. I'm NOT talking about waiting till retirement BTW, im talking about getting a budget setup, getting some investments going, getting some interest coming in, paying off debt that costs you interest etc. Interest is money you could be using for fun, that you instead are paying to some huge corporation. What I'm describing isn't some kind of punishment, it's a way to be more intentional and to always make sure the things you are spending on are helping you attain your goals and add lasting fulfillment to your life. It's the ability to buy things at their actual cost because you can get a decent interest rate. 

I don't make insane amounts of money, but I'm careful and try not to buy things I don't need. I always ask how many times a year I will use something before buying it. I think about how small amounts add up to be a big amount over time. My family mocks me saying things like "" he still has his first $1."" Basically saying I'm cheap. They all buy whatever they want when they want it. They are in debt, stuck in life and unfulfilled by the very items keeping them there. Once you get on the roller coaster of spending on credit cards for instant gratification, it can be VERY hard to get off.

I'm not saying this in a judgemental way, I've just seen so many people I care about struggle financially because of this mindset. I've seen it limit their ability to see the world and follow their dreams. Seeing it being perpetuated in a place designed to help people get their shit together is kind of brutal to watch. 

If you are a young person coming here for advice, this is the best advice I can give: Briefly defer your gratification. Half the time the thing you ""must have"" seems pointless if you just sit on it for a week. Avoid impulses and focus on experiences and items that will last and wear well over time. Once you have established a solid financial foundation, your ability to go places and do things will quickly outpace the friends and family around you that are focused on attaining every minor impulse and paying off the associated debts.

personalfinance,Questions about new construction home loans,"Im still in the design phase of a home I hope to break ground on this spring. With interest rates going up so quickly Im getting stressed about getting going on my loan. Im not sure exactly at what stage I can start looking for my loan, but I would assume it would be when I have my permit set of drawings. I believe there are new construction loans that will convert over into a mortgage, and that with this loan I could lock in my rate.

That being said, so far Ive spoken to 2 brokers and my bank (BofA), none were of much help and do not handle new construction. Do I keep looking around for brokers? Should I just approach large institutions and ask if they handle the type of loan I need. Do I need a permit set to move forward or is there any way to lock in a rate? I live in Chicago, so it is a large market.

As for a little info about the build, were going for about a total cost of 550k, including the land which was already purchased outright in whole for around 150k, which already gives me over 20% down. I Will likely also pay for around another 50-100k of the build out of pocket which leaves me with a loan of 300k-350k.

I have a stable job, have made greater than 100k the last 10+ years and more than 150k the past 3 in my day job, plus more in investment (real estate). Credit score was greater than 800 last time I checked (I forget exact number and it was around a year ago). No debt of any kind, and I currently own my condo outright as well, as well as other real estate holdings.

Ive gotten recommendations in the past to speak to my general contractor for loan recommendation. Someone in my family will be running the project whom I trust, this is to help save a good amount of money, but he doesn't generally act as a general contractor, he usually is a subcontractor. I myself am also in the construction industry, but my experience is in mainly in heavy commercial/industrial, so I am familiar with construction processes, just not on the residential end so much, at least on a singular unit.

personalfinance,"(US) Need aid for schooling, federal financial aid not available, no cosigner for private student loans, no income. Need suggestions.","Currently a stay-at-home dad (been looking for work in the IT field since moving to my current state 6 months ago) supporting a wife who's going through medical school. Our situation is this:

        Due to our familial situation neither side of our families are able or willing to co-sign on a private student loan.

        We have no income currently (I'm out of work and she's a student) so private loans without a co-signer are out of the question.

        A personal loan is a bad idea because since neither of us have income we wouldn't be able to pay payments on the loan when they come due (30 days after distribution).

        Due to my current program, federal financial aid is unavailable, and the other program i'm interested in i can't get accepted to due to my current GPA.

    So we're left with a few options:

        pull out our 401k's and use that to pay a few months worth of tuition until something else comes a long.

        contact Med school's financial Aid and see if we can increase my wife's current loan amount to pay for my schooling.

        Take a personal loan out and just eat payments with our credit cards until either i can find work, or can get into the program with appropriate financial aid options.

        Not go to school until wife finishes her degree (7ish years from now).

    None of these seem like very good options to me and need advice on what would be the best appropriate course of action.

personalfinance,Exempt from Withholding by mistake,"I think I have made a huge mistake. So here's my story: I started a software engineering co-op at a company in December of 2015. I was sill a student living with my parents so my father claimed me as a dependent. In June of 2016, I was offered a full-time position and I accepted it. Today I received an e-mail from our company's payroll department stating that I was claiming exempt from federal taxes and that if I wanted t continue claiming exempt, I would have to submit the W-4 form again.
Due to my sever lack of knowledge in taxes, I didn't know what the e-mail really meant. I took a screenshot of it and sent it to a co-worker. After much talk and comparing our pay stubs, I realized I wasn't paying my federal taxes (about $1000) from every paycheck since I became full-time, because of the exempt status, which has been a massive mistake on my part. I think should have submitted a W-4 when I became full-time stating I'm no longer a dependent. What should I do in this case? I'm really freaking out because I'm about to apply for a security clearance soon. Appreciate any responses
Edit: Forgot to mention that as soon as I realized, I emailed the payroll's department to change my status as Single with 0 allowances.

personalfinance,Education Tax Credit Question,"I am trying to maximize my refund for next year. Running a bit low on free cash at the moment. Now the terms on some of the credits like the American opportunity act make me feel like if I owe money at the end of the year I would be better off? Should I change my w4? I'm claiming 0 and single right now. I always normally get about a $2000 refund before school started.


Numbers from 2016 this is only numbers from middle of January:
Single no one files me as dependent. 


Gross pay:43000 


Federal withholding $5400 


Social Security $2600 


Medicare $600 


401k $2200



Expected to spend on school about $10000 with a $5000 employer reimbursement.
Can anyone help with how the federal education credits could be optimized? Should I claim 1 or 2 on my w4 instead to optimize this?

My main concern is this statement 

""The amount of the credit is 100 percent of the first $2,000 of qualified education expenses you paid for each eligible student and 25 percent of the next $2,000 of qualified education expenses you paid for that student. But, if the credit pays your tax down to zero, you can have 40 percent of the remaining amount of the credit (up to $1,000) refunded to you.""

Does this mean I would be better off needing to write a check for $1500 at the end of the year before this credit? Then this credit would make me have a $1000 refund? 

Whereas currently if I already have a return of say $1600 it will only give me an extra $1000.",finance
personalfinance,"how to appropriate my house sale proceeds and recently higher income to my debts? also have no retirement! hot mess, please help.","Hi r/personalfinance. I am really overwhelmed by my situation and I am just having a hard time processing exactly what my next steps are. I want to make sure that I make the smartest decisions because I have not been the best with money in the past. I browsed the FAQ and posts but it seems like describing my situation in its entirety may get me the help I’m looking for. (Everything rounded to the nearest hundred for simplicity).

 

I purchased a house in 2014 – put a lot of work (and debt) into it – and just recently sold it for a very decent profit. The check that I deposited at closing was for $40,000.

 

I am a nurse so I have job security and make a decent living. I just moved for a temporary position where I am making almost double what I made at my old job. My temporary position will end on April 1, where I will have the option to be hired as an employee and still be making 60% more than I was at my old job. My costs of living are not that drastically different. I’m considering myself very fortunate that I was able to sell my house for a profit, have the opportunity to work for double the amount of money until April 1, and will have a higher rate of pay even after that. I don’t want to mess up my chance of fixing my finances since I have not been great with money in the past.

 

I took out an unsecured home improvement loan (5 years, 5% interest) when I bought my house and opened a Lowe’s credit card with 84 months of 5% financing. I also opened two synchrony accounts – one with Ashley Furniture for my sectional and one for new carpet. These are all the house-related debts that I currently have.

Home Improvement Loan: $16,600

Lowes Credit Card: $4,700

Ashley Furniture: $1,800 (no interest until 4/11/17)

Carpet: $1,100 (no interest until 9/29/17)

 

I also have quite a few credit cards with some hefty balances on them. I am in graduate school and had to charge summer tuition on a credit card because I honestly didn’t think about it when taking out my loans. I have requested a higher loan amount for this semester that will be disbursed to me next week ($7,000), and I will use that to pay off my Discover balance, since the majority of that was last summer semester.

My credit card balances are as follows:

Chase Slate: $3,000

Capital One: $4,200

Discover: $5,600 (can be paid off with student loan disbursement)

CitiBank: $5,400 (no interest until 11/9/17)

 

I also have nothing set aside for retirement. I have not been putting any of my paycheck since I’ve been working into any type of account. Stupid – I know. But this is why I’m coming to you all for help – do I pay off my debt using my newly higher income and set aside a large chunk of money into a retirement account to make up for the years that I haven’t put anything away? If so, what type of account and how do I go about doing that? What should be my priority at this point?

 

In addition, my current position does not offer benefits so I will also be paying for my own health insurance. I plan to get a catastrophic plan that will cost me $225/mo. (I am a 27 year old female, generally healthy, only ever go to the doctor for my yearly exam, and pretty religious about seeing my dentist every six months). Once my temporary assignment is over, if I remain at the hospital and opt out of benefits, I will make $7.50/hr more than if I were an employee with an FTE. If I work 36 hours/wk, that is an extra $1080/mo – which less the $225/mo health insurance cost – would mean I would be making $855 more per month. So I plan to continue to pay for my own insurance. (Not having an FTE status also has many other benefits, such as schedule flexibility and different schedule requirements).

 

Just to add one more piece to the puzzle, I currently pay $300/mo on my car loan – I have a 2011 Toyota Highlander and owe $11,400 – 2.3% interest. I’m not so worried about paying this off since the interest rate is so low.

 

I currently have approximately $62,000 in student loans – combination of undergraduate and graduate school loans – and that is up to date with the most recent loan I took out that will be disbursed to me next week. They are all Stafford loans (mixture of subsidized and unsubsidized) and are all in deferment due to me being in school right now. I will qualify for a Public Loan Forgiveness Program (which I was enrolled in for my undergraduate loans before they were deferred), where all of my loans will be forgiven if I work for a non profit organization and make 120 payments towards my loans (10 years). (My undergraduate loans already have 24 payments towards their 120 payments for forgiveness) So basically, your loans are consolidated, you pay the least amount per month possible, and then the balance is forgiven after 10 years. I am also in school for Family Nurse Practitioner and there are some government programs where if you work at a low income facility for 1-2 years, a very large portion of your loans can be forgiven (around $25k I believe). In short, I really am not worried about my student loans because one way or another, they will eventually be forgiven.

 

 

So, in conclusion, here are the basic numbers of my situation – and I need you all to tell me where to start / what to do / and how to organize my finances from here.

 

(+) Closing Check From House Sale: $40,000

(+) Student Loan Disbursement (after tuition is paid): $7,000

(-) Home Improvement Loan: $16,600

(-) Lowes Credit Card: $4,700

personalfinance,I'm being hired off of a contract. Should I ask for more money?,"I'm in my late 20s. No kids, paid off student loan debt, owe a little bit on my car (1.8% interest rate), rent an apartment and saving for a house. I have been working as a contractor in a management position (through a contracting agency). It's a weird position to be on contract for, they tried to buy it out right away but couldn't. My contract ends at the end of this month, but I've already gone through most of the hiring process. The ""boss"" (not my actual boss, but the guy that decides how much I'll get paid, etc.) and I had a brief chat about money but were interrupted. What they're going to offer me:

* Salary at $69k (I make $32/hour now)
* Health insurance, including free vision and cheap (but good) dental, at 1/3 the premium I currently pay
* 401K 100% match for first 3%
* 2 weeks vacation (non-negotiable)

Using the ol' 2080 multiplier, the $69k salary is a ~3% raise. BUT I've been salaried before. And I know this position. I'm going to be going from bring absolutely capped at 40 hours/week to working 50-60 hour weeks consistently. The ""boss"" expressed great satisfaction with my work performance. He went on to emphasize that I'm new to this kind of work but I fit in great and yadda yadda yadda. Median salary on Glassdoor for this job title in my area is $80k. I AM new to the type of position, I was doing this kind of work part-time before and I decided to jump to doing it full-time. Through the contracting agency, I know they're paying $40-45/hour for me. I also know that hiring me includes paying my benefits, though I'm less familiar with exactly how much that costs them. 

My hang up is that I will not get a performance review this year, so I'm not eligible for a raise for at least another year. This type of position doesn't really have room for growth, either. I know it's often said that contractors make more money, but to me that seems like it's mostly the deal for independent contractors. 

So. Should I negotiate for more, or just be happy to be getting a raise at all?",finance

Since September I have been working as a float pharmacist, for the company I've worked for for 5 years, at a rate of $58/hour. During this time period I have been able to secure 35-40 hours per week (I wasn't allowed to go over 40 hours because of overtime pay as an hourly employee).  
With the new year I have been given a guaranteed hours 20 hours per week at a salaried rate of $62,000 per year. The salaried benefit also allows me to work more than 40 hours a week. Because of this I think my yearly earning potential will be around $150,000 (50 hours/week). I think 50 hours is very plausible, since I was hired I have been turning down multiple shifts weekly due to my hour restrictions. I also don't feel I will burn out because my final year of school I was working 60-80 hours a week, with at least 40 of those hours unpaid.  
My wife also works full-time and is able to cover the majority of our monthly expenses, so I hope to put the majority of my income into student loans. We have no kids and own a townhome that we owe $171,000 on. No other debts aside from home loan and student loans.

My goal minimum yearly loan repayment is $40,000.

1. Is there an advantage to choosing a 10 year fixed repayment plan vs the extended fixed repayment plan? It doesn't look like it affects the interest rate at all, and I know that I am dedicated enough to pay the additional money.  
2. Should I be investing more than I currently I am?  
Currently I am only doing my employer 401k (I give 5% and they match 4%). I'm hoping to max that out this year, but I am wondering if I should also start contributing $300-500 monthly to a roth in order to have a little more money saved for the future.  

3.  When should I consider consolidating my loans.  Right now my thoughts are to wait until I have at least 40 hours guaranteed.

personalfinance,"Making about 50k more than last year, 19","So I'm 19 and a full time student. I recently start making substantially more money than last year. My main source of income is from YouTube. My channel has grown considerably and I went from making about 10k a year from it to now closer to 60 - 70k. I'm looking to protect my future as much as possible and really what to do going forward. 

Obviously YouTube is pretty volatile and I would like to have something to show for it in a few years if my social media presence some how disappeared. My channel is pretty ""utility driven"" in a sense, I provide a service that people will search for even 5 years from now. I feel pretty confident in being able to move to other social media platforms if something were to happen to YouTube.  

MY current situation is:

- 8k in the bank (due to volatile income) 

- 26k in private loans, about 10% interest 

- 500/month in fixed expenses (lease, phone bill, insurance)

- Total monthly expenses (including fixed) is about $800

- 7k in federal loans at 2%

Over the past 4 months or so I put 7k toward my private loans. Right now I am pretty much taking out 1k a month for expenses and taxes and everything else goes toward loans. Hoping to have all my private paid off by summer. I know this sub will recommend ditching the car, but I love cars, work pretty hard and am not really interested in doing that atm. 

So my main question is what should I do after my loans? Right now my goals in order are: 1. Pay off private, 2. Save for next 2 semesters, 3. Pay off federal, 4. Roth IRA and money in the bank for future schooling/taxes. Is there anything I'm forgetting here? I have 1.5 years of undergrad left (including Spring semester) at 20k a year, then 1 year of grad (5 year program) also at 20k a year. Then probably going to look at PhD programs.

As most of you know this wrecked my credit score but I have since turned everything around.  I consolidated my federal loans and have been paying on IBR payment plan for the past 14 months. My private loans have been in good standing for the past 2 years and I have paid down quite a bit extra on them as well. 


The problem I'm facing now is that I've been following the snowball method of prepayment on my private loans because my highest interest loan of 9.88% also has the largest balance of 26k. And the rate has continued to rise every quarter or so. 


Is there any way for me to refinance this private loan to a lower rate? As I said my credit isn't stellar due to going into default and I've been declined two separate times for refinancing, once with SoFi and once with citizens bank. My credit score is right at 696 (FICO) but keeps going up with steady on time payments.

Decided a few years ago to put about 6 grand in the stock market before I really got into fine tuning my finances. Stocks are NFLX, TSLA, and UA if that matters. Up on NFLX, slightly down on TSLA, and down most on UA.

What I am considering doing with the money since it is too late to take advantage of a pre tax account like 401k is to sell the stock(s) and putting it towards my highest interest student loans. 10.5k balance at 6.4% variable rate. This would allow me to pay off in full by midyear at the latest. Would open up $242 in cash flow as well. 

Other loans/accounts...have approx 10k in 401k, 1k in HSA (ETFs invested), 10.5k in emergency/down payment savings, 11k in car loan at 4.5%, and 20k in lower interest federal loans. I am 26 and make a comfortable salary for my area, I just want to be as efficient as possible and am looking forward to other points of view. Thanks for your help.",finance
personalfinance,Why a savings account is nearly vestigial,"Over my years I always had a savings account. My return was always pennies. What I have learned is if you have your checking account as a savings account you won't be penalized for transferring funds and will be able to effectively use your emergency fund. In the meantime, use your credit card as your daily purchaser and your spending will be relatively limited, but as your credit increases instead of a couple pennies every month, you'll save more with better interest rates. Reddit, what is your thoughts?

Edit: I'm leaning some, however, whether saving (not spending) or putting it in a separate account is a point I'd rather move on. This is to get to a point where it's fiscally redundant to follow this path. Once a good financial base is set (no/low debt and a good credit score is set) then it's rather useless to follow this advice and invest elsewhere. Hence NEARLY vestigial. A savings account is still useful once certain requirements are met. It is possible to supercede cash back rewards at a certain point. The original post was a rather inarticulate thought.",finance
personalfinance,"19 y/o new home owner, not sure what to do next","Hi all,

I'm 19 (Going on 20), and purchased a home about a month ago. The mortgage is about $700 a month (Including taxes/insurance), and I'm purchasing it on contract from the owner for 2 years, at which point I'll refinance with a lender vs. paying him directly (My credit history is only a year old, at which point no lenders wanted to finance me with a thin credit history). Doing a co-signer is not an option, as my parents and I mutually agreed that this house is my house, and I have to do things on my own.


To be frank, I'm lost right now - I'm getting advice from several different people that wildly differs, and I'm not sure where to go from this point. I don't want to wait 2 years, just to discover that I can't get financing for my home, and then have my interest rate balloon significantly (And risk losing the house), and I want to make sure that I'm taking the right steps to build my credit history for when I finance the home.


I'm currently working 4 jobs (System administrator, sales consultant, game developer, and business owner), and I'm potentially looking at making 80K+ a year (Last year's gross income was around 35K).


Right now, my monthly expenses are broken down as follows:

- $700, mortgage.

- $120, car insurance.

- $100, property taxes.

- $150, phone service (80 of that is for 3 devices I'm leasing, about $1K left).

- $100, Internet.

- $300, gas/electric.

- $50, water.

- $800, food.

- $200, credit cards (x3).

Total expenses: $2,520


When I refinance before 2 years is up (The contract states that after 2 years, if I can't find a lender, the interest rate balloons from 4.5% to 8% on the house), I don't want to do PMI. The house was purchased for $115K, with $5k as a down payment. I was unable to finance through FHA, because the property is dual purpose - aka: 1/3 is zoned commercial, 2/3 is residential). The total amount I need to finance with a lender (After 2 years, if I wait that long) is around $96K, which would require a down payment just shy of $20K.


Savings: I have no savings currently, aside from a mutual fund that my parents setup when I was young (Currently has a value of around $1K).


Current debt: I have 3 credit cards in my name, and I'm an authorized user on one account (Parent's). Combined, they have a total CL $2,350. One of those is closed, $1.4K/$1.5K utilized, and the other accounts have a zero balance (PIF every month, never using more than 20%). I also owe T-Mobile about 1K for 3 devices I leased from them, that I'm going to purchase for personal use.


Credit: My FICO score is currently around 630, and my Vantage is around 720. No derogatory remarks, no late payments, history is around one-and-a-half years old. Two cards have zero balance on them, paid in full every month before payment is due. One other account was closed because I went over my limit by a significant amount ($3000/$1500), and has been closed since August of 2015. The current balance on that card is $1.4K/$1.5K. I am also an authorized user on my parent's credit card, which helped my score (I don't use the card, I'm just attached to it). Only debt I currently have are credit cards - no installment loans, car loans, or mortgages reporting to the credit reporting agencies (I'm currently paying the house on contract, which doesn't report to the agencies). I had a full-ride scholarship for college, so no student loans were reported to the agencies.


What I'm struggling with: 

Right now, the main thing I struggle with on a monthly basis is my impulsive spending. I work for Best Buy as a sales consultant, and the discount is incredibly tantalizing at times (Example: Buying a $8K TV for $4K through the manufacturer, even though I already have a TV). It's not just work either, it always feels like there's a hole burning in my pocket whenever I get money (The feeling that if I don't spend it, it's going to disappear somehow) - be it fast food, ordering pizza, going to the movies, or buying merchandise from work - there's never a moment where my wallet has more than $100 in it.


Another thing I'm struggling with is my credit card usage - I tend to max out the cards every month on stuff I don't need (Eg. Purchasing an Xbox One during the holidays), and paying it off before the statement comes through. When I don't budget my income well, I resort to my Chase debit card (Which has overdraft protection), which allows me to use it for transactions, even if I don't have money in my account (Each transaction &gt; $5 = $34 overdraft fee), which adds up quickly (It's like a super crappy credit card to me, for times I don't have money).


The final thing I'm having trouble with is prioritizing my goals - I have a list of about 15 things I want for my new home (Eg. New counter-tops, new bed, redoing the kitchen floor/walls, new appliances etc.), but menial things take priority over the important, significant things. Therefore, I'm having difficulty saving for stuff I legitimately need, because I'm in control of my money, and I can't stop myself.


Goals:

- Thicken/improve credit history so I'm able to gain conventional financing through a lender (Recommendations for lenders would be greatly appreciated!)

- Save $20K in &lt;= two years for down payment.

- Finance my home before November of 2018, would like to do a 10/15 year fixed rate conventional.

- Pay down any current debts I have, and keep below 20% utilization at any given moment.

- Save for the future (Would like to start saving for retirement now, so I don't have to worry in my later years).


Misc. notes: I need a new (Well, used - new to me) vehicle for work, as my current vehicle is showing its age. Should I pay cash outright for a vehicle, or try to secure financing through a lender (Credit union/in-house financing) so I can add variety to my credit portfolio? If I go through a lender, what should I do before trying to apply?


tl;dr: Young adult who bought a house, income increased significantly - thin credit history, need to refinance home through a lender in &lt; 2 years with 20% down payment (Out of $100K).",finance

personalfinance,"Discharge undergraduate debt as permanently disabled, go to graduate school as RA, profit? Pitfalls?","This will be cross-posted to /r/LegalAdvice if it's more relevant there/this weekend

I have about $65,000 in student debt. I will graduate with a bachelor's in an engineering field. I am extremely good at what I do and expect my starting pay to be about $85,000/year if I leave with my bachelor's degree.

However, my current plan is graduate school. I intend to go 'until I'm done', which likely means a doctoral degree and a starting pay with six figures to the left of the decimal point.

I deal with a chronic medical condition that has me on disability. I receive some funding assistance, but because of circumstances I was forced to go to a private school where tuition wasn't completely covered - nor were my medical expenses. So out of a $500/month check I'm spending $350/month on medical care through two insurance plans and have been for the past seven years. I had to move out recently, shifting much of my medical care into coming out of my student loans.

I've received an offer to discharge my debt completely. The criteria that I can see are that I have to stay under the federal poverty level for 3 years or my debt resumes, I lose access to federal financial aid (or my debt resumes), and at the end of 3 years I have to report the full extent of my debt as one massive chunk of income.


I intend to go to graduate school as an RA or TA, which would involve a stipend around $1000/month up to $1500/month after benefits. Let's assume $18,000/year, which should be right on the threshold of the federal poverty level.

If I discharge my debt, I can count it as income of ~$20,000/year for 3 years.

With the tuition waiver alongside being a TA, I receive training services valued at about $20,000/year in untaxed cash.

I will likely receive untaxed housing assistance worth about $1000/month valued at $9,000/year (summer excluded).

I will use a PASS account and ERWE to protect my TA/RA stipend for use as a medical and equipment fund  and continue to receive $6000/year to pay for food and incidentals.


I may receive additional tuition assistance that will not cover the full $20,000/year, but this is unlikely.

I will receive assistance with equipment worth about $2000/year.


Just to show that I'm not completely out of my mind thinking wishfully, currently I receive 9K/year in housing assistance, $10K/year in tuition assistance, $2K/year in equipment assistance, and the $6K/year in discretionary spending. (But I pay about 40K/year in tuition - though I knock off another $20K/year with other scholarships). I'm certain I will have at least these benefits.


So, this means I'm effectively grossing $75,000/year to go to graduate school - if I can discharge my debt. If I can't it makes it a 'paltry' $55,000/year.


From my perspective, it makes financial sense to go to graduate school rather than going to work with my bachelor's degree because I will recoup the money I could have been making if I was employed instead of a student rather instantly if I can discharge my debt.

If I can't discharge my debt, it'll take a bit longer to recoup but it still appears to be worth it.


My question for you all is thus: Has anyone ever tried to discharge debt this way? Is this something that could really work this smoothly? Am I really looking at essentially grossing ~$75,000/year to bump my starting income up by $20k-$30k or is there a bridge out that I'm not seeing?",finance
personalfinance,Babysitter who is miffed about change (finance related). Need advice ASAP.,"So I'll try to make this short. 

 Have had the same babysitter for a while now.  Responsible and doesn't flake… But comes at a high price.  Babysitter watches the children at her home, along with her children… She wants to get paid even if she doesn't watch the kids.  For example, for Christmas vacation, she didn't watch them at all but we still had to pay her a week of pay.  If I take off of work and spend the day with the kids, I still pay her.  She says this is been her common experience as a babysitter… That she's reserving her time.  She's also off the books… We don't like having to pay for when she's not needed, but we figure because she's responsible and stuff that we will suck it up.

 At the very last minute… We had a major scheduling change… We wouldn't even really need her anymore… But we decided we will keep her on for two days a week just in case the schedule doesn't stick long-term…I tell her about it and that we will only need her to work two days a week instead of four…and her first question is will she still get paid as normal. We explain no, we anticipated just paying her for the two days.  I tell her that this would start next week.  I didn't mention anything yet about padding her next two checks, which I likely would have except she jumped in and was very upset.  

 She says that she is upset because we told her last minute and she wants to have the next two weeks fully paid and then we could start up the schedule change… She justified this by saying  it's because we didn't give her enough notice

 We don't have a contract or anything with her. I can understand that she is upset, but she kind of flew off the handle about things… it really left a bad taste in my mouth… She also said that she has turned out a lot of babysitting jobs because of us. (?)

 I do not want to go forward with her now because of all of this… It really turned me off… She is supposed to watch them the rest of the week and I'm not even comfortable with that…i'm going to call out sick tomorrow and figure out what to do in the following days…

 It really could've turned out well if she didn't fly off the handle… I like to think I'm a reasonable person. 

 How would you sever ties… What would you say? I would like it to be kind and non-confrontational.  And also what would you do about pay… Should I just pay her for yesterday… Or should I pay her for this entire week even though she won't be working  and I will be calling out sick?

Bitcoin is not the currency of the future

We need to stop listening to self-proclaimed experts and hack economists who say

Bitcoin will change the world

The Bitcoin experiment has finally been resolved. Everybody was wrong:

Bitcoin is dead.

Mike Hearn said ‘farewell to Bitcoin’ and took a job with Goldman Sachs because he thought

‘Bitcoin is just an experiment.’

Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire says nobody will be using Bitcoin in 5 years because

It’s still early days. Something better will come along and replace it.

People were wrong when they said

Bitcoin will bring reliable self-banking to the unbanked in third world countries.

Smart people understand that

Bitcoin challenges central banking and undermines the ability of governments to keep financial tabs on their citizens.

In order to fight terrorism, the government tracks everything you do online.

Personally, I’m tired of living in a world where

Hackers, drug dealers and terrorists can use Bitcoin to get away with their crimes.

It’s actually just a myth that

Bitcoin is good for the world.

That’s dead wrong.

You aren’t smart enough to use Bitcoin; it will never be adopted by the masses.

Economists like Paul Krugman keep saying

Bitcoin is evil.

I don’t believe that

Bitcoin can make the world a better place by empowering people.

All you can do with Bitcoin is buy drugs. And maybe a hitman.

It just isn’t true that

Bitcoin can be used for good as well as bad.

It is true that Bitcoin is riddled with scams and crooks. Mt. Gox blew up, Ross Ulbricht went down. Hardly a day goes by without somebody getting hacked or handcuffed. We all know

Bitcoin was born in sin.

Charlie Stross wants Bitcoin to die in a fire. He says

Bitcoin is evil.

I’m tired of hearing that

Bitcoin is actually close to mass adoption.

The price of Bitcoin today is nearing an all-time high, but the Economist Magazine says it’s just a bubble – Like tulip mania. The smart money says

The experiment is over – Bitcoin has failed.

But wait – isn’t this all backwards?! Read the article in reverse: Only fools believe that

I'm in a sticky spot where I have to decide to take loans from family to finish my undergraduate degree. I am one semester off from graduating from a strong liberal arts college but due to unfortunate circumstance, the Federal loans and aid provided from my school have not been enough to cover my costs. My extended family has offered to loan me the 11,000 I need to cover this last semester at a fixed 5% interest, paid over 10 years. I also have the option to delay my final semester a year, receive more aid from the school, and work to save up for any costs that may not be covered by aid. 

Neither option feels good in my gut. Delaying has fairly clear downsides, but taking the loan, especially from family, feels bad too. I'm having difficulty evaluating the impact that size of loan will have on me in future. I know many people have to borrow much more, and the terms of the loan are favorable. I will also have federal debt after graduating on top of this loan. 

I would hate to take this money now for my immediate happiness and desire to finish in 4 years, when delaying might be much more rewarding in the long run. Am I being too cautious??",finance

Since I am a domestic student, my stipend income is paid tax free upfront, and almost all of it goes to living expenses.

First, your and my initial reaction: ""No Retirement Savings at 30? Holy shit, get it together""

Yes I feel that way too.  Let me explain, though.  We went to professional schools and first started working at 27/28.  We have been putting my wife's entire salary towards high-interest loans (6.5%), which seemed to make more sense.  We have cut loans in half from $160k to $84k in 2 years.  My income pays the bills and leftover goes toward home down payment fund.  Neither of us have matching 401ks offered by companies, so our other option was IRAs, which, from my understanding, it makes more sense to pay off 6.5% interest loans. Please correct me if I'm wrong (more on loans below)

I wouldn't say we have an extravagant/wasteful life.  We don't really like the ""finer"" things in life - we own 2 used cars, don't really go shopping, don't have expensive tastes, but I also recognize that we have not been the most efficient at addressing our budget.  There is certainly waste there.  I'm here for help and guidance so we can stop procrastinating and get our shit together

Past Income: My wife's income has been steady at 55k.  Mine has gone from 65k to 105k in the past 2 years.  Frankly, we were both underpaid for our careers and still are, just less so.  We are looking at employment options still to see how other opportunities are out there

2016 Husband Income: $105,000.  (Projected 2017 income is ~110-130k; non-salary, based on production)

2016 Wife Income: $55,000.  We are putting 95% of wife's income towards loans.  She is likely to get a promotion to $70k for this year, but for the sake of conservatism, let's assume that doesn't happen

Savings: 50k in savings account for down payment.  Should this be somewhere else with more interest?

Own: Fully paid off 2 used cars in cash

Retirement: 0k.  We looked at the flowchart here, and neither of us have matching 401k by employers.  Our loans have been federal and private at 6.5%, so it made more sense to contribute to those rather than putting towards IRA (correct us if we are wrong).  I've read it's only worth to favor IRA over paying off loans when loan interest rates are 4% or lower.  At the same time, I often wonder if all that compound interest would end up being more than enough to offset the interest on those student loans

Loans:

Private #1: $14,108 @ 6.54%

Private #2: $7,629 @ 6.24%

Private #3: $16,803 @ 6.25%

Federal #1: $37,068 @ 6.55%

Federal #2: $8,559 @ 5.16%

Federal #3: $339 @ 2.4%

Total ~$84,000 at average $6.28% with yearly interest at $5327

Is it best to consolidate these to lower rates?  How to address the private versus the federal ones?  What would you target first of the loans?  At what point would it make more sense to start putting some $ in IRA.

Budgeting: Unfortunately neither of us have employer healthcare, so we're dropping ~7k/year, which sucks.  This is for the high deductible plan with an HSA (borderline catastrophic).  Hoping if/when my wife gets her promotion, then we'll at least have one person covered.  We pay 1200/month for rent which is reasonable in our big city.  We're looking over our budget this week to see where we can cut unnecessary expenses, but the bulk of it goes to food (cook every meal but 1 a week), rent, healthcare.

I know it's risky if you just put more money on the cards, but I've proved to myself I can aggressively pay off this debt. Spending habits have changed as well as getting a big fat raise. I may use a card for rewards/revolving balance but I will not carry a balance.

personalfinance,How to avoid excess debt from college?,"Hi Guys. Love the financial info you guys post. Great tips. 

Currently, I am a freshman at a large public university,the university of michigan. It is well renown, but in a way expensive. Due to some very gracious local scholarships and school aid, I will most likely finish this year and the next with around 5,000 or less in federal subsidized loans. Which is pretty good. I have always saved up everything and don't really spend money unless needed. I am a tight-wad, but it has allowed me to save up enough to make up the difference in financial aid for the next year. It may take less than four years for me to graduate, given advanced placement and community college credits. I will have around 63 credits at the end of this year. equal to half my degree.

My concern is for the next two years after this. I know that my financial aid will decrease, and my parents will go from making around 50k, to 68k. Mom was laid off, didn't work. Dad still works, now my mom is working part time. I am very thankful for all that they give me, but their financial planning is rather poor. Unfortunately, I can't rely on them to use this subreddit, so I will be footing the bill for my college. That's okay. 

The cost of attendence for me would be around 10-12,000 per year after this increase. Which is also very generous from the school. If I keep my normal summer job (4k-5k serving), apply this to the cost of attendance and take out federal subsidized loans, then my total debt will stay at around 20,000 if everything goes okay.

This would be fine if I stuck with my current major, which is currently civil and environmental engineering. I will most likely change my major next year to something such as biology, earth and environmental science, or computer science. I know that besides computer science, these degree paths are less stable than engineering and also require advanced degrees. I probably should have already switched out of engineering already, but I enjoy some parts of it and financial insecurity in other fields has me worried. 

So, what are some tips for reducing the amount of debt during college. I looked into becoming an RA, but the application period has already closed.

personalfinance,I need advice for buying a used car while paying off student loans.,"I have $42,000 worth of student loans at a 6.04% APR (weighted average of interest rates). I make $60,000 gross with no mortgage, living very frugally. 

I'm in a very, very, good position to get out of debt in roughly 4 years comfortably. There's just one problem: I drive a lot. I enjoy driving and I'd really like to own my own car (I own maybe 20% of my current car. The rest belongs to the parentals). I know that I don't need a ""new"" car and that it might be wiser to limit interest where possible, but damn I want this. Could you shoot holes in this?

Pros to buying a car:

1. Owning my own car

2. Knowing that I can rely on my car. (risk assessment) My current car was a 2008 fleet car, 85k miles, and I have no idea how it was treated. Runs okay for now. 

3. I get to enjoy driving. I drive 25,000+ miles a year and this is my hobby, like some people play golf, or others eat food. Not recklessness, but just enjoying sun and turning and stuff. I get to enjoy this daily, so it's a lifestyle plus too. 

Cons to buying a car:

1. Student loans build $5k *more* interest and take 7.5 years to pay off instead of 4.

2. Not sure that I can finance? Just opened up first line of credit so I'm certain my score just dropped. (Not even sure I'd want to finance. Why not just save up cash?)

3. Parents shame me for being ""fiscally irresponsible"".

4. Not sure if I have to pay for my own insurance or...? 

5. Gas costs marginally more (though still within budget).

6. Premium gas /*hint hint*

7. Insurance goes up, but still within budget. 

Please help me make a good choice. I want this like a fat kid wants to live an extended and fruitful life, but I know that it might be impulsive. I've considered it long and hard for literally ~~weeks~~ week. Could you evaluate my logic, or just shame the hell out of me?",finance
personalfinance,Forbearance About to End,"Hey all!

I have ~$32k in student loans that is about to be at the end of all of my forbearance. I have loans with 2 places:

 * 2 are through OSLA totaling ~8$200 w/a monthly payment minimum of $55. 
 * 5 are with My Great Lakes and is ~$24000 w/ a minimum payment of $295. 
 * They all have an interest rate of 6.800%

There is no way I can afford the $295 payment with where I am at right now.

TL;DR on where I am at right now:

 * Just finished FPU and in the middle of building emergency fund, $523
 * I have 2 credit cards totaling $1200 I'm paying the minimum on
 * Apartment rent I split with my brother of $732 + utilities and whatnot
 * Car loan totaling ~$2600 I'm making minimum payments on
 * Student loans aforementioned

I have been looking into repayment options on the bigger student loan as that would be the last thing I would tackle with the debt snowball. Would it be a better idea to consolidate them all into one, take the My Great Lakes one elsewhere with a lower rate or keep them where they are now?

Thank you all! =D

personalfinance,Wells Fargo changed our checking account and now is trying to charge us a monthly fee. What checking accounts do you recommend?,"The title pretty much says it all.  My husband and I have made saving a huge priority this year so I have been monitoring our accounts daily trying to see where we are doing wasteful spending.  Today I logged in and saw a little link on our checking account that said monthly service fee.  I clicked and the box said monthly service fee to be applied if daily balance falls below ____ and direct deposit amount ____.  We've never had this before so this is something new.

We've been pretty fed up with Wells Fargo in general so I wanted to see if there was a great checking/savings account others recommend that we can switch to?  We have our mortgage through SunTrust Bank and have been looking into other accounts with them, but also looking at credit unions as well.

personalfinance,"Should I negotiate a settlement, ask to pay original amount due ($3,626), or pay full debt ($4,709) to Williams &amp; Fudge (W&amp;F) in order to be able to attend a public university this semester?","Hello,

Background: In the Spring of 2016 I received my last semester's worth of grants (TAG) which I used to pay off the semester in addition to federal loans. By the beginning of summer I received a notification letter stating that I was unqualified for TAG (because I had already received it for the maximum amount of semesters) and therefore owe the $3,626 that was granted. I was given payment options for monthly installments but at that point could not afford to pay this off.


I already had an unpaid government internship lined up that I needed for career advancement so I did that over the summer with casual work as a Babysitter and Dental Assistant - did not make enough to pay even a quarter of the debt. 


I then learned that I could not register for the Fall 2016 semester unless I pay off the $3,626. As a result the debt was sold to W&amp;F and an additional fee was charged of $1,083 - total debt now equal to $4,709.  I still cannot register for the upcoming Spring 2017 semester unless I pay the full amount since I have a hold on my account; transcripts, etc. which means I cannot transfer to another university


Current: From September (after my internship) through December 31st, I have been able to earn enough money (working as a Nanny and other odd jobs) to pay off the entire debt in full. I've read the posts on the sidebar on debt and credit, and I've also searched for comments specifically related to W&amp;F but I haven't found a situation where the student had not graduated. They have a lot of leverage and I'm unsure how to negotiate.


Need Advice: I'm not sure if I should try to negotiate a settlement as I've seen in multiple posts here or should I pay the full amount which includes the penalty fee. I feel like I can't use any hard-line tactics to negotiate as they have control over whether I can finish school.


***Note: I am not trying to get out of paying the debt but if there is any way I can negotiate to pay the original amount and not W&amp;F's fee, it would help significantly because I still have to pay for two classes around $4,000 and I don't think I'll be able to do that without the extra $1,083.

personalfinance,"Refinance student loan in graduated repayment for lower rate, or pay extra on lower payment?","I currently have about 50k in federal student loans that I consolidated a few years back around 6.25% interest.

With the current payment, I think I can add about $1000/ month to that. 

If I were to refinance, I could probably get around 4-4.5%, but my payment would be larger as a traditional, fixed payment loan (somewhere around $550 for 10 years).

personalfinance,Defer or slow IRS withholdings until year end?,"Hi everyone!
 
I have a question that doesn't seem to have been asked before on this subreddit, unless the search is even worse than I thought.   
 
Can I defer my IRS federal income tax withholdings until later in the year, as a strategy to 'borrow' against them?  In other words, I would slow my withholdings now, and later in the year (say, mid-November) I would 'catch-up' to by overwithholding and getting caught back up to get close to a net $0 refund.  I would use this strategy to pay down some debt that my wife unfortunately accumulated in Q3 2016.  Due to the interest accumulating on the debt, the cash is more valuable to me now than it would be in Q4 '17.
 
Does this sound like a resonable and legal strategy?  Google doesn't seem to turn up any discussion on the topic, so its possible I'm missing something.  I know the interest savings seem like they might be immaterial or not worth the hassle, but I work in finance and squeeze every basis point possible from my P&amp;L.  I'm not familiar enough with taxes to know if this is legal or reasonable to do, so any discussion would be helpful.

Throwaway account just to have a sense of anonymity.

Here's my current situation. I have $11,770 worth of credit card debt spread out over three cards. I currently have $4,200 worth of cash on hand.

I have cancelled all of my online subscriptions. 

Here's my question for you; With this cash on hand, should I pay down some of my debt *or* continue to make monthly payments and accumulate cash until I can pay them all off at once?

I make an average of $500/week cash and maybe another $150 on the books after taxes (paid biweekly - $300/2).

Interest rates are as follows:

* CC1 = $3,941.29 @ 17%
* CC2 = $3,224.58 @ 0% going to 18% thereafter in 8 months
* CC3 = $4,604.54 @ 0% going to 18% thereafter in 2 months.

I have balance transfers available where I can drop interest rates back to 0% but I'd like to strategize this appropriately with your help.

Ive read a lot of success stories in here and Im looking to start turning my previous irresponsible financing decisions around. 

First, I have a huge problem. I havnt made any payments on my federal student loans in almost a year and Im facing having my income taxes garnished. 
So, yesterday, on a whim (I feel so stupid for this) I contacted an agency that proposed it will be able to help me get my loans out of default and eliminate the chance of my taxes be garnished. I actually felt that they seemed genuine while I was on the phone with them, but the more Im thinking about it and researching more, I think I may have made a major mistake.

Can someone please review this and let me know if this is legit, or if I got scammed.
I have a couple days left before I can cancel everything I signed with them.

I pay 3 payments of $250. This is to enroll myself in their program. After enrollment, I will have to make 4 monthly payments of $300 to get myself out of default, then, I can start making payments of $200 for a loan rehabilitation. 
After this, I will make $200 loan payments for the next 15 years, then everything afterwards will be forgiven. 
My total loan is about $40,000 and if I make payments to this company, I will pay about $30,000 total (within 15 years).

Here is a link to their website: http://www.federalstudenthelp.com/services/

personalfinance,How to calculate Annualized Compound Interest,"I'm making slow progress on my road to increased financial literacy - reading everything I can consume (both print and online), and finally planning rather than avoiding. Thank you to r/personalfinance for your fantastic explanations. 

I am trying to understand how some of the figures quoted by Morningstar are derived, and am having trouble reproducing them.

I'll use GOOGL as an example, since it does not pay dividends, which makes the calculation a little easier. Morningstar quotes a 10 year annualized Total Return % of 11.0 as of 1/10/2017 (http://performance.morningstar.com/stock/performance-return.action?t=GOOGL&amp;region=USA&amp;culture=en_US).

My understanding that this is the gain in share price expressed as a compounding average annualized return (http://www.morningstar.com/InvGlossary/total-return.aspx), but I get a very different answer.

On close of 1/10/2017 GOOGL was $826.01
On close of 1/10/2007 GOOGL was $244.97
This is a gain of $581.04 over 10 years.

Using the formula for compounding interest, assuming a principle value of $244.97, and a final value of $826.01 compounding once annually and solving for the interest rate, I get:

FV = P(1 + r)^t

r = (10^(logFV/P))/t - 1

r = 10^(log826.01/244.97)/10 - 1

r = 0.12924256621 (12.9%)

which is a lot higher than the 11.0% value quoted by Morningstar, so my mental model is clearly wrong - but how?

personalfinance,Best way to use my end of year bonus?,"Hey ya'll! My husband and I are in our late twenties and recently got married. We are trying to make smarter financial decisions. That being said, I will be receiving an end of year bonus of about $6,000 and would like to know how to make it work the most for us. Here is our financial situation in a nutshell:

Emergency fund of $20,000 

Approx $84,000 in investments 

We own our home which will be paid off in 15 years. Money is already set aside but the previous homeowners wanted a monthly income. Our interest rate is a little over 3%

We are off the grid so we have no utilities to pay

I owe 7,000 on my car -interest rate is .01%. 

As well as $3,500 left to pay on my student loans - interest rate of 3.15%

I don't feel like we have a ton of debt but also know we are looking to fund a few big things (second home, a doctorate program, and possibly kids) in the next few years. I would love any direction on whether we should pay down our debt, save for the future, or use it to invest.

personalfinance,FedLoan Servicing and Autopay,"I just realized a ridiculous policy of FedLoan Servicing.


My loans are not currently due, still in grad school, but have been paying about $500 on them monthly via my bank's bill pay. As I've disbursed 2 loans through FedLoan I have two accounts. The plan was to quell of interest while I'm paying off my private student loans which offer less protection in repayment. Well, the good people at FedLoan have been applying the full payment to 1 loan and ignoring the other allowing it to accrue interest.


The kicker here, is that if the accrued interest is not paid off within 6 months of graduation it is capitalized. Interest on interest. 

I caught it early and no big deal, I can just change my autopay on their website to specify how much I want going to each account.

And that is where I am wrong.

FedLoan Servicing does not allow automatic payments to be setup unless the loan is repayment. This just feels a little sleazy for a federal loan provider.",finance
personalfinance,Is Peer-to-Peer (P2P) a safe investment?,"Hiya Reddit! A bit of background first, I have been looking around for investment options for a while now after working full time over the summer and having over 7k in the bank. Having been saving every paycheck, I'm hoping to be able to get a larger return on my money than I otherwise would in the bank. Being 16 years old longer term options of 2 or so years are viable as I will only need the money when heading off to uni. 

I came across P2P upon hearing about it from a family friend. Specifically 'Squirrel Money'. They over 7.92% interest for 2 years. This is for a minimum  $5000 investment. Doing this would mean over 300 extra dollars at the end of the 2 years compared to my banks 3.9% interest rate. 

Just wondering what the thoughts are of such an investment? Is it safe? Are there better options? My mum has also said she will go half with me if I choose to do that with her.

personalfinance,Only paying off interest on student loan debt,"Hello everyone,

I’ve lurked here for about a year and the resources and advice have helped me quite a bit with getting a handle on my finances. 

Here’s my problem:
Three years ago I completed a Master’s program at a private university with a minimal scholarship and took out massive student loans. I stupidly was so thrilled to be accepted into the prestigious university that I didn’t do any research or educate myself about the financial pitfalls of Federal Plus loans before I took them out. Though I worked part time in school, with the 7.3% FedLoan interest myloans have increased to $90,000 in student debt over the last five years. 

I have a full-time job (ironically at the expensive university where I got my Master’s) with good benefits but not great pay (I make $38,000 a year before taxes). Because of r/personalfinance I’ve finally got my budget sorted and built up an emergency fund to cover 3 months. I have no credit card debt.

I am currently enrolled in the PSLF program through my job, and will be three years into repayment come this spring. I am on an income-based repayment plan currently paying $130 a month, which is about $20 over my minimum payment.

Looking at my FedLoan account yesterday it hit me that with the income-based repayment plan I am just paying down interest, not making a dent in the principal payment at all. I feel like I’ve been treading water for the past three years. 

I’m trying to decide whether I should continue paying the minimum for the next seven years with the goal of PSLF loan forgiveness, or try to pay off a bigger chunk of debt month to month.

Part of me is nervous about funneling money currently going into my savings into paying off more of my debt, as the debt is so vast it feels like pissing in the ocean. Even if I was stretching my budget to the max to pay off more of my loans each month, with my current salary and expenses I think I could only manage about $5,000 a year (the university I work at is in a large city with high cost of living).

I would like to start saving for other things - a downpayment on an apartment, an increased emergency fund, or a small chunk of money for investing, but I don’t know if that’s the most practical choice considering my debt.

Any advice you all have would be appreciated. Thanks for reading.",finance
personalfinance,Denied student loan refinancing twice. Any other options?,"So I've attempted to refinance my private student loans once with SoFi and then again with Citizens Bank and was declined both times.


Right out of college I was underemployed for roughly two years and ended up defaulting on my loans.  This dropped my credit score considerably and I believe this is why I am unable to refinance at the moment.


That being said, my financial health is much better than it was two years ago.  I have since found a job in my field and I'm making more money than I ever have. My federal loans are being paid under the IBR plan and have been in good standing for the past 14 months.  My private loans have been in good standing for the past 2 years and I've been paying extra down on them each month (snowball method).  


My concern now is that my largest private loan balance is $26k at 9.88% interest.  It kills me to see how much this one loan is costing me.  Any ideas as to how I can mitigate the expense here?  My FICO credit score is 696 on my last statement and I think this is what is holding me back from getting approved for refinancing.  That, or just my credit history in general with the prior defaulted loans.  Do you know what is roughly the minimum credit score accepted for refinancing?  Is there an industry standard of any kind?  My though is at least then I can reapply for refinancing as soon as I know I'm in the acceptable range.


The only option for possible cosigners is my Grandfather but I would rather not have him involved. I can provide more detail if necessary.  Any advice is welcomed.

personalfinance,Which order should I pay off my student loans?,"I have 6 different student loans with a single provider, which are at different interest rates. I calculated how much interest i'd collect in a year from that loan. The interest rate will not change. Any interest I collect will be paid off first, before paying the principle. Numbers are below:



Principle | Interest Rate (%) | Yearly Interest
---|---|----
3,500 | 3.40 | 119.00
6,500 | 3.86 | 250.90
3,500 | 4.66 | 163.10
2,000 | 4.66 | 93.20
3,589 | 4.29 | 153.97
3,911 | 4.29 | 167.78

When I pay my provider, any excess payment will either be put to the loan with the highest interest rate, or I can customize which loans receive how much (by percentage) of the excess.  I am in a position to put excess funds towards my student loans.

*My Question*: In the interest of paying the least amount of money, where should my excess payments go?

*My Solution*: 100% of my excess money goes to the loan with the highest yearly interest amount (the 6,500 one) *until* it matches the second highest yearly interest amount (the 3,911 one). Then the excess gets split 50/50 between those loans. And the pattern repeats when they reach the third highest.

What do you think? Is there a better way to do this? Is there something i'm not thinking of? I feel like i'm missing something!

Thanks for any help :)

*note* I've considered the avalanche method, but I don't think it'd help me, since the interest isn't added onto my principle. Plus, I feel like 250/year is a higher priority than 167/year...but I am open to debate :)",finance
personalfinance,Which method is better for paying off my student loans?,"I still have just under 30k, spread across 10 different loans, left to pay off. I currently pay between 2x-3x the monthly minimum on each loan because I can afford it, and I would rather pay off my student loans sooner rather than later. 

I calculated that my student loans should be payed off by August 2020 (Graduated 2015) if I continue paying this same amount each month. 

Should I continue on this path, or would it be more beneficial for me to pay the same total amount each month that I currently am, except paying only the minimum on the loans with lower interest rates (3.4 being the lowest) and putting the rest to loans with a higher interest rate (8.25 being the highest)? 

I checked the wiki, and most entries regarding student loans either didn't apply to my situation, or wasn't detailed enough about how to apply payments. 

I can provide more details about how much I owe, the interest rates, and my monthly payments if needed.",finance

personalfinance,Should I switch from desktop TurboTax to TurboTax Online?,"I've been using the desktop version of Turbotax for at least 10 years and have been very happy with it.  I was considering using the online version since, with my simple tax situation, it would be completely free for me to use and file for both state and federal.  I want to import my information, including my digital signature, from the desktop version but there is no way I have found to do this.  I googled and saw the link to update from your prior year's tax file but that link does not exist when I open up the Tools window.  Is *import* only available on the paid version of TurboTax Online?  If I must type in all of my information and recreate my digital signature in TurboTax Online, will the free version remember this info for future years or would I need to manually enter it each year?  If this is the case, I'll probably stick with the desktop version.",finance

personalfinance,"Currently in my fourth year at an out of state university with another two years extra planned ahead. Parents are currently paying tuition, but am currently looking for a way to help them out and pay for some (or most) of it myself by means of scholarships and loans. Any suggestions?","Hello Reddit,

This is my first real post so I apologize if my Reddit skills seem basic. Anyways...

I am currently heading into the back half of my fourth year of college. I attend school out of state (CU boulder but am from California), and my parents are paying for most of my tuition and rent expenses. I have a job, but that makes enough for car payments food and leisure since I am busy with school work. I have also applied and received federal student aid, but only received a minimal amount since both of my parents have a steady income. I have spent a lot of my first few years floating around, changing majors and transferring colleges as well as going abroad, so all the set backs have made me two years behind, leaving me with two more years in college after this semester. 

I was wondering if anyone has any suggestions to any good recommendations for private student loans or any private scholarships. My parents have said they will keep paying for school but I would like to start being responsible for my own payments and want my parents to begin to spend more money and time on themselves now that both my brother and I are out of the house. My brother also attends college out of state. Thank you!

Edit: Just want to make it clear that I'm willing to financially set myself back, more or less wondering the best possible way to take out these loans and apply for these scholarships (as opposed to wondering if this is a good idea or if I should do this)",finance
personalfinance,Want to do a mortgage backed consolidation loan. Need about 20 pts on my credit score to make it happen. Would appreciate suggestions.,"Long story shortened: about 10 years ago I went into my first lien mortgage holder and stated I needed about 15k to pay off some student loans and credit card bills while I was at it. The next week I walked out with the check at a very nice single digit interest rate. Wow how things have changed. Last year walked into the same bank, living in the same house with the idea of doing something similar. Because of lay offs (I had to leave my company for 9 months and was called back) and new jobs in which a clientele had to be built from zero (wife), the amount of revolving credit I had was very uncomfortable and I wanted to do the same thing. Was shocked when I was denied, especially as I was asking for about $30k on $100k worth of equity. At the time I had a 690 score and my bank wanted me to have over 700. The reasons given for this score were A. Amount of available credit (lack thereof) on revolving credit limits and B. No recent installment loan. 

A score simulator provided by Discover, if to be trusted, states that if my revolving credit were paid off I would have over an 800 score. So the issue I'm trying to take off the table is the one preventing me from taking the next step. In the year since, I have kept everything well maintained, but have only crawled back up to 696. 

Winter is coming. My company of 16 years has been purchased by a large telecom and my employment next year is uncertain. My wife makes a good salary and would easily be able to handle our mortgage and a second mortgage at a decent interest rate. My point is, I want to make this happen, and soon while I still have a 16 year job as a positive on my side. 

Here are my 2 questions: 

1. Does the secondary installment loan actually have any real impact? Can I go out and get a $500 personal loan from a finance company and see a jump in my score? If so, how soon could I see that?

2. My bank is big into personal lines of credit backed by equity. Is this a good thing or a not-so-good thing compared to a second mortgage from a third party mortgage company?

I'm sorry for all the background, but wanted you to understand my specific situation and goal. Many thanks for any insight you may have.

personalfinance,[Student Loans] Should I take a federal unsubsidized loan to pay off a private loan?,[deleted],finance
personalfinance,How do I maximize my student loan tax credit,"Background: I recently graduated from a state university and now have a stable income as a full time employee. I am fortunate to have less than $35k in student loan debt. 

My state has a tax credit program where if you graduated in the state with a STEM major, and now live and work in that same state, they will give you a tax credit up to a certain amount per month based on your student loan payments. 

I'll use fake numbers for an example. The state sets a limit on the amount they will credit you, and if your monthly payment as dictated by myfedloans falls under that, that's the max they will credit you. (They will only credit you for your minimum payment, anything over that isn't credited) So if my payment is $250 a month, at the end of the year they will give me tax credits for 12x$250. So, if you live and work in the same place for 10 years, all of your student debt will be credited for. But, because ten years is a long time and I don't want to commit to that, I think it might make more sense to plan for taking advantage of the program for 5 years, to minimize the accumulation of interest. 

The problem with this plan is that the more I pay per month over my minimum, the lower my minimum payment gets, which means the lower the amount I can get a tax credit for.

The next part of this problem is I have 8 different loans of varying amounts with varying interest rates. So if paying them off early is the right move, how do I pick which one to pay off first?",finance

I am 18 years old, I live in Belgium and college here is pretty much free. I could go right now to enroll to an Economics and Business university because I'm quite interested in that stuff but on the other hand I feel like there's nothing more valuable than self-education and I have the feeling that those 3 years studying economics won't serve me that much. 


I'm interested in a bunch of cool things: self-improvement, business, psychology, social-media, health, spirituality, personal finance.. I read a lot about those things and I definitely have another awareness on those fields compared to my peers. I feel like they live in the bubble of social conditioning, all defending their ideas about what is good or bad to do in life, what's best to study.. I believe they have no idea what they're talking about. 

There's one thing I know for sure: I would hate to work for a boss. I want to be my own boss. 

So here I am drowning in confusion about what the hell would be the right thing for me to do right now.

personalfinance,Transmission in car is going bad - need to make a decision,"Hi all, I currently drive an 04 Acura TL with 160k miles and unfortunately I think the transmission is failing (as many Hondas do). The car is fine to drive right now but shifting hard and it once slipped out of drive into neutral last weekend. It was bitterly cold that day. Forums, friends, and personal experience with Hondas say the car could have a week, could have 6 months. I commute 13 miles to work so I need transportation.

I bought this car two years ago with a 3% loan from my grandparents. I currently have $3000 left on that loan, paying at about $180 monthly. I have auto insurance through June as I paid up front.

I have $2400 in credit card debt (24% interest just started) paying off at $500 a month currently. I usually pay more when I feel I have extra money. I have 5 cards total for $12k limit, but only one has a balance. None of them have 0% interest anymore.

I have $800 in savings (was starting an emergency fund) with $120 weekly going into that and I make $780 a week after taxes ($60k), $660 going into checking. I have $500 in my checking with no big bills until Feb rent.

My expenses outside the car and credit card are about $1550 and I would be hard pressed to cut even $50 of that. This all leaves about $200 of buffer monthly after income for unpredictable expenses.

For tax refunds I have $2300 in federal and likely $170 in state coming after I file in a few weeks. I was planning to use these to pay off the credit debt. I was also planning on, once that credit debt was gone, maxing my company match at 8% into Roth which is about $90 per paycheck.

As of right now, worst case I need a new transmission which would run $3-4k that I don't have and won't have for months. I am faced with the following choices:

1. Trade in while the car drives (I'll get roughly $2k) and get a $5-7k loan and have a more reliable car like a Toyota. But it won't be as fun or nice as my car is now, and I still have my grandparents $3k to pay. I *could* schmooze them into lengthening the loan to lower the payment to $80, saving $100. If I get the loan, I will have to upgrade to full coverage meaning adding $100 monthly on auto insurance.
2. Open a new credit card that will cover the full transmission bill. My credit is 730 and I think with my income I can get a $7-8k limit on a card with 0% for 12-18 months. If I do this, all my plans stay the same (401k, paying off other card) but I still have an older car and I add $4k of debt right as I should be finishing credit debt.
3. Change my transmission fluid, keep driving it, hope for the best, and be prepared for it to fail. This option is the cheapest obviously, but it is winter and again this could happen any day. I would have no trade in value with a broken transmission.

I was planning on getting a new car in 2018 or 2019, after this one was paid off. Psychologically I felt great and now this week I feel helpless again, like just when I feel good about finances unexpected shit shows stop me full force.",finance

personalfinance,I'm saving too much money and I have too much debt,"Sounds like a no-brainer, right? I wish.

I'm 22, fresh out of college, still living with my mom. I started my first full time job 2 months ago. I make $50,000 a year, but take home ~~$37,000~~ ~$33,600 after taxes, insurance, 401k, etc. 

I have $40,000 in student loans. I'm on the lowest interest rate plan, which costs me ~$450 monthly.

I have car insurance that costs $130 monthly. 

Other expenses like gas, tolls, and food come out to about $320 monthly.

Altogether, my monthly expenses are about $900.

My mom wants me to live at home to save money -- great idea. However, since I'm not paying rent, she thinks I can afford to put $2,000 A MONTH in my savings as my ""rent"" for living at home. Her idea is that I will be able to put money down on a house/condo in a couple years because she plans on selling the family house by then. I only bring home $2,800 a month, I will literally drown in debt at this rate. 

My mom has offered to pay for some expenses because I haven't been able to afford to keep up with paying for them (OBVIOUSLY) and I haven't been working long enough to pay for my upcoming monthly expenses ON TOP OF what I owe her. As of now, I owe my mom $2000.

She's really into the idea of forming good financial habits, and I'm all for it, but this plan literally makes no fucking sense. How should I refinance things so that it makes sense to my mom and helps me get out of this debt while saving money?

TL;DR - I bring home $2,800 a month, I have $900 in monthly expenses, on top of that I owe my mom $2,000 and counting because I can't keep up with my expenses with this ""plan"", my mom wants me to save $2,000 a month as a form of ""rent"", this doesn't even add up and I will be swimming in debt in no time.

personalfinance,Drowning in debt and need advice on how to get out.,"Hey y'all, so I was advised to post in this for advice on how to get out of my current situation given the resources I have. Currently I am 99k in debt from student loans and 12k in debt from a car loan. I only make 40k per year and my loans my federal student loans are still in deferment until June 2017. Currently I am paying a student loan back that doesn't allow me to put in into deferment or anything a normal loan would allow so I am stuck paying it. I also have a car payment of 300 per month, car insurance at 95 per month and my rent in 450 as of right now. Im nervous that once my student loans come out of deferment, I wont be able to afford being able to live and will damage my credit it further. Right now my credit scores are in the low 500's for one and low 600's for the other. I just recently applied for a secured line of credit which I got approved for so hopefully that will improve my credit some what. My question for you all is, with still being able to eat, what should I do to get out of this situation sooner than the 20 years these student loans are set for. Getting a higher paying job isnt an option (i do have a masters in rehab counseling) but my resume is ""weak"" to everywhere I keep applying. And currently my job wont allow for me to get another job due to HIPPA and other company restrictions. 

Ill gladly answer any questions as well!

personalfinance,Regarding the new Overtime Law that Obama and the Labor department passed back in May,"Hey everyone.

I had read that Obama and the Labor department had instituted a new law that would require certain salaried employees (that qualified) to time and a half pay for every hour of overtime that they work if they make under roughly $47,000 a year.

This law was supposed to go into effect December 1st, 2016, but I recall that a federal judge in Texas was attempting to block it.

I am trying to figure out what the threshold is on how much I can earn from the freelancing before it turns into an issue where I will be taxed on that small chunk of income.  Is this even an issue or do I just have something mixed up?  The accountant at the Mo job said that under $600 should not require paying taxes but I cannot find anything on the topic and want to make sure I am not screwing myself up with the situation by not filing something correctly.

personalfinance,Married filing: joint or separate??,"Background.

Add into the mix in January of '16 our first child was born, so this will be our first year adding that into the mix.

personalfinance,[DEBT] Out of debt for two years- Now 30k back in debt- Engaged/Planning a Wedding. Looking for some advice.,"Hey everyone, I'm 34 and recently engaged. 

I proposed to my now fiance Christmas night- oh yeah, and she said yes! 

We've been together for 3 years and she is one of the least materialistic down to Earth gals I have ever known in my life... Except for when it came to an engagement ring... 

She's never cared for extravagant things so when I discovered she wanted a larger ring then I would have guessed I didn't hesitate to spring for what she wanted.  

I spent a total of almost 13k on the ring. I had 3k to put towards it this month, and then had budgeted making a 1k payment on it a month and have it paid off late next year.

Last week when talking about the wedding she expressed wanting to get married this year, October 2017. I hadn't thought about getting married so soon- not because I don't want to, I just didn't consider it (first time being married). When she suggested it, I loved the idea and as of now we have a venue and caterer already booked.

Small speed bump in our venue/caterer (they are connected) is that they only except check as payment. I'm pretty bummed by this as I use an Air Miles card as I live in CA but my family is all in ME. I'm a teacher so I travel home for Christmas and during the summer, and the air miles are amazing to rack up.

Anyways, and my apologies this is maybe for info than what you need... When the wedding expenses are all said done we are anticipating about a 16-17k bill. This wouldn't be so bad except the fact that I am also no sitting on a 13k bill for the ring as well. 

I have a couple questions...

1. I'm considering taking out a large personal loan to combine the ring/wedding expenses into one place. The loan will be for about 30k I am assuming. I don't have a lot of experience with loans- How should I shop around? Should I shop around for a personal loan? Do banks tend to be better, credit unions, or what about consolidation companies like Lending Tree (I know nothing about them). I have good credit between 700-720.

2. I hate the idea that I am going to be losing out on 17k worth of air miles. I know you can withdraw cash from your credit card- This would allot me the miles. If I did this due to the withdrawal interest rate being so high I would also still be looking to then take out a personal loan to pay back my credit card company and also consolidate the ring into it as well. I have never withdrawn cash using a credit card... is this a really bad idea?

I know that a lot of these things I could research, and trust me I plan to, it's just been a whirlwind of a week- getting the wedding items planned, getting back from ME, starting school up again, my kiddos have finals next week, and I am also the assistant commissioner for our sports conference- so I've just been pretty tied up and already this week burning some heavy midnight oil.

If anyone could even just nudge me in the right direction or offer some advice I would be so amazingly appreciative of it.

So I'm currently in my 1st year of a 3 year graduate school. I have about $10,000 in savings and no student loans from my undergraduate.

I'm living with my parents while I'm in school so I have very little living expenses. All my loans are federal with an interest rate of around 5-6%.

personalfinance,Can I dispute a closed legitimate credit card entry I did not sign up for?,"Backstory: I had a relative with a bit of a ""god complex"", and she added my sister and I to one of her credit card accounts without our knowledge or permission (long story; family drama, don't ask). Neither of us ever agreed to this, weren't aware of it at the time, and we were minors when we were added - as best I can tell, I was 15 when she did it. Neither of us ever had a physical card, and made no charges on it. She passed away a few years ago, and that account was paid off in full and closed by her estate's executor.

The closure of this account was recently brought up by a lender since I'm in the process of buying a new home. It's listed as a *positive* mark on my credit, at least according to my interpretation of credit karma's report. My credit isn't terrible (just under 780 at the moment), but I'm being led to believe that this closed card will impact my interest rate in a negative fashion. 

So here's the question: Is it possible for me to dispute this *positive* mark with the credit reporting agencies in an effort to have it removed? Also, if you think the lender is BS'ing me with this for some reason, please say so (she has a distinctly scummy vibe).",finance

We have a 2-year old and another on the way but have pretty frugal lifestyle in an expensive city.  Combined income for the year is around $75k before taxes.  She's in the medical field and I piece together part time work, but our monthly expenses are $3,200-$3,500 all told.  

We have $60k at 4% in debt from her medical school and that's all.  No other student loans or credit card debt.  Right now we have about $15k in the bank and that number has been growing steadily the last 6 months.  So the questions is do we save our money to be rid of the student debt or for a house in 2-3 years.  

I know the arguments to some degree.  Student loan debt is a great one to have.  Low interest rates, good for credit score, etc.  The equity in the house and great housing market here make buying a great return if we were to sell in 5, 10, or even 15 years.  There is no sign of this city's economy slowing down with all the tech jobs pouring in.

personalfinance,"I recently received my master's degree, and the federal that department that funded my thesis project offered me two contracts for the next 11 months worth a total of $120,000. How do I proceed?","Hello all,


I've been lurking for a while here now, but this is the first time I've felt compelled to post.

I completed my master's degree in a science in December. Nearly yt two years ago I landed a contract through a regional federal agency that detailed a project that I based my thesis on, which lasted 1.5 years and paid $60,000. Most of that money went to tuition, software, a stipend, and university overhead (they took 55% of money that was given to me as a stipend). 

Since I have completed the degree, I submitted proposals for two other projects (two separate projects, but have to do with the same work topic), each worth $60,000. Admittedly, I expected to get one and planned for that to be my work for the next year; I was relatively pleased right out of grad school. 

Today, I learned that I have the total trust of a lot of people in the department, and secured both contracts worth a total of $120,000.  They will run simultaneously 11 months, from February to the beginning of 2018. I will be paid by deliverable, which currently is bi-monthly ($20,000 every other month) but there is room to change this as of now. I am doing so as a self-employed contractor. Business expenses will be limited, as I have most of the hardware necessary. I will need to purchase the professional versions of some software packages totaling a couple grand. The rest of the money is mine to use as I see fit after (quarterly?) self-employment tax. (PS- I assume this tax is on projected earnings for the year)? 

My current financial situation. I am 25 years old. I rent a place for myself (and my pup) since my long term girlfriend moved out. I have no debt, credit card or student. I recently applied for a secured credit card to begin building my credit. I own my car. My living expenses are relatively minimal, as I really don't live too lavishly. I have $8,000 in the bank. I work a job in my field that I also held during grad school. They promoted me after graduating, but I don't see a future there and it doesn't pay nearly as well. No benefits, and I am on my parent's health insurance until my next birthday in late 2017. 

So I suppose my question is.. what do I do now? All of my friends were in business fields but I was always the science guy. While I feel like I have a good grasp on a lot of things, finances, taxes, and things of that nature are pretty lost on me. I have done some reading on credit, IRAs, etc, and plan on hiring a financial advisor, but I would love some initial tips if anyone has any. 
You have to realize, this is quite a shock to me and quite a bit more money than I ever expected to be making right off the bat (even if it is only for a one year contract). I realize this is a great opportunity, and want to take the proper measures to ensure that I make the most of it. If you made it this far, thank you for reading!",finance

I currently have around $12k debt on my car at a 4% interest rate, and an $8k unsubsidized student loan at 6.8%.  Long story short, I am undertaking more schooling while I work (post-bac) and as such have had my student loan payments deferred, so my subsidized portion of loans is currently not accruing interest.  I am however, considering a switch to a full time graduate program next year.

This begs the question, does it make more sense to aggressively pay down this student loan to minimize the long term cost, or pay down my car to eliminate a payment, thus making attending a graduate program full time more feasible.

My mother died at the end of 2015. She owned 3 properties about 2 hours away from where I live. One of which was her house she had worked with an architect to build from the ground up., the other two were rentals on the same street. I have a brother and two sisters, everything was left to us equally. We made the call to sell the two rentals, and I decided I wanted to buy the main house. It took some time to get things organized, all of my siblings live far away and it took util May basically till we could all get to the house together and each take the stuff we wanted. It went very amicably, but took a while. There is a renter in the house, he was renting a single room from my mother; stayed there during the week, lived in a large nearby city on the weekends/holidays/etc, so his rent money was paying basic utilities. In the meantime I inspected the house and found some issues (Hole in the roof/termites/water leaks) and we got those fixed using the funds in my mothers leftover accounts (She didn't have a lot in liquid assets). My plan for the place is to rent it out as an AirBNB as it's close to the beach and looks like a Martha Stewart home (Open floorplan, 3BR/3Bath, 2 with Jaccuzzi tubs, walk-in closets, bay windows, massive back deck, etc). Also, when it's not being rented out I could use it as a vacation home. While I was getting money together and whatnot, I got hit by a flood. 3 feet of water in my house, lost my car, some other stuff. I did have insurance on the house but only liability on the car. My father died almost immediately after the flood (Relevant later) (Parents had been long divorced) After the flood buying a used car was a big issue so I decided to buy new (I know, I know). 


I've been working on my credit score for a couple of years, my issue being I basically had almost no credit history. (I've never liked credit cards, hate being in debt) I got a credit card a couple of years ago and started using that for basically all purchases and kept it completely paid off. Using Experian I've been keeping an eye on my score and at the time it was in the 750's. When I took out the loan for the car, I put $5,000 down (Could have done more but I wanted to keep a safety fund of about $20k because after the flood I didn't know if the business I worked at would recover), but they didn't give me a great rate on my loan (4.5%) because they said my credit history was paper-thin. 


Anyway, flood insurance finally paid out, my place is almost done being rebuilt, we've sold one of the rental homes, and I'm ready to tackle my mom's house again. It needs a little work to be ready for AirBNB, (Needs TVs, a full bedroom set for one of the rooms, deck needs some sprucing up) but it shouldn't cost more then $5k.

All of the properties are owned outright, nothing owed on any of them.

**The Numbers:**

*House I want to buy value: ~131k (Two appraisals done, first one came in at 140, sisters were shocked it was so low so wanted another opinion which came in at 122)

*Income: 87K

*Value of current home: ~60k once repairs are done (It's a townhouse, living below my means) (Owned outright)

*Balance remaining on car: ~23k ($500 monthly payments)

*Cash on hand: ~45k once the check for the house we sold comes in, $13k is in SBA loans that I'll be paying back over 30 years at like $65 a month, though considering doubling it to get rid of them faster

*Probable inheritance from my father's estate: ~$30k

*Current Credit Score: 765 (Took a hit after I took out the auto loan but has been going back up)

*Price I need to pay my siblings for the house: $98k



**The Questions**

*I know I own 25% of the Equity of the main house, so does that mean I can just take out a re-financing loan? I did some research before the flood, seems you can take it out up to 80% of the value of the house. Is the APR on that better than a mortgage? Can I even take out a mortgage since I own it already? I really know almost nothing about this sort of thing.

*Should I go ahead and pay off the car ASAP? Would that help my credit? Hurt it? I know having an installment loan helps your credit, but I don't know how beneficial it really is and how long it needs to go on before its effects are diminished.

*How do I go about shopping for the best deal on a loan? My first inclination is to use my bank (Regions) but should I be shopping around?

*If I got a re-financing loan, how does that work? Do they just send my siblings checks? 

*What sort of APR could I reasonably expect for this sort of loan?

*Will I get any tax breaks for having gone through a federally-declared disaster? Googling it was pretty inconclusive.

I live and work in a flat-tax state. Does my gross income get taxed by the flat-tax at total gross and taxed federally at total gross? Or does state or federal tax come first and the remaining gross gets taxed the other way.

For example, if I make $30,000 and the flat tax is 3%, what will my taxes be? Will they be 3%*$30,000 + (amount that is federally taxed on $30,000)? Or will it be, for example, 3%*$30,000 + (amount that is federally taxed on 97%*$30,000)?

personalfinance,Which debts to pay down first? My husband and I cannot agree on what to do.,"So being that it's a new year, my husband and I are working on catching up on some bad spending habits over the past few years. We have quite a few credit cards and we cannot agree on how we should go about paying them off. 

I say that we pay the ones with highest interest off first. Period. Then we roll the extra money into the next one on the list. 

My husband had a different theory, basically that we pay off the highest balance debts first, because even if the interest rate is less, his example 10% vs. 20% we are saving more by getting that debt paid off, because we are paying less interest per month. 

His theory makes absolutely no sense to me whatsoever, but I can't seem to explain my thinking so that he agrees with me.

That's why I'm not really sure if I should pay those ones off or just pay minimum on those for now until I figure out if I will reenlist. My plan right now is to pay the minimum on subsidized and unsubsidized and pay a lump sum of maybe $10,000 to the state loan and try to get that paid off in a year. Is this a bad plan?

Using a throwaway due to some personal info on my other account but big fan of this sub. I'm graduating in May and have a job paying 65k+ annual bonus (5-15%) lined up to start this summer.

8800 in private at 10.8%

personalfinance,Advice on Debt Collection to Secure a Federal Job,"I'm planning on applying to a US Government agency later this year and, while reading through the process, I noticed a caveat about financial status.

&gt;A complete review of your credit is an important part of the background investigation. If you have a loan (no matter how small) which has been turned over to a collection agency, or is in some way classified as delinquent or in arrears, this must be resolved before any action can be taken on your application. Written documentation must be provided illustrating your good faith effort to repay any bad debt. All credit cards possessed must be listed, regardless of the balance.


As it stands now, I have 5 accounts listed on Equifax. 

1) My car loan through Wells Fargo Dealer Services. This account has been open since around August of 2015, and I pay it as agreed each month. 

2) My student loan through Fedloan Servicing. Around 30k, and it is currently delinquent. I'm focusing my attention this month and next month to bringing it current, and prioritizing staying on top of payments afterwards. I graduated in 2012

3) Bank of America Credit Card - $500 limit. I try to pay it off in full each month, and have followed tips here to use it as a means to assist in boosting credit. Never missed a payment. Open since June 2016.

4) Belks Credit Card. I used this back in 2011 in order to get a discount on a suit for an interview for around $100. I forgot about this until I pulled my credit report. I do not recall any correspondence for this account. Equifax states that it was charged off in 2013-2014, but does not list it in the collections tab.

5) The most concerning account for me right now is my old Citibank credit card. I used this in 2011 while I was on 2 month vacation around NYC, Boston, D.C., and I managed to rack up around $4000 on it. Immaturity and poor judgement, coupled with loss of my work-study grant, led me to ignore this. This ultimately proved a terrible decision as it went to collections and still resides there. 


From the way the job application sounds, I must have all of my debts resolved. It specifically states loans and not credit cards, but I assume derogatory history for a credit card is still no bueno. I'd like to get this cleared up as quickly as possible. I've done the math and I can throw a few hundred at the debt each month if I work hella overtime.

personalfinance,RE: Sanity Check - Any problems with my student loan refinancing plan?,"This post deals with frequently discussed topics, but given the gravity of the decision, I couldn't *not* ask people to weigh in.

My husband and I have approximately $315,000 in student loan debt. ($121k are mine). The loan we would take out would be a joint loan, so I would assume a greater student loan burden personally than I have now. The loans are almost entirely federal loans and the interest rate on the loans is between 5.9%-7.9% with most loans at 6.9% or higher. We have the opportunity to refinance $300,000 of the debt at 2.75% for a seven year repayment period through a private bank. Our monthly payments will be about $5,500.

Our current combined income is about $290k/yr pre-tax (not including bonuses) and our salary is expected to increase 10-15% per year for the next several years. However, our fields are both up-or-out business models. We would both probably still be employable if we lost our jobs, though probably not at our current salary, and the odds of us both holding on to our current jobs for the next seven years are mediocre at best (though we are both probably secure for at least 2-3 years).

We have about $30k on hand right now, and high rent, so if we both suddenly lost our income, it would probably only take 3 months to burn through our reserves with the new monthly loan payment.
The difference between 7% and 2.75% compound interest on $300k is crazy, and stands to save us about $50k over the next seven years.

I'll have about 2k worth of expenses to immediately pay, towards the university and credit cards, and I am trying to budget for the first time in my life.

I'll earn 600-800/month for my part time job depending on how many shits I take.

Monthly expenses: 
$242.5 Auto loan - 9.9% interest rate with 11k left. Car is worth about 10k, I purchased it this year, so I want to make extra payments to get positive equity in the car then refinance to a lower rate.

$200 gas as I'll be driving 40 minutes each way 4x a week

$200 food, but likely won't be this high as I'm bringing food from home 

$20 gym right next to my house

$100 fun

$20 Spotify and Netflix

= ~790

If I divide my 4K up by 6 months, that gives me a 666 income + 600 work = 1266/month.

I'm also planning on stocking away 200/month to an emergency fund, and then paying an extra 250/month on my auto loan to bring it down quicker. 

My question: should I pay 6 months of 250 (1500) on the principal upfront, so less interest acquires, or should I pay the 250 monthly? 

I also have some odd jobs that will net me 200-300 some months, such as babysitting or helping out with an organization I mentor with, which I plan to split each month between the car and my emergency fund. Also I should get a tax return of ~1k as sales tax in Texas on first vehicles can be returned, and I plan to split that also and throw half at the car and emergency fund.

So I want to set up a savings account, or possibly something else. I want to be able to automagically take money out of my account so I don't have to remember to do it. Or be able to have my work direct deposit part of my paycheck into it.

Should I just shop around some banks looking for ones with a good savings account? Or are there other types of accounts that I could put money into and get a better interest rate?

I don't anticipate taking money out except in dire emergencies. 

My healthcare basically is paid for by my job (public school fuck yea!), I dont pay any monthly cost, I  have a $1000 deductible, and $1500 out of pocket max. I already put $1000 a year in an FSA and I get ~$850 in a VEBA Account. I've already hit my deductible and will hit my out of pocket max in the next month or two (yay trans healthcare costs).

I have my grandma's old car so I am not making any payments and I keep it pretty up to date on maintenance.

I have a portfolio with Schwab and have a decent amount of stock (I think), but I don't know how liquid that is and how easy it would be to cash out if I need money. My mom managed it for me up until a couple years ago and I haven't really touched it since.

2) Current monthly income net (after) tax: $6.6k

  
3) Current monthly expenses including savings: $4.75k


4) Net difference to put towards loans monthly: $1.85k 

 
  



Now for the debt.  
1) School Loan principal balance $20k with 6.5% which has $310 monthly payment due 2023  


2) School Loan principal balance $13k with 3.8% which has $162 monthly payment due 2025  


3) Car Loan principal balance $9.8k with 1.9% which has $274 monthly payment due 2020  


4) Car Loan principal balance $16.5k with 1.7% which has $310 monthly payment due 2023  



So now with all the information laid out, what are your thoughts? With $15k saved up do I pay off the $9.8k car loan so I can feel good about eliminating one and have an extra $274 each month to put towards something else? My hesitation is that is has such a low interest rate so very little is going to interest. Do I put it towards the $20k school loan since it has the highest interest rate at 6.5%?

personalfinance,I just had $6000+ stolen from my checking account via paypal. Am I checking all my boxes?,"I checked my bank statement today, which was about about six thousand south of what it should be. Sure enough, my statement displayed three separate transactions from a computer store that I did not make.

The paypal account used was not my own, however they did use my eBay account (which is weird since the two are connected). All of these purchases were emailed to my yahoo account. 

The yahoo account had a different password, and the eBay account is gone. I assume they deleted it.

I have contacted paypal and they are in the process of refunding my money. I also locked my debit card and am getting a new one. I'll have to drive down to my local police station since neither my local police station or the one in the city that the card was stolen from will make a report on the phone.

The Paypal rep I talked to was awesome, and even tried to contact FedEx to cancel those shipments. I'm trying to contact the third party shipping facility the thief had them sent to, as well.

So $TBIO (+376.85%). Healthcare stock moved after news announcement about a licensing agreement with leading Canadian laboratory services provider LifeLabs.

personalfinance,Refinance question.,"I have a mortgage of 130,000 @5.0% I have 23 years left on the  life of my loan. My payment is 1167.20 a month. I want a 15 year mortgage. My house is currently valued at around 190000. Original loan was 160000 in 2009. 

I am looking to refinance. A lady I talked to today said she can do 3.625% for 15 years. She also said it is possible to buy points and get my interest rate down to 2.625.  She also said she can roll the cost of the points into the new mortgage. Is there a formula I can use to determine when it is no longer cost effective to buy points? I can't see why I wouldn't just buy the max amount of points possible since I will be dropping the life of my loan by 8 years.

personalfinance,"18, no financial help, on my own, little debt but need help to keep on track.","This is my first post here, I didn't see anywhere what information would best help, so please let me know if I am forgetting any details.

Job: I make decent money, $14.81 an hour, and on normal weeks, full time. Sometimes depending on health issues (more on that to come), holiday, and whatever else I may have to miss work for, it might be less. I am not allowed overtime. I started this job in 4/16. A requirement of this job is I have to be enrolled in college classes.

Parents: My parents are completely unsupportive, even when living with them they would often make me pay for everything from food, clothing, car, car insurance, gas, phone, etc. So I graduated as a senior, my birthday being in July meant I was still 17. I was fed up with my parents offering no support and figured I might as well move out if they aren't going to help me. So me, my cousin (20) and 2 friends (19 and 20) rented a 3 bedroom house, we each have our own room and one in the basement. Rent is $375 per person, bills around $80 per person. With recent family issues and certain threats placed our way, my parents didn't think twice about letting me move out.. with one caveat being I am completely on my own. They will not pay a penny of anything, not even college.

Education: I graduated with decent grades from highschool, I also did a technical school during highschool as part of a program. After 2 years of being in this program, I was struggling on the last semester due to myself and medical issues. I applied for the job I have now, and got the job. It was day hours, so after talking to my counselor there, he told me to withdraw, get the job and I can always come back. So I did, thus never finishing that class and not getting my credits. I worked all summer and planned on going to college at a local publicly funded college, however with no help from my parents, I couldn't afford it and had to wait until the next semester which I planned to go instead to community college. Time flew and here we are in January of the next year. I'm enrolled in classes in community college, 6 hours online, with payment or payment plan due 1/17/17.

Debts: When I moved out, I had 0 savings, with the hope that I would make enough to save along the way. My cousin loaned me the money for deposit and some of the stuff we had to buy (kitchen utensils, cleaners, etc). About $500. A few months later I opened my first credit card account, with the hopes of building up credit. $300 limit, I was good at spending and paying it off every month but then money started going else ware and now I have a balance of like $275. I also opened a new checkings and savings account as my parents were on my other. For some reason that I still don't know, the debit card somehow got negative balance. I didn't know until about a month later because I never ended up switching to it. A month later I see I have a balance of -$100+ from late fees and shit. Well I didn't have the money to pay it, so here we are, about another month later and I get a letter saying they closed the account and if I don't pay immediately, it will be reported to Consumer Reporting Agencies, which may prevent me from obtaining services at other financial institutions. Fuck, I don't have money to pay it. Christmas eve, I wasn't paying attention and slowly (and by slowly I mean SLOWLY) backed into my cousins car, a 2011 Ford Fusion. No big deal right? Grill was pushed in a little but that looked like it... No, estimate is $1700 to $2100!! FFS DO I NEVER GET A FUCKING BREAK? NOT EVEN ON CHRISTMAS EVE? Anyways, that's going through insurance and since my parents won't help me at all, my aunt and uncle are paying the $500 deductible and I can pay them back over time, amount not agreed to yet. So lets backtrack because I forgot about my phone, my old phone broke about the end of November. The AT&amp;T guy fucked me over because I told him multiple times, I CAN'T RAISE THE BILL ANY. So he ASSURED me that the new phone wouldn't raise prices, used my grandpas upgrade, bla bla. Failed to tell me I still owed $200 on my old phone, parents are pissed, expecting me to now pay off that AND my new phone AND the phone bill itself. I think that's the end of that section, thank god.

Vices: When I first moved out, I was a heavy drinker, not addicted, but I enjoyed being drunk. $20 a week. About a month later, I started occasionally smoking weed with my roomates whenever they smoked. Eventually it turned into an everyday affair, I quit drinking and went all weed, thinking it was so much healthier. Next think I know up until the beginning of last week, I was spending $280 A MONTH ON WEED and I didn't even smoke before/during work!!! I realized this and I stopped immediately, cut it off completely, which is great but now I have the issue of Insomnia back and no weed or alcohol as a vice to help me. So I would love to stop completely but I really have had a hard time without it, sleep, emotions, time, it's all so.... SOBER and BORING and I hate it... ALSO, lets tack on the impulsive spending. My worst vice, going out to eat, eating at work, going out to eat at lunch at work, buying little things here and there that just add and add and add onto it and it fucking kills me but it's like my brain can't say no.

Health Issues (The one thing my parents are helping with):
The beginning of semester 2 of my senior year, I was really struggling with sleep. No matter what I did, I couldn't sleep for the life of me. At the time, I didn't smoke and couldn't drink on school nights (I didn't keep alcohol at my house), my doctor diagnosed me with pretty bad insomnia, and we tried sleeping medicine (Don't remember the name now), this medicine knocked me out, but even after getting 8, 10, 12 hours of sleep a night, i would wake up as if I never slept, like I just layed awake for 12 hours. I don't remember exactly what I tried to do to counter this but I stopped taking the sleeping meds (Ambien now that I remember)and school went to shit, leading me to the job i have now and my previous talk with the counselor. Funny, after moving out, the sleep issues weren't there (stress I'm sure and the lack of it after moving out). About 3 months ago I started having stomach issues, went to the doctor who took my pulse, noticed that my pulse is very high for resting and immediately had me do an EKG, which showed signs that I have had a heart attack. They did blood work and a sonogram but everything looked normal, whatever, it went away. A couple weeks ago it happened again, this time worse, the pain and how long it lasted. The next day I got an appt with my doctor, again, pulse high, she thinks it could be anxiety/stress related, more bloodwork, urinalysis, chest X-Ray, all which turned out fine, no signs of issues. So I did a holter monitor (24hr EKG I wear on my waist), which takes about 3 weeks for results, she also wants to do a stress test of my heart and spirometer testing. All this has caused even more stress and I'm trying not to flip out but it's so hard especially without weed or alcohol. (BTW when I had the second ""episode"" i guess you could call it, I was already off weed and alcohol) 

So, I know i'm forgetting more but let's try and break it down.

-$500 (Cousin)
-$500 (Aunt and Uncle)
-$250 (Debit Account)
-$275 (Credit Card)
=$1,525 in debt

Monthly Income and Bills:
Net Income - $1600 (Full 80 hr paychecks)
Rent - $375
Bills for House - $80
Car Insurance - $75
Gas - $120
Food - No idea, I realize that is a big part of what I need to keep track of and will be from here forward. The past two weeks, instead of eating at work for breakfast/lunch in the cafeteria, I started packing a lunch 3 of 5 days of the week.
~~Weed: $280~~ 
Credit Card: Minimum $25

It seems I have money to spare right? Well as of right now, I have $50 in savings and maybe $20 in checkings, and $12 cash... I was stupid and didn't pay attention to what I bought, where, and why and I don't know what I spent all my money on.

I wan't you guys to know I am ready to change though. I cut back on food, weed, no alcohol, and am trying the hardest I can to get through this in one piece. The stress might kill me before I can get there though..

personalfinance,"Employer missed 2016 401K contribution, wants me to accept as ordinary income and suffer a big tax impact. Any remedies?","Hi /r/personalfinance,

I left my most recent employer in the summer of 2016. They paid a portion of my cash bonus on my last payroll cycle, and we agreed to reserve $53,000 to be funded to my employer-sponsored 401K account for the 2016 plan year. This amount was to be funded last month (December).

Today, I was informed that they did not make the contribution, as I was not an employee on 12/31/2016. Instead, they would like to wire me the funds as payment for services rendered as a 1099 employee.

This causes a couple of issues:

* Tax Deferral Timing: I've missed out on my pre-tax 2016 401K plan contribution (empty bucket).
* Tax Deferral in General: I'll incur significant tax impact on these funds, including 25% marginal Federal Tax rate, ~3% blended California State Tax rate, and (if I've understood correctly) a 15.3% Payroll Tax rate for Social Security and Medicare, since these will be contractor (i.e. sole proprietor) earnings.

Some suggestions from friends have been:

* try to force the employer to make the employee portion of the contribution to 2016 ($18,000);
* take the remaining subtotal and contribute it to a 2016 Traditional IRA ($17,500) and Roth IRA ($5,000); or, contribute similarly to a 2016 or 2017 Self-Directed or Individual 401K (up to the theoretical limit based on the remaining subtotal);
* pay ordinary income taxes on the taxable balance, and pay any self-employed payroll taxes on a different taxable balance

The goal here is to figure out practical solutions to limit the incremental tax bill and get the bonus I feel I rightly deserve. (Had I known about this in August when I left, I would have demanded the contribution at that time, or would have taken the cash and included it in my 2016 Taxable Earnings and enjoyed the market performance on that cash during the last 4 months of the year.)

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? Any suggested remedies at hand, or further issues to avoid? I'm not the only employee in this situation, so your advice (I know, YMMV, IANAL, etc.) will go a long way.

personalfinance,"Recent grad, finally employed so I want to start paying down my student loans. Would on-time, regular payments sufficiently increase my FICO score?","Hello, I've recently accepted a full time job offer that will pay enough to allow me to modify my student loan repayment plan. I'm currently on the income-based repayment plan and since I've had no income my monthly ""payments"" have been $0. My assumption is to continue on the income based plan but update my servicer on my new income.

I've also been learning a ton about personal finance for when the time comes that I have an income, and I want to improve my credit score. I've never had a credit card (had only a debit card through a credit union while I worked my way through college) but my question is, do I need one at this point if the only reason I'd get one is to improve my score? I'd rather just make responsible payments on my solely federal student loans, but if I should have a credit card for the first time I'd like to know (and why).

Finally, I got what I believe is an estimate of my credit score via CreditKarma.com - I was going to pay for the FICO calculation but was advised that it may be unnecessary if my bank had a score service. My CU linked to CreditKarma in a help article about FICO calculation. Is CreditKarma accurate enough for me to safely estimate my score or should I (ask my mom to) pay for the official MyFICO.com score?",finance
personalfinance,Interviewing for a new position at work and this will be my first-time negotiating salary. I'm inquiring about the 3/5ths rule.

I have 14 months experience in my current job which is a precursor to the position I am applying for, and I have my Master's degree in the particular field I am working in (Clinical Research).

personalfinance,"PSLF or ""refinance"" of sorts?","I currently have nearly $300k in student debt (I'm an idiot).I was planning on PSLF, but am not very far into it and am worried about the future of the program, and whether I'll be happy in a PSLF-qualifying job for the next nearly decade. 

The interest rates on my loans average 6%, and my current IBR payments are not enough to even cover interest (aka, the loan balance gets bigger every day). However, if I continue to work in the nonprofit sector, my grad school program makes my monthly IBR payments and after 10 years my loan balance is forgiven under PSLF, meaning I effectively ""make"" well over $300,000 (10 years of payments is likely between $60,000-$100,000 and then the balance, which could be closer to $400,000 by that point, is forgiven tax-free). 

I now have the opportunity to effectively refinance, but through a personal loan from family. I'd repay at something like a half-percent interest rate, with a monthly payment that was something like $1,000 minimum or 10% of my salary (the details are far from being worked out). I'd be responsible for paying the money back eventually, but it would be okay (with the individual lending the money) for it to take 20 plus years. 

Let's say my salary options if I stick with my PSLF plan range from 40,000-60,000 currently, and maybe up to 100,000 by the time I qualify for forgiveness. I could get ""lucky"" and have a salary more like $140,000 by that time.

If I go the refinance route, my career options broaden up a bit and I'd be probably be more in the $70,000-$120,000 range, maybe up to $180,000 eventually. 

The pros of refinancing include that I wouldn't officially have any student debt (which may help if I ever settle down and start a family and want to get a mortgage for a home); I would just have a payment plan with the family member who is loaning me the money. The downside is, of course, that I'm paying $300,000 that I would not have to pay under PSLF. And that it wouldn't be done with in 10 years, although I suppose it is possible I could try to find a high-paying job and pay it back more quickly. 

I'm stuck figuring out which option is better from a financial standpoint-- I'd like to minimize risk and debt and maximize happiness. Any insight?",finance
personalfinance,home buying,"I am a first home buyer but have learn a lot through the short time I've invested in this process of looking for a home. Last week I went to the 3rd walk through of home with my realtor and during the walk through I found water in the unfinished part of the basement ( finished has a sump pump), behind a closed door and a leak coming from the ceiling of the top floor. My realtor said this could be a good thing because I could get a waterproofed basement and a new roof out of this. We told the seller and the seller was embarrassed and told his realtor that he was going to have his contractor address all these issues.
This home is old, 1920, however 10 years ago was a total rehab, from ground up according to the seller. It has been mainly used an investment property and occasionally rental for 10 years.
My realtor told me that the seller found the issue with the water in the basement was due to a broken condensate line to the AC unit with a frozen and clogged line. The condensate line was replaced. This is why the water was running on the unfinished part of the basement. The roof has been fixed and the new drywall is being applied.
My question is this. Is this still a house worth considering? I talked to the neighbor of the adjoining house, 2 identical row houses built by the same contractor, and the neighbor told me that past renters of the property always mentioned water in the basement when it rained. Also the neighbor mentioned that she experiences water running down from the waters sometimes during heavy rains in her house, the adjoining wall. I'm definitely nervous going through and putting an offer because of these issues I saw. I don't know whether or not there is mold, rotten wood, beams or anything from the roof leak. I called a roofer and was advised that they wouldn't' be able to walk the roof due to the rooftop deck.
Another thing I don't know is an issue is that there is a tree root that is under the brick patio and the bricks are coming up. I don't know if that is a potential issue to any pipes or anything.
Again, I'm a first time home buyer that is looking for a move-in ready home and I travel for my career 1/3 out of the year. I don't want to mess with water issues when there is no one occupying the property. Are these issues to walk away, or will I be walking away from every house that has potential water issues? It is a great house and very good price. Thanks",finance

personalfinance,"$111,000 in Student Loan Debt: This is my plan, please critique","Okay some backstory:

I just graduated with a Bachelor’s in an Engineering discipline and currently $111,000 in student loan debt. The silver lining is that I was offered a position with an awesome company starting at $37.29/hour full time. 

I went to an out of state school and unfortunately my parents couldn’t cosign for me because of past bankruptcies so my sister cosigned instead and the majority of those are high interest rate, like really high. So the following are all of the loans and the rates I have:

$7811.84 @ 3.86%

$7691.68 @ 4.66%

$13437.17 @ 4.29%

$48968.63 @ 11.75%

$21917.54 @ 11.25%

$2380.77 @ 8.50%

$8500 @ 5.00%

Okay so I have a 743 credit score which is nice for my age and this is my plan:

From my calculations based on 40 hours a week I will get roughly $6,000 pre-tax each month.

I plan to move into a rental house or apartment near my work with 2 friends bringing the rent to roughly $700 per person per month. If I budget $250 in utilities and phone bill and $400 in food a month. I will be able to stay on my parent’s insurance for 1 more year or so depending on how the ACA repeal works out so that is covered for now, but if needed my monthly bill should not be more than $150 so I will budget that to be safe.

This bring my total of essential expenses to $1500/mo leaving me with $4500/mo to pay student loans and build an emergency fund. 

I plan to save $6000 initially as an emergency fund why paying minimum payments on loans.

My company does not match 401k investments for the first year, so I will wait to contribute until they match.

After my first month of income and I have a paystub I will go through SoFi in order to refinance my high interest private loans. I have already set up a preliminary rate check with their calculator and it offered a fixed rate of 6.5% for the 3 highest interest loan amount. 

After I have accumulated an emergency fund and have refinanced my loans I will begin putting all of my excess income post essential expenses into paying off my loans. 

Is there anything I am missing in my budget, or anything you would do differently if you were in my position?

This makes it a no brainer to take the offer now.  So I paid the $250 and got an act now rate of 2.9375 for the next 62 months. I'm pretty happy right now.

personalfinance,Best avenue for investing excess cash reserve of non-profit? Treasury bonds safest bet?,"I am on the board for a pretty low-key nonprofit. For a period in the 90's primarily the group barely got by. We put significant work into the property and have now had a very healthy income stream for the last four years. On top of that we received a few large estate donations. There is no logical reason this source of income will end. 

I'm in the process of proposing we put half of our cash reserve in a long term, low risk, fairly liquid investment. The other half would be much more than needed as an emergency fund and for wanted projects moving forward. Would something like a 10-year treasury bond be the ideal investment right now? Should I wait until the Fed raises rates this year? Right now only one out of eight is opposed to the broad idea.",finance
personalfinance,1/4 Of an Inherited House Questions,"This might get a little long, I apologize if I include too much information but I'm attempting to answer some questions before they are asked.


My mother died at the end of 2015. She owned 3 properties about 2 hours away from where I live. One of which was her house she had worked with an architect to build from the ground up., the other two were rentals on the same street. I have a brother and two sisters, everything was left to us equally. We made the call to sell the two rentals, and I decided I wanted to buy the main house. It took some time to get things organized, all of my siblings live far away and it took util May basically till we could all get to the house together and each take the stuff we wanted. It went very amicably, but took a while. There is a renter in the house, he was renting a single room from my mother; stayed there during the week, lived in a large nearby city on the weekends/holidays/etc, so his rent money was paying basic utilities. In the meantime I inspected the house and found some issues (Hole in the roof/termites/water leaks) and we got those fixed using the funds in my mothers leftover accounts (She didn't have a lot in liquid assets). My plan for the place is to rent it out as an AirBNB as it's close to the beach and looks like a Martha Stewart home (Open floorplan, 3BR/3Bath, 2 with Jaccuzzi tubs, walk-in closets, bay windows, massive back deck, etc). Also, when it's not being rented out I could use it as a vacation home. While I was getting money together and whatnot, I got hit by a flood. 3 feet of water in my house, lost my car, some other stuff. I did have insurance on the house but only liability on the car. My father died almost immediately after the flood (Relevant later) (Parents had been long divorced) After the flood buying a used car was a big issue so I decided to buy new (I know, I know).


I've been working on my credit score for a couple of years, my issue being I basically had almost no credit history. (I've never liked credit cards, hate being in debt) I got a credit card a couple of years ago and started using that for basically all purchases and kept it completely paid off. Using Experian I've been keeping an eye on my score and at the time it was in the 750's. When I took out the loan for the car, I put $5,000 down (Could have done more but I wanted to keep a safety fund of about $20k because after the flood I didn't know if the business I worked at would recover), but they didn't give me a great rate on my loan (4.5%) because they said my credit history was paper-thin.
Anyway, flood insurance finally paid out, my place is almost done being rebuilt, we've sold one of the rental homes, and I'm ready to tackle my mom's house again. It needs a little work to be ready for AirBNB, (Needs TVs, a full bedroom set for one of the rooms, deck needs some sprucing up) but it shouldn't cost more then $5k.

All of the properties are owned outright, nothing owed on any of them.


**The Numbers:**

*House I want to buy value: ~131k (Two appraisals done, first one came in at 140, sisters were shocked it was so low so wanted another opinion which came in at 122)

*Income: 87K

*Value of current home: ~60k once repairs are done (It's a townhouse, living below my means) (Owned outright)

*Balance remaining on car: ~23k ($500 monthly payments)

*Cash on hand: ~45k once the check for the house we sold comes in, $13k is in SBA loans that I'll be paying back over 30 years at like $65 a 
month, though considering doubling it to get rid of them faster

*Probable inheritance from my father's estate: ~$30k

*Current Credit Score: 765 (Took a hit after I took out the auto loan but has been going back up)

*Price I need to pay my siblings for the house: $98k



**The Questions**


*I know I own 25% of the Equity of the main house, so does that mean I can just take out a re-financing loan? I did some research before the flood, seems you can take it out up to 80% of the value of the house. Is the APR on that better than a mortgage? Can I even take out a mortgage since I own it already? I really know almost nothing about this sort of thing.


*Should I go ahead and pay off the car ASAP? Would that help my credit? Hurt it? I know having an installment loan helps your credit, but I don't know how beneficial it really is and how long it needs to go on before its effects are diminished.

*How do I go about shopping for the best deal on a loan? My first inclination is to use my bank (Regions) but should I be shopping around?

*If I got a re-financing loan, how does that work? Do they just send my siblings checks?

*What sort of APR could I reasonably expect for this sort of loan?

*Will I get any tax breaks for having gone through a federally-declared disaster? Googling it was pretty inconclusive.

It was a bit of a struggle to get everything aligned but we have a budget and financial plan now and our ongoing expenses are under control.

When we were making our new plan, I realized paying the credit card interest was costing us a lot of money (duh), so I did a balance transfer to a 0% interest rate card for 18 months.  I set this up about 2-3 months ago, so I have about 15 billing cycles left @ 0% interest.

personalfinance,Specific Advice - Best way to manage debts/investments,"Hey guys!

Hopefully you can give me some insight on what you would do in my situation.

Currently, I make $76,000 annually.

My 401k is matched at 100% for the first 3% and 50% for the following 3%, meaning I put in 6%, they match 4.5% total.

My girlfriend makes 40,000. Her 401k is at a 3% match.


My company also offers a stock purchase plan at a 15% discount with a max investment of 10%. I'm already in at 10% and its either 10% or 0%.

Currently we have the max match amounts going into our 401ks and the max for the stock plan.

For debts. We own a home and we both have student loans.
On our house we have a 3.5% interest rate on ~$200,000. This is going into our second year of ownership, we paid 1 extra months worth of payments (13 total last year).

Student loans, mine are ~10,000 @ 3.5% interest
Hers, $51,000 @ average of 5.5% interest. Some 3%, some nearly 8%.


She is a recent graduate from a more expensive school - Her loans have been in deferment for a few months and I think we're ready to begin paying them off. Should i 86 the stock plan and use that money to pay for her student loans? Is it worth keeping our 401ks at the max matched investment?

I think I'm doing it right, I plan on removing my stock plan investment and just paying down her student loans.

We have no car payments, no other major debts, and somewhere in the ballpark of $10,000-$15,000 in savings. We'd like to have a wedding in the next year or so as well and have a few house fixing projects on the docket (~5k total) but not urgent things. Our lifestyle has temporarily inflated some and our spending is temporarily higher but on things that will improve our quality of life significantly + an engagement ring, so our savings is a bit lower than I would like. I think this is likely a wash over the space of the year (For instance: We got theme park passes for quite a bit of money, but pack our own snacks/etc and go there instead of going out).

personalfinance,[21/F] Supporting self through grad school w/o job - personal loan justifiable?,"Hi y'all,

I'm currently a senior in college and I will be continuing into a 1 year master's program for education in an in-demand/high-need field starting in July of 2017. I will graduate again in May 2018 and am all but guaranteed a job starting at 45-50k a year. (I would not have done this program if this was not the case.) I do carry some undergraduate debt, but half of it is federal and thus I have many options of managing it as a future teacher. My own credit score is ~750 and my parents also have excellent credit and are willing co-signers (which I would rather not invoke).

Unfortunately, the caveat of this program is we are not allowed to work during the program. At all - we can be kicked out for doing so. Even if I could have a job on the sly, the time to do so would be limited as I would be teaching full-time during the day and going to class at night 2-3 times a week...and I still have to do homework. In return, my tuition is covered but my living expenses are not. There are no opportunities for academic stipends (RA/TA) and a very slim-to-nonexistent chance of a stipend in the spring for student teaching, but I am not betting on it. I am hoping to do some babysitting here and there to bring in a little extra money but again, I can't really bet on that at this point.

Of course, I knew this was coming so I have been doing my best to save while in undergrad, but life (emergency illnesses and an unexpected opportunity to go abroad that helps my career) happens and I am a bit short. As of this moment, I have the following:

* 2k in checking
* 3.5k in savings
* 2k in ROTH IRA (which I would not touch)

I currently make $500-600/mo working part-time while going to school, so after monthly expenses I believe I can realistically save another 1k by May. I can also find a job and work part-time in July and August as I would only be taking one class. I live in Boston so unfortunately the cost of living is high (as is my future salary), but I can realistically live on 1k/month including rent and other expenses. It would not be pretty but I grew up in a poor and frugal family so I am used to it and I am not afraid to make sacrifices to get things done.

With what I have so far (not assuming a summer job yet, but assuming some saving between now and May), this puts me about 6-8k short of a year's worth of living expenses. My mother had recently suggested taking out an additional private student loan or a personal loan to cover these expenses. She graciously offered to chip in a little bit of money here and there when she can to help with the payments while I am in school, especially because she has not needed to contribute to my undergrad education. This would admittedly save me a huge headache when looking for a place to live for the academic year (the Boston rental market moves quick) and would take my mind off of knowing I would at least have a roof over my head and food to eat while working. I am just leery of taking on more debt than I need, but I just don't see another way. Unfortunately, student teaching is an exploitative business.

Is there anything else I am missing, any other way I can make it through?

personalfinance,Student Loans - Pay off aggressively or gradually to build credit score,"So I am a recent graduate, and I had to take out a few student loans during my time as an undergrad. I know the suggestion is to pay off loans as soon as possible to avoid paying on interest, but is it worth doing gradual payments on a student loan (around a 4% interest rate) in order to establish a good credit history?

With my student loans I have two installment accounts, two other installment accounts with the credit builder loans, and a revolving account with my secured credit card. The student loans are my longest open line of credit--would paying them off close the account and reduce my credit score? Would they still contribute positively to my score even after being paid off?

personalfinance,"W4 withholdings - how to ""zero"" out withholdings each pay period?","Hi PF, 

Long time lurker, first time poster...I hope this hasn't been asked already. My wife and I (4 kids, 10 and under BTW) have both traditionally claimed ""0"" on our W4s, resulting in more tax withheld per pay period and a big refund in Q1. I know, I know - "" you shouldn't do that, interest-free loan to the government, etc. etc.""  I get it, but this method has worked very well for us. We take the ~$7500 each year and put it into a home improvement project and/or build up our savings or something like that, we don't go out and buy toys and stuff.  Bottom line, this way works for us and we're okay with it.

**However.** I recently started looking for a way to pay off my student loans quicker. One of the ideas I came up with was to change my withholdings on my W4, and put the extra $ from each paycheck towards my loans as well. I like this idea a lot, but I'm not sure how to adjust my W4. I don't want to claim too many exceptions and end up owing $ to the government at tax time, but obviously continuing to claim 0 won't change anything. What should I change my W4 to?

My federal withholdings per pay period are $202, State is $88. Is it feasible to get the total withholdings per period down to about $40, so that I could have an extra $250/pay period to put towards my student loans? That may not be possible, I confess I'm not very good at knowing how this all works. If it *may* be possible, how do I determine what to change my W4 to? I've tried the tax calculator thingy and either I suck at it or I'm doing it wrong, because I can't figure it out for the life of me. Any suggestions?

financialindependence,Results of a sabbatical experiment while on the path to FIRE,"Not sure how much interest this will generate, but I've seen the topic of a sabbatical pop up on occasion. My spouse and I did one and ended up on a slightly non traditional FIRE path. I had a few folks ask for an AMA, so here it goes. Try not to flame me too hard, eh? 


Background 
Married couple in our late 20s. Let's call us Adam and Jane. We started our relationship in our mid 20s both with a net worth of essentially zero. Adam's net worth was due to paying off student loans. My net worth was due to a previous marriage to an irresponsible guy and our subsequent divorce. 

Current combined stats
Net worth: about 500k, not including home 
Home: 200k with about 100k left on the mortgage, which we choose to not pay off yet due to the low interest rate
Annual income: 200k-240k depending on bonuses and stock options
Savings rate: about 50%
Investments are mostly ETFs or index funds as we are both very risk averse
No significant passive income other than listed above

We were both getting a bit burned out from the working world and the stresses of daily life, so we decided that we needed a sabbatical so as to not burn out. 

Experiment design 
Adam to take off 2 months. After his first month off, I would take off 2 months. This left us with each having one month off while the other worked and one month off together. We wanted to explore the dynamics of one of us working while the other retired, such as would occur with staggered retirement dates or if one of us wanted to take time off for kids, as well as how we would fare with being together almost 24/7. We both set goals for our time off in terms of projects, activities, and other things that we wanted to accomplish during our time off. 

Experiment execution and results 

Summary: 
Adam took off his two months and he flourished. I took off 2 months and became a glorified bump on the log. Around the 1.5 month mark, I realized that I got almost none of my goals completed and extended my leave by a month to a total of 3 months. I got more done in that last month than I did in the previous 2 months. 

Adam's first month: 
Adam took a week to clear his head and mostly played a lot of video games. After that break he started his to do list. He had few house projects that were bugging him as well as some personal learning goals. During this time, he kept our household running, doing 90% of the chores and errands. Adam is an introvert, so the lack of social interaction during the day time didn't bother him, and when I got home from work, he would still have a good amount of energy to go out and do various fun activities with me. This is as opposed to our normal working schedule where he is too tired after work to do much other than sometimes doing the dishes after dinner. Even with assuming 90% of the household responsibilities, he still had a few days during the week where he got to indulge in playing video games all day. Overall, Adam had a good experience with his time off. 

Our combined month off:
We took a few road trips that were a lot of fun, tackled some combined house projects and worked on ""us"". The working on us was important, as we had a few festering issues in our relationship. Nothing that was a deal breaker, but we weren't  seeing eye to eye and it could lead to hurt feelings and disappointment in the future. Since the break gave us a lot of free time, we spent a ton of time talking, understanding, and compromising. 
We were concerned that spending 24/7 with each other was going to make us hate each other, but, thankfully, that didn't happen. We had a few little spats,  but they were very minor and nothing that wasn't resolved within a few hours or less. 
The biggest problem during this time was that, because we spent so much together, our regular conversations got boring. When we were separated during the day, we'd text/message on and off throughout the day then do most of our talking during the evening. When we spent all our time together, we stopped being able to share the funny stories about our day because we were both there. 

Jane's time off alone: 
Whew... while the first month wasn't an epic fail, it was not a productive use of time. I had planned to go visit friends across the country, I wanted to cook through a cook book, and brush up on my technical skills so I could slip back into the work routine seamlessly. I wanted to get in shape with biking at least 20 miles a day for cardio, free weights for building muscle and doing at least an hour of yoga every day. 
Instead, most of my days consisted of sleeping in, going to yoga, reading Reddit, and playing way too much candy crush and Pokémon go. I was always behind on chores, and my cooking was sporadic and basic when done. As much as Adam is an introvert, I am an extreme extrovert. With all that isolation and general laziness, I became depressed and stagnant. I did meet people and make new friends, but, while not true for everyone, the bulk of the people that I met who had free time during the day every day were not as... driven or disciplined in their life. These folks were fun to hang out with for superficial relationships, but I would have had a hard time relating to them long term. 
After almost a month of being a boring bump on a log, I realized that my break was almost over and kicked it into high gear. I extended my leave by a month (I had this option prior to taking the break) and really focused on knocking things off my to do list. This additional month was a better use of my time, as I managed to go on one trip, complete a few house projects, and I spent time working out what makes me happy and what gives me purpose.

Results/conclusions 
Based on my experience, I realized that RE was not for me. I will likely want to be working in some fashion, even if it's just part time consulting, until 55 or later. My job was burning me out because I was pushing myself to advance as quickly as possible so that I could accumulate enough wealth to retire early. Adam realized that he loved his time off and has renewed motivation to pursue it. Adam is willing to decrease his lifestyle to retire early, whereas I would rather maintain it as I plan to be working anyway. We reworked our career and retirement plans to reflect FI with us retiring at separate times. To balance the budget, Adam has a much smaller fun budget than I do. Adam will retire when we accomplish FI with the basic expenditures, in 5-10 years, and I am taking a more laid back approach to my career and will maybe retire when I hit 55. If I decide to not retire when we reach FI with our currently lifestyle, we'll let our lifestyle creep up to whatever is sustainable if I were to lose my job. 

Tl;dr: Tried a sabbatical to see how we'd like early retirement. I disliked it, husband loved it. Now we're planning on retiring at separate times and updated our mutual and individual budgets/career to reflect our new plans. 

I glossed over some details, but that's the basics of our experiment. We're glad that we did it, learned about each other and ourselves, and we're much happier with our updated goals. AMA.

personalfinance,Bank is reporting my foreclosure as 6/2016 even though it was final 11/2011. Help.,"I have contacted credit agencies for the last few years regarding Home Federal and Mortgage showing my foreclosure as 6/2016.  I submitted the notarized court document showing my foreclosure was final 11/2011.  

I pulled my credit report and it's showing foreclosed June 2016 with 180 day late payments from 9/2011 to 9/2013.  However, I have court documents showing the foreclosure was final 6/2012.

Every time I dispute this, the bank replies back to the credit agency that all the dates are correct. That even though the court document states my foreclosure was final on in November, 2011, the bank states I was late on mortgage payments from 2012-2016 and the foreclosure was final in June, 2016.

I filed a complaint in December 2016 with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau about Equifax.  Same thing happened in that they contacted the bank, the bank says the dates are correct, Equifax responds the dates are correct and they will not correct them.

personalfinance,"I would like to pay off my ~$12K debt @ 0.75% interest early, but math says that's a bad idea. Are there any factors I am not considering?","Several years ago, I took out a $36K loan at 0.75% interest. It was considered a career starter loan and was a low interest rate due to my involvement in the military. 

As of 01 February, 2017, I will have paid off a credit card with a much higher interest rate. While I'm excited about that, a recent promotion plus the credit card cash flow has put me in a position where I can potentially pay off this loan earlier than anticipated. I owe 11 and some change thousand dollars on the larger loan, and that represents my only debt. I have a small emergency fund (~$1k) and a retirement account set up with my work. If that amount is needed, I can provide it. 

Now, I've read most of the resources here, and most of them will tell me that paying more than minimum into the 0.75% loan isn't a great idea. While my job is very stable at the moment, events a few years ago have led me to be very risk averse when it comes to debt, and I frankly really hate this loan over my head. That said, here are a few options I can see:

1. **Invest the money.** I don't have much in the way of investments, but finding mutual funds or stocks that yield anything over 0.75% (almost all of them given enough time) would be mathematically better than paying the debt. 

2. **Pay off the loan early.** Regular loan payments are ~$610/mo. That means a final payment date of August 2018. If I put my extra money towards the loan, I could essentially halve that and be fully paid by approximately October 2017. Not mathematically sound, but again, I hate the fact that I have this debt looming over me each month. 

3. **Buff up my emergency fund.** The current amount has saved my ass before with a recent vehicle tune-up, but I know $1000 isn't a whole lot. I eventually want to get 3 month's worth of expenses in the bank. 

Am I missing a potential option? Does anyone else have experience with making a mathematically inferior decision in order to feel better psychologically? Or am I losing out on too much money by doing that? Thank you in advance for your time.",finance
personalfinance,Tax Filing Question [TX] for Soon To Be Divorced,"Hey everyone.

As the title states, I am in the process of getting divorced. I live in Texas. No state, only federal. I don't foresee the divorce being finalized until after this tax season, but that doesn't really matter as the taxes being filed are for 2016 anyway.

My soon to be ex and I have been separated since their affair and announcement for divorce August. The petition for divorce was filed beginning of September. I was the only one working from January to the end of April. My ex started a new job the first week of May. We have a 2 year old, who I provided health coverage for all year long. I also paid the majority of the child care fees since I took our kid to daycare most often. I also began providing health coverage for my SO in July after we found out the coverage offered by the small company they worked for was crazy expensive. I provided health insurance for my SO until I changed jobs at the beginning of December. New benefits were immediately active for my child and there was no gap in coverage.

Her salary was larger than mine, but only by a few thousand. But being that I worked for the entire year and she only worked for 7 months, I'm sure I made more than she did.

My questions are:

Are we classified as legally separated?
Can I file ""married filing separate""?
Can I claim ""head of household""?
Can I claim the money my soon to be ex paid towards child care while we were together and separated?
What if their new SO has made payments to the daycare (a suspicion of mine as there are card numbers on the billing summary the aren't any of my ex's that I recognize)?
What would be most beneficial to me?


I would really like to file separate, mostly because I don't want her knowing where I work or how much I make.

personalfinance,"[Taxes] ""In a prior calendar year you were overpaid by the Department of Defense""","Hi /r/personalfinance,

Last year I joined the Navy and received a signing bonus of approximately $15,000. Long story short, I was given an honorable discharge for failing to complete training due to a medical diagnosis. They Navy is recouping my bonus per my contract with them, and while most of that money is gone, I now have a well-paying job, and I have been paying the Navy back in monthly installments at a very low interest rate.

I never thought that this would come into play come time to file tax returns, but today I got a letter from the Defense Finance and Accounting Service. The letter reads (emphasis mine):

&gt; In a prior calendar year you were overpaid by the Department of Defense. The overpayment was established as a debt to the United States and was reported as taxable income in that year. This certifies that during calendar year 2016 you paid the United States a total of $3,495.43 toward settlement of your debt.

&gt; This certificate is for your use and may assist you in reducing your tax liability for calendar year 2016. Keep this certificate with your income tax records for that year.

&gt; (DO NOT ATTACH WITH YOU INCOME TAX RETURN)

&gt; **If amount you repaid (shown above) is less than $3000, you may be able to itemize deductions and claim the repaid amount as a miscellaneous deduction (Rev. Rul. 79-311). If the repaid amount is more than $3000, you may be able to deduct the amount repaid as a miscellaneous deduction or use the amount repaid to compute a credit against your tax liability (26 U.S.C.

personalfinance,Refinancing student loans: fixed or variable rate?,"Hi everyone,

I recently refinanced my student loans (over $200k, from grad school...yikes).  Since my loans are with the government, I had the usual 6.8% interest rate.  I have decent credit score (around 720) and when I looked to refi my loans, I was only offered either 6% fixed rate (I am paying it off in 7 years) or 5% variable rate (same term).

I was originally thinking to go with variable rate due to lower interest, and from what I've read/heard, the variable interest rate usually doesn't ""move much"" based on history, like it might move a few tenths of a percent in the term of the loan (based on the previous several years).  But, my dad talked me into going with the fixed rate due to the unforeseen economy and future with the upcoming Trump administration.  (The cap for variable rate would have been at 9.75% interest.)

What would you have done?  Take a calculated risk and go with variable rate?  Or go with a sure thing with the fixed rate?  With the variable rate, do you think it would have likely increased beyond the fixed rate of 6%?

At what point would it be wiser to go with variable rate over fixed rate and vice-versa?

Sorry, I'm not too well-versed with financing and this is my first refi.

If it helps at all, I am able to easily make my monthly payments.  My combined income with my wife is just short of 200k, but we do have over 250k in student loans combined.  Our rent, heavy student loans (but trying to pay it off aggressively), credit card debt (had a large wedding recently, and trying to pay off CC debt asap) and other life's necessities and utilities do currently eat up most of our monthly take-home amount.

Thanks in advance for any help.

Definitively, the tech is solid and they think it's the future. They are obviously interested in the technology because of the total control it would give them on the currency and the lack of anonymity it provides in its current form, the ability to track every single transactions, a cashless society where you can't hide your money, etc.

Isn't there a risk that once the technology is proven and they create their own coins that most people will simply adopt the FedCoins and leave Bitcoin behind?

And if people want anonymity and don't want to be under the control of governments, wouldn't the parallel market simply switch to alternate coins that provide these features, such as the Monero?

I can almost consistently make 10-12 pips a day (scalping or catching small hourly swings) and in theory shouldn't one leverage the shit out of your account and risk 10% or more if you are consistent? 

Perhaps a 3-5k trading account is simply not large enough for supplemental income from my 50/hrs week day job. When you factor in federal income tax and brokerage commissions, a few hundred dollars a week does not go very far. 

I hope this does not sound like a rant, please let me know your thoughts as I am exploring some outside the box leverage thinking.",finance

personalfinance,Taking a loan to pay off vehicle to sell to pay off other debt?,"I've been approved for a $5,000 dollar loan which I intend to use  to pay off a newer motorcycle I purchased a few years ago. The interest rate is high on the bike and the company that has the title is literal ass to deal with. The bike has $3,400 left on pay off so that would leave me with $1,600 left for the loan. The bike is worth about $5,500 so I can sell it for around $4,000 as it is in pristine condition. The combination of this would then go to pay off what is left for my credit card debt. Which is also hovering around $5,000 but at a lower interest rate. 

Does it make sense to put myself $5,000 down at 10% for two years to pay off $3,400 at 9.95% and with the sale off bike to pay off $5,000 at 7%? (I believe, don't have the statement in front of me)

I just found out that my student loans became active and I needed to pay for them, I did not receive any notice and I check my account back in Sept and there was no payment needed.. now I owe back money of 500 dollars and it was reported to creditors that I have a delinquent account! (by the way they never notified me or sent me any notice of any sort, I would of thought that they would of. Last time my account became active for payment and I did not pay they called me but that was 3 years ago, I went back to school but took the fall semester off thats why I wasn't paying on them prior) 

I am planning on using the 500 dollars to pay off that amount, would that be a good idea to at least get caught up? Or to use that money elsewhere?

My husband has our emergency fund covered, we have over 1,000 dollars saved up for that. 

My thought it to pay off my 1st and most of my 2nd CC to make it simpler but I also know that the 4th CC is a slightly higher interest rate (its about 2% higher).

I live a pretty simple lifestyle, I seem to break even every month, something I am working on. I have recently started up college again, and will be getting about $750 a month (GI bill). 

My question is where would that $750 best be put? I originally wanted to put it all into the NF credit card (the highest balance), and then into the US one. 

I also plan to move in the next 4 months, and will be saving around 400-500 extra a month, but currently I'm only banking on the GI bill coming in as additional income, and possibly 1200-2000 back in taxes. I want to know where I should put that extra $750 a month? Should I split it up, pay off one thing at a time?

Please note that the TS loan is a timeshare loan, andt he TS fees is the monthly fees, it currently does not report on my credit, as it is still in my ex-wifes name (divorce is final next month, will have to transfer it to my name at that time).",finance
personalfinance,"Student Loans, Credit Scores, and a Collection Agency. Three Questions","I graduated from university back in May, but I haven't yet found full-time work. Nelnet services my student loans. Bear with me, I'm gonna lay out the details.

I had believed my student loan payments began January 3, but in late December I began to worry because of calls from a supposed debt collector (United Collections Bureau). At first I thought it was totally a scam, but then I got to worry and started looking over my student loans. Indeed, they're all serviced by Nelnet, but what worried me is the statement I found on my student loans page on the federal student loans website: that I ""Entered repayment 11/18/2016."" So I am now unsure if this means my first payment was January 3rd or not. **Question 1:** Was I late? Literally nothing on Nelnet's website told me I was late, but I didn't start looking into it until mid-December. They approved the forbearance no fuss no muss, even.

Late in December I requested a forbearance on repaying my student loans (since I'm still not full-time employed), and it was quickly approved on 12/29/2016.

On January 3rd I got an email from Mint (I think I signed up for them a long time ago but never sign in or use it) saying my credit score dropped 5 points in December. **Question 2:** Could this be related to how I was late on paying my credit card in November? This was my second late payment in the history of my credit card since I got it almost 10 years ago, I believe. I paid a late charge of ~$30.00 for it, too.

Earlier today I got another call from UCB, the collections agency, for the first time in more than two weeks. I never answer them because I find that the caller ID is really suspect (it only shows an area code). But it made me worry again, so this time I requested my Equifax credit report after searching around on this subreddit. It shows my credit card and student loans as I expected, and ""0 collections found"" which makes me think this collections agency is, indeed, bogus. **Question 3:** Are there other ways for me to make sure I'm okay and not delinquent on anything? How did this CA get my information when my credit report shows nothing? Other people I found talking to UCB on this subreddit basically say they're given the run-around when they try to find out even the slightest information about what debt is being collected. Passing back-and-forth to ""managers"" and not having any info on file for the people. If I call them I wouldn't wanna give away more info than what they deserve, especially if this is fraudulent.",finance
personalfinance,Should I get a second credit card? (MEX),"Hi, /r/personalfinance.
Currently, I have a single credit card in the same bank I receive my pay, wich started with a 12K MXN credit limit. I have given it a limited use (3-5 Uber trips per week, clothes every other month, car rentals once or twice a year). Only twice in two years I've missed the payment deadline and had to pay interest. After then, I've always paid it full and kept it in a zero balance. A couple months ago, the credit limit was increased to 18K. 

Last week I opened a savings account in another bank, where I intend to keep an emergency and savings fund. During the process, I was offered a pre-approved credit card by the bank. It would start with a 13K limit and increase from there according to use. The interest rate is similar to the card I already have. 

The accounts manager was very clear to me that for him it was mostly about reaching a credit card sales goal. He even offered to me to open the card, keep it a couple weeks and cancel it (which I declined. I either get the card or I don't, I'm not going to be playing games with my finances and credit).

Now, I'm starting to build my emergency fund, I have never needed to use the full limit of my credit card and, according to the advice I've seen, in general I keep a healthy management of my CC. If I get this card, I would keep the same mentality. I don't intend to take any credit card to its limit or to put myself in a position where I have to difer their payments.

Would it be any advantage of having a second credit card, if it's so similar to the one I already have and I have never needed to go to the limit of my credit capacity? 

What's the impact on one's credit score from having a single credit card or having two?

I live in Mexico, but overall our finnancial regulations are quite similar to the US, for what I know.

- started a savings account that has $1000 in it currently. I want to save at least $1000 per month this year. 

- started doubling down on paying off debt. I've paid double our car payment and double our credit card payment this month and am planning on continuing this until they are paid off. Which I'm projecting to be in July.

- I make $35,000 a year. 
- my wife makes $5000 a year. (Part time, she's in school)

- credits cards, unfortunately we have some credit card debt because we were both full time students for 2 years and it was kind of necessary. Now that I work full time I am going to pay it off. We have $2000 on the credit card.

I spoke with my financial institution and they can approve us for up to $40,000 at 6% interest. This would pay off all of our current debt. 

The only reason the car is mentioned, even if it's paid off using a slightly higher interest rate loan, is the lowered monthly insurance payments for it, which would save us more money than the difference in interest rates.

I am getting married in August, and hope to buy a house with my fiance sometime before the wedding. 
Most of my financial knowledge comes from reading posts on this sub and listening to dave ramsey when he's on the radio whie I'm driving. After reading the wiki and  ""how to handle $"" on the side bar I still have several questions. 

1) In order to maximize my companies 401k match, I will put in 10% (of base pay)  to recieve they're maximum match of 8%. Is this enough to save? Typically I read annual retirement savings should be at 15%. Right know I am set up to put  10% into the 401k. And then another 5% into a Roth 401k also offered by my company and managed through Merrill Lynch. I feel like I could be a little agressive in terms of savings here. 

2) School loans are 33k, dont remember the rate off the top of my head but they're all federal loans. I am not required to pay any until June (allowed to defer the first 6 months after graduation). Listening to Dave Ramsey, he would have me believe that I have to pay this off prior even saving for retirement or anything else. I feel his method here is a little extreme. Is there anything wrong with deferring until June and making the minimum monthly payment until after the wedding and moving into a house?

3) I have never bought a house before and am not entirely sure of the process/what I can afford. Can anyone direct me to some reliable sources to learn more about this. I feel like everying I see online is a sales pitch to sway me one way or another. My plan for now is to save up ~$20k for a down payment and look for a house between $140k-160k with a 15 year loan. If I buy a 160k house, my simple math puts my monthly mortage payment below 1k, which is a good spot to be at to me.

Thanks to the saving and spending habits my father instilled into me since i was young i am able to afford putting about 50% of my income into savings, while still being able to live a very comfortable life. I do not own my own home as of now, but most of the money i am putting aside is to go towards buying land and a house.

I also do not yet own a car as i live close enough to my work to walk, however i do not like having to pay for a cab any time i want to go into town or asking one of my friends for a ride. I am looking at purchasing a used car, and using it to help me build some credit, as i currently have none. The price range i'm looking at is between 10-15k, and putting about 6k into a down payment.

My question for you, Reddit, is how aggressive should i be in paying off the car? I was thinking about putting maybe 100-200 more per month than the minimum, at a very good interest rate (about 3% thanks to my father agreeing to cosign)

Should i be more aggressive and build my credit through a different means, such as a credit card, or is it smart to build my credit through this method? 

tl;dr I am financially independent, putting about 50% of my income into savings, should i be aggressive in paying off first car or should i use it to build credit?",finance
personalfinance,Smart investments out of university with entry level position.,"Not sure if I'm posting this in the correct sub and many apologies if my ignorance is annoying, but I graduated university in summer '16 and was recently hired making 32k paid twice per month (15th &amp; last day of the month). My work automatically deducts for 401k, so I don't have to really worry about that, insurance is deducted as well, which isn't much, nothing I notice.
By the grace of my wealthy grandmother and parents, I only have 13k in university debts to pay off.

With this current job, I'm still on the job hunt as many other places are hiring in my area offering more pay, but this job shot me an offer first and I was hungry, and I also do not plan on looking into housing until I know I'm 100% where I want to be/all these potential opportunities are behind me.

I have it extremely well off in my situation: My only bills are gas (student loan repayment begins in March). My car was a graduation gift, and still under factory warranty.
I stay with a relative during the week for work, and return to my parent's on the weekends so my living expenses are non-existent. 

My questions are:
What are some smart methods of investing I should do with my pay (I know there are tons posted on this sub, it's pretty overwhelming and I'm extremely indecisive).

I do not have any money in IRA's of any kind, but am aware of their value and reliability. I just don't know where to go to begin, in terms of banks/investors, etc. What banks have good IRA rates?

Are there any small types of businesses I could start up with my income (I've been looking into mini-storage buildings. If any others that can be started or invested into relatively cheap, that'd be appreciated!). I'm just looking for another source of income that I can create myself with what little pay I have.

Should I just focus completely on paying off my student loans, which I could technically pay off within a year or two?

I've got about 5k in savings. Last month I paid off the accrued interest of my student loan which was almost 1k. When I get paid again, I'll likely put $400 or so on the loan to get ahead. Payments (when they begin) are extremely cheap ($135/mo) for my current financial situation. 
Don't early payments on student loans lower the interest rate, typically?

I think that's it. Sorry for being all over the place and messy, as I'm still trying to figure everything out, grow accustomed to salary, being paid decently (not random hours at $10/hr), and decide what exactly I need to do. Again, apologies for ignorance. All help is greatly appreciated.",finance

Been looking through a lot of advice, and a lot of it pertains to the US. I also have some factors which change how I need to move the money around.

I am getting married mid 2018. I need the cash partially available for deposits, though I wont need a large cheque until the day of. So a full investment seems to be out.

I have about $15k saved and want to make sure its not uselessly sitting in my savings account. Its a normal savings account with a major bank, and the interest may as well be non-existent.

I have no debt with one exception, my car. Its a 5.9% interest rate, and I only bought it 2 months ago. Car was about $28k after tax/fees/interest. I thought about making a large downpayment on this debt as suggested, but I am worried about not having the amount of cash I need to pay for the wedding next year. I am banking about $1000/month into savings.

I am not opposed to switching banks.

What is the best option for the short term? Someone pointed out the Tangerine Tax Free Savings Account, which looks like it would get me a guaranteed rate of 1.20%. A couple hundred bucks is not a bad choice, but I wanted the experts opinons of other options I have.

gaming,"I'm wondering about the console arguments, and also looking for more games to play","So here's everything in my head.

I'm a huge fan of classic RPGs. The more you give me ATB, the better. I'll always have a soft spot of Chrono Trigger and Earthbound. My other favorite series have been Borderlands, since the RPG elements and improving guns allow me to be able to improve to take out enemies easier, instead of 'getting gud' like my friend harp on to me about. I really don't like FPS usually, or straight action games. I do love good stories though. I'm not a fan of competitive online play usually. 

Here's my console run down
I've been carrying a dislike for the Xbox One since day one, with mismanagement of their consoles release (along with the privacy risk it looked like). Besides that, I don't see any exclusives that really talk to me. I love my Xbox360 still, for games I've collected on it that are aren't exclusive (I had it first from gen 7 and 8) and the Fable games along with Blue Dragon.

I got a PS3 from my parents. There's a FEW titles I have. (I got Disgaea games, Kingdom Hearts because I'm a fan, Ni No Kuni, Tales of Symphonia, and the Jax and Daxter collection) But other than those occasionally being brushed off and played, it sits around being the easiest thing to play netflix on. I also play Tekken Tag 2 on it with friends

I own a wii that plays the throwback Gamecube games for me *cough*

I use a Wii U to play Metroid Prime Trilogy, didn't like Hunters or Federation Force on 3DS, and I also have every Zelda game they've done. I found pokken tournament to be a lot of fun, and a needed break, though the mechanics sometimes tick me off, since I'm used to regular fighting games. Mario Kart 8 is amazing with friends, but why is it that all my friends aren't as good... The majority of the time, I leave the TV off and play virtual Console games on it though.

My PS4 is my baby in a way, and I play Disgaea 5, Digimon Story Cyber Sleuth, Skyrim, Final Fantasy X, Citizens of Earth, Child of Light, and some GTA5, for just goofing around. I don't really play GTA online. I also use it to play Rocksmith, since that's actually something I like doing to improve what I can do with my guitar.

What I'm wondering about is if there's anything reason to pick up a Xbox One, that would fit with all I said above. There's also a lack of RPGs in my life that I haven't already beaten. I do intend to get a Nintendo Switch, but outside of that, I just want to know: What all should I get? What would I enjoy? What have I missed?

Oh, and I also play Borderlands 2 on PC too, with stuff turned down so it runs smoothly. My PC isn't exactly the best but it manages.",technology

Our combined pre-tax is around 160k. We don't want kids for the next 2 years or so (I am 29). We are very conservative financially and have no debt. We also save &gt;50% of our income, but have not had significant wealth accumulation to this point since we both went to grad school. We have saved plenty for a down payment though. Our option is to either get a $450k zero-lot home with three bedrooms that would likely work for 6 or 7 years. It feels like the mortgage would be an albatross around our necks though. Option two is getting a 2-bedroom townhouse for $230k. If we go with option two we will be able to save tons of money over the next several years. It would only work for our first kid though and we would probably have to turn around and sell after maybe four years. I know the rule of thumb is to hold for five years, however these factors make me hesitate
1) our rent goes up 8-15% every year
2) my income is now high enough that a tax-shield is an important consideration
3) I believe there will be interest rate hikes over the next several years and possibly inflation - meaning getting into a mortgage is a good move.

personalfinance,Savings vs Student Loan Payoff,"I've got a ELI20: I have heard in the past that when you have debt with high interest rates you should pay that amount first instead of saving money, as the money you save from not having to pay interest is greater than what you earn from savings (provided that there is no 401(k) matching by employer).


That being said, I am wondering if I should do the opposite. My current employer does not require me to put money in  a 401(k) to make a contribution (they put 3% of my yearly salary once every year).

personalfinance,"Money allocation, Roth IRA or house downpayment","Hello all,

I've been a browser here for a while now and this is my first time being OP, so here goes.  My question is, should we (wife and I) put money towards Roth IRA or house downpayment.  

Here is an overview of our finances:

- Gross income: 103K (will double in about 20 months, then up to ~300K in about 3.5 years; we are both medical residents so salary bumps coincide with our transitions to full attendings)

- Monthly expenses: $4300 (rent, utilities, insurance, phone, internet, food, restaurants, car repair savings, vacation savings, fun money, gifts, etc)

- Monthly loan payment: $960

- Additional savings per month: ~$650

- Total loans: 300k student loans (hers) at ~ 6.5%

- Emergency fund: 15K

- House savings: 20K

- Total Roth IRA: $6500

We are planning to buy a house in the next 12-18 months, by that time our housing savings will be about 28K.  We are in an upper midwest city with a competitive housing market and will likely be looking at houses that range from 300-400K.  There is also a chance that my family may help with a house downpayment (would be likely be a family loan at a low interest rate, maybe 2-3%. Very much risk free, awesome parents, not worried).  I would like to put 20% down, if possible, so to get there we would definitely need the help of my family.  

So, to the original question, should we put everything towards a house downpayment or contribute to Roth IRAs this year and next year?  After these next tax years, we won't qualify for Roth IRA and our tax brackets will go up, so part of me is thinking that we should take advantage of it while we can.  On the other hand, we would like to put as much money down on a house payment as possible to get a lower interest rate, and there is no guarantee that my parents will go through with their offer. In regards to student loans, we may try for PSLF so we are going to stick with IBR for the next 20 months and see what job my wife lines up. Once our income increases, we may just say screw it and pay down aggressively.

In the end, it's all probably small peanuts, but I had to ask.

CryptoMarkets,Putting your money into Umbra to stake will currently earn you more interest annually than savings accounts in the following countries:,"**Shadowcash (SDC) has a 2% annual inflation rate on coin supply.**

...

- You can hold SDC in the Umbra wallet. When it is *'configured for staking'* it will passively earn you more SDC by verifying the SDC network.

- The rate at which you earn SDC is proportional to the amount of SDC you are staking relative to everyone else who is staking on the SDC network.

- If 100% of SDC owners were staking their coin via Umbra they would each make 2% more SDC per annum.

- As of writing only 36% of SDC is staking.

- Assuming the staking percentage remains unchanged, this means stakers currently could make 5.55% per annum staking.

This beats all but 12 countries in interest rate returns through using a traditional savings account.

- That beats 184 of the 196 countries globally.

Even using the 2% PA interest, staking SDC provides a better return than 165 other countries (assuming SDC was a savings bank).

In this scenario only 31 other countries provide savings accounts with an average annual interest rate that beats SDC.

- There is no cost to stake SDC.
- There is no minimum amount required to stake SDC.
- Staking SDC will work on any computer that the Umbra software can be downloaded onto and run on. Almost all computers &lt;8 years old will run it.

...

*http://www.deposits.org/savings-accounts.html*

...

This is the list of world savings rate. Notice that the minimum 2% PA return of SDC beats countries like the USA, Quatar, France, Austria, South Korea, Hong Kong.

...

- It significantly beats countries like China, Switzerland, Lithuania, Brunei, Japan, Macau, Luxembourg, Solomon Islands and Liechtenstein which offer less than 1% or even 0% savings interest rates.

- Notice how many of the countries in that second list are traditional stores of 'hidden wealth'. Well guess what; SDC (configured correctly) can provide complete anonymity in hiding your wealth too!

- Not only that but it's interest rates that beat these countries.

- SDC is currently priced at $1.70 as of writing. There are only 6.9 million SDC in circulation. That means it's cheap now but as demand rises the price of SDC will go up and so the price of SDC will go up.

- That means your true earnings annually in fiat could go up by much more if invested into SDC early!

- Yes, much more than 2% or 5%!

- At 2% inflation it would take 10 years for coin supply to reach a coin supply of only 8.3 million!

...

Realise that if demand outstrips supply, the potential for SDC to go up massively is profound (we are talking 1000% plus).

I hold SDC because I understand that if it is marketed correctly, i.e. honestly with awareness of the facts made, that people will take notice and buy into this incredible store of value.

I notice that SDC offers a better return to me than any savings bank in my country. I have acted accordingly at put a stake in it.

If you act now and spread awareness you and many other people you know could be a winner too!

...

So yes I did the analysis. I'd like to point out that Tim Smith's articles on Fintekneeks gave me the idea specifically this one:

http://fintekneeks.com/is-dash-a-threat-to-bitcoin/

He advocates DASH but I'd like to point out you would currently need $12350 minimum to buy the 1000 DASH required to setup their masternode and earn via staking.

...

- There is no minimum requirement to stake beyond 1 SDC for Shadowcash.

- This benefits the smaller investors greatly.

...

So think about it. Learn more about it. Invest in some SDC if you want to and tell your friends about it. Feel free to ask questions; *the community is very helpful.*

I'm a student in Denmark, and we have the opportunity to take student loans from the government which are basically meant to help make ends meet.

On top of this, my bank has given me a offer where I can keep around $2850 in my savings account there at 3% interest rate. I was thinking the rest could either maybe go into some kind of index fund or just be stored in a regular account since the interest I'd accumulate would still be quite low even if I just end up paying it back - if I do end up needing it, it'll be a very cheap loan and I could use it for either housing or starting a business in the future.

**wumbotarian**

Noah Smith is talking about the [Permanent Income Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_income_hypothesis) again

And pooping on Milton

**ocamlmycaml**

this post? https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-01-12/milton-friedman-s-cherished-theory-is-laid-to-rest

I don't understand Smith. That consumption pattern looks pretty darn smooth.

&gt;We see at least three fruitful avenues for future work. First, we find that families act during unemployment as if they have little liquid assets and little access to credit. But we see in the data that these families have room to borrow on their credit cards and from surveys that these cash-poor families have substantial illiquid assets in housing and retirement accounts (Angeletos et al. (2001), Kaplan and Violante (2014)). Why do families not use
these mechanisms to help smooth spending? And why do families not hold more of a liquid buffer stock against risks like unemployment and health shocks? Second, we documented a sharp drop in spending at the exhaustion of UI benefits which is hard to fit into a model with forward-looking agents who have rational expectations about job finding. Future work should try to understand which theories of unemployment and/or consumption best explain this drop.

**gorbachev**

damn they observe credit availability

that's so good

**wumbotarian**

My issue is that every time the PIH is brought up, Noah has to stress MILTON FRIEDMAN CAME UP WITH THIS AND HE WAS WRONG

This is my problem with Noah

**gorbachev**

it's a cool paper that deserves press

ganong + noel, cool cats apparently

and it does beat up the PIH pretty good

**integralds**

""The PIH is wrong"" is a strong claim imo

First, there are a couple of things one can mean by ""pih""

Second, PIH-like behavior is a salient feature of the data and important in modelling consumption dynamics. It just so happens that other stuff matters too, and largely for the reasons you'd expect.

Third, it's not clear what the ""alternate hypothesis"" is if we treat the PIH as the null.

If the alternate is ""hybrid PIH + other stuff,"" then is it really right to say that PIH is ""wrong""? Or is it simply incomplete?

""Wrong"" to me implies ""we throw the theory out entirely"" and nobody is suggesting that.

**roboczar**

http://www.thomaspalley.com/docs/research/Modigliani_RPIJEBO.pdf

**mrdannyocean**

I assume alternative to PIH is some sort of behavioral model

probably one where the slope of expected income matters more than the amount

so negative shocks happen, ie reducing consumption way more than PIH would predict in the face of losing UE benefits

**gorbachev**

anything other than a strong and literal form of the PIH

is a completely trivial claim

""but the PIH is basically true, people save at least a little out of income shocks!""

ok?

**integralds**

People save, like, two-thirds or more out of income shocks. This is particularly true if we treat durables expenditures as saving, which is what the theory implies. But then we get into a really boring semantic issue because you'll treat durables purchases as ""spending"" and I'll treat it as ""saving"" and we'll both be ""right"" for different purposes.

**gorbachev**

Speaking of empirical evidence on the topic

I read somewhere that there was a cool paper looking at the topic

that got written up by a journalist from bloomberg

*sticks out tongue* 

**integralds**

PIH is the single most tested proposition in macroeconomics.

Doubly so if you count all the finance papers on C-CAPM, which is just PIH from a different angle.

**roboczar** 

not even Post-Keynesians throw out PIH

they call it ""relative permanent income"" and add a bunch of behavioral stuff

**gorbachev**

I thought any literal PIH basically just gets rekt everywhere, looking at old people moving to soc security, looking at people blasting through tax refunds, and now at the discontinuity induced by the (pretty darn predictable) end of UI benefits

I mean, w/e, nobody is saying people dont consumption smooth

if the PIH is ""people consumption smooth a lot"" then it's right, if the PIH is ""people consumption smooth perfectly"" then it's wrong

I mean maybe the latter is an unfair standard

but then again, it's what people in the literature have tested before

and people at least seem to have thought about it that way before

and the former option is pretty trivial

so idk

**mrdannyocean**

does anybody disagree with the statement 'people definitely consumption smooth, but don't do so perfectly'

i can't really imagine that being controversial

and the only disagreements being 'how much'

**ashen**

is it possible to disagree with that?

**roboczar**

how much and why

**gorbachev**

I can imagine disagreement

econ old timers often stress to me that people took econ theory of that sort ultra literally in olden times

and that younguns have implicitly observed behavioral on a deep level so much so that we don't notice how much we've accepted it

**say_wot_again**

We don't observe the ﻿⁠monetarist﻿⁠ behavioral water we swim in.

To paraphrase Nick Rowe and hopefully irk integralds and please besttrousers.

**mrdannyocean**

to quote david foster wallace, ""[What the hell is water?](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/sep/20/fiction)""

**integralds**

literal anything basically falls to pieces when you confront it with data.

Also it should be noted that Friedman himself didn't believe in the PIH, if we're defining PIH as ""people perfectly smooth their entire lifetime income stream""

That's a much later development. Friedman's idea of ""permanent income"" isn't ""the expected discounted value of all future income,"" it's closer to ""your forecast of what your personal income stream will look like over the next 5-10 years.""

The main reason I'm being nitpicky is that NS is kinda slamming Friedman for an idea that isn't really his.

**gorbachev**

that seems like a fair criticism (of Noah)

**geerussell**

Is it really just semantics to highlight the difference between holding money and buying durables?

**integralds**

PIH says you smooth the consumption of nondurables.

Durable goods provide a flow of services. Think dishwasher or washing machine.

So if you get a stimulus refund check and spend it on a washing machine, you're still following PIH-like behavior, but you're also ""spending"" or ""stimulating"" or whatever, as the policymaker presumably intends.

**geerussell**

Gotcha

**say_wot_again**

Investment vs consumption, basically.

**integralds**

Right.

Also, depending on your time frame, lots of things are durable. Clothes are NIPA-classified as nondurables, but they last me several years. Theory ahead of measurement? :)

**roboczar**

you're a guy. my wife cycles through new clothes several times a year

Veblen, etc

Palley actually added a ""keeping up with the joneses"" behavioral function to the PIH

to account for status spending

**mrdannyocean**

&gt;Veblen, etc

Appropos of nothing, *Theory of the Leisure Class*  is about 3 feet from my head right now

**integralds**

There are a couple of ways to do that, yeah. And I have some sympathy for the idea.

**ponderay**

I don't know why you guys think consumption smoothing is intuitive most non-econers think it's pretty weird

**say_wot_again**

Because we're econs.

**integralds**

Govt gives you a windfall of $1200. Do you spend $1200 on whiskey now or space it out, spending $100 on whiskey each month for the next twelve months?

**roboczar**

integralds depends on whether you're poor or not

**gorbachev**

it's just a question of framing

everyone knows they'll save a little from a windfall

framing in terms of a windfall not affecting present consumption except through a permanent income channel will spook um tho

**ashen**

&gt;everyone knows they'll save a little from a windfall

not if they've got pressing debt.  or is that saving in this case?

**ponderay**

Borrowing is the one most people don't seem to get

**gorbachev**

yeah, good point on borrowing being the case people dont get

there is sort of a strong asymmetry here

like, the PIH definitely doesn't do well in the face of debt aversion and all that

**say_wot_again**

roboczar, does it depend on whether you're poor or whether you're credit constrained?

**roboczar**

&gt;[Campbell and Mankiw \(1989\)](http://www.nber.org/chapters/c10965.pdf) estimate that up to one half of all households are of
the liquidity constrained, Keynesian-type, with the other half being typical life
cycle/permanent income consumers i.e. wealth constrained. This ratio of course
would differ across countries with variations being dependent, amongst other
things, on the degree of liberalisation of domestic financial markets. In fact, in
their research Campbell and Mankiw provide estimates of the consumption share
of such households in 6 countries with the estimates lying in the range 0.2 –0.6
and with their explanation for the cross-country differences linked to the relative
development of their respective credit markets.

**gorbachev**

I feel like taking credit constraints to the PIH is almost cheating

of course there are credit constraints, I think the neato deviations are behavioral

**roboczar**

yeah, that's why you can't have PIH without behavioral imo. People who are income and/or credit constrained do unexpected things.

like not actually consumption smooth very well, if at all

&gt;The first, a study by [Venti and Wise \(1993\)](http://www.nber.org/papers/w4600) 
 looks at the savings behaviour of
people in anticipation of retirement. This type of study provides valuable
empirical information regarding the extent to which people do forward planning
in order to smooth out the inevitable decline in their future employment income.
The results of this research appear to suggest, however, that few individuals have
planning horizons which stretch over their lifetime, with most giving little
consideration to the question of saving for retirement until their 40s. In addition,
while saving may start at that time, the reality is that for many their savings ratio
is vastly inadequate given normal retirement durations, with many in fact relying
almost exclusively on State support.

**mrdannyocean**

it's definitely a (stylized) fact that a depressingly small number of people save enough for retirement

**integralds**

Are we counting social security into those calculations? I assume we are.

**gorbachev**

yeah. When people get soc security, their C changes a bunch

**ocamlmycaml**

So what's our core question

Does the PIH hold empirically / what does it mean to hold empirically?

Using Noah's post as a launching point of discussion

**besttrousers**

i'm just trying to figure out what wumbotarian's objection to Noah Smith’s article is

**wumbotarian** 

Noah would be a great communicator but he mixes politics all the time

**mrdannyocean**

is noah's article assuming a strong PIH?

seems silly to label the PIH dead unless you think it's an all-or-nothing thing

true value of (propensity to smooth consumption) is somewhere between 0 and 1, debate is just about where

**integralds**

&gt;And Milton Friedman was wrong about the permanent income hypothesis.

Yeah I don't need this aneurysm right now.

Friedman: The MPC out of current income is probably about 0.3.

After another fifty years of research: the MPC out of current income is about 0.3.

**integralds**

Here's where I'm of two minds.
The PIH that Noah criticises in his article is the plain-vanilla intertemporal consumer optimization plan. That's all fine and well to criticize, but it's somewhat divorced from the original PIH that Friedman talked about in his book.

On the one hand, it's unfair to attribute to Friedman the theories of people other than Friedman. In a similar vein, it'd be unfair to criticize Keynes on the basis of Hicksean IS-LM.
On the other, I understand that ""Friedman is wrong"" generates clicks and might be ""close enough"" for the person who isn't an economist.

**gorbachev**

isnt a flat MPC out of current income strongly inconsistent with a claim like ""consumption is a function of lifetime, not transient, income""

**mrregmonkey**

Yeah IIRC permenant income hypothesis explains 30%-50% of consumption and old keynesian style consumption explains the rest

**roboczar**

thank mankiw

**Ponderay**

What does it mean to explain only 50% of the consumption?

Is it a variance decomposition?

**roboczar**

http://scholar.harvard.edu/mankiw/publications/permanent-income-current-income-and-consumption

&gt;This article reexamines the consistency of the permanent-income hypothesis with aggregate postwar U.S. data. The permanent-income hypothesis is nested within a more general model in which a fraction of income accrues to individuals who consume their current income rather than their permanent income. This fraction is estimated to be about 50%, indicating a substantial departure from the permanent-income hypothesis. Our results cannot be easily explained by time aggregation or small-sample bias, by changes in the real interest rate, or by nonseparabilities in the utility function of consumers.

**gorbachev**

What does it mean for the PIH to explain 50% of consumption

isn't the permanent income hypothesis that consumption out of permanent income explains 100% of consumption?

isn't an alternative formulation of the PIH that doesn't explain 100% boil down to a trivial statement?

like, if it isn't 100% or at least close to 100%, is the PIH anything other than a labeling of an obvious intuition?

**say_wot_again**

Yeah, how is 50% PIH different than C = a+0.5Y?

**roboczar**

it also doesn't take into account that people don't consumption smooth well at all. they're bad at it.

imo it's just a trivial intuition that doesn't tell the whole story anyway

**gorbachev**

my personal suspicion is that the PIH is on the list of things like ricardian equivalence that nobody really defends but which people will use to attack other ideas

by people I mean, those not yet wised up to behavioral

also credit constraints defs are bad news for the pih

**ponderay**

I forget but PIH relies on complete markets right?

I don't see a lot of people defending complete markets

isn't that why heterogenous agent macro is a thing?

**gorbachev**

I don't see a lot of people defending ricardian equivalence, but that doesn't mean I don't see people haranguing about it at seminars for some reason!

**roboczar**

**roboczar**

wumbo is going to have an aneurysm

that's why he's not here answering, he's ded

**ponderay**

it seems like a reasonable article to me

**integralds**

Y'all are really bad at defining what it means to reject a theory.

Let's use a really simple case. The Bob Hall version of the PIH is ""the FOC that comes out of a consumer maximizing a quadratic utility function subject to a sequence of budget constraints."" Now there's a lot in there to dislike, but it'll make the math easier and illustrate my point.

The operational Hall PIH is that the FOC is: C(t) = E[C(t+1)|t]. Consumption is a random walk, conditional on period-t information.

Now, the really cool thing is that this FOC comes with its own estimating equation.
We can rewrite it as, C(t) = C(t+1) + e(t+1), where e(t+1) is orthogonal to anything known at time t or earlier.

If you recall your econometrics, this is exactly what we need to run basic OLS! Huzzah!

So we should be able to regress the change in consumption on ﻿⁠⁠⁠anything,﻿⁠⁠⁠ and the coef should be insignificant. Okay. Pause.

So I reg (change in consumption) on (stuff today)

Suppose that (stuff) is statistically significant!  Is the Hall version of the PIH now wrong? Think carefully.

**roboczar**

i don't think anyone's saying it's wrong, just incomplete and useful only in circumscribed cases

**integralds**

Noah certainly is (saying it's wrong): ""And Milton Friedman was wrong about the permanent income hypothesis.""

Back to the point.

If (stuff) is significant, do we throw away the theory? No! We we modify it to take into account (stuff).

Here is a case where we can ﻿⁠⁠⁠reject﻿⁠⁠⁠ a theory with some confidence:

1. Build a hybrid model that takes in various theories as polar cases

2. Now run your regressions

If you take Theory X as the null, and you reject the null, then you have no guidance on either (1) how badly Theory X failed, or on what theories Y should replace it.

Now the Campbell-Mankiw papers are pretty crappy by today's standards. But they do have one nice feature, in that they nest ""C=a+bY"" and ""C=E[C(t+1)]"" as special cases, so we can meaningfully figure out where between those extremes we lie.

But if we write a model where it's something like a\*(Keynes) + (1-a)\*(PIH), and the estimate of a is basically 1, then yeah we can ""put the PIH to rest."" Most hybrid tests on aggregate data are like 50/50 PIH or 70/30 PIH.

I'm not quite as familiar with the microdata studies, it's been a few years.

As an example of some nice microdata using cleanish identification, we have
http://japarker.scripts.mit.edu/docs/PSJM2013.pdf

12-30% of a one-time tax rebate was spent on nondurables, about 50% was spent on durables, and the remainder wasn't spent on consumption. Hey, that's pretty good for PIH. It's not like the MPC on nondurables is 80% or something.

This pattern occurs over and over.

**integralds**

My basic point is that if the hardcore PIH says ""MPC out of transitory payments is close to zero,"" and MPC is actually like 20%, it's a bit silly to say that the theory is ""dead and buried"" especially when the prevailing wisdom was that MPC out of transitory payments is 70%.

One more point, so you guys don't think I'm weasling. It is entirely possible for a theory to just suck.

If we tested a careful version PIH and the coefficients went in the wrong way, and all the coefficients that the PIH told us would be significant were insignificant, and the fit sucked, then yeah let's throw it in the trash bin. But that's not what we observe.

**roboczar**

i'm more interested in how it works when combined with Modigliani's [Lifecycle Consumption Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-cycle_hypothesis)

plus behavioral

PIH on its own doesn't do a great job despite being trivially true

**integralds**

PIH and LCH are fairly comparable. LCH just adapts it to the setting where there are finite lifetimes with retirement, which is an eminently sensible thing to do.

Borrow young, save in middle age, draw down savings in old age

Die with assets=0 if you don't care about your kids

**roboczar**

except we're bad at that due to cognitive bias, hence behavioral

i'm trying to figure out if that's the message Noah is trying to send, that for PIH to work well, you have to do all this other stuff and it starts to not look like the PIH anymore

personalfinance,Climb out of debt with income tax?,"Ok so first off I'm 24 making around 30k+ a year as a first/second year Welder in CT. So on a day to day basis I am not drowning in debt to where I cannot enjoy things. I am more or less just looking on advice on how to use this in the best way.

The bills.
Credit cards $1400
Student loan $1800
Medical bills $300

The tax refund:
Fed $1060
State $1800

Now at this point in my life I just recently broke up with a girlfriend of 6 years, and moved back in with my parents. So really the majority of my bills have opened up. Do I just take my tax refund and pay off as much of the debt as I can, or do I set some aside and pay it off month by month to continue to build positive credit marks? Should I put it all aside and pay off month by month and use it as a ""rainy day fund"" , I am unsure how to go about this and what would be best any advice is appreciated!

personalfinance,Settling Credit Card Debt through a Debt Relief Program,"I'm looking for some advice/stories of people with experience with debt relief programs. I've done some research and I can't seem to find anything alarming, but still have a tiny bit of skepticism. 

I'm a single mom of two toddlers, and racked up a ton of credit card debt (About 30K total, counting what I already had before the split) when their dad and I separated. A lot of it was just trying live off of credit cards while we got back on our feet, but a big part of it was just irresponsible spending trying to avoid dealing with my feelings. I stopped spending, but the damage is done, and now my minimum payments per month, have reached over $1,000 per month. I am REALLY struggling to make payments, and so much of it is going to interest that I'm not even making a dent in what I owe. 

I finally looked into the debt relief programs and have talked to a few agencies which all seem to offer pretty much the same type of help. They can settle all my debt, I pay a fee incorporated into my monthly payments (the fee is a little high, but still WAY less than what I would end up paying with this debt for the next 15 yrs), my credit will be affected (which it was already gotten pretty low from crazy high credit-to-debt ratio, and missed payments, so it will do almost nothing to my credit), and I can be debt free in about 3-5 years depending how much I pay per month on the settlements. 

I haven't really found a lot of negative behind doing this and in fact have found positive reviews, but I want to make sure this is the best option for my situation. I really don't want to file for bankruptcy, and with my credit, consolidation loans would still have a high interest rate. I know that some of my settled credit card debt may be taxable, so I'll have to research/prepare for that, but I just want to make sure that this is the best option, and that I'm not overlooking something else.

Bitcoin,"A brief explanation on 'what is money supply' , the Fed , and how to stabilize a national currency.","Money is a unit of measure. The collective sum of all US dollars is the internationally agreed upon collective worth of the United States.

The worth of the United States is calculated by:

Productivity (innovation, structure) x Populace (immigration, birth) + Natural Rights (oil, landscape) + Historic value (The Louvre, 'oligarchs')

That is the formula. It's not much more complicated than that. Time to time, it is necessary to 'reappraise' a Nation.

For example, the 'worth' of Saudi Arabia is substantial, but only because of the selling off of previous oil reserves. If the oil reserves dry up, then the value declines to $0. More explicitly, the Saudi 'money supply', on the international scale naturally increases as the nation sells oil to other nations, but should someone want to 'buy' Saudi Arabia, the 'Historic Value' (of sold oil) would hold no value, as it provides no future benefit to a new buyer. However, the value remains so long as the 'oligarchs' (or whatever) can retain power, international consistency.

Essentially it's like selling off a piece of your home at a time, while fearing a reappraisal by the bank.

In parenthesis is put common factors that change that value. For example, a nation who doubles in population while maintain consistent productivity effectively doubles in value. A nation with a consistent population but increases production (via innovation, generally), likewise increases in value.

Some alterations are unsustainable, while others hold worth. For example, the Louvre or the scenery of the Alps, will always retain 'some sort of value', while ultimately residing within a single nation. This sort of value is more like 'in case of bankruptcy', but even if no one lived in Switzerland but 1 man, it would be hard to suggest his control over the Alps presents an unsustainable economic value - That said this is rather nebulous and hard to define, and changes little after the establishment of a nation, unless the resource is plundered (oil extraction, pollution, fire, etc).

Generally speaking, nations increase in value at a rate of approximately 5% (or more) on the annual basis. That is just a loose approximation of historic trends. The primary factor, generally, is the rate of innovation. For example, it's 'more possible' for '3rd world Nigerians' to go from making $1 per hour in a sweat shop, to $30 per hour as IT support, than it is for Americans to have 30 children per household. Likewise, innovation is more beneficial to the populace on the individual level, as it increases their well being, in so much as the gains of productivity are passed down to wage earners.

Put simply, the value of a nation could be described as $1 per person + fair value of current assets, if all peoples were similarly productive, and technology was stagnant.

The Fed is a private (internationally controlled, most like) organization that appraises the value of the United States, time to time. Generally speaking the value of the US goes up about $800 Bil annually, from immigration, new birth, and innovation.

The Fed (Gov) then has the option on how to inject the $800 Bil into the economy. For example, they could spend $800 Bil repairing infrastructure, without spending a dollar in tax, or likewise pay off individual debts, or simply issue a bonus check of $2,700 per person to everyone in the US annually.

This is effectively 'your share' of business profits, or a tax paid without any money transferred.

However, the Fed can also give the money to the international corporations, via the interest rates. This is more complex, depending on how you perceive the Fed, however if you assume that the 'banks' (or big business) will always get bailed out by the government, then effectively their rate of bankruptcy is a 'tax' on the tax payer.

For simplicity, let's say the rate of default is 5%, annualized. Therefore, the Fed should charge the banks a rate of interest at 5%, to create stability.

Historically, the Fed has charged rates of up to 14%, but over the last decade or so, less than 1%. Ignoring geopolitical implications, the Fed is effectively asserting that the banks will go bankrupt '1 in 100 years' vs '1 in 7 years', during other periods of time.

This (seemingly) arbitrary decision (1 in 100 vs 1 in 7), creates ripples within the economy. A low interests rates causes big corp to grow, subsidized by the tax payer, while excessive interest is effectively a hidden tax on big corp, subsidizing the citizen - Too much interest, and big corp simply moves to a new lender nation.

Many speculate that the Fed utilizes their powers over money supply to influence political elections, rather than as an accounting assessment. There is no question what so ever that the Fed is designed to be the Nations financial liaison to the International wealth of the world. Each nation must have 'something' in place to establish a valuation, translated into a common unit of measure, accepted on the global scale.

I want to clarify briefly that this is not 'bitcoin', or rather is different than bitcoin. The 'unit of measure' is commonly 'production'. For example, a nation that produces 10 cars vs 5 cars, has double the value. The physical (intellectual) goods produced create the value. Bitcoin is merely a store of value, and is not designed to be a unit of measure.

For example, if you build a house and secure a loan from a bank, you (plus the bank) have effectively 'created the value' of the new house (your work + appraisal). With bitcoin (or gold, or other fixed unit), you must remove (transfer) the money away from something else of value into the home prior to receiving benefit.

Put another way, if you have 1 unit of measure and 1 home, and then build 4 more homes, then each home is now worth 0.2 units of measure, where as with an appraisal or banking system, you would add 4 units to account for the new homes, so that each retain a value of 1.

The way banks lend you money individually is a kin to the way the international (or gov, depending on perspective) lend money to the  banks (or big corp), nationally. If you ever get a loan from a bank 0% interest in your life, please let me know ;)

To, essentially, stabilize money supply you'd need to take the following steps:

1) Charge a rate of interest appropriate to the level of risk

2) Add 1 unit of measure per new person added to the system

3) Return a rate of interest appropriate to the level of advance

4) Periodically reappraise the rights of nature, historical works, and historical values, or to simply not allow privatize (national) ownership of nature, history, or hereditary wealth.

While the actual process of doing this is more complex than this 300 word essay, or what have you, that is the general idea and framework you are shooting for.

Each revolution, stimulated by economy, is effectively a reappraisal. Most commonly, wealth gets passed down through hereditary means to persons that provide insufficient value for the amount of wealth assumed, or percent of national wealth appropriated.

This is partly because children of wealth are rarely as successful as the children of who became wealthy in a fight to escape poverty. Effectively the velocity of wealth creation, or productivity, is unmatched in the hereditary successor.

That is the most common reason for social strife, however other factors are at play as well. For example the collapse of the Venezuelan economy is largely unrelated to hereditary wealth transfer, but a reappraisal of a nation in which the primary source of valuation (oil) provided no residual value, or had fully depreciated, however you want to say. Typically this goes on about once every 50 years.

And there you have a better understanding of finance, economy, government, and society than 99% of people world wide. Was that so hard to understand? For what reason do they not teach this in schools?

For that, we may never know.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,What to do with extra income,"I'll start off by saying that I am in a rare, and particularly good financial situation for someone my age. I'm currently 25 (almost 26) yrs old. I bought my house ($223,500) with 5% down when I was 23, and I have had roommates helping pay my mortgage since then. I have since refinanced and reduced my mortgage to a 20 yr mortgage, my payment after taxes is $1,727.51 with a 3.875% interest rate. I have 3 roommates generating $475 in monthly income totaling $1,425/mo, then we split utilities 4 ways. I have $201,847 deductible remaining on my mortgage before it's paid off (about 19 years at my current interest rate/ payment). Additionally I am a Mechanical Field Engineer, and I am blessed to have a very good paying job for a great small company in my area and my salary is $70,000/yr (1,836.37 paid twice/ month). I deposit 4% into my 401k ($102.08/ pay check) which is my companies maximum base match (100%), so I am depositing a total of $408.32/ month into my 401k, which is 100% vested. My company also gives me a yearly bonus deposited into my 401k totaling about $7,000/yr. I currently have $14k in my 401k retirement account (which is fully vested), $18.5k in a rewards checking account, which pays me 3.01% interest on the first $10k as long as I remember to use my debit card frequently enough. I have an additional $29k in a money market account which pays .3% interest on the money (thru the same credit union). I have $359/ month in student loans, but my state offers a tax rebate which pays me $4,000/ year in tax rebates (deducted from my student loan payments) simply for living here and paying my student loans. They're fixed rate and will not be increasing in interest. As long as I do not move out of state, I do not see any benefit in paying these off in advance. I spend about $1,100/ month on my credit card, but I pay it off every month and don't have any actual debt accumulated on it. I already own a car ($10k value), and a motorcycle ($7k value) which I do not have any loans on. I also have a company car, which I am allowed to use for personal use, so both of these vehicles are more ""luxury"" expenses for me (I'm into auto-racing, mainly autocross). As you can tell, I have some excess income at the end of every month. I am not sure what to do with it. 

I do not have any inheritance lined up for the future, and I am realistic that I will likely have to take car of my parents as they get older as they haven't saved for retirement, and they have no money or assets to speak of. I'm not sure if I should keep saving my money so that I can invest it in something like an apartment building after I get enough for 20% down, increase my 401k contribution, or invest privately in stocks (I have no experience in this, and am very timid about the idea of investing in them because of this). I like the idea of acquiring more real estate, but I don't have enough money saved up yet to buy it, and I don't really want to completely drain my bank account to get it. I also forsee that it could be a PITA to be a landlord to a multi-unit property, although I am pretty handy and can do a lot of work myself.

I also have an interest in cars and motorcycles, and have looked into doing some car ""flipping"" (buying and selling) to generate a little more income, and because it's an interest of mine, but I don't like the idea of making money off those who are less fortunate than me, and I don't want to be a car dealer.

Also, the company I work for is very young, and the future for it is uncertain, so I would like to have some type of safety net in case it ever goes under. (my college professor told me you should have a safety net equal to 1/2 your yearly income saved up in case of emergency).

This all being said, what would you do with your money if you were me? I'm thinking I should keep saving my money until I can comfortably put 20% down on a piece of real-estate that will generate me monthly income after the mortgage and taxes are paid (I like the idea of commercial real-estate, but again, that's more expensive and will take years for me to save up enough for 20% down). My ultimate goal is to become financially independent, so that I can generate enough income without going to an employer daily. I've also had interest in starting my own business at some point in the future, but I have not figured out what yet.",finance

Private debt: 2 loans, one for 25K and one for 28K through AES.  

Federal debt: around 50k that I pay 300 on per month

Federal Loans: ~31K at interest rates between 3.2-6.55% currently paying 250/month , with a rising payment every 2 years to be payed off in 10.

Private loans: ~29K @ 3.9% paying off at $230/month, will increase contribution with increases in salary, hopefully done in 9-10 years

Car Loan: ~19K @ 3.4% paying off at $330/month for 5-6 years. This was partially a necessary expense as I drive 80 total miles/day for work and getting 15-20 mpg with an old car wasn't going to cut it. New car gets 35-42 mpg.

Monthly housing expenses come to 730/month, and after the month is over I have $500-$600 going into savings(reached emergency fund for 3 months)

Of course I take the occasional vacation, buy football tickets, go out to eat on occasion, and spend~50-100/month on things I want but dont necessarily need. I also have a separate Roth IRA that I try and contribute 2K/year, and charitable givings come to 500/year. Health insurance through work at 120/month(includes dental and vision)

Also, regarding MyFedLoan, When I make my monthly contribution, rather than paying just the interest off on all 6 individual loans, then applying the rest to my highest-interest loan, it spreads it out based on amount of the loans left. How can I change this so that my highest-interest loan is getting the principal paid off first, after interest on all other loans has been paid?

stocks,How to evaluate amazon?,"I am having some problem defining my exit strategy for growth stocks like amazon.

Here are my not so professional analysis. 

I am looking for some critique.

a. I don't think aws will continue its high growth trajectory.

* i. google app engine, microsoft azure's entry along with digital ocean and heroku's existence is likely to drive the price down for amazon's aws service.

* ii. it is not clear what is the next big thing for the tech industry after mobile, and web app. Especially when alot of tech unicorns have no clear monetization method (pinterest, quora, medium, twitter...etc). A new market (related to server utilization) is necessary for amazon aws's growth (internet of things? self driving car? automation revolution?)

* iii. I have seen some analysis relating the tech boom with low interest rate and I am curious if the tech sector will continue to do well under an interest hike from the fed.

b.    The growth of amazon is related to brick and mortar store's current revenue and profit. 

* i. if amazon is on track to replace brick and mortar store, we can probably extrapolate its growth trajectory using big retailer's sale data.

c. The pe ratio will revert to a more modest number after amazon have saturated brick and mortar store (assuming no new market is explored eg. streaming, aws growth, grocery automation like amazon go, logistic automation like self driving truck) . Perhaps a pe ratio of 20 ~ 40. To give some reference under the current price  of 817 with a pe of 30, the stock price will be around 130.


Currently my exit strategy is revolving around finding that approximate point of market saturation. The main fear that I have is that assumption c will become true, and I will loose 84% of my investment.

Can someone critique my analysis?

personalfinance,"[22] I need to move out, but I'm pretty clueless about how afford it.","So long story short: I'm living in a pretty rough situation where my parents (both N-Parents in their own ways) micro-manage everything about me (money, free time, etc.), and I'm at a point that I really need to leave for my emotional health and the possibility of a decent future. 

I'm 22. In a very basic minimum wage job for a South Eastern chain store (grocery store cashier) with a semester of community college under my belt. Small town without really any rentals (or apartments at all for that matter) that are a) in my price range and b) close enough to any commercial areas that would allow me to work without a vehicle. 

I have no credit cards, debt whatsoever, credit at all, and nothing substantial in savings (I think its currently like $8.00). At least half of my paycheck each week goes towards rent, and what's remaining is used up pretty quickly for any other expenses I have for that week (gas, phone, groceries, my share of the internet, toiletries, or whatever my parents can come up with to charge me). At the end of the week I try to move whatever I have left into savings, but unfortunately its next to nothing.

I'm looking at an estimate of about $800.00, possibly less, from federal taxes this year. My parents already have plans for what I'm to do with it, but I can usually keep mum about it for a few weeks. Though I can't ""hide it"" forever. I've also taken on the two tax allowances that I qualify for on my paycheck in order to get that little extra right now in hopes that if I owe anything next year I'll be in a better place. 

Right now its looks like I'd be moving to the closest ""big city"" as my vehicle and everything (even my phone bill) are under my parents' names. If I decided that I want to move out on my tax refund Ideally it would be out of the state to one of the cities I have friends that are willing to help me out temporarily in (Austin, Sacramento, Seattle, Portland, Savannah), but I also know they are high cost of living areas. They all have their pros and cons about why I could move to each one, but the biggest problem boils down to money.

No one has ever told me how to save, budget, or any of the things that would go into moving. I had to figure out how to do my own taxes, and while I've talked to my banker(s) about it they're suggestions tend to boil down to either apply for a loan, a credit card, or something of the sort (my bank operates out of the grocery store I work at so I don't really expect a lot out of them). I also know that I'm running on a bit, but I'm also trying to get out all the information that might be useful. 

Since what I'm asking is if there are people that understand money and planning more than me that could offer some advice. Like where good places to start would be if I wanted to move very quickly (within the next few months), advice how to make the most of what little I'm saving, and anything that is probably just plain common sense that I'm missing out on. 

I know I'm probably being very financially unwise wanting to do this, but, for lack of better phrasing, I'm running out of options. I need to have some semblance of a life, and my parents are pretty much trying to insure I have nothing/no one but what they want for me.",finance
personalfinance,"(US) - Tax Advice Needed - From Single Filer to Head of Household, Single Earner","Hello all, 2016 was a pretty busy year for me and my new family. I wanted to bring this up in the hopes I could get more of a refund this year, and hopefully refile more accurately next year to get bigger paychecks and no refund.  

Apologies for the below structure, I'm just trying to get it all down on paper.
  
Currently since I am the only earner, I will qualify for the 25% bracket in the ""head of household""  AGI estimating to be eighty something.
  

I bought a house end of 2015, so this was the first year in the house. its a 30 year fixed mortgage at 3.875%.  I put 20% down so I do not have PMI.  

* $9,0,10.32 paid from mortgage interest during 2016
* Property Taxes paid on City and county level, but I assume I can't get any deductions from that?
  


In April I got married to my long-term girlfriend, and in August we had a healthy baby boy.  

* Hospital bills after insurance are in the $2,000 range, but I am on a payment plan of $150 / month so i don't have to use my emergency fund if not absolutely needed. If it would be better for taxes, I could theoretically pay all now.
* I pay my parents to take care of my son twice a week when my wife is going to school

My Wife still attends school and I paid for her classes 100%, 

* which was about $12,000 out of pocket
* I only had to pay around $500 out of pocket for her previous student loans before they went back to remission
* Is there any way I can use this amount for any sort of deductions?
 

I sold 2 cars, and bought 2 cars. 1 car I bought was from a family friend via credit union who I financed with (100% financed over 2 years, currently owe $3600), and 1 car I bought and put half down, and owe about $17k on that.

* I think now you pay the sales taxes upfront on the car, so should I be able to deduct that?
 
   

* I spent $1100 to get a hazardous tree out of my yard, and about another $400 on random yard upkeep.

* I've put in $18,000 for the year towards my 401k, and $5,500 towards my Roth IRA.

Can't remember anything else right now, but would appreciate any tips on how I can get the most deductions this year, money is very tight for us and would like to start the year off with some padding.

Thanks

I make about 90K/year and my monthly expenses are around 1500/month (rent, utilities, cell phone, but this does not include stuff like food and gas).  This past year I was unable to save very much just due to moving and taking time off work, etc, but I think this upcoming year, I should theoretically be able to save at least $1000/month.  Besides my mortgage, I have 0 debt.  Below is a breakdown of my assets.  

House: paid 220k in 2013 with a 15yr mortgage; currently pay 1200 for mortgage/property tax/insurance; and I am renting it out for that amount (1200/month).  I've started putting $100 more a month towards principal just to get it paid off a little earlier.

Cars: I own two vehicles, both paid off; yearly insurance around 1200 combined cost. Both run great.

401k: I have two old 401ks, one with 10k and one with 27k.  My current 401k has about 4k in it (I changed jobs this past year).  I recently upped my contribution from 8% to 12%. 

Cash: 26K in WellsFargo savings account; it's a ""Preferred Member Account"" meaning my checking account is free, but I only make $1/month in interest on the savings account.  35k in Golden 1 savings account making $4.50/month interest.

I think I'd keep my $26k savings as an emergency fund, and then invest the $35k.  Or should I keep more of my savings with Golden 1 since I get a better interest rate?  I was initially thinking of putting some of that $35k into CDs with a Laddering strategy, but maybe I should do something else?  Buy index funds?  Also, should I get a financial planner?  If so, given my situation, what should I look for in a financial planner?

investing,How to short UK house prices/real estate,"My situation is that I'm looking to buy a house at the moment but am concerned that UK house prices are currently overblown. 

It's a bit of a strange situation, but this particular house is a kind of ""now or never"" type affair, so waiting for house prices to fall and then buying is not really possible, and overall I'm not convinced that house prices will fall anyway, I just want to hedge some of the risk that buying an expensive house would foist upon me.

So, assuming I buy this house, I'm wondering how best to hedge this risk, and have thought of a few things:

1. Short the housing index. The problem with this is that I don't know of a mechanism to do this. If I could find a CFD/spread betting provider that offers this as an index or ETF it would be easy, but I don't know of any that do currently.

2. Short individual stocks that are correlated with house prices, e.g. housebuilders, with a CFD/spread betting provider. The problem with this is that the correlation isn't that strong, and my fortunes would be intertwined with the idiosyncratic fortunes of a rather slim portfolio of housebuilders.

3. Buy an inverse ETF that's inversely correlated with house prices. The problem here is that inverse ETFs are not a good long term option for what I want (http://monevator.com/short-etf-maths/) and I can't find one anyway.

4. Short gilts on the assumption that if interest rates go up then house prices will fall. I have no idea if this would play out in reality!

I have a second credit card, the Amazon rewards visa, also through Chase. That one has a $5000 limit, which is about to be maxed.

- I'm potentially going to be unemployed in May. (Looking for work, but of course that might not pan out quick enough). So I have been putting expenses onto that Amazon card, while putting the money I'd normally be putting towards the bills, into my savings.

- I know most, if not all, of you are going to bawk at that. My thinking is; if I can put cash into my savings, while putting some expenses on credit, I can save a few months worth of expenses. (this way even if I become unemployed, I can still pay my normal bills for that long, including the Amazon card.)

However, I just got my W2, and I'm probably going to owe a little over $1200 this year. I have my tax allowances set to 10 (I know, more bawking), so that I have no federal income tax taken out of my paychecks (I live in FL, so no state tax) because I honestly needed the extra ~$150 in my weekly check.

- Last year, when I did my taxes - after claiming my son and filing as head of house hold - I still got $900 back (instead of close to $4500 the year before when claiming him while having my allowances set to 0 to have the most taken out of my check).

- To me, that seemed fine, I was keeping the extra in my paycheck, and just wasn't getting as much back at the beginning of the year.

However this year was different for some reason, and now I'm gonna owe $1200 that I wasn't prepared for.

I have like.. $1600 saved up in preparation for having $532/month in expenses that I still have to pay if/when I'm unemployed.

I have a Capital One card that I've never used, with a $3000 limit.

- Now I'm in a position where I either use my savings to pay off the $1200 taxes, and have not a whole lot left to keep myself afloat if I lose my income. ***Or*** I use my capital one card to pay off the taxes and just have a 3rd credit card with a balance that I can't pay off except the minimum. (The amazon card is basically maxed as it is so I don't have room there.)

personalfinance,What are your time horizons for determining investment options (e.g. CDs vs. bonds vs. stocks vs. etc.)?,"Specifically, if you have a sum of money and you know generally when you want to have access to it, what are your rules of thumb for determining the appropriate investment strategy.

As an example, we are receiving ~$25,000 for our wedding. However, we plan on paying for the wedding by ourselves, and saving that lump sum of money for a down payment on a house. We won't settle down in a permanent area for at least 5-10 years, and will be relocating every 2-3 years until then. We'd like to invest that money in the meantime, but obviously can't risk too big of a downturn in the market. But it also seems long enough that a CD really isn't worth it (plus their interest rates aren't much better than an online savings account).

My proposed strategy: I currently invest through Vanguard. I've thought about keeping $5,000 in a money market account, invest 7,000 in a bond index fund (VBMFX), 10,000 in relatively safe stock index fund (VTSAX), and then put 3,000 in a somewhat riskier stock index fund (VIMSX). 

All dividends would not be reinvested, but deposited in a money market account. We'll have an idea of when we'll be able to buy a house at least 1-2 years ahead of time. Also, if there was a downturn in the market when we go to buy house, this strategy would hopefully still have enough cash on hand that it wouldn't be difficult for us to aggressively save to have enough for a down payment. We would then just keep the investment is where it is for the long haul; however, it would mean that year or two that we wouldn't be contributing fully to our retirement accounts.

What do you all think? Is that too risky for that time frame? Not risky enough? Anything I'm not considering?

* I am assuming that my monthly expenses are ~$3,000; this is intentionally overestimated and accounts for rent, utilities, internet, car insurance, groceries, etc. per month 
* I have no background in finance/economics/business, so everything I am saying or doing can very well be flat out wrong...

&amp;nbsp;

I've been playing around with my budget (or what I expect to be my budget) for a little while now to try to determine the ""optimal"" course of action to maximize what I'm calling my total savings: 401(k) savings + ""disposable income"" savings (I'm calling ""disposable income"" basically any net income that doesn't go toward bills).  I've been testing different combinations of 401(k) contribution and monthly student loan payment to see what results in the maximized total savings over different periods of time.   

&amp;nbsp;

*For example*, if I pay $1,000/mo to the student loan, it would take approximately 20 months to pay off the loan; therefore, what can my total savings be over a 1/5/10 year period if I contribute x% to my 401(k) during that 20 month period and then maximize the 401(k) contribution after that period? 

&amp;nbsp;

I'm assuming that everything stays constant over the time period (e.g. salary, monthly expenses, etc.) except for the monthly loan payment going from $y to $0 and the 401(k) going from x% to MAX% once the loan is finished.  I'm not factoring in changing loan amounts (e.g. snowball repayment) or changing 401(k) contributions; I'm looking more at a ""what are the best values to start with **right now** to 'optimize' my future savings if everything stays constant"".  

&amp;nbsp;

I was able to reduce the analysis into a single equation that is a function of my 401(k) contribution and my monthly loan payment:  

    monthly total savings = monthly disposable income + montly 401(k) savings
    monthly disposable income = [(13/4) * grossWeekly * (1-myPercent)] - loan - constants
    monthly 401(k) savings = grossMonthly * (myPercent + theirPercent)

where  
  
    loan = monthly loan payment (variable)
    myPercent = my 401(k) contribution percentage (variable)
    theirPercent = myPercent/2 (if myPercent &lt;= 16%) OR 8% (if myPercent &gt; 16%)

(I can provide the derivation if necessary)

&amp;nbsp;

I then did a month-by-month ""simulation"" of the finances to get the monthly values.  I accounted for interest in the 401(k), interest in the student loan, federal income tax, FICA, health insurance, standard deduction, and personal exemption in the calculation.  I looped through this process for however many months I wanted.  Once the student loan reached $0, whatever 401(k) contribution % I was previously using instantaneously went to the max 21.23%. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Here are the results:**  
Total Savings over 10 years - http://imgur.com/fEEGAb2 , http://imgur.com/JZBFeTj (~$421,400.00)  
401(k) Savings over 10 years - http://imgur.com/4ZaEGPe (~$327,400.00)  
""Disposable Income"" Savings over 10 years - http://imgur.com/khuL7Wl (~$94,000.00)  
(areas without data are combinations that result in negative savings and are thus removed from consideration)

&amp;nbsp;

For this 10 year analysis, it seems that the ""optimal"" selection to maximize my savings over 10 years is to pay ~$700 per month to the loan and contribute the maximum 21.23% to my 401(k).  The results in my loan repayment lasting approximately 28.5 months.  However, if I pay my loan off more aggressively, say at $1,500 per month, and do NO 401(k) contribution for that time period (13 months), I'd actually end up with less total savings over the 10 year period ($421,400.00 vs $391,000).  

&amp;nbsp;

**This seems really counter-intuitive to me**.  From all the things I've read, paying off the loan quickly seems to be the go-to advice.  Paying it off in 13 months seems pretty fast to me, and I really couldn't pay it off much faster while staying financially comfortable.  But my analysis shows that this plan is not the best plan.

&amp;nbsp;

Am I thinking about this wrong?  Am I overthinking this?

I want to go to graduate school in 1.5 years, and before that take a 4 month backpacking trip throughout Asia. Currently I put away $300 a month towards my student loans, but according to the website I actually don't owe anything each month (totally I owe 16k). I would like to start putting the money I had for my loans towards a savings account with the 2k I have, where I can develop interest over time.

personalfinance,Is there a way to verify lack of student loans after 10 years?,"I'm a bit embarrassed to not know something so basic, but I think this is the biggest missing piece to get my finances in order.

I went to a four-year university and I got a federal direct loan for $10K, and I think my parents paid the rest of it.  At least that's what we think - we didn't keep good records.  My parents no longer have an account at the bank where they wrote the checks, and it's been 10 years already, so we're going off memory.

It's definitely the case that my parents paid most of the cost (and I know I'm insanely fortunate for it), but I'm worried that maybe we got a loan along the way and forgot about it, and that the loan is silently collecting interest.

I paid off the Federal Direct Loan, and all 3 of my credit reports showed it as paid off, and they do not show any other loans.

With other debts, this would put me at ease that everything's settled (or if not it's been so long that it doesn't matter, and I've been keeping very detailed records for the last 8 years).  However, since student loans can't be discharged, is it possible that I have an outstanding loan that's collecting interest, and the loan provider has been trying to contact me but is actually reaching someone else (I have a commonly misspelled name) and sometime in the future they may find me?  Are there any safe harbors where I can get student loans discharged if no one is trying to collect?  Is there any other source of student loan info other than credit reports?",finance
personalfinance,Should we do a 15yr or 30yr mortgage?,"Our family is looking forward to buying our first house soon. Combined we make 195K (95/100). No debt, paid off all student loans, cars, etc - but due to the aggressively debt payback we only have about $40K for a down payment. We both have 800+ credit. 

We're looking to buy in the 350-450K range which would put our mortgage around $2500. I figure that's still survivable on one income in the worst case scenario. While we're both working it still leaves plenty of room for savings, we both max out our 403bs and save another $2K a month on top of that. 

Ideally we'd like to retire in like 20 years. We could definitely afford the 15 yr mortgage, payments would go up to about 3K. Is it really worth it considering the tax deduction though? It would accelerate payments to the point where we'd be back on the standard deduction before too long. Plus with the lower interest rate of the 15 yr mortgage, there's less to deduct. In either case, the excess will go to savings, not spending. 

Basically it comes down to whether we'd be better off with the 30yr mortgage and investing the difference vs the lower interest rate of the 15yr? Especially when taking taxes into account.

financialindependence,"My wife and I are technically almost one million dollars in the red at 28/29. We net $80,000/yr combined. Here is an oversimplified version of our plan to become FIRE'd before 50.","Bear with me, as I'm new to the world of financial independence. I am using rough estimations for a lot of this. Soon we will be sitting down with a family friend who is a retired stock broker/financial advisor to seek guidance from him. I must also add that I'm thankful because, without happening across this subreddit, our plan wouldn't have happened.

I'm 29 and my wife is 28. We have:
* ~$20,000 in credit card debt
* ~$20,000 in auto loan debt
* ~$120,000 in student loan debt
* ~$265,000 in a rental property mortgage (paid off in ~20 more years; we make a $200/mo profit off our renters; 3.75 interest rate)
* ~ $500,000 in the mortgage for our home (just started this 30 year loan; we pay $1800/mo and my in-laws pay the rest; 3.75 interest rate)

That's a lot of debt! And a very negative net worth. :-o 

We have a combined $53,000 in our 401(k)s and about $2,500 in savings. 

Combined we net about $80,000 per year. We are both in the second year of our careers, so we will top out much higher. 

Here's how we plan on retiring early: 
For the first time in our four year relationship, all unnecessary spending ground to a halt as soon as my wife and I discussed our intent to retire early. Additionally, we are now simplifying our life by selling, donating, or throwing away about 30% of the ""things"" we have but don't really need. We are putting $2,000/mo toward credit card debt, then paying off our vehicle debt. 

My wife's student loan payments are only $100 per month because they are based on her income. After 8 more years, the remainder of the debt will be forgiven. So, we only *really* owe ~$9600 in student loans.

Once our debt is paid off - save for the mortgages - we should be able to comfortably get by with $40,000/yr in expenses. By then, we will be about 34 years old and net ~$100,000/yr. At that point, our plan is quite simple: aggressively invest $60,000+ per year for the following 10-15 years.

We want to retire with enough money to comfortably spend $60,000 - $80,000/yr. That includes basic necessary expenditures, locally spent 'fun' money, and world travel expenditures. We won't always spend that much per year, since we plan on spending wisely. What we don't spend will stay invested. 

When our rental property is paid off, we will be 49 and profiting ~$26,000/yr. So, we really only need to reach between $1,200,000 and $1,300,000 to achieve this (WR of 4% of $1,300,000 is $52,000 + the $26,000 from the rental investment = $78,000/yr). 

Hopefully this made sense. I'm open to constructive criticism.

Edit: We are actually nowhere near $1 million in the red since our mortgages don't count. Noob mistake. Thanks for pointing it out, /u/pctw 

Edit 2: Wew lad, this post blew up. I really did a textual diarrhea of the fingers (#wut), skimmed through it with little extra thought, and posted it. Let me clarify some things:

* My wife's student loans will not end up being $9600 like I originally posted. The amount will go up as she makes more money since it's based on her income. However, the program that forgives the loan 8 years from now will NOT require us to pay taxes on the payoff amount. 
* My wife and I are actually on the same page. We were already heavily leaning toward selling the rental in the near future (tenant's lease is up in May), but I threw it into my retirement forecast to obtain critiques and see if others think it's a decent idea. It isn't. We're selling the rental! You guys can breathe easy on that matter now.
* We are going to have a good chunk of change from selling the rental property, tax returns, and various other sources over the course of this year. In fact, we should have over $10,000 in savings by March. We will use the year's extra money to aggressively pay down credit card debt(!) and build up a larger emergency fund before paying off our vehicles. 
* Our in-laws are living with us. I wasn't clear about this in my original post, so it seemed as if we were just having them pay toward our mortgage while they lived in their own home and we lived in a $500,000 home.
   - If the in-laws die early on, we can use their life insurance as a buffer while we sell the residence. 
   - If they decide they don't want to live with us at some point down the road, we will sell the residence. This doesn't seem likely at all, as I'm close with the in-laws (before marrying my wife, we were best friends since the age of 13)
   - Yes, a $500,000 home is very expensive, but my wife and I will be paying ~60% of that since the in-laws cover ~40% to live with us. I know that is still expensive, but our share comes out to about $300,000. 
   - Houses in the $200,000 - $250,000 range in my city are generally fixer-uppers requiring a lot of maintenance, remodeling, etc. 
* We chose Subarus not only because of their safety rating, but because, thanks to AWD, they handle well in the really snowy Alaska weather.
   - The 2010 Subaru was a fairly good purchase. With that being said, the lease on the 2015 was a very cruddy purchase.
* We admit that we made some very, VERY poor financial mistakes during our 20's. Now we are digging out of it.
* Our expenses will likely be closer to $45,000 per year.
* Within 5 years we will net over $100,000/yr combined. 
* We will eventually top out at around $160,000/yr. This is based on my work's pay scale and the upper range of my wife's field - but this is a rough estimate. 
* We may be having a close friend (a network engineer making 6 figures) rent out a room for $1,000/mo for 2 years. This would obviously help pay down our credit card and vehicle debts much faster. As of now, we will plan as if this won't happen - but it'll be nice if it does. :-) 
* Again, we will be very aggressive with paying down our debt over the course of the next 2 years. Within 2-3 years we will likely have a situation that looks more like this:
   - Still a $500,000 mortgage (the in-laws pay almost half - so our responsibility is more like ~$300,000)
   - Still a lot of student loan debt (though it'll be forgiven within 5 or 6 years at this point)
   - No other debts
   - 2 paid off vehicles
   - $20,000+ in savings
   - Approaching $100,000/yr in net income
   - Finally heavily focusing on maxing out our 401(k)s and IRA, etc. 
* We don't really need to have a FIRE number of $80,000 because our monthly expenses should be under $2000 once the house is paid off. We will obviously reassess as time goes on, and consider working past 50 if it means a more comfortable retirement. 
* 55 is still FIRE, and reality may dictate that we must retire in that age range in order to safely remain FIRE'd for life.

Thanks for all the input and well wishes! Many of you have provided helpful information, and logical criticism.

I get that even my projection for 2-3 years from now isn't an ""ideal"" situation for the truly minimalistic, frugal, and FIRE-minded individuals out there; however, it's a LOT better than our current situation, and it would allow us to retire early as long as we stick to the plan.

I make around $100k without overtime. I worked my way up from $45k to where I am now in about 5 years.

No student loans, or car loans or any kind of debt except my mortgage.

Mortgage and utilities are $1700 a month. (30 year loan)

Gas/Car Insurance is $200 a month (I have a truck)

Food/Entertainment/Groceries are $500 a month.

Assets: $40k in cash, $18k in my Roth IRA (vanguard VFFVX), $33k in my TSP (Roth) (Lifecycle 2050).


My question is, what can I do better to get my dream car?

Ideas, I've had are to switch my TSP from ROTH to Traditional, and start saving much, much more, with the idea of using that money as a loan to myself to pay for the car that I want. I am loaning myself the money from my TSP, however, I pay it back to myself with interest. Yes I understand this comes with a risk, however I am not saving for something that I need, this is a want, and I can wait longer if the money is not there. Is this a bad idea?

I can sell my current vehicle for about $15k...

The car is about $65k-70k. (BMW M4) I dont want any packages, just the base car with a manual transmission. I'm not trying to show off or anything like that. That's not why I want this car. After all the research I've done, this is the car with the best performance relative to the value.

Thank you PF!",finance

personalfinance,Worked and extra day but had the same paycheck amount. Is this normal?,"I picked up one extra shift during this last pay period (1 paycheck per 2 weeks). To my surprise my paycheck was almost the same as when I didn't pick up an extra shift. I talked to the other servers and they said that the more they work the more tax is taken out. This I understand. However, they and I both agree that the amount taken out seems super drastic. I should have made an extra 70$ in hourly wage which all went to paying for federal withholding, Medicare, and etc. 

I am considering picking up an extra shift a week and it doesn't seem too worth it if I have to pay an extra 70$ in withholdings. Please help explain to me if this is normal and if it's worth it. 

When I worked 28 hours (at 10$/hour plus tips)
Hourly = $280
Tips = $224
Federal withholding = $45
Social security = $31.25
Medicare = $7.31
CA withholding = 0
CA disability employee = $4.53

Paycheck received = $191.91

When I worked 35 hours (at 10$/hour plus tips)
Hourly = $350

Federal withholding = $84
Social security = $47.48
Medicare = $11.10
CA withholding = 9.96
CA disability employee = 6.89

personalfinance,Pay off high principle student loan debt or invest,"First off, thanks in advance for the advice.  I frequently visit PF and /r/financialindependence.  My wife and I are in our mid 20's and looking on how to distribute our leftover funds.  Between our two incomes we have roughly $2000 a month we can contribute towards a goal.  We already have a good starting emergency fund and budget.  My main question has to do with how to spend or invest this money.  We have roughly $124,000 in student debt, but its sitting at variable of 2.5%. Now, according to a lot of advice on here and FI, they say to invest extra money if the interest rate is below 3-3.5%.  So my plan as it sits is to pay minimum payment on these loans while contributing to Roth IRA or some vanguard index funds until the rates reach 3%.  Does this seem wise or should I just begin paying as much as I can to our student loans?",finance

ethereum,Dapp idea: Blockchain based video archive,"Dear Ethereum-community,
my father brought me to following idea:

In times of ""fake news"" and [Face2Face](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohmajJTcpNk&amp;t=75s&amp;spfreload=10) -like technologies, I thought about a PoF (proof-of-first) video archive.

The idea would be, that important videos (like a speech of a president or a court decision) would be safed on the Ethereum blockchain. And if someone (e.g. a journalists) wants to use the content, he/she can decide to go to youtube to watch the replay or use the dapp to be 100% sure the video isn't faked.

You could link an ""upload"" with a blocknumber, so that everybody could retrace when the video was first ""published"". That would make faking nearly impossible.

What are your thoughts? Feel free to develop the concept in any way.

personalfinance,Looking for advice on how to tackle my credit card debt,"I just applied for the Chase Slate card to consolidate my debt and I was approved for $1,800, however my debt far exceeds what I was just approved for. I'd like some advice on which balances I should consolidate and how I should move forward with payments during the 15 month 0% introductory period. 

My credit card debt balances and interest rates are:
*CC1: $1,159.42 @ 23.16%
*CC2: $960.63 @ 23.15%
*CC3: $3,856.72 @ 21.24%
*CC4: $5,408.37 @19.24%

My thought process is to combine all of CC1 and $640 of CC2. This will leave $320 on CC2. I plan on making more than the $120 monthly payment needed to pay off the $1,8000 on the Chase card. I also plan on making aggressive payments on CC2 while making minimum payments on CC3 and CC4. So here's my question, if I go this route, does it make sense to continue to transfer balances from other cards every 30 days? I understand that I will have to increase my monthly payments to ensure the full amount is paid off in 15 months, or transfer the balance to a new card. Or would you go about this with a different strategy?

personalfinance,What to do with extra 50K?,"Hi all -
I find myself with a ""spare"" 50K on my hands after bonus season, and I have no idea what's the best use of the money.  I've read the investing and retirement sections of this subreddit, and can't figure out the smartest move.

**Here's our financial situation:**  
- 32 y/o (me), 34 y/o (husband)    
- married, no kids (but want to start a family within next 2 yrs)  
- dual income household (600K annual)  
- already have a 6 month emergency fund saved  
- 450K in 401K retirement funds between the two of us  
- 86K in Betterment account with time-weighted return of 8.2%  
- 4500/mo mortgage (already putting extra $700/mo towards principal)   
- already auto-depositing $500/mo in to Betterment account  
- no student loan or credit card debt  

**Personal considerations:**
I will likely stop working for a time after having children (so within next two years), which will drop household income down to 420K.  Even when returning to work, I definitely won't be making what I make now (I currently work in finance in NYC...not super family friendly!)

**Options I've thought of for the money:**  
- beef up emergency fund to 12 months (tempting, but 1% interest rate on that account means losing money over time due to inflation)    
- put it in to current Betterment account (Trump presidency makes me nervous for state of the market!)    
- invest in bonds (lower risk, but also lower reward, may as well just put it in to 1% savings acct?)

personalfinance,down payment versus 401k.,"Hi,
I have a question about saving for a down payment for our first home versus contributing to our 401k.    
My wife and I are both working in good paying jobs. She works in very secure position in academia and I am working for a startup. Both of our places offer a 401k and financially we can contribute the max 18k a year per person to the plans. She is contributing the 18k and I am doing 12k a year.    
We have no student loans and we can pay off our credit cards at the end of the month.   
We are also looking to buy our first home, so we started saving for that. Unfortunately, we live in one of the high price real estate markets on the east coast.  Considering that we want to limit our commute to one hours each way for the both of us, a good school system and some yard to play for our kid, we determined that we must spend in the ballpark of 500k for a house.   
I tracked our spending over the past year and I am not sure that we are making enough progress to save for the down payment in relation to the rise in real estate prices and interest rates in our area.    
 I have mixed feelings, because I am trying to balance out the expenses of 401k and the savings for a house. On the one hand with a 401k you are saving for retirement and compound interest really kicks in the longer you save. On the other hand, owning a house is also part of retirement in that you do not have to add in the cost of renting when you are retired.   
I am a little nervous, because friends of ours bought their home in 2015 and they are paying a full percent less in interest than what you can get today. That results in something like 300 dollars more a month.   
So, my question is: Does it make sense to contribute less to our 401k in order to have the down payment faster?",finance

personalfinance,Question about rolling Roth/IRA accounts,"Hi PF, 

I searched the sub but didn't find an answer to this, apologies if it has been asked before. 

My wife and I make more than the limit for Roth IRA (200k+), but my wife has now saved $3500 in her roth account. I have split $2500 between a roth and a traditional IRA in my old account. I've saved ~$2500 more in a traditional IRA since starting my new job. 

We both recently got new jobs, and in both of our cases, the checks for rolling the balances to our new company IRAs were never cashed. They are being reissued directly to us now. The question is, is there anything else we can do with the money? We made some mistakes last year and are carrying a credit card balance that I'm uncomfortable with. The money coming to us would be helpful to dig us out of that (starting us back at $2500 for retirement) if there are no substantial penalties for using the money in that way. 

We have a plan to quickly rebuild for retirement, but in the short term, using that money to pay off cards with a higher interest rate than our return on investment makes sense to me. Can you tell me what my options are?",finance

investing,Advantage to buying secondhand bonds with different interest rates as opposed to buying new?,"So I'm learning about bonds and I'm confused as to why someone would buy a bond frmo a marketplace/someone else as opposed to buying it directly from the government/company. For example, I have had a 30-year bond 5 years which I bought at $1000 and 8% interest. The interest rate then drops to 6%. I go to sell my bond for some reason. Instead of my bond selling for $1000, it will sell for more due to the higher yield. This will push the current yield down.

How much will the current yield be pushed down? Well I have a suspicion that in order for the bond to look like a good deal for me to sell to someone, the market price of the bond has to increase until the current yield is at or almost at the same price for current interest rates. And to the lender looking to buy my bond, why would he buy a bond with such a high market price that the current yield is less than the 6% he could get from buying a new bond?

I just don't see the advantage in the lender's eyes of buying a bond previously owned by someone else when he can buy it directly from the government/company? It just doesn't seem like there's any advantage to either option.

The only difference I can think of is the fact that with bonds previously owned, the call date may be sooner around the corner, than on newly-issued bonds.",finance

personalfinance,"Had surgery, paid ~$4500. Want to transfer the balance to a new card so that there's 0 interest while I pay it off (should be ~3 months). Trouble picking a card, also is this a good idea?","Hey y'all,

This is something that I think my dad has done before. I had a (life changing!) surgery a few days ago. I had some savings but they couldn't cover the entire cost and I didn't want to use all of them anyway so I put $4500 on my cashback card. I don't know exactly what my interest rate is on this card off the top of my head and for whatever reason the BofA app doesn't tell me when I click on it so it's probably like 18% or something terrible because I got it a long time ago. I actually only have 2 credit cards and 1 line of credit (freaking jewelry stores, man) and even though my credit score is good I know I would be alright with another card. This balance is the only debt I have, I own my car and I rent right now.

I can pay it off pretty aggressively. I got a 14k raise this year and pending the first paycheck at the new rate this Friday I'm thinking I might be able to allocate ~$1500 a month towards paying off the debt.

CreditKarma is showing that I'm in a position to apply and likely be approved for a whole slew of cards. I wanted one with no foreign transaction fee but a lot of the cards that don't have that come with an annual fee. On the other hand, one of them has an annual fee that is 1/4 the cost of the balance transfer fee so I could go 4 years before paying what I'd pay in balance transfer fee with a card with no annual interest, there's like a 3% transfer fee for most of the no-annual-fee cards.

I get the wrecked credit for 7 years, and that not all debt would necessarily be eliminated, but there has to be more to it than that. What am I missing? 

Debt: 

- $240000 line of credit, floating prime (2.7%)

- $85000 combined provincial / federal student loans, no interest accumulates until graduation. 

Assets: 

- Car worth less than $10000.

- Personal items worth less than $3000.

Context: 
Professional school student in mid 20s, interviewing to enter post graduate training in competitive discipline. I would begin making about $60000 yearly in July and it goes up from there. The danger is that this is not guaranteed and I am not particularly employable in any other field.  
Married, wife makes $45000 before tax. Her name is not on any of my loans.  
Part of my debt is poor habits early.   Part is supporting myself through wife's unemployment for a while and my own medical illness which delayed my progression through school but still cost me the many thousands in tuition for the extra time. 

Is bankruptcy such a bad idea? I will try to avoid it but I've heard such a taboo about it in my conversations with people and nobody seems to actually know why it is so bad besides credit score and therefore lending capabilities.

The biggest change I have is the possibility of rent adjustment. We pay $1200/month and there is room to have it moved as we rent from family. We've talked to them and they're open to any price we need but I want to avoid it out of pride. 

Also, my bank has offered to increase the line of credit by $25K if my wife puts her name on it. On one hand, that would grant us flexibility and we would have no issue with concerns about changing lifestyle. On the other it's this huge exposure to her to put her name on it. She says she is more than willing (we've talked many times about it) but I'm still more hesitant to take that deal than she is.",finance

Second overwhelming problem, my student loans have ballooned in recent years. I don't make a US income so I have filed for forbearance the last few years and made bulk payments (transfer AUD to USD).

I moved here 2 years ago for career reasons, and it's been a huge boon both in terms of salary and quality of life. But the prospect of buying a home is daunting/depressing, given how frothy the market feels and how pricey even the oldest of houses are.

My wife and I are both committed to living in the area long-term, and we're also committed to buying a home at some point. We're both in our mid-20s but don't plan on having kids for at least 5 years. So we're open to a condo, townhouse, or freestanding house.

After doing lots of research, I feel like the Denver market is fairly valued and real estate here will continue to appreciate, but I'm open to opposing opinions on the matter.

personalfinance,Running out of money as a senior college student. Need advice on the next steps to take.,"Hello, 

I am currently a senior at an in-state university. I was fortunate enough to have my parents pay for my first three years of school. However, the last year I have been paying for myself. I have taken advantage of the federal pell grant and have taken federal aid loans out (to what I believe) the max I can. I currently have one more semester after this one. My rent is $500 a month and food costs me approximately $300 a month. I am currently unable to work as I have an internship outside of my 15 credits which takes up nearly all of my free time. At this point in time, I have enough money for approximately 2 months of rent and food. What should I do in terms of money for the next year? (I graduate in December). Loans?  Any advice is appreciated. Thanks.",finance
personalfinance,"Car totaled by snow plow while being financed, need advice on new car finacingy","On new years eve my car (2010 Mazda 3) was hit by a backhoe doing snow removal.

Despite it being only a crushed in rear quarter panel, the damages were estimated at 6,100$ through insurance. The car is now considered a write off.

I will be compensated 8,200$, I luckily only owe 7,000$. That will leave me with 1,200$  after paying the remainder of the finance. 

My issue here, or concern rather, is that after I take the settlement, give in the car, have finances covered - I only have a car rental for 5 days to find a new car. 

That's 5 days to apply for new financing, however if I understand correctly it may take up to 30 days for reports of paid loans to be reported to the credit bureau. So when I apply for a new loan it may show I have an outstanding car loan.

I want my next car loan to have a low interest rate. Is my scenario even an issue? I had an idea of paying the car loan off myself and waiting some time before taking the insurance money in order to insure my credit score is high.

I plan to buy a car for 18k. 5k down and financing the other 13k. My past financing rate was about 5% on 10k.

personalfinance,"Heads up: The federal government just filed suit against Navient, claiming they scammed millions of borrowers between 2010-2015 to the tune of $4 billion. This is huge.","The suit was filed January 18th 2017, by the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (CFPB) against Navient. 

First, know that the CFPB has requested that the Court order Navient to comply with the following actions, among others: 

1. Restitution to consumers harmed by Navient's conduct; 

2. Disgorgement of all ill-gotten revenue


Here are the details of the allegations: 

From [consumer affairs .com](https://www.consumeraffairs.com/news/feds-sue-student-loan-servicer-navient-011817.html): 
&gt;Specifically, the suit charges that Navient:
&gt;&gt; Fails to correctly apply or allocate borrower payments to their accounts;

&gt;&gt; Steers struggling borrowers toward paying more than they have to on loans;

&gt;&gt; Obscured information consumers needed to maintain their lower payments;

&gt;&gt; Deceived private student loan borrowers about requirements to release their co-signer from the loan; and

&gt;&gt; Harmed the credit of disabled borrowers, including severely injured veterans.

From the [LA Times](http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-navient-lawsuit-20170118-story.html): 
&gt;In its lawsuit, the consumer agency alleged many other borrowers had problems enrolling in programs to reduce payments and Navient instead steered struggling borrowers into plans that made more money for Navient but saddled borrowers with higher costs.

&gt;Specifically, the government alleged that Navient maintained compensation policies that encouraged customer service representatives to push borrowers into forbearance, which allows borrowers to suspend payments without defaulting but does not stop interest from accruing.

&gt;However, most federal student-loan borrowers earned the right in 2009 to enroll in the less costly payment options that are based on their income.

&gt;Although those plans save borrowers money, forbearance was more lucrative for Navient, the agency alleged because the company could enroll borrowers in forbearance in less time and with less staff.

&gt;In all, the servicer slapped borrowers with additional interest charges of up to $4 billion by enrolling them in repeated forbearance plans from January 2010 to March 2015, according to the consumer agency. 

If you want to learn more about this, I highly encourage you to read the original complaint filed with the court by the CFPB. It is VERY readable (not filled with legalese) and reads as an absolutely scathing indictment of a company whose business practices targeted its most vulnerable customers in flagrant violation of the law. 

You can find the original complaint on the [consumer finance .gov website](http://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/201701_cfpb_Navient-Pioneer-Credit-Recovery-complaint.pdf). They also [summarized the complaint on their website](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-sues-nations-largest-student-loan-company-navient-failing-borrowers-every-stage-repayment/). 

In the spirit of this sub, I'm sharing this information because there are plenty of people here who may have been a victim of these alleged practices. Including myself, as I've been paying down my Navient loans since 2012 and have several years to go. 

I'm going to read through the complaint again, and if anything important jumps out at me that I haven't mentioned, I'll update this post. 

**Edit:**
Additional allegations: 

(since July 2011) Disregard of borrower instructions when processing payments submitted by check with written instructions from the borrower specifying how the payment should be applied.

(Jan 2010-March 2015) Using uncharacteristically vague email titles like “New Document Ready to View” to notify borrowers that they needed to renew their income-based repayment enrollment. During this time, the number of borrowers who did not timely renew their enrollment regularly exceeded 60% of borrowers and resulting, often, in capitalization of interest. 

**Edit:** There is no way to know how potentially impacted borrowers will be affected by the lawsuit. We will have to wait and see. Lawsuits of this magnitude often take a LONG time to get resolved.

investing,Bonds vs Bond Funds (Pros and Cons of Each),"I hope that this post helps to clarify the difference between purchasing a bond fund, and an individual bond outright. For the purpose of this post, we will assume that the type of bond we are dealing with are U.S. Treasuries.

**Individual Bonds**
1. An important reason one would buy an individual bond is to guarantee their principal amount being preserved (by holding until maturity). For example if one has $5000 and they wish to still have $5000 by 1 year from now, they might buy a bond with a 1% yield and maturity date of 1 year later. This would mean that by the time the bond matures 1 year later, they would have received $50 plus their entire $5000 principal back, guaranteed (we are assuming treasuries). It is important to note that the principal is preserved because the holder only redeemed at the maturity date. Between purchase and maturity date, the value of the bond fluctuates, but as long as the holder holds until the maturity date they will get the full principal back.

2. Worst case scenario for individual bonds (treasuries that is) is if you have to sell the bond early at a loss. As noted above, the value of the bond is guaranteed if you hold until maturity, but if you need the money before the maturity date, then you’d be at the mercy of the market price at that time.

**Bond funds**
In comparison to individual bonds, the principal is not guaranteed because there is no maturity date. **edit for the remainder of this we will be assuming that we are talking about no maturity bond funds. From the comments it seems that this was not emphasized enough** This is evidently seen if you look at the graph of VBMFX (https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0084&amp;FundIntExt=INT) and simply notice that the value does decline. (Thus if you had unfortunately purchased at the peak and were planning to redeem when the total value was lower, then you would have to redeem at a loss)
However, in almost every other scenario aside from requiring the full principal at a later date, the bond fund has unique and strong things going for it.




1. Let’s assume that interest rates have went up, causing the value of the bond fund to go down. Even in this seemingly bad scenario (our assets lost value!) it really isn’t so bad. In the long term, it is likely that the value of the fund will come back. This is because of a couple of reasons: the coupons of the bonds are reinvested into bonds with the current higher yield. Furthermore, each bond that matures will be reinvested into bonds with the current higher yield. The net result is that over time the bond fund (quite quickly actually) grows into the new higher rate environment, and the NAV rebounds. 


2. It allows for easy diversification. A bond fund allows you to diversify in many ways, not but limited to: maturity, yield, type of bond. Thus for example, one fund might have a 4% treasury bond with maturity date 6 years from now, a 1% municipal bond with maturity date 1 year from now, and a 6% corporate bond with maturity date 30 years from now. This way you can take a balance between duration sensitivity and higher yield. 

3. It’s easy to buy and manage. While it isn’t very hard to buy an individual bond, there is definitely  more process to it than buying a bond fund (it can be bought as a mutual fund or ETF just like stocks). And as for management - you do not really need to do anything! Someone else will manage the fund for a low expense ratio (like VBMFX noted above) which for example involves purchasing new bonds continually over time.

4 . Worst case scenario for bond funds is if the fund (the fund manager) is forced to liquidate their individual funds at lower market prices (perhaps due to many investors selling the fund). The reason this is bad is that they would not be able to reinvest the coupons and matured bonds as seen in point #1, but would instead have to take a loss as seen in the worst case for individual bonds.

**Conclusion and observations**
If you have plans where you need to have EXACTLY a certain amount of money in the future, there is a certain level of risk that this may not be guaranteed with a bond fund and thus you may wish to invest in individual bonds instead. Even if the risk is small, small risk is nonzero risk. 

On the other hand, if you do not have a specific date of redemption in mind and am maybe just investing generally for the long term, then bond funds make a lot of sense

personalfinance,Is it time to cash-out the higher paying investment?,"I'm a property owner in South Africa. I currently own two properties in different cities. Due to the arrival of a new child, cash flows have been thrown out of balance and I'm now at a cross roads.


Property 1: Current value is around R2.4mn. Owe the bank approx R1.4mn. Interest rate is 10.5% (not fixed), monthly bond repayment is around R14,000. Living in this property. Appreciating at approx 3% per year.


Property 2: Current value is around R2.75mn. Owe the bank approx R1.45mn. Interest rate is also 10.5% (not fixed), monthly repayment around R14,600. Rent this property out for R12,750 a month, meaning after all is said and done I need to personally pay in about R4,000 a month to meet the bond payment. Appreciating at approx 10% per year.


Question is as follows: Each month, i'm personally paying around R18,000 to the bank and of that only about R4,000 is capital repayment. If I sold Property 2, it would pretty much pay off property 1 completely, meaning I'd be R18,000 a month better off in terms of pure cash flow for day-to-day needs with a new baby. However, I'd then be sitting with all funds in a property appreciating at 2-3% a year. Alternatively, if we cut out all unnecessary expenditure, we could probably make things work with the dual properties for now but it is tight, we're living paycheck-to-paycheck and by year end we're hoping for a Christmas Bonus from work to pay off overdrafts that have built up over the year. I'm of the opinion that our family would be a lot happier if we actually had a bit of spare money we could go on the odd holiday with, that we could send the older kids to after school sports on, etc etc. And that we wouldn't be throwing away R168,000 this year to the bank in the form of interest. However, everyone else I've spoken to is saying don't do it - keep both properties and live the next year or two budgeting down to the cent.


If this makes any difference to your opinion, our longer term plan (next 1-2 years) is to move away from the city where the property is only appreciating at 2-3% per year and down to the city where it is going up at 10% a year. We would not be able to move into Property 2 as it is a small 2 bedroom flat and we'll need a family home, so when the move happens in the next year or two we'd have to sell Property 2 anyway.


If there's anything I need to clarify further, please ask away and I'll try get back asap.",finance

So I know I am going to sound like an idiot, but financial things just really don't click with me so please bear with me. 

I took out a credit card at 18 and, as credit limits are want to do, the limit has gradually increased since then; unfortunately I also went through a very rough time with my personal and financial life that led me to being a whopping $4,600 in debt on this particular credit card. That was two years ago. 

I have since managed to chip it down to $1,300 and my credit score has improved about 200 points. 

My interest rate on this card is a terrible 24% if I am not mistaken. 

When I make payments I always try to pay more than my minimum. 

Here's my question: say my minimum is $50. I pay $150. How much of that is actually going towards my principle? 

Should I be specifying how I want that payment applied?

Also, would it be worth my time to attempt to have my interest rate lowered seeing as how my credit has improved, as has my history with my lender?

personalfinance,Buying a fixer-upper with no closing costs+little money down and refinancing later,"Is there anything wrong with a strategy to get an initial loan for a fixer upper with a small % money down and no closing costs and refinance later when you've renovated the place? 

For example, buying a 140k home with 10% down, so you have 14K in the home value. Lets say I now spend 20k to redo all of the kitchens and the bathroom (doing most of the work myself). Could I refinance a few months later seeing as the value of the home should be at least 160k now? To get a conventional 80:20 loan. 

Is this a sound strategy or am I missing something?

My other plan is to just get a piggyback mortgage and just deal with the higher interest rates.",finance

It's interesting that I have had the basic ideas for a writing like this in mind, but I have been unable to properly compartmentalize exactly what I want to get across. The interesting part is I want to express some insight on compartmentalization/compression.

Nick Szabo talks about compression in relation to our brains, in that we are so complex, and information can only be compressed so far, that there is a limit on our ability to perfectly step into another person's shoes, or express the entirety of what is in or own heads. *This link is broken and I cannot remember if I am referencing the correct paper and with the proper context but its the link I had in mind.

This is related to Adam Smith's impartial spectator, that we can theorize about a conceptually ideal and neutral perspective without suggesting it is wholly possibly to ever enter this perspective.

Krishnamurti levates this perspective through his dialogue and encourages one to move in the direction of invoking it individually and inwardly. Bohm formalized group invocation of such an objective perspective

In regard to one's own brains and minds (whatever relationship we ascribe them to have with each other) I think it can be said that we have some natural tendency to try to make sense of our experience, but I think it comes not from a psychological need but rather from a need to compress and store the experience.

Probably in some form of debriefing stage (like dreaming), it could be supposed that the mind uses complex association in order to compress and compartmentalize as much information as possible.

This creates a need for some “very stable” centers in which different concepts are linked to and that they can “unfold” from.

From another approach, we represent our experiences with some form and magnitude (or level) of metaphors, and we sometimes struggle to fit new experiences and understandings into whatever basic metaphors or building blocks we have constructed to represent the compressed information.

The “core” of these metaphors, or the most basic of blocks, would be the most difficult and traumatic to change (some possibly or nearly impossible), especially in a society that generally uses this paradigm (whether they know or understand they are using it or not).

Some experiences, or insights could lead to a change in the base structure, and we would expect this to be very uncomfortable for the individual or the psyche or “ego”. Depending on the cause we might expect very unfavorable (ie unsociable) fragmentation or disorder.

This would be like metaphors that are locked in some kind of fast memory or RAM, that cannot be dumped or debriefed to a long term storage, or in other words they do not fit in with the current compression methods. It might be as a whole or it might be in conflict with the base blocks.

Then it could be said that there might be the possibility of FAVORABLE change/evolution, and that the basic blocks used to store the compressed information might be able to be evolved.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Paying debt to help with an auto loan,"So as it stands right now I have just under $7K in credit card debit. I know it's just a drop in the well compared to most other CC debt cases, but it's been a struggle for me to keep it contained. With tax returns just around the corner would it make sense to throw all of it at the debt, plus a little more to bump my score up? I've been playing around on the Capital One Credit checker thing and I know it's just to give you an idea of what will affect what but putting $2,300 against my CC debt would raise me up from a 551TU to a 632TU which is just above the subprime threshold for auto loans. Ive been hitching rides with a co-worker to and from work but have been given the opportunity for a better job after February but I would have to have my own vehicle. Would it be better to put a larger sum of money into my debt now, and finance a car with better terms and little to no down payment or purchase the car with my current score and wait to start making bigger payments against the loan with the new job? I figure if the car payment will be lower than the credit card payments combined (6 cards) then I will come out on top as long as the interest rates are close. Considering the lowest interest rate on the cards is still 20%+ that shouldn't be a problem. Any advice or suggestions appreciated! Thank you!",finance

personalfinance,To refinance or not to refinance?,"My wife and I bought our first home a little under two years ago.  It happened somewhat suddenly when a home fell into our lap through an acquaintance and we were able to snatch it up before it went to market, and ended up getting it at a *substantial* discount relative to what other houses of that size were going for in our area.

However, because it was an unexpected opportunity we weren't quite where we wanted to be financially when we bought it.  My wife was working part-time while getting her teaching certification (which she's since gotten and is now working full time), and where we live part-time jobs aren't counted when assessing income for a mortgage.  Because of this, we weren't able to get a fixed rate loan, and ended up with an adjustable rate with 10-years fixed.  Also because our down payment wasn't what we would have preferred, we got stuck with private mortgage insurance (PMI) to the tune of about $100 a month.  It wasn't a terrible ARM in that the interest rate increase is capped at no more than .5% a year, and no more than 5% over the life of the loan.  We got a 3.5% rate when we bought, so 8.5% is the highest it can go, and we have 20 years before it can get there.

What really bugs me is PMI right now, so I went to the bank last week to talk about when we'd be able to get rid of it.  At our current rate it would be about two more years until PMI fell off by itself.  However, she came up with an additional idea to get out from it.

As I said, our house is likely worth much more than what we paid for it, and since we bought a few other houses in our neighborhood have sold for much more than we paid.  We've also done some moderate renovations.  We could get the house re-appraised, and if it comes in just around 7% higher, PMI would just go away right then.  I suspect the house is really worth around 13-15% more than what we paid for it, even before our renovations, so I feel pretty confident on this one.  However, it is no guarantee.  It would cost us $550 for the appraisal, which is not a huge hit, but it's not nothing.

But, the woman at the bank said if we plan to refinance to get out from the ARM, we need a new appraisal anyway, so why not go ahead and refinance now?  She estimated our interest rate would go up by about 1% (between 4.3% and 4.5%), closing costs and whatnot would come out to around $3,500, which could be rolled into the new mortgage, and we should lose PMI at that point with the new appraisal (assuming it's higher).  Our monthly payments would go up with the new, higher interest rate, but it would even out the savings from no more PMI, so we would have almost *exactly* the same monthly payment, but no PMI and a 30 year fixed rate.

So my question is, should I do it?  Rates could always go back down a bit. A lot can happen in 8 years (the time we have our 3.5% guaranteed).  I'm not thrilled about adding $3.5k closing costs into a new loan either, but we just had a baby so we're not in a position to absorb that out of pocket right now without being uncomfortably thin on our ""rainy day"" money.  On the other hand, having a fixed rate for the next 30 years is very enticing.

TL;DR:  Basically I have 3 options:

 * Do nothing, keep the status quo, PMI goes away in a couple of years and we refinance sometime in the next 10 years when rates are good, and until then enjoy 3.5% interest.

 * Get the appraisal for $550, hope it comes back higher the first one (I'm confident it will) so we lose PMI and save $100 a month.  We don't refi now and again wait to get a good rate sometime in the next 10 years.

 * Get the appraisal, hope it comes back higher then refi with a 4.3-4.5% interest rate on a 30 year fixed.  PMI goes away, payment is unchanged (don't save money, don't spend more)

I'm leaning towards going ahead and refinancing, but I really don't know.  Obviously the bank makes the closing cost money when I refi, so they have an incentive to get me to redo the mortgage.  However it also feels like it may be a case where it our interests align.  

Any advice would be appreciated!",finance

personalfinance,Struggling with Pay as You Earn vs. Revised Pay as You Earn vs. Traditional Repayment on Unsubsidized Loans,"I am looking at my student loan repayment options as a graduate student who is completely able to repay the amount in a traditional manner, likely two or three years early.  Don't get me wrong, it isn't chump change, but we've budgeted so that we ensured student loan repayment is doable.  Additionally, we plan on keeping our standard of living about the same despite pending pay increases.

My AGI is unusually low compared to my gross, and I could legally make it considerably lower than it already is.  If I'm calculating the formula correctly ((AGI - 150% poverty level)*.1) then my payments would be roughly 20% of the traditional repayment amount.  Assuming loan forgiveness in 25 years, making minimum payments I would end up paying roughly 1/2 of my current loan amount (not including interest gained in the 7-8 years of traditional repayment) and less than 40% of my 10 year repayment amount.  Again, if I had been so inclined I could have legally taken deductions that would have kept my AGI under 150% of FPL in 2015, and would likely be able to do so again for the next 3-4 years at least.

I am unable to get specific details about my account because I am not yet in repayment, but I would appreciate some guidance.

* Is there a way for me to see the interest rates?  I just can't find how one of these repayment plans affects my interest rate, and I can't really be as thorough as I need to be in this decision without interest rates.  It seems odd that I have to be in repayment before I get this information...
* It seems like the regular Pay as you Earn repayment plan is ideal.  If my income increases significantly I can always pay extra, but it is unlikely that my discretionary spending will double in the next 10 years at least.  Additionally, the forgiveness period is only 20 instead of 25 years, meaning that assuming I'm paying the same amount as I would on my 2015 tax year, I'd be well under 50% of my current amount.
* It seems like if I'm not eligible for the PAYE program the revised PAYE one is still helpful.  Even if my income increased to the point where I would be paying more than the traditional repayment plan it would have a smaller effect on my family.

I have been making the largest payments I can before repayment kicks in as they are pre-dated so that the amount I pay now does not collect interest during deferment, but if I'm looking to utilize loan forgiveness, it seems like I need to stop this immediately.

I feel like I must be getting something wrong here.  This isn't how it works with my car payment, my mortgage, or Jim who I loaned 20 bucks from last week.  I'm terrified I'm missing something and will end up hurting my family.  I would like to invest the saved amount either into a RIRA and/or into some form of brokerage account (not a 529) for my son.

personalfinance,Having Difficulty Finding Student Loan Refinancing Option that Beats Current Rates?,"Greetings, I have about $12,000 in student loans with interest rates varying from 3.15% to 3.61%.  I've worked hard to pay my minimum payments and also pay down a higher interest student loan group (6.5%) which is now all paid off.

My credit score is 735 and I've established a debt history with student loan payments, credit card payments (provided that paying the credit card off every month establishes credit history, I honestly don't know that it does), and automotive payments over the course of a year and a half, I've got good income (~65k) so the plan I hatched was to try and refinance to get a better interest rate so I can comfortable make the minimum payments on my low-interest debt while investing spare funds in places that would, hopefully, grant me returns greater than my interest on the debt.

But despite a good credit score and debt history I'm having a lot of trouble finding places via online application that will even give me the interest rate I currently have, let alone a lower interest rate.  I get that the loans aren't collateralized, but I'm not some kid going into college.  I've got my degree and a job and have shown I'm serious about paying my debt.  Am I missing something or am I just stuck with my current rates?

She works in her field as a speech assistant full time but it's not paying enough. She also works part time as a waitress. For these reasons she's going back to school to get her associates in nursing which she will hopefully begin in Fall 2018. The plan was to defer her private loans while in school but the thought of the capitalized interest is a huge issue in my mind. 

I have money saved up and my parents are also willing to loan the money to pay off her $30,000 private loans. She also has $30,000 in federal loans which 4/8 are subsidized direct loans and she is currently on an income-based repayment plan for all 8. She currently pays only $89 a month for the federal loans and $620 for private. I'm worried that once the private loans are paid off she will have to pay a much higher amount on her federal loans. Is this a concern?

Also last year was the first year that she had the loans paid under her name. I want her to have a credit history and be able to claim student loan payments on her taxes. If she were paying back my parents instead how would this work? What is the best route of action to take?

personalfinance,Is it crazy to leave the Bay Area and move to SLC?,"**TL;DR:** *I am not a software engineer. I am in Business Operations. My employer told me I can move myself from the Bay Area to Salt Lake City, where we have a sales office, and keep my Bay Area salary. My concern is that the move would stagnate my career progression and I'm not sure if the financial gains are worth the opportunity costs.*


So like many people, I am getting pretty fed up with the cost of living in the Bay Area. There are few things more disheartening than making almost $120k/ yr. and only being able to afford a crappy apartment. I am a married 30 year old with a three year old daughter and another on the way. My SO stays home with our daughter because the cost of childcare is laughable ($1500/ week on average), and it's not worth her working when we can lower our tax liabilities and have her stay home. 

I've lived in Northern California my entire life, but only moved to the bay area a couple years ago. My career has taken off since I dove head first into the software/ tech industry. I've gone from making $40k - $120k in less than four years and have gone from entry level tech support to running business operations across the entire customer lifecycle. But as I stated at the beginning of my post, that salary doesn't get you far here at all. However, the title and level of influence I have are pretty great.

My current employer has a sales and marketing office outside of Salt Lake City. I like it out there, except for a couple cultural things (California isn't perfect by any means though). I approached them about relocating and working out of that office and they've given me the official go ahead. Most importantly, I'd get to keep my current Bay Area salary and am still eligible for an annual raise in the next few months. 

There is no comparison between the lifestyle that $120k/yr. gets you in SLC vs. the Bay Area. It's the difference between a two bedroom apartment and a 6 bedroom house on 1/3 of an acre. My concern is that that move would completely stagnate my career progress; however, at a certain point being a father and spending time with my kids is more important than networking and schmoozing at conferences. 

Am I crazy for considering this? Has anyone else made a move like this? How did you weigh the opportunity cost of leaving the center of technological innovation and economic hyper-growth, for a slower lifestyle with more expendable income?",finance

Which to choose? Pay more in monthly for years until the PMI drops off, or save the money in monthly payment now while having a little bit more every year to write off due to the interest rate being higher.

Should I use the Roth offered through my 401K or lower the 401K percentage and look at Vanguard for the Roth? I only expect my salary to increase by 2-5% per year for the foreseeable future. 

Should I be more aggressive with my HELOC since the interest rate is over 4%? It is 4 years old at this time.

**===OBLIGATORY FITNESS METAPHOR===**

I've struggled with fitness all my life. I've had periods where I'm in great shape but mostly I'm a fat motherfucker. I know the problem but it's tough for me to fix it. Every few years -- and 2017 seems to be one of them -- I'll get fed up with fatness and dial in on fitness. At first, this takes the form of weight loss. I just want to get the weight off and I want it off *now*. So, I set a target -- usually around 170 pounds -- and I work like hell to get there.

Three months or six months or twelve months later, I do it. I get to 170! Hallelujah! Let's celebrate. But in the past, a strange thing has happened. I reach that weight and instead of being excited, I feel...lost. The moment is anti-climactic. I float at my goal weight for a few months, then the pounds start creeping back on. Triumph turns to shame and guilt and I only eat more and get fatter.

Now that I'm old (47), I know better. I'm sure many of you do too. Aiming for a specific weight is largely ineffective, not just for me but for everyone. It's better instead to aim to adopt new habits. For instance, I might try to reduce sugar consumption, drink less alcohol, etc. Better yet, I can set ""approach goals"" instead of ""avoidance goals"". I can aim to eat more veggies, walk more often, take smaller portions.

If I make positive, constructive lifestyle changes, then weight loss is inevitable. It becomes a side effect of eating right. (Note that while weight loss is a side effect of good nutrition, fitness itself is a side effect of regular exercise.)

The same idea applies your money.

**===THE SIDE EFFECT OF SAVING===**

Take debt reduction, for example.

When I owned Get Rich Slowly, I got to hear tons of tales from folks who managed to dig out of debt. Yay! But some folks struggled. They eliminated debt, maintained for a while, then found themselves falling back not the abyss. I see this more often in real life than by email (probably because readers who relapse tend not to write back). I have friends and family members who decide to get out of debt, make that a goal, work hard toward it, then feel aimless once they're debt-free. After a while, they buy a bigger home, buy new cars, go on expensive vacations. They get out of debt but they don't stay out of debt. Why not? Because they made debt elimination the goal. Once they achieve it, they lose their way.

I thinks it's smarter to view debt reduction as a side effect. Or, if you prefer, a step toward something greater. A subgoal.

If you do the right things -- reduce your costs, increase your income -- your saving rate (or ""profit"") will grow. And as your profit grows, you can use it to do things like pay off debt. Or work toward financial independence. You don't have to make debt freedom a goal. It'll just happen.

Now, I hope it's painfully obvious that if debt freedom is a side effect of smart habits then so too are the other [stages of financial freedom](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/4c15ke/the_six_stages_of_financial_freedom/).

* Debt freedom is a side effect of smart money management.
* Emergency savings are a side effect of smart money management.
* Fuck-you money is a side effect of smart money management.
* And, obviously, financial independence is a side effect of smart money management.

I've received too many emails from early retirees who reach FI then don't know what they're going to do with their lives. (Hell, this is a common refrain from traditional retirees!) Why? Because they made some arbitrary financial point their goal. But when they reach that goal, they realize it's meaningless

**===A GUIDE TO THE GOOD LIFE===**

Here's the first line to the book I wrote in 2009: ""You don't want to be rich -- you want to be happy."" I believe that more today than I did a decade ago. Money is great. It's a terrific tool you can use to build the life you want. But it doesn't make a satisfying end, in and of itself. It's a *means* to an end.

So, if I'm arguing that you shouldn't make FI a main goal, what *should* you do? I think the best thing you can do is answer the question: **What do you want out of life? What's your why? *Why* do you want to become financially independent? If you reach it, what then? What does FI represent to you?**

The very first bullet point in this sub's sidebar is says that FI/RE is about ""discovering and achieving life goals"". That's spot-on, but I think too many times people get focused on the money itself instead of what the money is for. 

In the introduction for *A Guide to the Good Life* (one of the books in this sub's recommended reading), William Irvine writs:

&gt; What do you want out of life? You might answer this question by saying that you want a caring spouse, a good job, and a nice house, but these are really just some of the things you want in life. In asking what you want out of life, I am asking the question in its broadest sense. I am asking not for the goals you form as you go about your daily activities but for your grand goal in living. **In other words, of the things in life you might pursue, which is the thing you believe to be most valuable?**

&gt; Many people will have trouble naming this goal. They know what they want minute by minute or even decade by decade during their life, but they have never paused to consider their grand goal in living. It is perhaps understandable that they haven’t. Our culture doesn’t encourage people to think about such things; indeed, it provides them with an endless stream of distractions so they won’t ever have to. But a grand goal in living is the first component of a philosophy of life. This means that if you lack a grand goal in living, you lack a coherent philosophy of life.

&gt; **Why is it important to have such a philosophy? Because without one, there is a danger that you will mislive** — that despite all your activity, despite all the pleasant diversions you might have enjoyed while alive, you will end up living a bad life. There is, in other words, a danger that when you are on your deathbed, you will look back and realize that you wasted your one chance at living. Instead of spending your life pursuing something genuinely valuable, you squandered it because you allowed yourself to be distracted by the various baubles life has to offer.

I love this. I wish that I had written it myself.

And as much as this sub (justifiably) hates on consumerism, the ""various baubles that life has to offer"" go beyond cars and computers and flat-screen TVs. FI for the sake of FI is just another bauble.

**===A HIERARCHY OF GOALS===**

The purpose of this post is to encourage other FIRE folks to change their aim slightly. I want to warn you of the ""danger that you will mislive"". **Instead of making FI a primary goal, take some time to figure out *why* you want FI.** What's your purpose in life? What's your mission? How does FI support it. (DOES FI support it? In some cases, FI might actually be in direct conflict with what you hope to accomplish. But usually not.)

I'm not going to rehash activities and exercises I've used in the past. Instead, let me point you to a book that anyone interested in FI ought to read: *Grit* by Angela Duckworth. This book is all about the power of passion and perseverance. Success, she argues, comes from having a clear goal and then working toward it with tenacity.

I like Duckworth's description of a hierarchy of goals. Your life ought to have a single primary purpose, she says, that sits alone at the top of this hierarchy. Below that are 3-5 main supporting goals. Below each of these are 3-5 mid-level goals. For each of these, there are 3-5 immediate short-term goals. (Actually, your hierarchy could be more complex than this, but let's try to keep things simple for this discussion.)

So, to use MMM as an example, he recently told me that his primary mission is ""to live the happiest, most satisfying life I can possibly live"". That's abstract, right? And it ought to be. Your top level goal -- your purpose -- is likely to be something airy like this. In *Grit*, Angela Duckworth says her top-level goal is to ""use psychological science to help kids thrive"". My own mission is ""to be the best person I can be, both mentally and physically"".

When I asked MMM to send me his mission statement, he included some additional detail: ""So far, this means focusing on curiosity and learning, hard work and self discipline, close friendships and sharing everything generously."" These would be his high-level supporting goals: curiosity and learning, hard work and self discipline, close friendships, and sharing generously. Note that FI isn't even one of *these* goals.

My high-level supporting goals are similar: ""self-care comes first""; go new places, try new things, meet new people; use my skills and experience to improve the lives of others. No FI there either.

But by *becoming* FI, both MMM and I are better able to pursue are high-level goals. It's not a primary aim, but there's no doubt it helps.

**===YOUR MISSION STATEMENT===**

In *Grit*, Angela Duckworth says that as you set each goal, you should ask yourself why it's important to you. If one of your goals is to become FI, *why* do you want to be FI? Duckworth writes:

&gt; If in the course of asking yourself these ""Why?"" questions your answer is simply ""Just because!"" then you know you've gotten to the top of a goal hierarchy. The top-level gaol is not a means to any other end. It is, instead, and end in itself. Some psychologists call this an ""ultimate concern"". Myself, I think of this top-level goal as a compass that gives direction and meaning to all the goals below it.

Some of you probably know that I'm keen on the idea of personal mission statements. I think *everyone* should have one -- especially folks who think FI might be in their future. A mission statement is like Duckworth's top-level goal: it acts as a compass. It helps you stay the course when things get stormy and dark. But it also helps you stay the course curing times of irrational exuberance, as well.

If you need help building a mission statement, check out the [mission statement builder](https://msb.franklincovey.com/) from FranklinCovey.

**===FINAL THOUGHTS===**

Why am I posting about this here instead of on my blog? Because I write about purpose all the time there. I beat the idea into the ground. To me, it's one of the three cornerstones to success -- financial or otherwise. (Those three keys to success are purpose, profit, and patience.) Besides, my readers tend to be less FI-focused. It's the financial independence I have to persuade them is important, not the purpose. Here it's the other way around

So, there you go. My challenge to you: **Find purpose. Don't blindly pursue FI. Figure out how money fits with your greater goals. But put it in its proper place.**",finance

financialindependence,Advice for an independent worker,"Hey FI! I've been following this community and you guys F*&amp;#ing inspire me. Thank you for letting me into your lives and now, if it please the internet... I'd like some advice/outside perspective on what I've got going on.

early 30s, single, secured VERY low rent in a high COL area which I need to be in for my work. I work independently doing my dream, a collection of positions that I have been busting my ass creating for 10+ years. This means that I am not pursuing financial independence so I can go do something else.  This means I am living my ideal day, every day and now I'm looking at the numbers to make it last.  So... basically the opposite of a programmer gritting their teeth through work, making 6 figures in his 20s.

Tracking my expenses has been the most difficult and also most rewarding task.  Its taken years, but I've finally found a system that works for me.

**Expenses**
Monthly my expenses (rounded up) average out to...

Food $200

Rent $550

Bills $150

Transportation $150

incidentals $150

Monthly health insurance is taken care of by my family because they are in the medical industry see me as a liability. There are a couple more layers of insurance I should buy for myself that would cover a lot of my personal belongings and work related business totaling approx $300 for the year.

**Savings**
I have my three month emergency fund and then some for a total of $4,300 in cash, checking, savings and some cds.

I am also lucky enough to have $81,000 in a Schwab managed account. This is basically a retirement account for me that my family put together. I never touch this and honestly I'm kind of scared of it.

I managed to increase my income by 30% this year and I was able to save 40% of my income in the last few months once I really got everything under control.

What do I do now? I live extremely frugally.  I would like to increase my income by another 30% this year, but maintaining my current level of income and savings would make me just as happy.  

Do I buy more CDs with my savings? Look for another savings account with a better interest rate?  Dump all my savings into the Schwab account? There is no employer matching, there is no side hustle, its just me.

Please be gentle. I know this is borderline LeanFIRE material but the Schwab account kind of bumps me into another echelon.",finance
personalfinance,Looking to cut down monthly costs. Some advice needed,"Hi /r/personalfinance,

I recently lost my job (early October) and thankfully I had enough money saved to be able to live fairly comfortably since then while job hunting. Despite having a healthy reserve of money, I'm still very aware of how much my monthly expenses are really hurting my pockets.

Total I'm out about ~1k a month in expenses while staying with my parents. That includes my student loans ($312) as well as my car payments (421+110 insurance) and the rest of my miscellaneous expenses. I plan on contacting the MyFedLoan folks and getting my monthly loan amount reduced until more money is coming in, but I'm wondering if there are any other cost saving measures I could use?

personalfinance,My tax returns have been re-routed towards my student loans for years. I don't know how to resolve this.,"I come to you humbly, as I have been very irresponsible with my student loans. I went into default multiple times, kept NO records and just kind of didn't take it that seriously. 




Beginning in, I believe, 2008, my Federal Tax Returns started going directly towards my (government) student loans. I believe I was in default at the time, but I can't say for sure... I just accepted this.

 


So for 8 years I haven't received my tax return. I never received any letters from anyone saying ""oh we took your return and applied it towards the balance of loan A"" or whatever. I only knew it was going to the government because my completed tax status would say so.

 


I have since gotten much more responsible and entered into repayment plans with my lenders over the past few years. I made all payments on time.

 


Late last year I became eligible to have all my loans consolidated and entered into an income driven repayment plan with Fed Loan. So I am on the right track...but will I ever be able to receive my tax return again?




I don't even know where to start and that's why I am here asking for your help.

 


To add to things, I got married in June. We have no dependents to claim.. and we really don't combine our incomes. 
I was told by people in passing that we can file separately...I am not sure how that works... I am pretty worried that his return will be taken, and put towards my loans... especially since he is in a lower tax bracket than I am and receives a pretty good return every year (for example last year my FR was like $344 and his was $1500 even though my salary is higher).

 


So my questions are: Where do I even start with becoming eligible to receive my tax returns again? Is this until all loans are paid? Who do I contact? What do I say?

 


I would also like to know if there is a way to protect my husband's return...
Just an FYI, I only owe about 8k total... so we're not talking a huge amount. 

I appreciate any advice or insight. Thanks guys and gals! 
p.s. I tried not to make a wall of text, but it doesn't appear to be showing line breaks on my end. I hope it looks ok on your end!            EDIT: Learned the difference between tax return and tax refund! Sorry for wrong terminology!",finance

personalfinance,$26k in student debt. How best to apply $17k gift from family member?,"Hi /r/personalfinance,

Throwaway so as not to tie financial information to main account. 

I graduated with $29,581.84 in debt in a package of subsidized and unsubsidized federal loans. Since graduating I've been employed full-time by my alma mater and have paid back $26,411.87 via monthly payments. I've paid a little over $8,000 altogether, but have only shrunk the balance by ~ $3,000. I'm returning to graduate school tuition-free due to my job, but my monthly pay will drop significantly as I'll be taxed as if my tuition costs were income. The interest will freeze on my subsidized loans, but not my unsubsidized loans. I will not have to make monthly payments on any of my loans until after I graduate. 

A family member is giving me the contents of a 529 that they opened for me when I was born, and told me it's a little over $17k. I intend to apply it all to my debt, and need advice on how best to do so. My loans are as follows;

Loan Balance | Sub/Unsub | Interest 
---------------|--------------|-----------
$13,287.94 | Unsub | 6.55%
$6,734.47 | Unsub | 6.55%
$1,728.80 | Unsub | 3.61%
$4,660.66 | Sub | 3.61%

My plan right now is to:

* Completely pay off $13k loan
* Pay off as much of $6k loan as possible with remainder of 529 gift
* Focus on eliminating remainder of $6k loan, followed by the $1.7k loan
* Ignore $4.6k loan until after I graduate, since it will not accrue interest

personalfinance,BofA platinum honors mortgage,"Me and my fiance are about to close on a house where most of the down payment is coming from her BofA account.  Since it's in excess of 100k she qualifies for their platinum honors interest rate which is nearly half a percent lower than what we locked into with our lender.

The thing is, doing some quick research online, you have to maintain 100k to qualify for this program and that money is for our down payment, we can't continue to maintain it.  We can refinance with them and lock a lower rate, they'll even waive the closing costs.  Am I missing the fine print somewhere?  It doesn't seem like we should need to continue to qualify, right?  I can't find anywhere that has information about this exact situation and it seems way too good to be true..  This is BofA after all...

Quick update:  I've had a minute to sit down and dig a little more into this and I can safely say there is nothing anywhere on bank of America's website or anywhere else that says they can give preferred customers a discounted interest rate on a home mortgage.

Alright, let me break down how our conversation went.  The guy doing our wire transfer was like ""woah, you know you qualify for platinum honors membership?"" then incorrectly explains to us ""We give discounted rates for mortgages"". He calls in the lending officer, we give him our down payment amount and cost of home, he says he could get us a 3.875% interest rate.  When he comes back, he says rates are up right now but if we wait a couple weeks he could lock us in at 3.875%.  Going to bank of America's mortgage calculator, their rate today for our loan would come with a 4.25% rate, barely lower than what we have.  Maybe he didn't want to outright say we can't get the lower rate and instead said he'll call us in a couple weeks when ""rates go down.""  Basically they're both full of shit, perhaps for different reasons, but somehow they were simultaneously overly optimistic about what we could qualify for.

Here's the thing, even if rates go down by that much, our current lender will refinance us and it will be much less hassle.  If I'm right, this was a waste of time.  We're neither being tricked nor getting a better deal.",finance

Option 1) don't pay any extra and accept the 4.25% interest rate and pay 1,027.17 to the monthly mortgage.

Option 2) pay $1,321.70 to lower our interest rate to 4.125%, bringing our monthly payments to $1,011.95.

Option 3) pay $2,898.14 upfront to lower our monthly mortgage to $996.84.

Now, my math skills are limited, but I was able to figure out that with option 2, it would take 7.2 years to recover the savings of paying up front, and with option 3, it would take 8 years.

What I'm not sure how to figure out is that we want to pay down debt as quickly as possible, so we intend to put extra money toward the mortgage (we checked, and there is no penalty for paying extra toward the principal). My question.

The home cost £170k. We have around £70k of equity. He's agreed to take £35k and walk away (we're both aware there are multiple options available. It have a written agreement on this being the way forward). 

I've seen the lender today and I can keep the outstanding £100k(ish) on the insanely good tracker we got back in 2008 (0.89%). However, the £35k I will essentially remortgage in order to free his cash will be on a rate of around 2%. I have an approval in principle and an appointment next week to decide what I do. 

I won't go into fine details of my salary and outgoings, but once I've paid the mortgage, utilities, council tax and other costs like travel, food, etc, I will be left with around £300 per month. 

I'm used to living on a lot more, so I appreciate I will have to adjust my living standard, but is it foolish to take the mortgage? Is this enough to account for unexpected costs? Should I focus more on saving for my child's future? 

I have a second option with the mortgage which is a complete remortgage on the current balance, plus the £35k of equity. It would be a 30-year term (versus the 16-year term in the option I already mentioned). This means I have a mortgage for longer, lose my insane interest rate... but have more cash every month (around £550). 

The bank/lender says option 1 is best, but that's an entirely long-term finance view. Obviously low rate &amp; short term is better. But practically I don't know if the remortgage and longer term is better for me?

I fully acknowledge that I should have done better research on this problem awhile ago. I got some bad information and didn't realize it. So now I am coming here.

My SO took out parent plus loans a few years ago that are in my FIL's name. Within the last year I've been working hard on getting control of our finances, and when the loans were coming out of deferrment about a year ago I had asked if those could be consolidated and put in my SO's name and forgiven through PSLF. The person I spoke to must have thought the loans were in my SO's name, advised me to consolidate to a different kind of loan eligible for ICR, and said they could then be forgiven. However, my FIL deferred before we could do anything, and these loans fell off my radar because in my head we would get them taken care of through PSLF eventually (bad call).

Well, now they are back on my radar, and I am correctly informed that the loans are not able to be put under my SO's name. Our goal is to get them out of my FIL's name as soon as possible. Plus, the loans are through Navient, and with all of the drama that's going on, I want to deal with Navient as little as possible. As of now, there is a total of about 40k in loans, and the two highest ones have an interest rate of 8.5%.

As of right now, my plan is to have my SO take out all available unsub loans for 17-18 which will be about 20k between Fall/Spring. I think we would probably be able to qualify for a 20k personal loan to cover the rest. The unsub loans would eventually be forgiven through PSLF.

Currently, we are on IBR with 2 dependents and file our taxes separately so our payments are 0. My SO should be on year 2 of qualifying PSLF payments.

Is this a reasonable plan? Is there something I'm overlooking? What ways could Navient try to screw me over that I should be aware of?

As a sidenote, I believe these loans were taken out in 09-10ish. Because they've been in deferrment this whole time, would these loans potentially be affected by the lawsuit?

personalfinance,Refinancing with a mortgage and a HELOC - what is the best options?,"My sister in-law lives in a townhouse in Arlington, VA (just outside of DC).  She is debating her options to reduce her monthly housing costs and requested that I ask the kind folks on /r/personalfinance.

She refinanced her first mortgage in 2014 (almost exactly 3 years ago).  She did that to get out of the mortgage insurance with the original FHA loan since the house value had increased so much in the first 2.5 years of ownership.  She then was able to get the HELOC to do some improvements (kitchen, floors, deck, basement stairs, landscaping retaining wall, driveway, and HVAC).

Current mortgage is $225k at 4.375% and the HELOC is $76k at 4%.  The HELOC rate and terms aren't bad but its the 1% minimum monthly payment that she is trying to avoid.  Proposed mortgage rate combining the two would also be at about 4.375% (though it increased yesterday on news from the fed). Combined prepaid and closing costs are between $5500 and $6600, higher if she has to pay a point or part to get a slightly lower rate.

The HELOC refinance option is free (the credit union covers the closing costs) and gets her 3.9% fixed interest rate on a home equity loan as opposed to the 4% variable of the HELOC.  Concern about this one is also getting a high enough appraisal that shows 80% loan to value to avoid PMI.  There are other programs that might offer higher LTV but she would need to find a CU that would let her join.

The townhouse is in northern VA where real estate prices are unreasonably high, so there is less concern about losing value and being underwater.  She is planning to own the house for a while.

Thank you all for any input you might have.",finance
personalfinance,Thoughts on buying a rental condo in this scenario?,"Short rundown of my financial picture:  

- 29 years old
- $67,500 salary (expect to increase quickly) 
- owe $11,000 on car at ~3.25%
- Student loans were paid off a few years ago, no CC debt
- $34,000 in 401k (I contribute 6% with 6% match).  
- Have a cash balance pension (currently small, but ramps up longer you stay with the company)
- 750+ credit score 
- Own 1 BR condo ($64k left on 15 year mortgage, purchase price was 90k. 3.55% interest rate)

The most significant thing there is my condo.  I purchased it well under market value due to some laws my state has on the books.  Basically they force developers to mark some units in newly built condo complexes as ""affordable"".  I took advantage of that when I was still working an entry level job and bought a condo worth about 200k for 90k.  No strings attached, except that I need to sell it at a similarly low price once I decide to move.  

My girlfriend is going to be moving in with me in a few months.  I already do well and make significantly more money then I need/spend.  I currently have $1000+ in excess money per month, should rise to $1500+ once the GF moves in (who I am serious with).  

I am thinking of purchasing a different condo (2 bedroom) now and renting it out, while remaining where I currently live.  Target price on the 2 BR condo would be 160-180k (targeting two specific complexes).  This would be a condo that I am buying to keep for life as a rental, but it might also be good to live in as a ""stopgap"" for a few years with a kid or two before buying a nice house to live in forever.

personalfinance,Discover Savings Transaction Limit,"Hi finance gurus!

**apologies if this was already asked... I searched to the best of my ability and couldn't find this anywhere**

I am 18 and recently set up a discover savings and checking account because of their great rates and customer service. Although I still love them, I have realized how they can maintain such good customer service and interest rates - they do not make it easy to know when you are about to incur a fee. I have two questions concerning this.

First, looking online and on the discover app, it appears that they do not clearly show when the federal limit of 6 transactions on a savings account will be reset. I can add up the transactions by history, but I have no idea when Discover resets this limit according to their policy. Do they reset at the start of each month? Every 30 days? I want to do everything in my power to avoid unnecessary fees.

Secondly, I have both a savings and checking account. I plan to have the majority of my funds in savings for obvious reasons, with the checking account having minimal funds for my occasional and minimal spending. Given that access to the checking account is mainly provided through discover's free debit card which appears not to have protective measures against stolen cards or just plain overspending, I was wondering if there was any way to make a Discover checking account simply refuse to provide funds when the charges exceed the funds in the account. I called customer service with this concern and they said it was not possible, which I find appalling and hope I can get a more satisfactory answer from Reddit. (I am well aware of Discover's overdraft protection, but that would give a crook with my debit card access to not only the minimal funds in my checking account, but also my savings account with 10k in it (yes I said 10k. I am a very good saver)). I want to be able to use my debit card without fear of excessive spending fees or of losing my savings funds to a crook. If the answer winds up being to get a different debit card, please recommend one with this kind of protection available, no maintenance fees, and perks if possible!

I've been browsing this sub for months and it has really helped me turn my financial life around.

My question is around a ""Share IRA"" I am making essentially no interest on through my credit union, and what to do with it. A guy at my CU has been excellent and is very accessible, but I am looking for outside advice as I love this sub.

I recently rolled an old 403 (b) into my 401(k) with Fidelity through my employer (not vested for three years, may not be able to reach that as I may return to school to advance in my field). I contribute 5%, have $3,700 in a,Target 2055.

The ""Share IRA"" has approximately  $1,500 in it. I was previously putting in $90/month but reduced it to $10 as I am building an Emergency Fund. The CU has different time frames (3 months, 6 months, 2 years), and the interest rate goes up accordingly. If I kept it with the CU the rate is .75%, and would gain approximately $21, which isn't thrilling.

**TL;DR** - 25 y/o with almost $15k in credit card debt.

I've been trying to learn more about debt consolidation, and what options I might have, to get a lower interest rate/lower payments (I know this means longer term)/etc. I'm trying to get some breathing room in my paychecks to have an opportunity to build a savings while paying my debt off (so that if something unexpected occurs like a medical emergency or job loss or what have you - I can use savings instead of just piling debt back on)

The most popular option seems to be a balance transfer to another credit card with a 0% intro APR promotion.

- **How can I find a card that's doing this, that will actually let me transfer my balance?**

I have a Chase Freedom card ($9500 balance) and an Amazon Rewards Visa ($5000 balance) - also through Chase.

From what I read, a bank typically won't let you transfer from one of their cards to another. I checked anyway, and was told I had no offers available.

I signed up for a Capital One card offering 0% APR for the first year (only $3000 limit, but figured even if I can only do that, it's $3k that won't be getting interest applied)

However, when I went to Balance Transfers, it told me I had no offers available. This was close to a year ago so that 0% APR ends in March.

**- How can I find a card that will actually let me do a balance transfer?**

**- Would it make sense to even do so if I can't transfer the whole balance?**

**- Am I just trying to do a balance transfer incorrectly or something? It doesn't seem like I'm actually ever able to do a transfer; I figured since a lot of folks suggest it, that it'd be a common thing that people can just do.**",finance

investing,Feed my confirmation bias: Bond Guru Who Called Last Bear Market 40 Years Ago Says Go Long,"&gt;Using an out of fashion metric known as the velocity of money, the Austin, Texas-based economist says he’s convinced the rout since the election of Donald Trump is just a bump in the road for an extended rally.

&gt;The velocity is the rate at which money circulates in the economy and is usually measured as a ratio of nominal gross domestic product over the total supply. In other words, it measures how well an economy is able to generate transactions, and in turn growth, with an incremental increase of money in the financial system.


&gt;The problem is money velocity in the U.S. (as measured by M2) has fallen to a record-low of 1.44, meaning every dollar spent circulates only 1.44 times in the economy, down from over 2 times at the peak in 1997. To Hunt and other adherents, that shows even after years of unprecedented money printing by the Federal Reserve, inflation will remain subdued and elusive, largely because the private sector has chosen to hoard, and not spend, the money in the years after the financial crisis.

**Current income: ~$120,000 annually + husband ~$55,000 annually.**  Important to note, I did have 2 pay cuts in 2016 (my shift differential and overtime pay rates were cut, reducing my annual pay by ~8%. $120k is a safe annual estimate for the future, but I am *very* concerned my wages will face additional cuts in the upcoming years.

**We are both 31 years old and just got married in 2016.** We have yet to file our taxes and are unsure if we will file jointly or separately, I will be crunching those numbers soon. 


I have been and will continue to contribute 4% into my 401K which is equally matched by my employer. My husband has a pension plan with his union, he also has a 401k that he contributes to, but the company does not match any contributions. 

We have ~$60,000 in retirement savings and additionally we have ~$70,000 in traditional savings and within the next 6 months will have ~$100,000 in traditional savings. The ~$100k figure in traditional savings will then be used to put a 20% down payment on a house and still maintain a healthy emergency fund. Currently we do not have children but will start trying in Fall of 2017 after we have purchased a house. 

**My question**
Should I focus on maxing out both of our 401k contributions or focus on paying student loans (could have them paid off in ~4 years)?

My personal debate: 

* If we max out our 401k contributions, we are reducing our taxable income, and thus saving ~28% instantly, while also earning ~8% give or take on the 401k investments. If we do this, we will have to also save ~$150k for the IRS tax bomb for when we let the student loans ride out until forgiveness occurs in ~20+ years. 

The 'worst case scenario' part of my brain worries about saving this money and that it is not 'secured'. That is to say: if we save it, and I crash my car/end up with huge bills/have a lawsuit/etc that money would have to be used, and we wouldn't have the money for the IRS and would lose the house/everything we've saved for. Because I have already faced pay cuts in the past year, there is a potential that once I save money for the tax bomb, if I were to then lose it in a worst case scenario, I would not have a way to re-earn it in time to pay the tax man.  

The other 'worst case scenario' is that the student loan forgiveness plan itself is not guaranteed. The government can alter the terms of this program and maybe my loans won't be forgiven in 20 years. 

* Alternatively, I could pay down my student loans. This would take an estimated 4 years. But that is 4 years of paying full taxes on our incomes, and not saving much for retirement. (I would still do my company's matching contribution and my husband would still have his pension). But our current retirement fund is already lower than I would like it to be, and we are 31 years old now, and would be 35 before we started aggressively saving towards retirement once these loans are paid off. And again with my career, I don't know how much of a pay reduction I'll have in the next five years.",finance

I currently have around $45,000 in savings.  My initial goal was to continue saving a down payment on a home, but would it be better to pay down my student loans?  Paying down my student loans means I'm losing a lot less in interest, but it would mean no more money for a down payment - pushing home ownership out for several more years (meaning more rent).  Also, a few of my coworkers have been suggesting I start investing in a back-up retirement plan, but any money directed for this purpose means less for the first two options.

I wonder if this will accrue too much unnecessary interest as oppose to just repaying it using the standard repayment plan (my monthly bill is $220 as of now)

there should be a way to calculate this somehow (after youtubing and researching a bit I figured this could be a time value of money problem but I still can't figure it out, I'm still trying to learn this) 

So Reddit, can you point me in the right direction? my income should be anywhere from 2,500 to 3000 a month this year and will increase in the future.

Thanks a lot in advance!",finance
personalfinance,"Inherited house from Grandma, wondering about possible taxes on profit from selling it.","My three cousins and I each got 25% of my grandmothers estate when she passed away 3 months ago.

personalfinance,I Have 75K in Student Loans (~32k Federal and ~43k Private) in the form of 11 separate Loans. I have some questions about refinancing and consolidation.,"I've tried to do all of the research I can about consolidation and refinancing, but I’m not sure how that works with my current situation.

I have 11 different Loans totaling about 75k.

* 1 Private Loan (43k)
* 5 Subsidized Stafford Federal Loans (21k)
* 5 Unsubsidized Stafford Federal Loans (11k)

[I've attached an image of the loans I have with current interest rates, amount left on loan, and monthly payments.](http://imgur.com/a/A4iMF)

As you can see some loans are actually larger than what they were taken out for because of the high interest.

I make 43k a year after takes, 401k, and health insurance. Typical monthly take home is ~3500

Typical bills:

* Rent: 1000
* Utilities: 200
* Groceries: 400
* Train Pass: 450
* Savings Account: 200
* Credit Card: 100
* Student Loans: 550
* Personal Care: 100
* Misc: 200

That’s a good month. I’m usually exceeding my budget on groceries and gas/car expenses here and there. But in general, I don’t have a ton of disposable income after the fact. 

My usual minimum combined payment is about $560/month. I could probably put another 100 dollars per month towards this. 

My real question is what’s my best option for refinancing/consolidation? Can I consolidate the Subsidized separately from the Unsubsidized and keep the low interest rate for the Subsidized and then refinance the higher interest rate to something more manageable?

Should I try to knock out the individual loans one at a time?

Any advice would be appreciated!",finance
personalfinance,"Looking for a critical eye on what I've done so far, and open to suggestions","Three years ago I was making about $30k/yr and had no savings, so everything that I've done has been in the last few years.  I'm very new to the whole ""trying to be a responsible adult"" thing, so I'm curious to see opinions on my progress so far. 

I'm living in the CA bay area, making about $115k/yr with $2600/mo going to rent, water, electricity and gas.    I pay $150/mo towards student loans with a balance of approximately $31k with a fixed interest rate of 2.1% (hence not being in a hurry to pay them off).  No car loan or significant credit card debt.  

I'm also fully supporting my girlfriend while she's a full-time student getting a bachelor's degree. 

I'm putting $400/mo (after taxes) into my Fidelity account, and a 1% contribution into my unmatched 401(k) (with my thinking being that if we start matching, I'll crank that up to the maximum), and had a bit of a windfall at the beginning of the year that has allowed me to kickstart my account. 

My investment breakdown is as follows… most of the individual companies I bought into were just to have a few shares because I believe in them or thought they were reasonable for small-scale investing, but going forward I have no interest in holding individual equities without a damned good reason, since I have no reason to believe that I have more than the faintest idea what I'm doing. 

Anyway, holdings as follows: 

AAPL - 10 shares: +4.22% since August 2015

ATVI - 15 shares: +30.965 since August 2015

DIS - 5 shares: -8.82% since November 2015

EA - 19 shares: +12.35% (aggregate) since a mix of August and December 2015 (currently subject to a stop/limit order since I don't want to hold this any more)

FBSOX - 116 shares: (purchased this week)

FRESX - 119 shares: (purchased this week)

FSMEX - 160 shares: (purchased this week)

FSRPX - 24 shares: +6.78% since November 2015 (plus small reinvestments of little note)

FUSVX - 440 shares: (purchased this week)

NVDA - 15 shares: +121.56% since June 2016

WM - 12 shares: +8.52% since June 2016.

Cash to invest (separate from $10,000 emergency fund): approx $70k. 

Part of me thinks the right move is to just launch the remaining cash into FUSVX, but I know that I should also probably start diversifying away from just having equities. On the other hand, I'm still reasonably young and have a lot of ground to cover to make up for the savings I didn't do when I was younger, so aggression seems reasonably prudent. 

I was originally planning on using most of the above as a down payment towards a house, but I feel like it'd be prudent to see what happens with the mortgage interest tax deduction and taxes in general over the next year or so before I make that sort of commitment.

My experience has shown that people will typically get to work more with this guideline rather than less. Where before I was not allowed to work more than 40 hours and was typically sent home at 39.5 hours, here I could work 45 or 50 and it did not matter. So it was easier for me to work more hours than it was with a 40 hour overtime rule. Does that make sense? If not, please let me know!""

I have been googling for an hour trying to figure it out and I cannot find ANYTHING that says 56 hours for overtime. I looked at fact sheets, the FOL website, and the actual written OT law (ugh) and cannot find anything.

So my thought was to replace our $1,500 monthly payment (includes escrow and HOA, 15-year fixed) with a lower payment:


Current home:

House value: $215,000

Mortgage balance: $113,000

HELOC balance: $16,000

Payment: $1,500 with 10 years remaining


New home:

House value: $150,000

Balance after 50% down payment: $75,000

Payment: $780 (includes escrow, no HOA) with 15 years remaining


This will give us some breathing room and allow us to not live like college students while we're living on one income - the new mortgage payment would be about 18% of my take-home pay. We have no debt other than the current HELOC, but don't have much cash available in non-retirement accounts.


Does this make sense, and/or are there options I am not seeing? I am not interested in refinancing to a 30-year mortgage. We don't want to move but I can't see what else to do. Thank you in advance for any insight.

EDIT 1: Thanks for the replies everyone. I think I'm realizing that the costs of realtors/closing/fees may seriously offset any gains from a shorter term/lower interest rate. We may consider staying, refinancing to a 30-year, and then paying down the mortgage faster once we're able to.",finance

Both of our names are on the mortgage. She is of limited means, and will have trouble paying her half of the mortgage AND rent at her new place.  

**Here's my situation**  
  
* I can pay the mortgage on my own. It will be VERY tight, but I can pick up extra shifts, I'll make it. I'm looking for roommates to offload some of the stress.  
* We live in a west-coast city with out-of-control property values. 10-14% YoY. That's why we bought. They continue to rise, for now. The APY on the loan is 3.67%. The fed is raising rates, and is expected to do so multiple times this year.   
* I CANNOT qualify to take out a mortgage on my own to buy her out. 
* There are NO pieces of property in town that I could afford to buy. 
* Selling now would result in a loss, as I'd be responsible for costs of selling.   

**These are the things I'm somewhat certain of, but correct me if I'm wrong:**   
 
* The bank doesn't care that one person doesn't want to pay anymore. They care about getting paid, otherwise they foreclose. There's no way to ""take her name off the mortgage"" without taking out a second mortgage and buying her out (Not an option, see above)  
* Neither one of us can force the other to sell the house
* Because we don't have a tenants-in-common agreement, her interest in the property is 50%, regardless of how much she contributes going forwards.  
* The simplest scenario going forward would be renting the house out. Split the maintenance costs, split the proceeds.

  
**She is willing to:**  
  
* Pay for 1-2 months of her share of the mortgage  
* Pay for certain improvements (same dollar amount as I would) that would get the house into rent-able shape    
   
**Here's what I need help with**  
    
* Is there an agreement that she could sign that would determine equity share post-hoc? 
* If worst comes to worst, are there any legal avenues to making her pay her half? 
* If we were to rent the house, how would our mortgage change? Would it involve a new mortgage? Adjusting the rate?. I know insurance would go up as well...",finance

You’re not required to charge interest if the loan is for less than $10,000, or up to $100,000 if the borrower’s investment income for the year is less than $1,000.

personalfinance,Help me understand why Debt Avalanche is good.,"I always read that Debt Avalanche is the best way to pay off a loan but I'm having a hard time understanding it.  
So it's said that making payments on the highest interest loan you have will save you money in the long run.

If you have a loan of $5000 at 5% and a loan of $10,000 at 3% they say paying on the $5000 loan is the way to go. (Simply because the interest rate is higher, regardless of the balance)
But if I look at this, I see the $5000 loan will generate $250 in interest, yet the $10,000 loan will generate $300 in interest over the course of the year.


Yet still, people insist all you need to look at is the interest rates. So to make it more extreme, the $5000 loan is now only $500. It will only generate $25 in interest but the $10,000 still generates $300 in interest. 
How is Debt Avalanche better then calculating which loan generates more interest at any given pay cycle?


On MyGreatLakes, using custom allocation, it shows exactly which loan has currently generated the most amount of interest. To me it just makes more sense to make a larger payment on the token that is generating the most amount of interest but perhaps I am missing the bigger picture here.


*edit* This is all assuming every payment you make clears out the interest balance on all loan tokens before applying principal as it is done with MyGreatLakes.

gaming,I feel like not enough people played Rise of the Tomb Raider,"I have a PS4, so was a bit miffed that Microsoft got SquareEnix to agree to one year exclusivity. But I think even SquareEnix would be regretting the decision now since the sales of the game on PS4 are no where near what they were for the rebooted Tomb Raider in 2013. That version sold more than 6m units, with the lion's share of 2.42m on PS4. In contrast, Rise of the Tomb Raider has sold 3m units and only 1.18m units on PS4. 

The only reason this bothers me is because (imo) Rise of the Tomb Raider is a vastly superior game. It's excellent on every level and so damn polished. It's right up there with Uncharted 4 quality.

personalfinance,Low APR vs High APR repayments on 1 CC,"I have a CC with a balance on it at an interest rate of 20.24%.  I was offered to transfer other CC debt to the account at a permanent 5.99% balance transfer rate.  Now my statement shows two balances, one at 20.24% and one at 5.99%.  Last month I was able to pay more than the total balance due on the 20.24% including that month's minimum due amount.

This statement shows they divided up my payment to a portion of the 20.24% and the 5.99%, keeping the 20.24% balance alive where they can collect higher interest per month than I intended.

I emailed them and one response says they direct first to the min due, then to the LOW Apr before directing anything to the high APR.  

I emailed back asking that this be fixed by directing the necessary funds first to eliminate the high APR balance before directing to the low APR balance, after the min amount was taken.

personalfinance,[Debt] Want some quick/basic advice for paying down my student loans. Which loan to target first / consolidation of loans,"Background: 

23 years old, living at home with parents for 2 weeks each month. I spend the other 2 weeks away for work and get to stay in company housing. I get 25 dollars a day for housing allowance, and only have to spend 15 dollars on the housing for the 2 weeks. I don't have any major expenses besides 100 bucks a month for food and 50 for gas. I really don't exceed a couple hundred bucks a month. I earn about 2700 a month from 2 jobs. 

I have 1 shared visa credit card through my local credit union that I only make small purchases with so I can pay it off each month to build credit. I am also added to my mother's Costco Citi credit card and use it to purchase fuel each month, and don't spend more than 50 bucks (maybe around 35 to 40) per month. I also pay that off in full each month cause its just to build credit, and its also in case of emergency. 

I have 1,100 saved in an emergency fund, and a few thousand in Savings. I did spend a couple thousand for job specific gear and now each month starting this last month has been going straight to savings. I plan on keep adding about 300 dollars each paycheck to the emergency fund to reach the 3-6 months of expenses, and plan to move out of parents house later this year. 

So my student loans are through Sallie Mae and now Navient for my government loans. I have the following loans:

**Navient:** 

* Sub $3500 at 3.4%
* Sub $1814.05 at 3.860%
* Sub $1610 at 4.66%
* Unsub $2687.53 at 6.8%
* Unsub $5272.17 at 3.86%
* Unsub 6442.85 at 4.6%

**Sallie Mae:**

* $26,717.22 at 6.375%
* $24,342.96 at 9.125%
* $16,537.02 at 3.875%

Navient payments start this month and Sallie Mae payments start in February. From reading around I understand the best and most given advice is the Avalanche method where you work on the loan with the highest interest rate, which is going to be Sallie Mae's 9.125% loan. I wanted to ask about if I should really look into consolidating my Navient loans, and perhaps even the Sallie Mae loans. I think the Sallie Mae interest rates are fairly decent besides the 9% loan, and the rest of the Navient loans are rather small and a small spectrum of interest rates. 

TL;DR: Want advice about consolidating Navient loans, how much extra I should really throw at the loan I am targeting each month, and which loan I should target first. Really my money is to be thrown at the student loans and the rest of it into savings to move out and prepare for living on my own, including expenses like vehicle maintenance, rent, cell phone bill, etc.

personalfinance,"I have no student loans, however, I owe a lot of money to my former university. What are some things I can do as a twenty-year-old to pay back the money I owe?","After high school, I immediately went to Virginia to attend a four-year public university to study mechanical engineering. At this university, I spent a total of two complete years (four semesters) studying. I returned last semester (Fall 2016) to continue my education but I had to leave after only attending for less than five weeks for reasons both personal and academic. My school said that since I was there past the first day of classes I have to pay them tuition for the entire semester at a prorated amount which adds up to $17,000.00. My parents already paid somewhere near $12,000.000 on a monthly tuition management program until the day I had to leave school. I was not made aware of any of these charges until after I was dismissed. It seems now that the personal and academic reasons I had for leaving have now subsided and I am looking to go back to school or rather transfer to another four-year university. After sending in my application to several universities I went to send my official transcript from my previous university. It was then I was notified that I had financial holds on my account and had to pay a remainder of slightly over $5,000.00 in order to send my transcript. 

Now here is where my question comes into play. My father lost his job and is currently working as a cab driver. Both my parent's income combined is barely making ends meet and we are living paycheck to paycheck. My former university said that my scholarships and federal financial aid cannot be used considering I didn't attend the entire semester. Although I can work, there would be no way for me to make enough money to pay the $5,000.00 in time for me to send in my application to transfer to another university. I can try to take out a loan however after discussing this with my parents we decided that taking a loan would be better suited as a last resort in the event I needed one to afford the tuition and fees at the university I plan on transferring into. Up until now my scholarships, federal financial aid, and parents have been able to afford my education.

As a twenty to twenty-one-year-old, what can I do to pay back my former university in a quick manner that would not require pulling out a loan or selling a kidney to the black market?

Thank you, everyone, for the help.

personalfinance,Theoretical 401k Loan Down Payment discussion,"A co-worker and I were out tonight discussing the merits/pitfalls of 401k Loans for a first time home buyer, as he is looking to buy this year. While we both agree that its better to save cash, he brought up some interesting points I'd like some input on.

He is looking to buy a $300k single family home. He has $15k today for a down payment. His broker has found him loans with 1% at closing + about $180/month for PMI with this down payment. 

If he can put 10% down he can prepay 1.2% for PMI at closing, and have NO monthly PMI payment, with the chance that the seller will cover closing costs. This saves about $10,000 in PMI money if the seller doesn't pay closing costs vs 5% down by our rough estimates.

Our Company's 401k Loan does not default if you are fired or leave the company, payments continue as normal, with an interest rate of 3.75%, paid to yourself.

If he takes a $15,000 Loan from his 401k and treats it like that $15,000 is invested in bonds (for the purposes of balancing his portfolio) I can't see a downside to taking this loan. Interest rates won't be going down any time soon, nor do they have much lower to go, so there is a lot of interest rate risk in bond funds in general. In treating the loan money as a bond, he is basically buying a bond from himself. He is protected from the interest rate risk of a broader bond fund, and since he left the money which was allocated to stocks alone he hasn't lost out on any market gains. At 3.75% he will be beating the last 5 years of our bond funds return as well (past performance, not a indicator of future performance, I know...)

Am I missing something here? This seems like a low risk way to save about $10,000 in PMI for him over the next 5 years, without missing out on the compound growth of his 401k. The only situation I can see him losing out on, would be if the market absolutely tanks, he won't have that bond money available to reallocate into stocks.",finance
personalfinance,My Blank Slate,"I am going to be 19 on Sunday, I am setting up my 401k tomorrow. I make $10.25 an hour full time and I have $1,232.47 in my checking account. I'm looking at a possible $0.75/hr promotion in the next month (Woo :3). I am a business tech support for a nationally hated ISP, and we are understaffed which means overtime avaliable all day every day up to 13 hours in one shift.

My short term goals with more context: 
Starting this fall I will be attending college locally for an Engineering or Business Major (Undeclared) and a minor in Photography. I am living at home with a small rent fee of $200 which includes food. My university is only about 3 miles away and only costs about 5.5k a year. My current job will pay up to 2k a semester depending upon my grades and hours worked, down to about 1k.

I currently don't have and major expenses and I am single. My 2001 Corolla is paid for and reliable. Out of that $1,200 I have in my checking account I would like to invest $750, I just installed an app called Acorns from a recomendation but it won't be authorized by my Credit Union until Monday or Tuesday. Is there a better place for that $750 to go? 

In about 3 months I will be getting a credit card that I will immideatly set autopay to full on, and in about six months I will have an emergency fund of 2k. Deducting another 2k between now and then for unforseen expenses, dates, and just general entertainment, should I be putting whats left over into short term investments like Acorns?

My long term goal is to build an castle out of concrete and rebar powered by wind and solar on an acropolis, have a supercar, a Natural gas hybrid truck with a watermeth kit, and a very nice motorcycle. I want to fund my dream of creating a battery powered turbine flight suit that functions similar to how Iron Man's does, which will obviously cost several million if not more just to get the battery tech needed. Now I'm not here to debate the plausibility of all this, but where should I start?

personalfinance,Question about Loan Payments,"Hi PF .... Just wanted to get some insight to ensure we are on the right track. Using a throwaway username here so that friends/family cannot see my question.

My Wife and I will both turn 30 this year.
Collectively, we earn about $160K per year
We live in NYC, and are moving next month to an apartment that we will rent for $1975 per month

No cars, No kids.

For the past 4 years we have been aggresively paying off her student loans to the tune of approx $1K per month. With the remaining balance of loans just around $8K, we are expecting that the payments will be done by September. (woo hoo!)

We still owe her brother $35K for a loan that he cosigned when my wife was a freshman, and that he totally paid off so that it would not have an affect on his interest rate when he applied for a morgage. Its a very cool thing that he did, his only criteria is that we pay him back (interest free) by the time is first daughter is ready for college (which will be 11 years from this September.)

Also... we put about $1,000 away a month for liquid savings, and have been contributing about 10% of our salaries to 401ks.

My question is this.... What is the best way to pay her brother back the $35K. I have been reading up on opening up a 529 plan for his daughter and trying to throw the money into this trust. Is this the smartest move? Or should we just continue with payments of $1000 per month for the next 35 months until its paid off in full?",finance
personalfinance,Personal loan on commuter motorcycle,"I recently moved to a new town to start my first real, stable job out of school. I'm making decent money, but the closest rental property I could find leaves me with a 50 mile daily commute, or 100 miles if I have a long day and need to come home on lunch to let my dog out. Next year I plan on buying a house, which are available *extremely* cheap here as long as I can handle a similarly long commute (rural area). So I've done the math, and buying a motorcycle just to ride to work should save me an estimated $150 a month on gas, consistently, every month for at least the next few years. 

EDIT since a lot of people have commented on the commute: It's an extremely rural area, 25 miles each way only takes 20 minutes of interstate driving, which I actually kind of enjoy as it gives me a chance to relax/unwind. It's very rare that I have to make an extra trip home for lunch. I could live within walking distance of work but housing is significantly more expensive and I'd have to rent vs. being able to buy an extremely cheap house outside of town.

I understand most traditional lenders view motorcycles as no more than a toy, and thus probably aren't very keen on loaning me the ~$3000 I hope to spend, even though in my case I'd be buying it primarily for practical/financial considerations. By limiting my monthly payments to the amount I'm saving in gas, I can reasonably expect to pay it off in 24 months, so financially it seems like a no brainer to me as long as I can find a decent loan.

Some details on my employment/credit history (or lack thereof): I'm 26, work full time as an engineer for a government agency, By the time I start applying for loans I'll have worked there only 3 months and hope to have $500-1000 saved for a down payment. I make $50k/year gross and my housing costs are $600/month. I have zero debts, and my only credit history is two small car loans, one of which I paid back early.

What do you think /r/personalfinance? Is it reasonable to expect reasonable interest rates in my situation (and what would you consider reasonable)? Should I be looking towards banks/credit unions, or specialized motorcycle lenders? Should I go for an unsecured personal loan? Or could I put the motorcycle (which is most likely going to be purchased used, in a private sale), or my primary vehicle (which I recently paid off), up for collateral?

*Note: I'm not new to riding, I've owned several bikes over the years but had to sell them to go back and finish college. Please refrain from any lectures on the safety aspect of riding motorcycles.

**TL;DR:** Is a motorcycle a reasonable purchase when it pays for itself in gas savings? Do I have any chance of getting an unsecured loan at a reasonable interest rate?",finance
personalfinance,Is home equity loan for unemployed homeowner possible (Mass.)?,"A 50 year old friend of mine has a Ph.D. in the life sciences and a good history of employment in labs and academia.  The most recent lab he worked at was closed when the university lost some grant funding, and he was let go.  (He was non-tenured.)

He’s got a good history of publications and it seems likely that he’ll be able to land another similar job within the next year, earning 70k to 100k.

He had relatively little savings, and a house worth about 450k with a 250k mortgage balance.  

He’s been working crappy McJobs to have some income, but he’s exhausted his (undersized) savings and his $1,400 mortgage payment is a real burden.

He believes that he’d be unable to do a cash out refinance due to the CFPB’s new “ability to repay” rules governing mortgage issuance.  Also, he locked in a great interest rate that he'd hate to lose.

It it likely that a mainline lender would give him a home equity line of credit under these circumstances, or would the “ability to repay” rules keep that from happening?",finance
personalfinance,To buy or not to buy a house?,"I may have gotten myself into a mess.

I graduated college 7 months ago, landed a really nice job 3 months ago. Unfortunately this really nice job is 60 minutes away, between 70-75 if I leave after 4:30 or it's raining/snowing. To me that's a huge waste of time, and I'm not a fan of long drives at this time in my life. To help deal with this my fiance and I were looking for places to live near our work (she commutes 40 minutes herself.)

After a bit of off and on searching over the two years we finally found a house. It was within our pre-approval range so everything seemed right with the world, until I saw the monthly payment. We got two approvals in a similar range, one is $80/month cheaper and has lower closing cost, but the other has .30% lower interest rate. Still working on getting costs laid out for us.
I'm salary and take home about $1540 biweekly (after taxes, 401k, etc.). She is hourly making $12/hr but only working 20/hrs a week, which brings her to $400 after taxes. Work for her won't be full time till the spring. Even then she's working for a startup so I'm a bit hesitant as it's only 3 months old.

The loans we got approved for would either be 1523/month or 1444/month. Though we could afford this with one of my paychecks, we obviously haven't included student loans, car payments, or car insurance which is where I start to get scared. I'm going to round numbers up so they are easy to see, but are still accurate.


Payment | Monthly cost
---|---
My student loan | $425
My Car payment | $265
My insurance | $150
Her car payment | $165
Her car insurannce | $190
Her student loans | $200

That's already $1395/month which I think is a bit much of our expenses when we aren't even including all of the usual expenses of owning a house like water, internet, electricity (electric heating, so a nice big electric bill), food, gas for cars, and more stuff that I'm probably not thinking of right now. I'm supposed to meet with the realtor tomorrow to go over the offers that the two banks gave us and possibly make an offer for the house.

Personally I'm conflicted, one family is telling me it's a bad idea and that we shouldn't bother with a house right now. The other is telling me I'm overreacting and that this is normal, or ""that's life"". My fiance wants to put the bid in now, but I'm worried we are going to end up house poor. Especially since the loan is going entirely on me. Title of the house is in both of our names, but loan is 100% in my name.

We had talked about living relatively poor for 2-3 years to try and pay off all of our loans asap, but this is very counter-intuitive. Though it would be nice for us to actually be able to live together and have decent commutes.

You guys know a lot more about this stuff than I do, so I was hoping you guys would be able to help put this in perspective.",finance

personalfinance,[Planning] When would YOU buy an apartment given my situation?,"Hi PF, 

Long time lurker. I've gotten to the point in my life where I'm finally starting to consider the possibility of purchasing a home. Here are some details on my current financial setting:

-Single

-Location: Massachusetts

-Income: 57k/year

-Take home after taxes and deductions: 34,392k/year (2,866k/month)

-Debts: 

---- Car: 14k ($360/month)

---- Student loans: 33k (interest rates vary from 3-6.8%, $400/month)

I currently live with my parents; no rent or utility payments. I pay for food, gas, and personal entertainment. (Combined total about $300/month). I have been paying debt more aggressively due to not having to pay for rent ($400/month for car, $500/month for school).

I've been working for 2 years since graduating from school. I may obtain a new job that would pay 70k/year before taxes, but I am currently operating on the premise that I will remain with my current income for the foreseeable future in regards to house planning.

Here are some points of improvement I can engage upon:

1) Reduce food spending (by cooking at home, etc)

2) Increase salary

3) Engage on activities that would increase my overall net-worth (obtain career-related certifications, invest in the market, etc)

Other than the above, I currently do not have an emergency fund - I simply look at my savings and consider ""I can subtract whatever needed to cover emergencies..."", which admittedly is NOT a good mindset. 

So, given the above information, how would YOU feel about the prospect of buying an apartment?

I love this state, and would like to stay here for as long as I can. Obviously, job security is never certain, but as far as things I *can* control, I feel confident about being able to remain employed. 

Some questions to consider:

1) How much would you spend on an apartment? 

2) How much of a downpayment would you be willing to provide?

3) And *when* would you look into buying an apartment? (e.g. when all loans are paid off, etc).

Again, please assume you're in my shoes and are considering the prospect of purchasing an apartment or home. 

For reference, my baseline is probably around the $200k mark as far as homes go. 

Thanks for reading, and thanks for any feedback!

Once the sheet has all the needed information, it will automatically calculate your expected refund, or, in which case you underpaid, what you owe the IRS. I have not done extensive testing on this, so the refund number might be off, but it should be in the ballpark. 

Another nice feature is that you're able to see which portions of your income are being taxed in each tax bracket, and you're able to easily see what tax bracket you fall into. Our sample case falls into the 25% bracket. 

I'm hoping this sheet will help somewhat demystify how our taxes are done. I also recommend reading the IRS instructions for the [1040](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1040gi.pdf) form. They are surprising detailed.

Option:  $299,999 Duplex (2x 2Bed 2 Bath).  Close to downtown in a hot neighborhood near downtown and close to my office.  

Currently renting at $1650, and $1000.  The higher cost unit is the one I would live in. The lower cost one needs a facelift to get to a equal rent (20-40K), might be a good investment but not a priority.

personalfinance,Help! My parents are still trying to claim me as a dependent on their tax returns.,"So long story short I am 19 and have lived on my own since I was 18. I have a part time job that I work about 25 hours a week on top of my full time college classes. I cover over half of my living expenses and have my own permanent address (not a dorm or anything affiliated with the college) I made close to 14,000 of Fed income. I started to do my tax returns and was almost finished when my mom contacted me telling me a w2 for a previous job I worked at was sent to my parents address. I told her that it would be helpful if she would send me a picture so I can get the info and add it onto the return. I also reminded her that they should not claim me as a dependent this year because last year they did without my knowledge and I was screwed over with my return. She sent me the W2 and a text saying to wait to file my taxes because she wanted to talk to their financial advisor to see if it would be better for them to claim me on their taxes. I explained this would mean me losing 2 grand in my return ( I entered all the info both ways just to see) and she said to just wait because it may be better. So we are currently arguing because her tax guy told her that they would lose 850 on their return if they didn't claim me. I said that I couldn't justify giving up 2,000 dollars for them to get 850 when I've worked so hard to be where I'm at and independent. Am I wrong? I thought they couldn't even legally claim me if I did not live with them and I payed over half my expenses. Their argument was they payed for some of my insurance, but I'm fairly confident that doesn't surpass the amount I pay each month for my living cost, nor should it negate the fact I don't live with them. Does insurance even count as a living expense? What do I do? 

Update: I talked to them and they eventually said they would not try to claim me so I am going to go ahead and file. Thank you for all your responses and advice!",finance

solar,Problems with small 12v system,"Hi! I really appreciate anyone's help on this. Specific information about solar is a little sparse out there on the web.

With my shoestring budget, I have cobbled together a small 12v solar system on my RV. Two 80w 12v panels wired in parallel to two 6v 225 ah batteries wired in series (I was shooting for around 100-150ah but these were on sale). The panels came with a cheap looking charge controller which I am using for now until I can afford a better one. I had the system hooked up for a few days with the light on indicating panels were charging batteries.

I was powering a few led lightbulbs in the evening and occasionally a 12v water pump (8a) through a 600w inverter. On the third day the controller inficated the batteries were low. A test with a multimeter indicated about 10.5v. So I unplugged the inverter and waited... two days without power and no change to the battery state of charge. So finally I got fed up and bypassed the controller hooking the panels direct to the batteries. After around three hours the batteries tested at 11.5v.

Another thing to consider is that when I installed the panels, to make sure I got the polarity right I tested them with a multimeter and they showed pretty much exactly 12v. Now some places I am reading that should be 17v for 12v rated panels. I am off the grid in Oregon and looking forward to being able to rely on solar for my basic needs.

personalfinance,Passively Managed Funds like Vanguard Mutual Funds At Risk of Bankruptcy,"In Economics a simple concept that's taught is that less stimulation = less growth. If funds like Vanguard's mutual/ETF funds are becoming increasingly popular, then less money is being used to stimulate economic growth. The idea is thus: instead of spending money on goods, consumers are now divvying that money into funds that sit passively to generate interest. The inevitable result is that companies lose profit, file bankruptcy, and the interest rates plummet causing investors to lose hundreds of thousands to millions in investments over a lifetime.

personalfinance,I want to buy a house. Having trouble with mortgage calculators.,"I'm pretty fed up with renting apartments.  Tired of living next to noisy/nosy neighbors, tired of waiting nearly a week to get my heat fixed when it's 15 outside at night, not having a nice yard, a workshop/shed etc etc.

I make 50k/yr pre-tax, 3k/mo after taxes.  This doesn't include any bonuses.  My entire expenditures excluding rent (utilities, health insurance, car, food, entertainment - literally everything else) come out to 1200/mo, which I put everything on a credit/rewards card and pay the full balance every month.  That leaves me 1800/mo free which I would rather use some towards a house that is mine and builds equity than an apartment which gives me nothing.  My credit score is above 775.  I have no debt whatsoever.

On a side note, my girlfriend makes 1700/mo after taxes, her expenses including rent are basically 1700.  She would most likely be living with me eventually but she's not going to be anywhere on any official documents regarding the mortgage... but she would be privately contributing somewhat to rent and utilities.  I say this because it's additional money that I can ""use"" for the mortgage, yet it won't be considered for understandable reasons.

My issue is that without scheduling a meeting with a banker, I can't get any reasonable understanding of how much house I can afford.  When I enter my information onto online calculators, most spit out that I would only be qualified for some ridiculous amount like an 80k mortgage, if it even gives me a result at all.  The best result I've seen is a little less than 140k.

I'm looking on Zillow just for fun right now and see that the houses I would like in my area range from 190-225k.  Assuming I don't lose my job, I have plenty of money according to their calculator to afford even a 15-yr mortgage with plenty left over.

personalfinance,My parents want to claim my student loan interest on their taxes.,"I returned to school at the beginning of last year. I decided to live with my parents for 2 years instead of keeping my dead-end job so that I could attend full-time and focus on grades and making connections within the university.

I had a little in savings, so I continued to pay my private student loans, cellular plan, and car insurance (car is paid off). I qualified for federal financial aid in the form of both loans and pell, which I used for school expenses. After that, a family member passed away and left me $2000, which I used to continue paying my previous private loans, as those two loans are the highest interest.

Now it's tax time and I received a letter stating the amount I paid in interest on my private student loans last year that I am supposed to report on my taxes. Since my parents are claiming me as a dependent, they want to claim this deduction on their taxes instead, and they claimed that I am not allowed to claim this deduction because I'm receiving federal aid. I'm not so sure this is allowed. I have no problem helping them out on taxes while they are helping me out, but I'm not going to do anything that will get me into any type of trouble. Any information is greatly appreciated.

TL;DR: Are my parents allowed to claim my student loan interest deductions on their taxes because I received financial aid?

personalfinance,401k Loan for Home Down payment,"I hadn't planned on taking a 401k Loan for my down payment. I need a house sooner than expected, and was prepared to deal with the repercussions in the form of PMI. I currently have enough cash on hand to put 5% down and still leave me my 6 month emergency fund. 

IF I'm able to put 10% down I can eliminate my monthly PMI via an up front 1.2% PMI Payment at closing. By my estimates this will save me about $10,000 in PMI over 5 years (estimated time frame for when I'd be able to drop PMI on the 5% down situation). To get this additional 6.2% I would use a 401k Loan.

After thinking about it though, I really can't see any downside to taking this loan, please double check my reasoning here:

1) My plan doesn't default the loan if I leave or am terminated from my job. Payments continue as normal.

2) I would re-balance my portfolio such that the 401k loan would be part of my bonds allocation. In a rising interest rate environment this seems like less risk AND higher return vs a bond fund.

3) Even with the double taxation of the interest, I still end up with a ""bond"" return of 2.9% for the Loan, beating my current bond funds performance handily. Granted I'm paying it to myself, but its still more money in the 401k to compound vs if I hadn't taken the loan.

4) I'm not losing any compounding growth on my stocks as I re-balanced my portfolio to account for the loan.

5) Cash flow from my paycheck is not a problem and the loan would be paid in 24 months or sooner.

6) There is a chance I can get the seller to cover the additional 1.2% closing cost in negotiations.

This seems like a super obvious choice to me, what downside am I missing?",finance
financialindependence,Rental Property Numbers,"I've learned a lot of really great information from FI.  I've seen the topic of rental properties come up repeatedly as a source for FI and I wanted to share my experience for people to consider.  I bought a 2 family property in 2001 for $165,000.  My wife and I lived upstairs and we rented out the first floor apartment for $800/month.  If I remember properly we put down 3% for our down payment and our monthly mortgage/tax/insurance payment was about $1500.00/month.  While living there we saved up a 20% down payment for our next house and aggressively paid down the mortgage.  We bought our next house in 2011 and started renting out both units for a total monthly income of 1700-1800/month.  I longed for the day when the mortgage would be paid off so I made that my goal and we paid it off in late 2015.  At first glance things look great, I've got $1750/month coming in and no mortgage; however the costs to owning a rental property are substantial.  My taxes are over 5000.00/year, insurance if 1600.00, maintenance will be about 1400.00 this year and then there are water bills $600.00, electric bills 1100.00 anually, lost rent due to the tenant that stiffed me and we had to evict 2700, costs associated with the eviction about 600 and I'm sure there others that I'm forgetting.  The point that I want to share with FI is that the costs associated with owning a rental are substantial even when it is paid off.  When you're considering a rental as a source of income please be aware of this, obviously there are some extremely intelligent people on this subreddit that already know this, but there are also some extremely optimistic individuals who this post might help be of benefit to.

Now, I am 55 and counting our, husband and wife, retirement. Kids completed schools settled in jobs, and they are loan free. I do not need to bother them for any help neither do they bother me, except social gathering and network.

I earn around 90k/year, there is no issue for my job and I can count another 5 to 7 years before getting age 62. I stay in my job as long as I like to continue even beyond 62. I maximize 24k/year for my 401k.

In addition, I started a side business (mostly sales commission) that gives me $20000/year. This is my lifelong work as there is no retirement for this sales commission.

Saved $600k in my retirement account and have $100k in cash investments, mostly in stocks. Retirement account grows at 7% year over year and cash investments almost same phase. No car loans or other loans except mortgages.

Over these 20 years, I made real estate investments since year 1999. Now, I have primary home (450k mortgage fixed 30 year) and three rental homes (400k, 400k, 250k fixed mortgages). The rental homes are cash flow positive with expenses as I have locked 30 year fixed with 3.5% interest rate. Every year, the rent with all vacancies, expenses matches expenses and I get appx $7000 as total overall income. All the homes are growing at 4%-5% level over the period. 

If I continue to hold for next 20 years,balance years are 20 only, I get cash flow positive (as I pay more principal with fixed mortgage) and all homes are coming as free.

If I sell two rental homes (400k+400k mortgages) now, I can pay off my primary home loan (450k mortgage) and one rental home (250k mortgage) fully with the equity (after tax and expenses). I will be living with loan free primary home and a rental home that can give me $2000/month as income after all expenses. This income $24000/year is kind lifelong annuity and taxed by IRS and CA.

I really can not work, in my current job, more than age 67 or 70, but can continue the sales commission job ($20000/year) until I am physically able to do.

At this stage, I am confused whether to sell two of my rental and come out of loans or to continue hold my loans/rentals as such next 20 years. Let me know what is best for me as if you are in my position. Thank you all in advance.",finance

financialindependence,Opinions sought for my FI/RE plan through real estate investing (no IRAs or index funds),"Dear All,

I recently stumbled across this community. I have been planning and working towards FI/RE for several years. As such, many of the thoughts and suggestions here have been incredibly useful to me.

I built a plan some years ago to become FI/RE within ~10 years and would love to hear any comments or suggestions from the community, if that’s possible (sorry in advance if I don’t use the “right” language).

I am a 35 year old male, living around Washington DC. I have a net monthly income of around $6K, of which I spend $1.5K ($2K at most if I have any extraordinary expenses). My monthly retirement target income is $5K-$6K. I honestly think I would only need $2k-$3K/month at most, but I want to have plenty of breathing room just in case there are any healthcare emergencies. You may think this is a crazy big gap – but the place I come from I have seen middle classes (and people close to my heart) become unemployed and living in the streets due to a strong crisis in a matter of months (and low savings rates), so I really want to be careful here.

My plan to build assets such that I could get $5K-$6K/month is by buying real estate. I currently own 2 condos in downtown DC which I think of as my pension fund. DC has several good advantages as a real estate market: demand is tied with the federal government (so demand is fairly stable) with increasing equity values (though I don’t think about it much, because I plan to hold pretty much forever). Each of these places are worth around $450K (this is the amount I paid for them when I bought them 1 and 2 years ago) and they generate between $2K-$2.5K (net of HOA fees). Cap rate is about 5.6%-6.5% (depending on projected occupancy and repairs needed - originally I forgot to factor in HOAs too, which was a bit of a bummer). 

All these places were bought with 30 year fixed rate mortgages and where I paid down 10% of the sales value (I don't have any other debts). Both mortgages are all cash break even (+/- $50-$100 per month). I am now saving to buy my third and last condo (estimated purchase to happen in Q2 2017). At that point I will start prepaying the principal and de-leveraging. I am thinking about having that final and third mortgage to be a 15 year fixed rate mortgage (thoughts here appreciated, by the way). If I get lucky I may get to save enough for a 20% prepayment and avoid the darn PMI.

Real estate investing has been a learning curve. It is a bit like building a part time small business and seeing the time required to manage it slowly increase. I thought about my purchases as if I was buying into blue-chip stocks 90% financed through loans – only that return rates are a much more stable than the stock market in exchange for the illiquidity and the time commitment. I think I am lucky to be close to Washington DC, because the real estate market there seems to be very stable, with values steadily increasing. I tend to stick with condos that have a good mix between strong demand (priced towards young professionals in their 20s and 30s), but also a little bit expensive. All condos have a fixed cost in terms of my time commitment, so I’d rather have one condo that pays $1000 than two condos that pay $500. Also, I think 3 is a good number of condos to own. If I had 2 and one became empty temporarily, I would get income for just the other one and would still have to pay the monthly HOAS for both of them – which could be a bit tight. 

Of course, I put into my 401(k) as much as possible to get the maximum employer match. No money in IRA or index funds (should I?).

Anyhow, my plan is to have those three condos paid down within 10 years (maybe it will take me a bit more). In this projection, am not including any potential salary increases, but as soon as I have one fully paid down, the payment speed will accelerate. Once all three condos are paid down (or even 2 if I am feeling impatient), I will retire. I do not plan to have any money in index funds or IRA before retirement, though after paying down all loans, I may plug any additional savings to those funds.

So that’s the story. What do you think? Any comments, suggestions, criticisms would be very welcome.

Thanks!",finance
financialindependence,457 Help,"I have a 403b which is invested in a Vanguard target retirement fund. I am going to open a 457 to facilitate the possibility of early retirement (I am not yet sure if I would actually WANT to retire early, but I would like to option). I need to pick a provider. Voya offers high expense funds, a stable value fund with no minimum interest rate, and Vanguard target retirement funds with no added expenses (i.e., just the Vanguard .16 ER). Nationwide offers high expense funds and a stable value fund with a minimum interest rate of 3.5%. In addition, if I open the account with Nationwide, I can enroll in a Charles Schwab PCRA, where I can access all Schwab funds.

personalfinance,"19 y/o, have A.A. degree and $10k student loans. Moving out of state. Continue to bachelor's ASAP or work full time to get residency first?","So this summer I'm moving out of state to live with my long-term S/O's family. Only issue is, out-of-state tuition is expensive (nearly 3x in-state tuition). Originally I was going to work full-time for a year and get residency, however that would mean I'd be repaying student loans while still in school, and I would rather [save my 6-month loan grace repayment period](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/understand#change-grace-period) for when I'm completely done with school. I would have about 3 semesters worth of schoolwork left for a B.A. in Anthropology. 

If I can get a staff or administration job within the university, they'll waive 6 credits of tuition (regardless of residency), but from what I've been seeing on their website (I've been checking off and on for the last 8 months), the jobs for people with only A.A. degrees are few and far between.

My mother hates the idea of me taking a year off of school - she says that once you start working, it's much more difficult to go back to school. At this point, though, I'm not completely sure what to do.
Estimated expenses would be gas (roughly $50/week), textbooks (maybe $100/year, as that has been my historical average), and tuition (somewhere between free if I get a full-time job at the uni, to $15k), as I'd live with family 50 miles away. No public transport serves the area. I could get an apartment much closer, but I would have no idea how to pay for it (even if I worked at the uni - I wouldn't have much money leftover after rent). 

I have $6800 in subsidized loans and $3500 in unsubsidized loans. I don't qualify for much in terms of scholarships or grants, and there's no out-of-state tuition waiver available. Tuition at the uni is $18k/year out-of-state and $6.5k/year in-state, and I'm not sure how much of that a federal student loan would cover. 

At this point, I've been going back and forth for a while now. I couldn't find anything about A.A. vs B.A. or going back to school, especially as I don't currently make over $400/month from work-study.
I could also take classes from my home state online part-time to keep my grace period while working on getting residency. How solid is that plan? Is it even worth it, from a financial point of view?
[I also don't have credit cards or cc debt, however my s/o does so they won't be of much use] Short of getting married, uni employment seems to be my best (yet unreliable) chance at not racking up an unreasonable amount of debt.

**tldr**; should I bite the bullet and pay roughly $25k for the rest of my B.A., or am I overrating the 6-month grace loan repayment period and get in-state residency?

personalfinance,Get another loan or payoff one,"Hey guys, so this is my situation. I got a car loan last year because I wanted to create some credit (relocated to the US 2.5 years ago); there's about 10k left to pay.

Now, I don't want to get too far into details but to keep it short I owe ~61k that were used to pay my Master's degree and living expenses for a year and a half, this is money that has to be payed back overseas with an interest rate of 9.5% (high)

Always loading my schedule with relevant and challenging courses that would help me gain a better, more in-depth understanding of the biology of life on the molecular level. I took up a ton of extracurricular activities in order to gain some important experiences that I knew I'd need throughout my career. I became a teaching assistant for several organic chemistry labs, took up a molecular biology research project, became a resident assistant, volunteered at hospitals and clinics during my summer and winter breaks, and was elected President of my college's Pre-Medicine Association. Overall, I gained lots of leadership, interpersonal, teaching, administrative, wet-lab, clinical, public speaking, event planning, budgeting, grant-writing, and research experience during college. I always felt that with everything I had done so far, it wouldn't ever have been as hard as it's been now for me to find work. Which is why my situation has been so frustrating.

I have dreams of becoming a surgeon someday and decided to take two gap years before attending medical school. Like any hard working individual, I decided I wanted to go into the work force during this time to increase my skills and experiences, as well as helping my family financially while paying off some of my loans, before jumping into the hardships of medical school. Little did I know how difficult it would be to start the next chapter of my life. 

I graduated in August 2016 and began applying as soon as I moved back home. I know this was my first mistake, not applying while still in school, but, like I mentioned before, I never thought it'd be this much of a challenge. I've been looking for work as a research assistant or research technician at hospitals, universities, and pharmaceutical companies in my area and have only gotten invited to a single interview for a research technician position during this time. 

I felt the interview went really well as the lab manager seemed very impressed with my resume and everything I brought to the table. Our conversation went smoothly and she even invited me back to the lab after the second interview with the primary investigator (which also went well) to meet the other research technicians and discuss my start date as well as expectations she had for me. After almost 4 weeks of not hearing back, I emailed the lab manager to ask what my application status was and she informed me they were looking for someone with more lab experience and that they'd keep my resume on file for future use. It was disheartening, to say the least. 

Since I've been applying to jobs for the last 5 months and have only heard back from 1 place, I feel that I must be doing something wrong regarding my resume and cover letters. If any of you have any advice or could offer any type of help, I would seriously, greatly appreciate it. I've read so many success stories from people that had nothing and were able to turn their lives around with help from this sub, so I'm hoping I can have the same luck.

personalfinance,457 Help,"I have a 403b which is invested in a Vanguard target retirement fund. I am going to open a 457 to facilitate the possibility of early retirement (I am not yet sure if I would actually WANT to retire early, but I would like to option). I need to pick a provider. Voya offers high expense funds, a stable value fund with no minimum interest rate, and Vanguard target retirement funds with no added expenses (i.e., just the Vanguard .16 ER). Nationwide offers high expense funds and a stable value fund with a minimum interest rate of 3.5%. In addition, if I open the account with Nationwide, I can enroll in a Charles Schwab PCRA, where I can access all Schwab funds. If I elected this option, each pay period, my withholding will go with the 3.5 stable value fund. I will then transfer it into the Schwab account and purchase shares in my various funds. I'm having trouble deciding which to go with.
I'm leaning towards going with Voya for the simplicity of the vanguard target retirement fund. If I do not like how the AA changes over time, I can just switch to a later year's target fund. I am not what I would consider to be a savy investor. The target fund is easy. However, I do give up a substantial amount of flexibility, which the Schwab PCRA would offer.

personalfinance,"18 years old, lost $4500 in the stock market. I have some tax questions.","Throwaway because friends know my account and this is personal information.

Last summer I foolishly got involved in some options trading. I made a decent amount at first, then I started to lose more and more money. When it was all said and done, I had lost about $4500, which was most of my money. 
My question involves taxes and everything involved with that.
I am a dependent of my parents, and I made about $5800 this last year from my job. I paid $150 in federal taxes but I anticipate getting all that back. I know I can deduct $3000 a year from my taxes due to capital losses such as the one I experienced. Would there be any benefit from deducting this year even though I won't pay any federal taxes since I don't make enough? Would I be able to defer the tax-deductible loss until I have a career?
Also, I read that it's optional whether to report all of your stock/option trades to the IRS via some tax form I don't remember, so is there a form I need to fill out to file my taxes because of my stock market activity? I planned on filling out a 1040EZ, if that works out with my situation.

personalfinance,Financing solar. Looking for options.,"Hi all.

I'm in the process of shopping around to put solar panels on my house.

personalfinance,[NZ] Houses and house prices.,"I'm a 27yo male who would like to buy a house. I'm currently single, earning 55k NZD/ year gross.

Between savings, drawing from Kiwisaver, and additional help from relatives, I can come up with approximately 100k. This should suffice for a 20% deposit on a low end 400k+ house.

Since my country has deep structural problems preventing any decent increase in housing supply, and continual foreign capital coming in, house prices are continually rising, with the national average &gt;650k. Note, national average income is 47k.

My problem is that even with a low interest rate of say, ~4.6%, my dbt to income ratio is actually quite absurd, at approximately 6x+.

&gt;Markets, on the other hand, don’t focus on this rate, but rather on the real interest rate.

&gt;If you had a bond that carried a nominal yield of 6%, but inflation was at an annual rate of 5%, the bond’s real yield would be 1%.

personalfinance,[Retirement] Trying to figure out how to analyze my parents existing Traditional IRA,"So my parents have their IRAs with Waddell &amp; Reed, and given that they dont have very much money, I am trying to determine if there is something they can do to squeeze every dollar they can out of it.  I had my Roth IRA at W&amp;R, and after being fed up with the fees and underperforming funds they had me in, I recently initiated the transfer to get it into Vanguard.  So part of this motivation is coming from my own experiences with W&amp;R.


https://imgur.com/a/ErzEs


That is a spreadsheet that I put together for their existing funds based on their last statement, along with the expense ratios that I found on Morningstar.  I did an aggregate expense calculation to see what their entire portfolio sits at.  I also included the three target retirement date funds that are closest to their situation.  Early 70s, retired last year.  Primary income is SS, Mom gets a small pension (like $300/mo), and their mandatory withdraws from their IRAs is all they live on.

Dad is going to go into a VA nursing home with payment assistance (welfare), so long story short, my Mom's finances are going to be extremely tight since to qualify for the welfare, they have extremely limited budget allowances.


So here are my questions:

1.  What kind of portfolio would someone in their situation be?  They are currently almost 60/40 stocks/bonds, with a heavy bias towards US funds (only 15% international funds).  Conversely, the 2015 Target Date fund from Vanguard is closer to 45/55 stocks/bonds, with about twice as much international exposure.  The 2020 Target Date fund is closer to their current allocation on the stocks/bonds side, but I am wondering if they just dont have the right allocation for their situation.  Does this change if their nest egg is extremely small (~$100k)?


2.  What would be the best way to go about comparing their existing portfolio vs the Target Date funds?  They are currently in so many different funds that trying to view them all on a 10K chart is unusable.  I suppose I could make 4 different 10K charts and only show the US bonds vs the US bond fund in the Target Date funds to see how each class is performing (repeat for the three other classes), unless there is some other suggestion?  If that is how I go, how do I reconcile the differences in the Asset Class that W&amp;R assigned vs what shows up on Morningstar?  Take the WACYX continental fund, W&amp;R calls it a bond fund, but Morningstar shows it with about 50% US stock.  I want to make the best case to my parents as to why they should switch, but I also want my analysis to be accurate so I am not misrepresenting the performances.  I also tried to find equivalent funds at Vanguard to make the best comparison, but that didnt go well.  Only about half of the Ivy funds had equivalents, and the W&amp;R funds didnt even show up on the Vanguard comparison form.  I put together some kind of hodge podge mix of approximate funds, and it ended up around a 0.20% aggregate expense ratio, so I figured the target date fund was a better option to present (and much simpler for them to understand, as it details out what exactly they are invested in in a concise location).

3.  Are there any other tips or advice that can be given on how to help them make such a small amount of money work?  Once my Dad is in the home, my Mom will likely qualify for welfare/food stamps, so that should help some.  Unfortunately they dont own a home (2009 got them), so the only other asset they have is a car that is worth maybe $5k.  Thankfully they dont have any debt though.",finance

Last year I had to get a new car, I had always paid cash for them but this time I needed something that would last. When I applied, the loan company called me and informed me I had 14K outstanding from when I was 20yrs old that I had never heard of. I had even looked at my credit score on Credit Karma and it never showed up. Turned out, even though I was fully insured, they said I owed $14k from my sons birth, which was false.

Will we be able to get a house? What do I do to get my credit score up quickly? Are we going to just have to wait?

personalfinance,Federal Tax Withhold Question,"Hi all,

For 2016 I quit my job back in April and started a new one so I received two W2 forms from both employers.

My old job I left at about $67,000 and paid about $10000 in Federal taxes.

My new job I finished at about $75,000 and paid about $11000 in Federal taxes.

These two figures are based on taxable income and not gross.

Total taxable income is $142,000
Total Federal Tax paid is $21,000

Currently I have filed as ""Married - filing jointly""
1 exemption for federal and 1 for state.

I did a federal tax calculation and its saying that I'm supposed to be paying $27,000 in taxes, I understand why that is but I'm trying to understand why I was not withheld enough in taxes?

If anyone can shed some light on this or had been through that would be great.

personalfinance,Making a student loan payment with my tax refund - A few questions,"Hello, all.

First of all, let me give a pre-emptive thank you for viewing 
and contemplating my question here. I've seen a lot of people helped here 
and figured this would be the right place to ask my question. 

As the title states, I want to use my tax refund as a student loan payment. 
My loans are serviced via Navient. 	

These are my concerns / questions:

1) If I make this payment, will Navient assume I make more money now
and attempt to increase the amounts of my monthly payments?
How do I prevent this from happening? 

2) I should be making payments on my loans with the highest interest rates first, correct? 

3) I've heard stories of Navient not applying payments as the loan holder intended, what can I do
besides constantly contacting them after the fact in order for this not to happen? 

4) I assume I can make this ""extra"" payment and resume paying my monthly amount as usual. 
Is this correct? If there's any funny business, is recording dates, times, and CSR names enough,
or should I record all of my interactions with Navient? 

5) If I should be recording them, I assume an android app will suffice for doing so.
Any recommendations as to which apps I should be using? 

6) If I need to threaten legal action, what should I say. I believe I read something here 
about a lawsuit against Navient and there's a particular organization that takes complaints, who are they? 

Thanks again! I can't wait to get this monkey off of my back. I'm about to throw all of my refunds at it until I pay it off.",finance

personalfinance,"Shady Movers, Stolen Stuff","We're a family of four who until recently was living in northern Ontario. A sudden move was necessary for my spouse's medical program, which requires two years of placements around the province and gives only a few weeks notice of where yours happens to be. Severe, heavy snowfall was expected, and we didn't feel comfortable towing a trailer through that alongside our two toddlers. And so we hired movers.

The company was [Pacific Moving Canada](https://homestars.com/companies/2855341-pacific-moving-canada), a not-too-cheap and highly-rated moving service. We called, a Russian gentleman answered, and we arranged everything without issue. On the day of the move, two Russian guys showed up and filled the moving truck quickly and efficiently. 

We all arrived at our destination (southern Ontario) the next morning. The same movers, who were now very surly and in a hurry, moved our stuff into the new apartment. They insisted that we paid before anything came off the truck (a possible red flag? But how could we refuse? They had as ransom everything we owned). We were awake at 3:30 AM alongside our kids and just wanted the ordeal to be over. We paid and signed for our card to be charged.

Several hours later the truck was empty and we had a massive pile of stuff all jammed together in the middle of our living room. 

""It's all done."" The head mover said to my spouse, handing her the final work order.

""You're asking me to sign that the job's done, but what if something's damaged or missing?"" She was always keener than me. She said later that her intuition was acting up; but of course so were our kids.

""Go, go look!"" The guy barked, and then turned to the other mover and scoffed. They exchanged a few sentences in Russian. ""Everything is fine. This I promise you.""

""We have two more orders today, and this one took a very long time,"" the second mover chimed in.

""You didn't even rent an elevator for us,"" the first added.

""We have to go. Now.""

Two hours later we found a smashed tablet, and noticed that our new Instant Pot (still in the box; we had bought it as a moving present for ourselves), my wife's bass guitar, and our silverware was gone.

We immediately called the movers to report the missing items. We were transferred to the proper department. Of course, another Russian guy answered.

""Things can disappear in the strangest places,"" he said, ""Have you checked inside all your drawers?""

""A bass guitar doesn't fit in a drawer. We realized it was missing once we began separating the pile of stuff.""

""I see you signed the paperwork, so there's nothing more do. Go play your game somewhere else.""

It was clear that nothing was going to be done. We agreed to call back later. 

After we had checked the drawers.

We promptly called the police, filed a report of theft, and described our missing items. The officer we spoke to said that all movers had to be insured, and that we needed to contact their insurance. They were sympathetic, but it was clear that nothing was going to be done.

We called the movers back and spoke to the same person again. We asked for their insurance information; were told that they would only give insurance information to the police. I told them that police don't get involved with insurance claims, and that what he's asking makes no sense. He kept insisting that if there was any wrongdoing, then police would come down and fix it. No police, no crime. 

So we called VISA and asked to put a hold on the transaction until the matter was settled. We paid to have our items moved, and they were not moved. Not all of them. Not the expensive ones. In our assessment, they failed to provide the service we paid for. ""We don't stop a charge on the basis of the quality of a service,"" the representative told us.

Back to the movers. This time we stressed our status as poor students. Told them that we don't care what happened, that we understand moving is a tough job, but that we just wanted our things back. We even tipped the movers. We gave them food and drink (cliff bars, V8, fresh fruit, and cola, lol). We treated them right; so maybe our things could magically appear in a strange part of a truck or something, no questions asked. 

The man listened. This time we could claim missing items at a rate of $0.50 per pound. You know, $5.00 for a 10-pound bass. Cool. ""It doesn't matter who you are. You need to waste your time and your games somewhere else."" 

And so here we are, at a standstill. $1200 for moving, plus another $700 in missing goods. Is there any other recourse we could take? Small claims court? But then it's just our word against theirs, and damn do these guys know how to play it close to their chest. 

TL;DR: Hired movers in a pinch; stuff goes missing. Law seems wholly inadequate in the face of shrugging Russians.",finance

This is my first time filing a tax return after a job switch. Been filing for a few years at my last job and its usually been simple and straightforward. I am single non-dependent. Earlier this year, I was living at my parents' home in NJ and working in NYC. As of March, I moved to my own apartment in Philadelphia and now work in PA. I've been trying to use some tax software (in particular TaxAct and TurboTax), and I'm seeing some not so exciting results.

 I have both my W-2s for my past and current job, and when I enter them separately, I get the return I would expect. But when I try to enter them together into one return, I'm seeing that I owe ~$3000 between federal and state. On my W-2 it has my wages at $54990 with $7223 federal income withheld in PA between March and the end of 2016 (in which I lived in PA), and my wages in NYC show $8730 with $1445 federal income tax withheld between January and March (in which I lived in NJ).

Is this something that is to be expected during a job switch and relocation? Or is this something that tax software does not handle too well/should I see an accountant in person?

btc,Proof that blockstream trolls took Peter R.'s statement about supply out of context,"A lot of controversy has been stirred around a statement that Peter R. from BU recently made on Core slack.

https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5poe8j/can_any_bitcoin_unlimited_devs_preferable_peter_r/

If we look at Peter R.'s actual words, he said:

&gt; I don't believe a _fixed_ supply is a central property of Bitcoin.

Now, people have been attacking this based on their interpretation that this is referring to the 21M coin limit in Bitcoin.

__However, shortly prior to that comment, Peter R. said the following__:

&gt; [So, IMO, the scarcity of bitcoins is a central property, scarcity of block space is not.](http://i.imgur.com/XdibnSb.jpg)

__It's quite evident that Peter R. was talking about the supply of block space__, and not about the 21M limit.

---

_P.S.: I'm a member of BU. I haven't seen any members of Unlimited argue for a lifting of the 21M coin limit, let alone Peter. Having to quote him out of context only illustrates the desperation of those opposed to the concept of BU's market-driven approach to block size._

_If there do exist any BU members in favor of modifying the 21M limit, they could provide a signed statement to that effect. I am sure enough that you won't see any such statements, so we can basically put this FUD about BU's developers to rest._

_But even if there are supporters of inflation - their ideas would still have to pass a public vote according to BU's Articles of Federation. That would require majority support for Bitcoin inflation, which is nowhere to be found in the real world._

I'm still very much at a stage where I'm trying to figure out my career, but my goal is more or less to continue what I'm doing and hope I can find more opportunities in those fields. 

The minimum payment on my loans is $150 a month (though I've been paying $250 lately) and though my income varies it's usually anywhere from $1500 to $2000 per month.

This morning, my car had a timing chain issue and two separate shops that I trust have both told me that because of the type of engine, it would be cheaper to do a total engine rebuild than fix the current damages. Car is currently not running. Expected cost to fix is upwards of $1.8-2k. The car is a 2005 with almost 150k miles and I got it for only $3500 originally and probably have already put over $3500 in it. Needs new tires soon and also has an exisiting exhaust issue. 

It seems like it is time for a new car, but because I have no other car, negotiations must happen tomorrow. I can't afford to be taking off work more than today and tomorrow. I already will have to take a cab or ride with the tow truck driver to get to a dealer. This will make negotiations very difficult as I can't exactly walk out.

* Student Loan: Min payment is $183 but I have been doing $225
* Payment (interest free for 12 months) for engagement ring: $400

This leaves me with around $550 in excess that I normally am able to save, however since I am a recent graduate and I furnished my first apartment recently, I have been chewing through all excess cash since August. Now that I am settled and the holidays have passed that should settle down. Currently have about $5000 between savings and checking. Pay all credit cards (2) completely every single month. Credit score is in the range of 750. I expect $3000 at least between my federal and state (Ohio) tax returns. However, this won't be coming in time to help with a down payment.

personalfinance,"Near the limit on your Credit Card? If you can afford the minimum payment this month, make the same payment next month, NOT the new minimum payment.","**Just as an example, if you have:** 

- a $5,000 balance on a credit card 

- with a 20% interest rate, then

- paying JUST the minimum (let's say 3% of the balance, which is $150 for the first payment), 

- **it would take 183 months (that's 14 YEARS) to pay off the card, and you'd pay $5,601.51 in interest alone.**

*This is because the Minimum Payment goes downs as the Balance goes down.*  THIS IS WHAT THE BANKS ARE HOPING YOU WILL DO!!

So after making the first payment of $150, your next minimum payment is $148, then $146 in Month 3, etc.

**BUT, if you just keep a constant payment of $150, you'll pay off the card in 48 months and spend $2,164 in interest.**

**This will shave over 11 years off the time it takes to repay the card, and save you $3,437.51 in interest.**

*Paying even a small amount over the minimum payment each month goes a long way.*

More examples:

Paying $175/month ($25 extra) cuts your payments down to 39 months and saves you $3,914.51 in interest.

Paying $200/month ($50 extra) cuts your payments down to 32 months and saves you $4,226.51 in interest.

**I know you hear this time and again here in PF, but paying the Minimum Payments is a Lifetime Debt Sentence.**

*And paying extra each month gives you an emotional ""win"" that will help you keep moving forward.*

This is only one of MANY strategies that can be used to tackle debt, and it is only an example.

personalfinance,How should I budget and prepare for a major move?,"I recently have been accepted to a pharmacy school in a new state, in a very popular (and expensive) city. I've lived in my current state for my entire life but there is no in-state pharmacy option for me.
The opportunity to attend this school is amazing and I'm extremely excited. 

The only problem is, my new city has a much different cost of living than my current city. The homes in my city average $200,000 but in my new city they average around $500,000+. Likewise, rent here is ~$1200 for a 3bdrm house whereas rent there is $2000 for a studio apartment that has no parking.

My fiancé has a good job here (~$55k/yr), but will likely need to find new employment once we move. Should he start looking now? We're not planning on moving until June or July. We'll have more than enough to cover rent for the first 6 months - 1 year but I want to make sure we're secure past that. We have two cars and two pets so going into a small apartment really isn't ideal for us. Rent might end up being $600 more per month than we're currently spending. 

I likely won't be able to get a job while I'm attending pharmacy school. And if I do, I won't make enough to really impact our living situation. I just want to make sure we're doing everything the right way.
We have no car payments and no debt yet but I will be taking out federal student loans (which I have never doing before.)

I just need as much general advice as possible to help me make a plan.

personalfinance,"College wants $20,000 for 3 classes and refuses to release transcript, 1 week deadline.","Okay so the title was short and to the point but heres the full story.

My gf just admitted to me that she has one class left at the university we attended together in 2014. She did not graduate on time and had to take 4 classes (1 term) post the expected graduation date to finish. She ended up withdrawing from 1 of the classes so shes still 1 class away from a degree. 

Fast forward 3 years, I had no idea about the above. She is applying to a new program near our home and keeps telling me that she probably wont get in. At this point she tells me about the 15k debt she ahs and its accrued an additional 5k in the last 2 years. So this is where I am now. 

If she doesnt pay it she has no way to finish her Bachelors and the school won't release the transcripts, effectively stopping her from applying to any post graduate or the new program she is applying to. On top of that the credits she earned at the first university will expire and not be counted towards her new program. So I call the school and say that if they forgive the interest I can pay the semester today. I am promptly told that they will not forgive any interest and since we called and brought attention to the balance they are adding an additional 25% collections fee and sending it to the appropiate department (collection and repayment). 

So my choices now are to liquidate my savings from the last two years to pay off the 25k, which I most likely cannot since it is almost all my money is invested, I was going to liquidate my 401k to pay the 15k to begin with. Second choice is getting a loan from prosper/lending club at the outrageous 15-18% interest rates, which might not be too bad because I will most likely pay it off within 1 year. Last choice is let the 200k shes (her dad) already paid at the university go to shit and set her back years. She doesnt have the credit line or savings to handle it and I dont mind giving her the money just need to figure out how to minimize the impact on my life.

I spoke with Sallie about getting a post back loan but they will not go back more then a term. I wish she had told me earlier, since I am still in school and would have just asked sallie for a living expense expense loan at much better terms and deferment. Deadline is February 1st so im kind of panicking. 

edit: Let me just clarify that we have been together for 5 years and known each other for 8 and this is not me paying off a random GFs debt. I have thought it through and understand the risk I will be carrying and have decided to continue. The money is a large sum but I make a very healthy living now, and save this much about every 6 months. She also did not ask for me to pay it, I just know the implication this will have on our future if it falls through this gap. I do appreciate all the cautionary comments.",finance
personalfinance,Need a second opinion regarding a possibly incorrect W2 form,"I work for a small business that has a total of 4 employees. I make about $8.50/hr. My boss claims he takes federal tax out of my check, but it never shows on my pay stub. I asked him previously why the dollar amount never showed on the stub, and he said that he's only required to put the number of dependents I claim (which is 2). So, in my never ending naivety, I assumed this was ok. Now tax season is upon us, and on my W2, in box 2 which is federal tax withheld, there is a 2. Not a dollar amount, just a 2. When I asked my boss, he said to just enter in $2.00 for that box when submitting my tax forms. This seemed a little odd to me, so I asked him to clarify. His exact words were, ""Well you probably don't make enough to have federal tax withheld."" As I stated previously, earlier in the year, he told me he DID withhold federal tax. I've been advised to fill out a substitute W2, and that the number for federal tax withholding should be a dollar amount and not the number of dependents I claim. What is your opinion reddit?

personalfinance,What to do with the extra money I have no immediate plan for.,"This post might sound pretentious but it's not.  I made a throwaway for this reason.

My budgeting method is pretty simple.  I bring in more than I spend, sometimes substantially.  I don't have any debt besides a mortgage and monthly bills (food, gas, insurance).  I'm a single guy and I never really was into living high and I kind of still live like I'm in college even though I make more lol.  This means I get a lot of money coming into my bank... that loses money to inflation.

You're going to ask so:

* Yes, I have a good emergency fund in the bank.
* Yes, I contribute to my 401k (post tax Roth-401k).  I don't max it at 18% but I do 10% which is pretty good.  This is double than the minimum required for max match.
* Yes, I pay down principal and overpay my mortgage substantially.  My plan is to have my mortgage paid off in a few years and I'm meeting or exceeding that goal.
* Yes, I give to charity.  Not as much as I should because I'm paying my house down.  Once I'm free and clear I can give more.  St. Judes is a great organization.

So I have this money that just sits in the bank but it loses money to inflation because I really don't do anything to it.  It's not like I want a new car or anything at least right now.  I don't want to slam it ALL toward my mortgage.  I also don't want to contribute more to my 401k.  I contribute enough and I might want access to this money before I'm 65.

I want to do ""medium term investing"".  I don't need immediate access to the money but if I want to make a large purchase (Maybe I find a good deal on a truck?  Maybe I see a good deal on investment property?) I can always cash out.  If the market is down I can always hold off a few years.  Essentially a better place to put my money I likely won't use for some time that doesn't just lose value to inflation but not locking it up for retirement.

personalfinance,So confused :( Used three different tax preparation sites and got three different refund / taxes owed amounts !?!,"This is the first year I have a pretty standard return to file. No dependents, no complicated financial accounts. Just a small HSA that my new employer set up for me at the beginning of 2016 ($400 deposited) and a 1099-INT for a savings account (interest was $50 all together). 


I usually file my taxes with Turbo Tax. I went to their site and started a free, 1040 EZ return. Because of the HSA, Turbo Tax ""upgraded"" me to a 1040 A (and want to charge me $50 US). Long story short, Turbo Tax says I owe Federal $750 + the $50 fee. I exited out of the return before hitting the ""File"" button.


So, I hear about Credit Karma and their free tax filing. I'm thinking ""If I have to owe taxes, at least I can file for free at Credit Karma."" I go to the Credit Karma site and enter the same information as I did on the Turbo Tax site and Credit Karma says I get a $5 REFUND. No fee from Credit Karma to file the return.  I exited out of the return before I hit the ""File"" button.

Now I'm confused. I come to Reddit and PF and read the Tax Mega thread about filing taxes and see there's Tax Act, which is also free to file (initially). 


So I go to Tax Act, input all the same info and they say I should get a $350 REFUND ! Tax Act wants to charge me $15 for filing a 1040 A. 

To recap:

* Turbo Tax - owe $750     Fee $50

* Credit Karma - refund $5     Fee $0

* Tax Act - refund $350     Fee $15


Obviously, it's a no brainer which service I am going to file with.

**Edit #2 --**

OK, so I went through Turbo Tax, Credit Karma and TaxAct again, and this is what I found:


* TaxAct - All the numbers matched with the 1040 form on irs.gov except the Federal Tax Withheld amount. On irs.gov it says $13,590 (line 44). BUT on TaxAct it says $13,948. There is no way for me to change this number manually. Thus the $300 difference in a refund TaxAct wants to give me.


* Credit Karma - All the numbers matched with what's on irs.gov except there's a line in the ""Other Income"" section of Credit Karma's site that says $140. I can't correct this manually. I looked at this on the actual 1040 form at Credit Karma and it says it's an entry on line 21 of the 1040 form for $140 with a comment of ""HSA"". The site won't let me correct this. Ugh!


* Turbo Tax - OK, my bad here. I reviewed my entries again and I mis-typed my income. Once I corrected that, I got the same matching numbers as irs.gov and a $58 refund. But then I'd have to PAY $50 to file!!

personalfinance,Need Advice - 1st time potential homebuyer and I have zero clue what I'm doing.,"OK... I need some advice on what I should do. Here's my situation: 
I make around 57K/yr. I have a car loan that's $480/month ($26k outstanding) and another outstanding loan for $370/month ($13k outstanding).  Credit card debt is pretty minimal - right now standing at $150 with a $4000 limit.   
I have no savings, because I had a couple emergencies that came up (emergency vet bills etc).  

I have a 401k that's worth roughly $18k that I have to move or close out because my employer switched companies. If I don't deal with it by the end of February, I will start being penalized according to my HR. I have another 401k with close to $30K that is fine where it is.  

My current lease is up at the end of June, so I have 5 months to figure out what my next move is. I currently pay $900/month in rent, and monthly bills come to about $300.   

Credit isn't perfect, but I've been steadily improving it, and Credit Karma has me around 715, though I have a bunch of hard inquiries on my report from issues with my car and I had to trade it in Sept 2015.  

I know that I could get a decent house in my area for around $60-80k, and I am fairly certain that I could get a 100% financing loan through my credit union, though it would likely be at a higher interest rate than would be ideal.  

My questions are:   
1) SHOULD I try to buy a house right now, or try to find a different rental and wait a while?  
2) Should I close the 401k that has to be dealt with and use that money to help pay down some of my debt (based on my calculations, I'd lose a big chunk to penalties and taxes but I could almost pay down the $13k loan, and have one less debt in the way).  
3) Should I close the 401k and use it as a down payment or closing costs?  
4) Should I roll over the 401k into the one I'm keeping, or an IRA? (Never did this so I don't even know what the options are.)  

Basically I am clueless and confused by the whole process, but I've been a longtime renter and I feel like I'm just throwing money away. I hate the risk of renting from someone who (like my current landlord) doesn't much seem to care about their property and the prospect of moving into another bad property/bad landlord situation gives me panic attacks. I figure, even if the house I buy needs work, I could deal with it myself and it would benefit ME, not someone else.

The investment seeks to provide current income while maintaining liquidity and a stable share price of $1. The fund invests primarily in high-quality, short-term money market instruments. Under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the fund's assets are invested in securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies and instrumentalities. It maintains a dollar-weighted average maturity of 60 days or less and a dollar-weighted average life of 120 days or less. The fund generally invests 100% of its assets in government securities and therefore will satisfy the 99.5% requirement for designation as a government money market fund.

personalfinance,W4 ignorance cross post,"So I guess I opted out of tax being withheld from my earnings. I say I guess because I had no idea I did really to be honest. I have been in the military since I was 18 so I never had a real job. And had no idea you can withhold tax being taken and pay at the end of the year. What a stupid option. Who invents this dumb crap. ""Hey uncle sam instead of paying a little bit a month and getting a return at the end of the year let me pay a huge amount with no return at the end of the year"" I started being a mechanic about a year ago and during my setup of my pay I guess I opted to not pay taxes. Anyway a few weeks back i get some mumbo from my work about my W4. Not knowing shat this is i ignore it. Its now W2 time and I'm expecting a refund but I seen in my federal tax withheld is empty. So im like hmm wierd. A little googling and i find out what a W4 is and why my box 2 federal withholdings is blank. So no refund for me. Yay!! I'm so happy....so my question is can I get away with not paying any money when I file my taxes? Can I skip this year and opt in to paying taxes through out the year then use that return to pay 2016?? I'm sure that's a no but might as well ask. So when I do have to pay money is there a payment plan I can make? Or does the irs want all of it at once. Also mind u I have not had healthcare since 2013 and I'm sure there are fees for that too. Another question I have is there a forgiveness waiver for incorrectly selecting if you want to opt in or out of paying taxes??? Basically I'm wondering am I screwed and will be paying thousands to uncle sam or is there help for me....",finance

Economics,The Cost of Federal Regulation to the U.S. Economy,,finance
investing,"Im Not a Macro Guy, But This Has Me Worried...","Generally speaking, there's two ways for the stock market to appreciate. Either through earnings or the PE multiple going up. Naturally, if you buy a stock at 10 PE and the PE jumps to 15, then you've made a 50% profit if earnings stayed flat. Similarly, if earnings increase 50% then you'll make a 50% profit if the PE multiple stays flat. 

Problem is since 1990, 55% of stock market gains have been through PE expansion. (Using inflation adjusted data from http://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-earnings/table and http://www.multpl.com/inflation-adjusted-s-p-500/table/by-year.) Since 1990, price has gone up 5.37% a year. Meanwhile, earnings have only gone up 3.28% a year. To put that in perspective, from ~~1945~~ 1944 to 1990, they went up 2.55% and 2.46% p.a. respectively. (Remember, these are all inflation adjusted., i.e. real growth rates.)

Here's a graph I made: http://imgur.com/a/Tpq6m As you can see, historically, the 10 year median PE kind of cleanly cycles from a high of 18 to a low of 9 or 10. Then in the late 90's it ""should"" have peaked, but it didn't. It just kept going up and it's stayed above 18 ever since. In fact, we never had a 10 year median PE above 19 before 2000. Now we've had it 16 times.

See, when the Fed dropped interest rates to zero and dumped unholy amounts of money into the economy, everyone, including myself, thought we'd have high inflation. But the CPI has stayed low. Really low. http://www.multpl.com/inflation/ In 2014 Bernanke quipped that ""the problem with QE is that it works in practice, but it doesn't work in theory."" And since unemployment numbers have been good http://www.multpl.com/unemployment/ and the stock market has been going up, we all kind of assumed that, hey maybe this Bernanke guy knows more about economics than we do.

But here's a troubling thought. And Im not the first to have this, there's actually a really good, if libertarian-leaning documentary on Netflix called ""Money for Nothing"" that kind of inspired this line of thinking. But what if we haven't seen inflation in the CPI simply because the money (i.e. QE) didn't go to the consumers. It went to the banks. What if we are experiencing dramatic stock market inflation?

Well I think most of us know that low interest rates are propping up the stock market, but by how much? Well. If the stock market had a more historically average PE multiple of 15, for example, the stock market would tumble over 40% to around $1,300.

Now keep in mind, I'm not predicting a massive 40% drop off. I'm just saying that the PE multiple should revert to mean eventually, and 25 to 15, no matter how gradual, is a bit of a headwind. Even if it took 20 years to go from 25 to 15, with earnings growing at a real 2.66% a year like they have been since ~~1990~~ 1989, we'd ended up in 2036 with a price just shy of where it is today: around $2,260.

Course, this is all ignoring dividends. Which isn't lost on me. Even if the SP500 went flat over the next 20 years, you'd still get your dividends. And in case anyone is wondering, dividend yield has somewhat unsurprisingly ran counter to the PE. Here it is: http://imgur.com/a/7qTIS 

And the payout ratio (Dividends / Earnings) has been declining http://imgur.com/a/DPiAb which makes me curious about the effects of share repurchases. (Dividends and share repurchases are the two ways companies can return cash to shareholders.) Share repurchases make the stock price rise without affecting earnings, so that will translate to PE multiple expansion. Unfortunately, for all the awesome data http://www.multpl.com/sitemap Mr Shiller has provided, they don't track share repurchases.

Well pardon me for jumping off my train of thought with a rather unsatisfactory conclusion, but I have to get to bed. Hopefully I've given you something to think about.

gaming,The Last of Us is far and away the worst game of its generation,"I figured I would give this ""game"" a go, with so many of my peers clamoring over the greatness of it, and naturally – as with any game praised for everything BUT its gameplay – it was ultimately less than exemplar, and in fact, the worst game I've ever played in the history of my entire life.

It was honestly my fault, I'll admit that; I took the bait that so many of my friends threw out: ""The *story* is great!"", ""Ellie and Joel's relationship development is so amazing!"", ""The graphics are breathtaking"", and all manner of non-*game*play-specific bullshit. First and foremost, the story is the most cliché of its genre and the character building is bread stale; additionally, there was absolutely, unequivocally nothing whatsoever touching about the so-called emotional ending at all – I saw that cliché excuse for a climax coming from three universes away. HOWEVER, I do see what reeled in so many of you easily touched, emotional people: the voice acting. Yeah, the voice acting is the one saving grace of an otherwise life-draining experience. And cute wittle Ellie and her admittedly funny banter touched your bleeding little hearts, I'm sure. Literally nothing else about the story is memorable; just Ellie and that pedo-cannibal-rapist with the machete.

So much praise for some of the game's most mundane facets, yet very rarely any mention of its grade F gameplay. Oh, how rich the gameplay is. Worst third-person camera in the history of the industry; riveting, corridor horde confrontation possessing an unrivaled degree of uninspired linearity; a walking simulator rivaled only by Hitman; and last but not least, genre-ruining, asinine, button-prompt interactivity. I suppose that's all it takes to corral in gamers nowadays: an easily accessible experience with good marketing and fanboy ""rave"" reviews from big-time critics to boot. Instant money. To hell with gameplay! As long as the story touches hearts and it looks pretty, it's all well and good!

I'll admit, I'm rustled. But that's merely a consequence of, first and foremost, having wasted my money on – and thus contributed to the continued flourishing of – an objectively backwards product in a dying industry.

One should never be charged 30 USD for a glorified movie. That's simply absurd.

Factions is freaking amazing, though. The gameplay mechanics work quite well in that starkly different context (4 v 4 mutliplayer in more spacious/less linear environments).

DISCLAIMER: Before anyone states the obvious – Yes, these are merely the opinions of a highly unimpressed, #triggered gamer. They are aware that their opinion is on the utter fringes of the minority, but they don't give a fuck. Have a good day, lads.",technology

financialindependence,Past the halfway point—Year-by-year summary after being an F-150’s speedbump,"**TL;DR version:** had spark of FIRE mentality since high school (2003) but didn’t realize it until recently, put plans into overdrive after some “learning experiences” in my 20s and almost being killed by a rogue Ford F-150, and now am traveling the world on business while waterfront vacation rental properties generate extra income. Life is far too short to spend all of it working.

My 20s pretty much sucked even though I accomplished a lot. College was hard, my (very short) marriage was miserable, and there was little to my life beyond being a workaholic. I decided my 30s, however, were going to be different. *stomps foot* I’m spending more time with people I enjoy, I’m not on call anymore, the company-provided passport is getting some use, and I’m able to save much more FIRE cash. Fortunately or unfortunately, engineers top out pretty quickly if you aren’t interested in management, so putting myself at risk of Karōshi doesn’t have any real monetary benefit now. I think the moral of my story is that the sooner you figure out you’re a FIREman or FIREwoman, the easier it becomes to make major changes to your life. It’s a bit of a “DUH” statement, but maybe this will help push someone else over the edge to make a radical change. Even though I have a couple FIRE seeker friends now, I still don’t know anyone in real life who has actually quit and could encourage me even more… we are a rare bunch, aren’t we? :-) 

Although it’s a subject for another post, the vacation rental properties I mention at the end (and the team who runs them for me) just fell into place—I wasn’t looking to be a landlord… I just wanted a place to throw a kayak in the water after a long day at work. At the point I decided to purchase them, I was shoveling away cash in the boring yet effective “put every penny you can in low-fee index funds” strategy. However, when I stumbled upon this opportunity, I realized that I wouldn’t ever have another chance to own income properties like this. Either I’d make some extra money and accelerate my plan, or I’d learn a ton (the hard way) and delay my plan a year or two. Someday I'll probably live in one of them because, well, why not? At 30, I felt some minor setbacks were worth the risk since the rest of my plan is rather solid. A huge benefit of the FIRE mentality is that if you do someday decide you want to invest in something that requires considerable capital, you’ll be in the position to jump on it.

This is a (long) year-by-year summary of how I ended up where I currently am (over ½ of required nest egg saved). The one big question mark in my plan is healthcare. Under Obamacare (and someday Medicare if it isn’t destroyed) I’d be fine, but I’m hoping that whatever the new administration does settles out by the time I decide I’m done working full time. After seeing the bills (all paid by insurance) that I received after getting run over, I decided I needed to maintain insurance no matter what.


**A Kid Fumbling toward FIRE:**

* **2003** – At 17, work all summer for a computer repair and WISP startup shop. Do computer repair side gigs during the school year so I don’t have to work fast food like my best friend with the brand new car. Definitely not wealthy, but have freedom to do what I want when I want… the seed of working half as hard as everyone else while maintaining a happy standard of living has been planted without me even realizing it. 
* **2004** – Graduate from high school; need the F off of the Prairie. Move to the Southeast to study engineering in the heart of a major city.
* **2005** – No real college debt yet (small Stafford loans) and work all summer at a power plant. I turn 20. Get job in IT for college during school year.
* **2006** – Meet someday-wife, realize that I never want children. Work for same power plant again that summer… UGH. Definitely not working for that company when I graduate. Continue working IT during the year.
* **2007** – Summer of hell working for TeachForAmerica; interview like crazy for graduation next year. Become the manager and “fixer” for the IT group, set all my own hours, only work the difficult/interesting problems, and hold a full set of keys to campus with a magic “park anywhere” pass. Freedom! 5 job offers averaging ~$60k/year without a diploma yet. Win.
* **2008** – Graduate and buy most expensive house I could afford (3.6x Salary) immediately before the housing collapse. Idiot. First major financial life lesson. Put as much as I can afford into 401k and try not to look at house value. $60k in student loan debt upon graduation.
* **2009** – Marry college girlfriend without prenump (dammit)… second major financial life lesson. Refinance house from 30yr to 15yr. Payment only goes up $100/month due to way lower interest rate. First smart house finance decision. Start maxing out 401k and IRA. 
* **2010** – Realize marriage is already collapsing; working WAY WAY WAY too much after coworker transfers out of group and another retires.


**The Need for Change:**

* **2011** – Parents’ marriage ends, my marriage ends, EVEN MORE FREAKING WORK, and then I get ran over by a truck. Yes, treadmarks, 5 broken bones, a collapsed lung, and literally a “face-off” operation to fix the smashed sinuses… Worst. Migraine. Everrrrrr. Mutually sign 1-page DIY divorce settlement which protects all of my retirement accounts forever, I keep my upside-down house, and I pay off ex with a flat fee and no lawyers. Something’s gotta change, and I start reading Jacob’s ERE blog. At this point, I’m thinking mid-40s might be a possibility if I start to focus.
* **2012** – Screw having no life due to work demands… 3 months straight on 12-hr nightshifts while on call. For the 3rd year in a row. Enough! Start interviewing for new jobs while using the debt snowball to begin killing off student loans.
* **2013** – Take job for services company rather than another power plant and move closer to college friends in a state without income tax. New company gives a hiring/moving bonus; old company simultaneously gives yearly bonus and payout of remaining vacation. Sum is almost enough for the FHA down payment on my new house (bought for HALF of previous home’s purchase price). Now paying two 15-year mortgages. Shit. Drop Verizon for an MVNO; cut that bill in half at least.
* **2014** – Still paying two mortgages. %&amp;@*#%^!$!!!!! Spend 6+ months in upstate NY for work. I now know one place I never want to live (even if they do have good wine). End of year: sell old house for $50k less than I paid. Ouch. What little equity I had would pay off my remaining student loans though. Switched to Republic Wireless for even lower cell phone bill. Retirement in 40s now seems too late. Accidentally find out ex-wife is now a mom and remarried… Bullet. Dodged.


**Engage FIREdrive:**

* **2015** – Huge promotion in January after 2 out of 3 coworkers quit (1000/mo) and wiped out a mortgage (1300/mo) student loans (300/mo) and 2nd set of utilities (200/mo) resulting in an additional $2800/month in cash to play with. Finally! Kill off PMI (~50/mo) on current house after reaching 78% LTV from 96.5% in less than 2 years of ownership. Also learn how much I despise northern Ohio winters (work). Get snipped before turning 30 to permanently prevent progeny. Start running numbers; retiring in 30s seems possible. Making 6 figures before OT and per diem; spending less than $32k/year including mortgage but not paying much attention to actual costs because I simply don’t have to. 
* **2016** – Saved ~$35000 in after tax money by April to use as the down payment on first vacation rental property (2 houses; 1 waterfront lot). Close on the neighboring property (one more house) using OT money and some previous Roth contributions (no choice; sigh) 2 months later. Weasel my way over to Japan for 6 months for the least stressful “work” I’ve ever done. End the year with ~$250k in various retirement accounts but paying back $48k (down to $38k by end of year) in vacation rental startup debt (all low/no interest). Stressed beyond belief since I’ve never carried a credit card balance before (and my credit score took a pounding), but I start paying it off with thousands a month from rent and foreign incentive pay. Fly to NZ for Xmas on the company’s dime (hey, it was cheaper for them than home) and import a friend to Japan for free using airline miles. There’s finally a light at the end of the tunnel (that isn’t an F-150).


**FUTURE:**

* **End 2017** – Goal is to finish paying off credit cards ($25k at 0% interest) prior to end of year when 0% goes away. Stretch goal is to pay off foundation work on 3rd rental house ($13k @ 7%) which eliminates all remaining startup debt.
* **End 2019** – Stretch goal to have enough liquidity to pay off primary home (~$55k at that point). This would require putting away ~$2300/month starting in Jan 2018 if foundation work is paid off in 2017.
* **End 2021** – 5 year retirement plan: If I do nothing but continue to max out my 401k and throw an extra ~$800/month at my mortgage starting in Jan 2018, I retire at 36 with double the current next egg, a paid-off home, and vacation rentals that should provide enough income that I don’t even have to touch my savings. I also have a real pension that kicks in around $1100/month 30 years later, but of course this is far less than it sounds due to the impact of inflation.

The only real question I have though is where to retire TO, not retire FROM (as I read in another thread awhile back). But hey, I still have some time to figure that part out.",finance

To start off i did read many post. But since i'm living in The Netherlands i found a lot of information that was not very useful to me. Then i checked the other sub in the EU and found a lot of information that can't indirectly answer my questions. I apologies if i'm posting it in the wrong sub, but i feel i could be directed in the right area if i post it here.

For the past couple of months i'm living back home with my mom, my mom needs help but this is another topic. 
starting feb 1 i'm moving out and in a new apartment. So this spreadsheet is mostly aimed at that time. I will be moving in an apartment with almost nothing. No bed no furniture no pots or plates etc.
The apartment requires 2 months down payment + 1 month rent  is a total of 2520 euro which i have in my savings (and already excluded this from my spreadsheet).

I have a school debt of exactly 13.592,11 euro with an interest rate. I do not fully understand they way the interest is calculated. According to the website its always fixed for 5 years.  I had to start paying back my school debt in 2012. According to the website my interest is set at 0.60% but i can't make sense of the calculation.
My current debt is 12.973,36. I only started paying back starting June 2016.
From June 2016 until Jan 1 i have paid a total of 1039 euro and 109.19 interest.
So i don't fully understand why my debt only has a difference of 618.75 euro
I have provided the details in the spreadsheet linked at the bottom.


My only savings right now is 480 euro's in the bank.


In about 6 months i'm going to be a dad, and reality is slapping me really hard in the face. My biggest concern is my school debt and i want to pay it off as soon as possible. But at the same time i want to create a savings for the baby.
I am the only one that is working. My partner does not have a job. But instead does baby sitting (off the book). She will be doing this until she cannot work anymore. I think maybe 4 to 5 months.

With my own income i have a negative of 15.65 euro every month
Here is the spreadsheet containing information about my income and how i spend it.
Then i combined it with my partners income. The 4th tab is my school debt paid till now.

personalfinance,Im buying a house. Is it better to buy high with low interest? Or buy low with high interest?,"I live in Los Angeles and am planning on buying a house. The homes I'm looking at are priced between $375,000 and $425,000. I qualify for about 4.7-4.9% on a conventional loan and about 3.9% on an FHA. On a 30 year loan this puts my payments at around 2400-2700/month depending on the loan and the cost of the home. If the bubble pops in a year or so, and the same homes drop down to the $300,000 range, I imagine I would get a higher interest rate. Which scenario is better in the long run? High-price/Low interest or Low-price/Higher interest? I'd really like to get that monthly payment down to around $2,000/month.

In the first scenario, lets just say that I would be paying $2500/month for 360 months.  That means I'd end up paying $900,000 for a $400,000 house.  If the market drops and housing prices get lower, and I get a higher interest rate, would I end up paying less for the same house in the long run?

personalfinance,Save for a car or pay off student debt?,"I'm 35 and have $30,766 left on my last 3 student loans. I've paid off all of the higher interest ones using the snowball method. They're all under one servicer so I pay one bill that is divided among the three and the average rate is 4.94%. The minimum payment is $296 a month which I just round up to an even $300. I just paid off another student loan with a higher interest rate. I was paying $200 a month on that one to pay it off faster (snowball again). So I was paying a total of $500 toward my student loans.

Emergency fund is taken care of. Son's college fund is well underway, in fact it's doing great! Retirement funds are doing their thing. All expenses have been budgeted for. So I feel like I actually have disposable income.

So I'd like to buy a Tesla Model 3 sometime before my 40th birthday in just under 5 years. I figure by then, it'll a. be out, and b. might have some nice used ones out there. I'm figuring, though, that a new one with the bells and whistles that I'd like, and not counting tax credits because those are likely going to go away under the new administration, that the car will cost around $50,000. My current car is paid off and I plan on driving it until I get the Tesla. Hopefully I'll be able to sell it for some extra cash. I don't expect to save the full price of the car, but I feel that I can save a sizable amount for a down payment to lower the monthly loan payments.

My question is, should I take that $200 and start investing it to make my money work for me (likely stocks/mutual funds) or would it be smarter, even in the short term, to put that money, and maybe any extra, into paying off my last student loans? I've calculated that I could have the student loans paid off if I pay about $600 per month in the same time period, 5 years. So maybe the savings on interest on the loans would count as ""savings"" toward the Tesla?",finance

personalfinance,Should I take out a personal loan to pay off Nelnet?,"I hope someone can help me out.
I have a federal student loan with Nelnet
I've been paying for 5 years now the same amount of 150 every month.
It's now at around 8400
I recently consolidated the loan with a  5.2 percent rate.
I thought it was a fixed rate, but I guess not because I made the payment of 150 the first month and they took 7.50$ interest and then this month, same payment of 150, they took 45$ interest.
I'm just annoyed because if I look at all my recent payments the fluctuation in the interest rate is ridiculous.
I know banks won't pay federal loans directly and nether will any companies like So-Fi, Sallie Mae etc. because this loan was from a vocational school that isn't listed.
So what are my options here?
I plan on going to my bank BOFA to see if I can just take out a personal loan on a fixed rate.
Do you guys think this is the best choice?
Someone told me it might be better to get a loan with a credit union.
I have a credit card with BOFA and they know I make my payments on time and whatnot.
Also my credit score is 750 last time I checked so I'm not too worried about getting denied for a loan.

personalfinance,Retirement account 7% guaranteed return or Diversified Equity (expense ratio .175) ?,"Hello PF,

I've been visiting PF for the last year and love it. So thanks in advance for all the help. 

My wife is a teacher in the NYC Department of Education. In addition to a very generous pension she has a retirement account. 

The retirement account has only a handful of funds that one can choose to put their money in:

We are currently debating the merits of putting the entire balance in the Fixed Return (7%) vs keeping some in Fixed Return and putting the rest in diversified equity. 

The funds are described as follows:

The Diversified Equity Fund invests primarily in the stocks of U.S. companies, and also invests a portion of its assets in stocks of non-U.S. companies and other types of investments. The objective is to achieve a rate of return comparable to the return of the broad equity market.

Expense ratio .175

The Fixed Return Fund offers a guaranteed rate of return set by the New York State Legislature in accordance with applicable laws. The current annual rate is 7% for members who are serving in (or resigned/retired from) titles represented by the United Federation of Teachers (UFT) and 8.25% for other members

What say you PF? Guaranteed 7% return, diversified equity or some combination of both? 

Relevant info:
Wife is 33 and plans to retire at 55, which is the earliest she'd be eligible to receive a pension. 
Edit: 7% is guaranteed by the city of New York and interest is paid quarterly, I believe. 

We are free to change are allocations at any time to any of the other funds offered by the union.

personalfinance,First time homebuyer - conventional vs VA,"Hi guys.  I'm looking to purchase my first home soon.  I'm living in CA and i qualify for a VA home loan.  I have two questions.

I'm not 100% sure what is the best path, conventional loan with PMI or VA loan with the one-time funding fee.  I noticed that with certain down payment percentages, the total pmi cost over 5-8 years is less than the VA funding fee.  I WILL be putting 10-15% down on a home so i'm wondering if there is any benefit at all to a VA loan.  I've read that VA loans can score you a lower interest rate which is fixed and will never fluctuate.  I have a high 700s credit score so i'm not sure how beneficial this is as i'm sure i can get a reasonable interest rate on a conventional loan.

Also i was curious about straight numbers.  I think typically the annual return on a 100k investment is 4-5% which should be above the interest rate on a mortgage....so is dropping such a high down payment just to avoid PMI really beneficial at all? (aside from a lower monthly mortgage payment).

My partner and i bring in about 235k(pretax) annually and she is dead set on a home which is 590k.  That would put our total debt below 3x our annual salary (we have NO other debt), but i would spend EVERY penny of our savings on the down payment (except a small amount to cover the yearly escrow balance that might be required by the lender).  We have about 6-7k to put towards savings each month, but i foresee at least half of that going to furnishing and whatnot.

I apologize for the poor structure but there are many things going through my mind at the moment.  Thank you all for any guidance you may have.",finance

I put all of my information into turbo tax and before any student loan interest write offs my return was say ~800 federal, owed NY 50 and MA 50.

Even though I already hit the max possible interest write off, I put in the next loan.  For some reason, I owed NY and MA money again, even though nothing changed except I put in that i paid more money to student loan interest.  What is up with this?  Isnt writing off student loans optional?  Cant i just leave it where it benefits me the most?

personalfinance,"I'm receiving an unexpected 30k inheritance. No debt, etc. A couple quick questions on how best to parlay this in to a downpayment on a bigger home in 3-4 years.","Hello -

As mentioned I'm receiving an unexpected inheritance of around 30k.  I'm kind of at a point where I have a girlfriend I'm about to propose to and begin a family with.  I have no debt, but minimal liquid savings (basically a 2 month emergency fund), a (really good) state pension through work and a small 401k.  My girlfriend (eventual wife) has 20k in student loans that she is working on.

I am 30 years old.  My biggest self assessed issue is I need to put more towards retirement as I've allowed myself to really lean on the pension which is stupid.  

My only major financial blip is my home.  I bought a 1br condo in an expensive (but stable) city a year and a half ago.  We have 4 more years before we think we'll have firmly outgrown it.  My mortgage payment + condo fees is roughly the same as rent in my neighborhood ($2300/mo).  My goal is to avoid selling the condo and rent it for as long as I can.  

I bought it at 390k with 3.5% down, and a 3.75% interest rate.  No MI.  I realize I need to pay the principal down as fast as possible, so I add on an extra month's payment split across the year + a little extra.  


We will eventually need a 3br house which I'm ballparking to list at 800k.  This is probably the scariest part of my future life - the down payment is monstrous.  I've been reading the flowchart etc and I'm wondering:  how does this upcoming massive expenditure impact me?  Does it change how I should treat this lump sum?  


My immediate instinct was to drop it into a 1% APY savings account and then sock as much extra money away into this account as we can each month.  I like the idea of having the liquidity in the event of an emergency.  Is this a bad idea?  Should I be looking at better options?",finance

I live in Canada. 

I am graduating in April of this year. I have to write a licensing exam in June before I can obtain a job in my field. I don't expect it to take very long to find a job afterwards (there is high demand). 

Currently I do not have a high income. I am in the practicum portion of my degree where I do full time shift work. This leaves me little opportunity to pick up shifts at my part time job. I receive student financial aid, and the loans will be 100% forgiven by the government as long as I stay in the territory to work after I graduate. 

Being a student, I am barely scraping by. I still manage to put $50-$80 per month into a tax-free, high-interest savings account. I have saved $840 in the last 6 months. 

I do have some debt on a line of credit. Unfortunately, the student financial aid is not quite enough to get by. The interest rate is 8%. I have managed to keep it steady for the last couple months, and I will be putting a good portion of my tax return towards paying it down. 

My questions:

- Is it possible to still invest while on such a low income?
- If it is possible, what investments are best for students?
- Are the micro-investing apps (Acorns, Stash) legit? If so, are they worth it?

personalfinance,Student Loan Advice - Refinancing(Me) &amp; PSLF(Wife),"I'm creating a game plan for my wife and I to set our long term plan for tackling student loan debt. I work in private sector as a tax accountant, and my wife is a school guidance counselor (hence PSLF strategy). 

I'm considering refinancing my federal/private(1) student loans and have looked into SoFi and Credible. I don't think it's wise to refinance my wife's student loans and take her eligibility away for PSLF. 

Here's what our situation looks life:

Me: Public Loans at $50,309, avg rate 5.27% (includes subsidized and unsubsidized). One Private Loan at $6,431 at 10.12%. Total loans $56,740. I'm trying to run both scenarios of refinancing versus avalanche and targeting highest interest rate first while paying minimum to cover interest on all other lesser-interest bearing loans. I'm also considering only refinancing the private loan to reduce the interest, then avalanching from among all the student loans from there.

Wife: $118,841 Federal Loans, avg rate 5.69%. Given she's eligible for PSLF, I don't think refinancing is wise. She's applied for Income Based Repayment Plan. Is there a better strategy than PSLF for 10 years? Anything I don't know that I should? I've read into PSLF requirements and making sure you verify your employment qualifies. One question: Does the 10 years need to be full time consecutive? I.e. - If we have children and she takes time off or misses a year of full-time then starts back up, does the 10 years reset? Or is it cumulative 10 years in public service?

Our Monthly Net Income is $6,745.

As a rough calculation, we have to pay $982.45/month on our total student loans to cover only interest. Which is ~15% of monthly net income.

From the total monthly budget, my conservative calc gives us about 20-25% disposal net income, or $1500-$2000, which we'll use to allocate to emergency fund goal (6 months living expenses), housing down payment (currently putting away 500-600/month), and the rest essentially to our highest interest bearing debt.

personalfinance,Financing a University Degree (UK/EU),"Hello Redditors,

I have come here looking for valuable information regarding my future prospects.

I am currently studying for a BSc in Economics (in Denmark, although I am not Danish) and I will be finishing the degree next year. I originally took up the degree only to get more independent and to enhance my level of English (And because economics is an interest of mine). I feel that I have already achieved this. Now, my goal has always been to pursue a professional or academic career in law or related jurisprudence. Therefore I have applied to various institutions all over the world to pursue this degree (took the LSAT and LNAT, both for USA and UK). Eventually, I got accepted to one of the best universities in the world (2018 entry) and I am now to decide on how I will carry out the actual financing of my degree. As I have decided to study in the UK, I am not eligible for any state supported loan (EU student). This is due to the fact that I will have already completed my first undergraduate degree by the time I start the actual law education. This forces me to look for finances elsewhere. It should be noted that I am 100% determined to follow this path (combination of economics and law) and I know that I would never forgive myself if I did not accept this law offer. 

Long story short, I am looking for alternative ways of financing my university degree. I would be grateful if someone had any idea of potential private loans (banks, institutions..) that would follow similar principles as that of the student loans. I could not find any. Any other suggestion on how to handle this situation is also hugely appreciated. 

I have listed the options I have collected so far. Though, I would like to avoid some of them. The total amount of at least 50 000GBP will be likely required to succesfully survive my education.

1. Philanthropic foundations in my home country - given the fact that I am currently in the top 10% of my class at a top nordic university and that I had excellent school-leaving examination results, I am eligible to apply for various grants. However, the prospects of me getting an actual grant are low as these scholarships are distributed to only a few of the brightest students. And they usually favour STEM fields students. 

2. Home country banks - maximum student loan is only about 1/3 of the actual number needed. Therefore this option is not very appealing. We have a free university education and thus the loans are not very common.

3. Futurefinance.com - sounds feasible. However, the interest rate is ridiculous (over 10%).

4. Family - would not like to go down this route. We have some possibilities, but only as a last resort. 

5. ???

6. Profit.

Since I live with my now wife, we have both of us take care of our accounts. Sometimes we share what we want to expend the money in, sometimes we do it after we've bought it.

Well, in the last weeks I had been reading a lot of /r/personalfinance and decided to use the data provided by our banks to have a more detailed overview of how our finances have been in both 2015 and 2016.

[Here is the result.](http://i.imgur.com/JrS8JRl.png)

What your are seeing here is the money we earned in orange, and the balance in our accounts. For this graph to be fair, both lines start at 0, without taking into account few hundred euros we had before. I sat for about half an hour trying to justify what I was seeing.

**I am really scared,** not because of the line that shows the saved money (which I knew about) but the amount of money that actually entered home. Entered and is gone. If it were not for this subreddit, and the good advice that is given here, I would probably consider me lucky to have about 11.000 euros in savings (despite this being only about 13% of the earnings in this time). **I am capable of saving more.** 

Buying may give pleasure for a week or two, but this graph is depressing. 

- I knew that the bank was charging me a lot of charges that other banks didn't, but did nothing to solve this. This amounts to 300 euros...

- Around 13.000 euros were used in cash, so it is difficult to have the whole picture. Both me and my wife will pay more with our cards to organise our budgets easier.

- I received exactly 12.02 euros in interest money (after taxes) for two years. The interest rate is 0.05% IIRC. This is unacceptable from a /r/personalfinance point of view, year I didn't look any investing opportunties until now.

**VIEWPOINT:**

Brexit and Euratom: No rush to exit?

As the UK government moves towards the formal process to exit the EU, Jonathan Leech and Rupert Cowen consider the implications of Brexit for the nation's membership of the European Atomic Energy Community.

We would challenge the view that withdrawal from Euratom is inevitable, at least at this stage, and consider how the government's approach now may help or harm its ability to minimise disruption to the UK's position within the global nuclear community.

It is clear from Theresa May's speech on 17 January that the government sees little room for compromise in exiting the EU - there is to be no ""partial membership of the European Union, associate membership …, or anything that leaves us half-in, half-out. … We do not seek to hold on to bits of membership as we leave"".  It is also clear that government is committed to re-establishing the supremacy of UK law within the UK. ""Leaving the European Union will mean that our laws will be made in Westminster, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast. And those laws will be interpreted by judges not in Luxembourg but in courts across this country. Because we will not have truly left the European Union if we are not in control of our own laws"".

Regulators and stakeholders

There might have been a time in the past when the working of government was less visible and decisions announced as a fait accompli. That is not so much the case today - the arc of history reflects global movement toward broadening information flow and participation, says Stephen Burns.

A seminal article by American public policy analyst Sherry Arnstein, written in 1969, presented a ladder diagram to explain the graduated levels of public involvement in government decision making. The ladder has eight rungs that represent varying levels of public ""clout"", so to speak, in the decision-making process of those in power. The lower rungs depict non-participation and the middle rungs focus on education and information as well as some consultation. But as you get higher on the ladder - on the rungs that I think we're most interested - you get to partnership.

I do believe that today partnership between stakeholders and regulatory organizations, as well as openness and transparency, are seen more frequently as traits of a good regulator, and are increasingly set out as goals in strategic plans throughout the world. Today, I believe we do expect regulatory decisions to be made openly and after decision makers have carefully examined all the facts and with input from their stakeholders. But that raises a question not particularly addressed in Arnstein's ladder: Who is a stakeholder?

personalfinance,How does a car loan interest works,"Ok, my mom the other day showed me it doesn't work like the way I tought, and I didn't fully understand how she explained it.

The way I see it is, let's say the car is 15000$, you put a down payment of 5000$, thus making a loan of 10 000$. Let's take 10% interest rate, my calculation would be 10% of 10 000$ would be the intesrest  I pay, being 1000$, so total would be 11 000$. So I would have 11 000$ divided into payments.

personalfinance,"I have a a $75K salary that wants to get a home, and shocked at the taxes. Is this tax amount correct, and would starting a business help get some tax back? If not, what will?","Salary is $75,000. I was shocked when my paycheck was about $1800... since $75K/12 months is $6250. I did the math and it seems correct.  

**Edit/Update: My paycheck is $1800 biweekly, of course not monthly**

My question is, how can I best utilize that lost tax? Should I start contributing to a 401K? Start a business and use it at least toward business expenses I can deduct?

Here are some stats in regards to my inquiry in general

---------

$0 Debt, only cellphone bill. I live with the Ohana (family) so no rent.  I have about $40,000 in savings so not a lot but not a disaster.

Tax info: (Federal tax (25%), FICA (7.65%), Hawaii state (8.25%) comes to 40.9% tax on my salary.)

Hawaii renting is insanely expensive so I am hoping to find a bargain home (not joking, and these are condo's) for about $300K ~ $500K (higher the total price tag MUCH MUCH lower the maintenance fee) and get roommates and do airbnb.    ***Hold your brakes, $500K may seem a lot but realize I am not a fool and would only go up that high if its one of the resort-rental airbnb legal buildings in my part of town that rent upwards of $300 a day already. I also have money to do a full remodel of a home. 

My family is here so after a few years of residence I can also move in with them as a last resort or move to a better job off island and rent it out completely, I am ok with it being cash flow negative as long as its in a good part of town with good tourism. 

I am planning on putting $0 down thanks in part to to the VA loan but also because my job may be wary in about 3 years due to it depending on a contract that will likely be renewed but you never know till it does, right?

Im definitely a bit stressed since this job is a lifetime opportunity for me and I feel like my hands are still tied in terms of financially growing.   I would arguably not even buy a home if I lived closer to work but anyone who lives in LA or Hawaii knows what crazy traffic is like and traffic is insane here.",finance
personalfinance,Should I even consider using my 401(k) as an option in paying off CC debt and loans?,"I've been paying into a 401(k) since my early twenties at around 3-6% (matched) and am in my early thirties now so I've managed to save up around $65k. Last year I got married and we paid for everything ourselves and had it all planned out. Unfortunately, my wife lost her job right after the honeymoon and we've been struggling with debt ever since. We have about $35k in credit card and personal loan debt, with the least of those being a low interest $14k loan, and a $7000 credit card bill. The remainder is spread out across a few other credit cards of varying interest rates, and the car will be paid off next year. None of this includes student loans.

My wife did eventually find a job, but the pay isn't great and is only enough to cover part of rent, utilities, and her own medical and credit debt. We've been smart about what we spend money on and how we can save more, but it never seems to be enough and we've been living like hermits for the better part of the first year of our marriage.

It has gotten to the point where every month I've needed to withdraw anywhere from $300 to $1000 from my 401(k), not including the 20% penalty and fees. In total I've probably taken out about $5000 over the past few months. 

I know how incredibly stupid it is to rob myself of this money, but it's been the only way that we've been able to afford rent and groceries while also paying off the minimum balance on our debt. It has just recently become very tempting to take out a large loan against my 401(k) to pay off the lesser debts to give us some breathing room while we move to a cheaper apartment and start saving and paying more than the minimum required. The loan would likely need to be paid back before I'm able to make any sort of contribution or get any matches. 

So is any of this a good idea? I'm 31 and will be working for what is likely a very long time, and have been interviewing for positions that will pay significantly more, but I just feel that getting rid of some of these obligations would reduce our stress and help us plan for the future. I'll still be left with a good chunk of my 401(k), even if I take out $14k, and know that at my age there isn't always the luxury of having started a 401(k) so early (You can see how much I've tried to reason this out). I can provide any other information necessary if you think it will help.",finance
personalfinance,"My wife and I filed our taxes, and we owe $1.7k. What are we doing wrong?","My wife (age 23) and I (age 22) both work. 

We've been married a year and a half, and both worked for the entirety of 2016.

We have no kids, and we claim married 0. We have two car payments totaling around $470 a month, and we currently rent for $450 a month. Together we made roughly $70,000 in 2016. 

I made $34,000 at my only place of employment. 

She worked full time from January to May for employer A and then part time from June to December at employer A because she picked up a second job (employer B) where she worked full time from June to December.

She made $19,000 at employer A in 2016, and $17,000 at employer B in 2016, bringing her total income to $36,000.

We've filed our Federal taxes and we owe them $1200. We're currently filing our State taxes and estimate we'll owe them around $500 (we live in the state of Maine and get taxed like crazy).

What are we doing wrong? What should we both do to ensure this doesn't happen to us again come tax season next year? It's a real bummer. We have money saved to cover it, but we're also in the process of trying to save to buy a house so we're no longer renting. Is renting part of the issue? We have relatively low expenses given our income. The cost of living in our area is pretty low, so $70k allows us to live comfortably.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Should I get my annual report now or wait until closer to graduation to make sure it is as up to date as possible?

Should we try to please every person on the planet? And will doing so make everyone happy in the end?  3. How necessary is it that the government be the one that takes care of you when you wont take care of yourself?                                             4.

How well/unwell do you all feel the world economy is doing and how well is it benefitting the majority of humans?                                                  6. Is the rights of the individual more important then the rights of the group?                                                      7. Do you as an individual want to have an impact on the world or an impact on yourself?                                                    Now we get to the new system that can deal with a lot of economic, social, and over all health of humanity problems we have today.  The system is laid out so that every human AND business on the planet is assigned to one of three categories: Assets, Neutrals, or Liabilities.                                            Assets - Humans/businesses that are contributing/adding to the overall progression of humanity.                              Neutrals - Humans/businesses that are neither adding nor subtracting from the overall progression of humanity. I.e. People that assets are taking care of instead of the government, or people that are not subtracting from humanity, but not adding to it either.                                          Liabilities - Humans/businesses that are taking away/subtracting from the progression of humanity.                          People in Asset and Neutral categories may stay there as long as they want                                       Liabilities are giving a time limit for how long they can stay a liability/need to move to either the asset or neutral category. This time limit is not yet chosen but we would need to do it on a case by case basis at the start till we can become accurate in our time limits for people. After the time runs out, each liability would be given a job of the governments choosing to turn that liability into an asset. If the liability still does not want to work to become an asset in an assigned job, he will have to be moved a certain country/location, which is yet to be chosen. This location will be for all those who choose to only make decisions that are best for themselves. They may rule this county how they wish and continue to have individual interests guide themselves, but the rest of the world would not trade or do business with them.                                      In this system the government is a nonprofit organization, but it is a pro progress organization, it is ran like a business, just like any good business that lasts, the business fires or manages its risks and liabilities. In a business, the business itself is more important then the CEO or even the lowest employee. There will be no need for taxes because each individual will pull there own weight and/or any taxes that need to be charged will be to satisfy the needs of only the people working for the government. Similar to a employee owned business like WinCo foods. As an employee you don't pay your boss to work for them, they pay you.  This system will still be a free enterprise system so the more people that your service, product, labor, or idea benefits, the more you become a greater asset and therefor have more money and freedom you have to work with, the only exception to this free enterprise model is the the incentive isn't money anymore, it is progress. This solves our economic situation where inflation is increased by the whim of the FED/IRS. FED and IRS are at least American terms for the people behind our currency. Instead of the gold standard that the dollar used to be based off of, we would then use the world progress standard. If no new assets or progress points are being produced or if the assets in place became obsolete, inflation would stay the same or fall/be negative.  In this system a pharmaceutical company that is currently making money off of how many people they can provide a treatment to, is not an asset, because they are incentivized to keep people unhealthy rather then find cures to diseases, whereas Walmart is providing a service that is benefiting a large portion of the population, Walmart both hires people that need jobs, and keeps the prices for there products and services very affordable so that many people can benefit, therefore Walmart is an asset to humanity.                                              The political issues that we currently have are based upon the selfishness of individuals. The individuals think that the rights of the individual are more important than the entire population. The upper class would like to keep themselves in the present position in life or get hire, which isn't new knowledge. Middle class  wants the same thing. And you guessed it the lower class wants the same thing. Think to yourself who is being the least selfish of the the three groups though. The lower class might think they are the least selfish, but who's needs are they trying to meet other than there own. The middle class might say they are the least selfish, but they are just in the comfortable range where they are not taking away from anybody, but they are not providing a service to the rest of humanity. The majority of the the rich people in the world probably do think they are the least selfish in the world, because they are the ones that are living below there means, while also providing a product, service, or idea that benefits the population. Is Bill Gates a bad guy or selfish because he is rich? Or is he a unselfish man because his idea/dream to provide a computer to every household is coming true and the population is benefiting?                                            The social and ethical issues of telling people they have to participate or not reap the rewards of what the group sowed are solved very quickly. If we just think of a smaller scenario. In the scenario where a group of students at asked to work on a project and only three do the work, is it actually appropriate to say that the two that didn't do the work should still get the same grade. Is it ok for the three to say they don't want to work with the two ever again because they'll end up doing the work again. Somehow when we are talking about large groups the social and ethical rules change. Why is this?Is it UNETHICAL to say not everyone gets a medal? Is it inappropriate SOCIALLY to say that not everyone gets a medal?                              This system caters to both liberals and conservatives. Conservatives still have all same rights as before. As long as they are assets to humanity, they may do, say, or believe what they may. We are also putting everyone on the planet on an equal playing field. Race, gender, sexual orientation, how big, how strong, or how smart you are, Is if little importance. All that matters is that you are contributing to the groups needs and goals while living below your own means. We need people on planet earth to start thinking bigger. We need people to stop thinking of what they want and start thinking of what kind of earth they want for there children. In our current system where the government is trying to take care of everybody while trying to please everyone at the same time. Is the psychological needs of the individuals in the system being met or unmet? Are the majority of individuals happier or more sad in the end? How can we better incentivize people to fallow there dreams, become assets to society, and have the majority of the population to be happy and productive people.

Straight to the point. 

Stats: M/27/Single/No dependents 


Worked two different jobs last year.  My current employer, where I made about $11,000 and was federally taxed 864.12.  And my job from Jan-July 2016 where I made about 15,000 and was taxed 1,486.29.    

Overall Income before taxes: $27,549.00.  
Total fed taxed: $2,350.41

So I am still getting a return for a few hundred dollars, however, I am extremely upset because my return was at $1,400 (state included) before I added my previous job where I pulled in 15K.  I understand ""the more you make... yada yada"" but I did not think that would fuck me when I am still making under 30K a year.  Especially when I was paying the same amount of taxes...

Basically, I am wondering what I can do about this, if anything at all.  I am so upset, I feel like just deleting one of the W-2's off of TurboTax.  Though, I know that may not turn out well in near future...

I would at least like advice on how to avoid such a disappointment for next year.  I am grateful I do not have to pay the government.  I am just really upset seeing my initial number being so high and then that number getting royally fucked after adding income with the same amount taxes taken out.

Thank you!!!

For FAFSA, I filled out my parents income and everything, but they live in Canada, so basically I get like 4k in grants, and 8k in federal loans, and the rest is a ParentPlus loan that my parents can take out. However for the ParentPlus loan, they need to either be living in the states or be working in the states, but they aren't so they aren't able to take out the loan, which meant that I've had to go to Sallie Mae for the rest of my tuition costs. I predict that if I graduate on time, I'll be around 180-200k in debt and I'm extremely worried about that. I was wondering if there are any ways that either my parents or I could go about the ParentPlus loan so that they could take it out? Or any financial options I could do lessen my future debt?

personalfinance,Need help getting out of debt,"Greetings,
I'm dealing with a serious amount of debt that I accumulated in 2013 from being out of work for a year. I lived off my credit cards during this time since I did not have an emergency fund. The debt accumulated fast due to rent, expenses etc. Luckily, I was always able to keep up with all my payments. Therefore, I have a lot of debt but no negatives.

I now have a decent job.

Per month:
Income: $ 3,443.00 (This is after tax deduction, retirement contributions)
Mileage Reimbursement: $ 150.00 (sometimes up to $300)

Currently after my expenses (rent, car, groceries, min credit card payments) I only have $380 extra per month.

Here is my debt:

personalfinance,How to get a primary residence financed without first having a primary residence?,"I am currently renting but want to buy a condo in Thailand for approximately $70k. The best loan I can get in this country is a 9% interest rate with a 50% down payment. I have a previous US residence I currently rent that has $45k remaining on the mortgage. I explored doing a cash-out refinance or HELOC on my previous US residence, but seems like it's not possible because it's no longer my primary residence =(. 

Finally, I asked my mom if she'd be willing to take out a $115k mortgage on her home allowing me to pay off the rental property and the condo.Then I'd make payments directly on her mortgage. This allows me to pay off the other two properties immediately while getting a lower interest rate than what  is currently available to me. Also I only have to worry about one mortgage payment instead of two. She is 60 and retired, but her home is already completely paid off with an estimated value around $250k. 

Is getting a new mortgage for my purposes on a property that's already owned free and clear a viable/possible solution or are there any other options that I could look at?",finance
personalfinance,Looking to get a home loan - not sure how to complete the application - Tennessee,"My husband and I are expecting a baby in the summer and need to find a larger house (currently in a 900sf house that is small for two adults). We know what price range we are looking for and should be able to afford it no problem. Our desired monthly mortgage payment would be about 10% of our take-home pay. I am currently trying to get pre-qualified for the home loan before we put in an offer on a house.

Brief history - I bought my current house before my husband and I got married. My current credit score is about 780 now. We are planning to roll the equity into the down payment for the new house ~$20K.

Our financial situation is solid - we both work full time in a city with a very low cost of living - Memphis. Neither us have any debts - no car loans, no credit card balances, no school loans.

My husband does not have a credit score as he has never borrowed money - paid cash for his cars, no credit cards, etc. Would it be better for me alone to apply for the mortgage alone or both of us be listed as co-borrowers? Would there be any advantage to having him on the application - I am trying to keep the paperwork simple. Could the interest rate on the mortgage go up as he does not have a credit history- higher risk on paper?

Thanks in advance for your help.",finance

My monthly fixed expenses are:

-$735/month rent + utilities (utilities are split with my roommate)

-$30 internet

-$65 car insurance 

-$50 phone bill

-$200-$300 

-$4,000 credit card debt with pretty high interest rate (cant remember the exact amount, but its not pretty.)

I would still like to continue doing fun things on the weekend and have a bit of eating out/spending money. How much would you guys suggest saving a month? I am tired of spending money as soon as I get it and with this new job would like to be a little more wise with my money and future.

deeplearning,Inception and OCR,"Hello all, I am trying my hands on an OCR project. I have this idea of casting OCR as caption generation problem and wanted to use inception v3 as feature extractor with RNN head (similar to show and tell architecture). Currently, from SVHN dataset, I have extracted bottleneck tensors of inception and fed them to RNN after embedding to suitable size. The result is I get overfitting on training data i.e. training sequences are generated perfectly but the test results are bad indicating the network failing to generalise.

I am wondering if it is bad to cast OCR as caption generation problem, and if the results I see in training is just the network memorizing stuff during training. I would like to have your opinion on this. Thanks a lot in advance.",technology

personalfinance,Need Advice on second car purchase,"Hi Reddit! I posted on here previously last year about buying my first car which turned out to be a lemon and started having problems within a week. Though I still have that car and it is still VERY unreliable until this day (I bought it for $3,600 and spent $1,000 on repairs for it withing the first 4 months alone). But because I will be moving 3 hours away from my parents home and will be attending nursing school, I need a good, reliable car for long commutes.

So I am now looking to finance for the first time for a car in the 6,000 to 9,000 range. My mother agreed to co-sign for me and I am looking to put a down payment of $500-$1000. I have been looking for my car at reputable dealers such as Hyundai, Toyota, Chevrolet, and Nissan. I make $140 a week by babysitting and is currently 11,500 in student loan debt at %3.29-4.29% all federal. But I should be able to pay that back as a nurse in Chicago.

Here are the USED cars I found so far:

•  2010 Toyota Corolla (92,000 miles): for 9,000


• 2012 Chevrolet Sonic (94,000 miles): for 7,000


• 2015 Hyundai Accent GLS (38,000 miles): for 8,915 + 3 month warranty


• 2013 Hyundai Elantra GLS (53,000 miles): for 8,912 + 3 month warranty

EDIT: I would like to spread my payments out over 60 months to keep my monthly payments down as I still need to support myself in college. Though of course I will not use all 60 months and should have my car payed off when I graduate in another 1.5 years and start working as a nurse.

I got a ticket for following to close, mine and the other vehicle were towed away, everything on my car is okay except for the front right tire is rubbing against the frame slightly (not sure if frame damage or alignment). have yet to receive the info on her vehicle. 

Here's the punch in the dick, My insurance lapsed about 6 months ago. I bought my vehicle 2 years ago set up monthly payments, from what I can gather something in my policy changed and they sent me letters in the mail to confirm the new policy/premium. I was no longer at that address and the forwarding of the mail didn't process correctly or I forgot something on my end, I only did the federal forward and did not contact each individual company. I am terrible at checking my finances on a monthly basis, I basically check to ensure that I have over $1200 in my checking account on the 14th of the month because that's when my car loan/student loans/phone bill hit during that week. So that's how it was allowed to happen

At this point I have no idea what to do, I have about $16,000 in credit that I can use. $2,000 in my checking account, and a 401K that I really don't wanna touch. what are my options? what am I looking at in terms of legal trouble, I currently earn 45-55k a year depending on commission, after car/student loans/rent/phone/food I don't have any other monthly expenses.

personalfinance,I am currently in the process of a cash out refinance. Is 3.25% 15-year fixed a low rate?,"I'm currently in year 3 of a 30 year fixed at 3.75%. We bought at the bottom of the market and our home is appraised at 260% of the purchase price. Yay for us!!! We need to build an addition and other temporary situations have led us to the decision of a cash out refinance as the best option for us. 

We are well within budget to move from a 30 year fixed to a 15 year fixed and reducing our interest rate to a lower total cost of the loan.

When I started the process, my rate was locked in at 3.825% but rates have come down and I can lock in 3.25% now without issue. Is this a good time to do this or should I wait to see if the market will come down further? We have some time before we need to break ground on the addition. I know that anything said regarding future rates would be speculative, but given 15 year fixed rates in the not so distant past were in the 2% range, I am thinking that maybe waiting a bit might pay off. I only started the refi process last week and the rates have already come down a half a percent. 

I dont know if this makes a difference to what your reply might be, but this is a VA backed loan as I am a vet. I dont pay loan origination costs and I have service connected disabilities so the VA cuts out some of the fees they charge. I have also noted that homes in my area have recently started to lower their asking price so the signs I am seeing point to rates possibly coming down further.",finance

They do not charge us rent and they will sell it to me for the purchase price plus cost of rehab and upkeep (about 65k). I currently have a credit score of 742 (mostly due to lack of accounts - 4 - and length of accounts - I moved to the US so my credit is only a few years old) and I have $2,500 in a regular savings account. I save at least $650/month but usually closer to $850. I will be getting my mortgage through Navy Federal which has 3% minimum downpayments with no PMI. So a few questions (sorry it's so long)!

1. I feel like I'm not saving as well as I can because the money is just sitting in my account. I obviously can't do any long-term (or even 1 year) savings route, but is there any way to make any sort of significant return over the next 10 months?
2. My credit should go up a little because the length of accounts will go into the next bracket (5+years) and some hard inquiries will drop off. Is it worth opening another account now to have more accounts and more available credit?
3. Three of my open accounts are student loans with about 3k in debt. I know I need to keep them open otherwise I only have 1 account but is it worth paying them down to like 1k? 
4. Obviously I will put more than 3% down but on such a relatively small loan, is it more worth it to put 5-7% and save a little or should I put 10%? 
5. I want to buy the house for more than the 65k they are charging me because they will give me back any profit.  Should I buy it for as much as I can possibly afford? I was planning about 80k.
6. Should I immediately put most of the ""profit"" money back into the house or use it as a sort of loan and save half?",finance
personalfinance,Digging myself out of a hole!,"Hello folks!!! Been lurking for a while, trying to piece together information that will help me, but I figured it was time for my first proper PF post!

I’m 31, and finally starting to get my head out of my ass, and unbury myself from years of credit negligence. I started my journey last year with Credit Karma showing a score in the 540’s. It steadily rose a point or two a month, by paying off a few collections accounts and being lucky with them actually deleting the report. This stayed much the same until last week when my Discover It secured card showed up on my report and upped my scores on Credit Karma by a whopping 120 points!!! I’m now sitting around 667 for TransUnion and 650 for Equifax. (Hard Pull for Discover dropped both 540ish scores by 20). With the initial deposit, I was hurting financially, so my utilization is a little high, but I’ve worked OT this week and will be able to pay off the balance a week from Friday, and well before the bill is due. I’m planning to keep this card at around 10%.

I have about 5k in collections, all more or less legitimate (One CA has reported the same debt twice to Equifax) with the biggest account being a power bill that is almost 2,000 by itself. I’m in the process of sending Debt Validation letters, as these are all about 3 years old and I no longer have any of the paperwork for the debts, if I ever did. If they can validate, I’m going to send pay for delete letters after that and hope for good news.

I’ve also started working to budget, my money has never really had a purpose other than me to spend, and this mindset is part of what has me living paycheck to paycheck. Putting money back for savings is one of my top priorities this year. I’d love to get at least $1000 emergency fund by April.

Would it do ANY good to try for a personal loan from my bank to pay off the 5k in collections? I know borrowing money with the interest rates I’m likely to get would cost a little more, and it’s a long shot since collections are under no obligation to delete trade lines, but I’m wanting to be ready to buy a house in about 12 months or so, any additional advice or suggestions on cleaning up the mess I’ve made?",finance

* MS Office is $10/month

OKAY. So I know I spend money on the wrong things. 

* Cheaper phone plan.. can't. I live in the midwest but travel back east a couple times a year and I've tried T-Mobile and the signal sucks. I've never had problems with Verizon.

* I cannot get rid of the car because I'm underwater as fuck on it (traded in a 2013 Cruze with over $2500 worth of hail damage for it last year, went about $6K under on that)

personalfinance,Using Credit Karma to do my taxes (CA state). Question about inputting HSA info correctly.,"Last year, on the 1st of December of 2016, I switched to a HDHP/HSA. That December, I fully loaded my HSA to the max $3350 for 2016. Of that $3350, $200 were employer contributions, while $3150 were my own elective contributions, still taken through my paychecks. 
  
When using Credit Karma, and recording my W-2 info, it asks for W-2 Form - Box 12. The description that best fits is ""Employer contribution to HSA"". On my W-2, the amount in that box is listed as $3350. So first question...do I put the full $3350 here? Even though $3150 of that money was not technically contributed by my employer (but was taken out of my paycheck of my own choosing)? We will call this Box A for reference.
  
Next, under the Deductions tab, it lists ""Health Savings Account Contributions/Deductions"". There is a box where I can fill in HSA contributions. The description is ""Include only those amounts you, or others on your behalf, contributed to your HSA."" Would I put the $3150 amount in this box? And if I put that in this box, do I still put $3350 on the box I talked about above? Or do I just not fill out this section at all? We will call this Box B for reference.
   
**Scenario 1:**
  
Box A = $3350 (this is the amount listed on my W-2)
  
Box B= $3150 (this is the amount I contributed, taken through payroll)
    
Fed tax due = $564/ state tax due = $170
  
**Scenario 2:**
  
Box A = $200 (this is the amount my employer contributed, but does not match my W2 form)
  
Box B = $3150 (this is the amount I contributed, taken through payroll)
     
Fed tax due = $241/ state tax due = $81

personalfinance,Recently received a large raise. How to make it count?,"## Some Background
I recently notified my current employer of another job offer which I planned on taking.  At the time, I was making $85k/yr salary with the company.  To make a long story short: they ended up offering a $40k/yr raise ($125k/yr salary) to remain with the company, which I accepted.

I was able to comfortably pay all my bills, save some money each month, and have expendable income on my previous salary.  Now I am looking for advice on how to best make this extra money count for my future. I do not want to have this extra money just sitting in a low yield savings account. Should I pay off my student loans at a more greater rate?  Invest in a house?  Start a Roth-IRA (I think my contribution would now be limited to my income)? Invest more heavily in the stock market?  Max out my 401k?

Any insight or suggested reading material would be greatly appreciated.

This is cheap compared to the $ trillions spent on the wars on Iraq &amp; Libya - who also defied the Fed / PetroDollar / BIS private central banking cartel.","**The fiat masters of the universe are afraid they'll lose power if Bitcoin succeeds.**

They're afraid that trillions of dollars in legacy fiat will suddenly plunge in relative value, if Bitcoin shoots to the moon.

**So they're trying to quietly cripple Bitcoin - congesting the network, suppressing the price, and offering 1.7MB centrally-planned blocksize with their SegWit poison pill - which will complicate all further upgrades and permanently cement their power - while permanently crippling Bitcoin.**

In order to provide some support suggesting that _yes they would really go that far_, we have to dive into some pretty nasty and shadowy geopolitics.

**What do the wars on Iraq and Libya, JPMorgan's naked short selling of silver, and the book ""Confessions of an Economic Hit Man"" all have in common?**

Whenever a currency tries to compete with the Fed / Petrollar / BIS [1] private central banking cartel, the legacy fiat power élite destroys that currency (if the currency has a central point of control - which Bitcoin does have: the Core devs, the Chinese miners, and Theymos). 

*[1] BIS = the Bank for International Settlements, often referred to as ""the central bank of central banks""*

Trillions of dollars were spent to take down the central banks of Iraq and Libya, because they defied the hegemony of the Fed / Petrodollar / BIS private central banking cartel. 

https://duckduckgo.com/?q=ellen+brown+iraq+libya+bis

And while you're googling, you might want to look up whistleblower Andrew Maguire (who exposed how JPMorgan uses naked short selling to ""dump"" nonexistent silver in order to prevent the USDollar from collapsing).

https://duckduckgo.com/?q=andrew+maguire+jpmorgan

And you might also want to look up John Perkins, whose book ""Confessions of an Economic Hit Man"" is another major eye-opener about how ""the Washington consensus"" manages to rule the world by printing fiat backed by violence and justified by ""experts"" and propaganda.

https://duckduckgo.com/?q=john+perkins+confessions+economic+hit+man

That's just how the world works - although you have to do a bit of research to discover those unpleasant facts.

So for the legacy fiat power élite, $76 million to suppress Bitcoin (and quietly maintain their fiat power) is chump change in comparison. 

**You all *knew* that ""they"" were going to try to destroy Bitcoin, didn't you?**

Even Jamie Dimon practically admitted as much. 

https://duckduckgo.com/?q=jamie+dimon+bitcoin

Did you really think they would be clumsy enough to try to *ban* it outright? 

Private central bankers run this planet, and they have never hesitated to use their lethal combination of guns, debt and psy-ops to maintain their power. They pay for the wars, they keep people enslaved to debt, they censor discussion and create propaganda, and they ""dumb down"" the population so nobody knows what's really going on.

Print up a trillion dollars here, kill a million people there, brainwash everyone with censorship and propaganda. That's their modus operandi.

So we shouldn't be surprised if they they ruthlessly and covertly try to take down Bitcoin. They have the means, and they have the motivation.

It was only a matter of time before they identified the three weakest centralized points in the Bitcoin system: 

- the Core/Blockstream devs

- the Chinese miners

- Theymos and the rest of the corrupt mods on r\bitcoin

And so that's where they applied the pressure. 

All three of those players listed above are easy ""soft"" targets up against the full-spectrum of covert dirty tricks deployed by the legacy fiat power élite.

The central bankers, via AXA, are paying filthy fiat to Blockstream devs, and to their Minister of Propaganda u/brg444.

**Blockstream is a ""front company"" which has been established for the purpose of performing a ""controlled demolition"" of Bitcoin.**

So Satoshi messed up. He messed up by baking in a ""temporary"" 1 MB constant into the code at the last minute as a clumsy anti-spam kludge - and then not taking it out again soon enough via a hard fork.

Now the global legacy power élite have managed to use ""social engineering"" to *retain* that 1MB temporary kludge (and now offer us a pathetic 1.7MB blocksize via very messy soft-fork upgrade which will massively complicate future upgrades).

This is their plan. This is their secret poison pill for Bitcoin. SegWit is the trojan which will be the final nail in Bitcoin's coffin: giving only a pathetic 1.7MB centrally-planned blocksize - via a soft-fork that will mess up Bitcoin's code so much, it will make it almost impossible to upgrade Bitcoin properly in the future.

The only way to stop them is to:

- **Reject Core/Blockstream's inferior code** - with its current 1MB limit, and its upcoming SegWit 1.7MB limit - code based on CENTRALIZED BLOCKSIZE planning, and paid for by central bankers.

- **Install superior code like Bitcoin Unlimited / Bitcoin Classic** - which supports MARKET-BASED blocksize, clean safe hard forking, and features like FlexTrans (which does the same thing as SegWit, only with much cleaner code).",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Advice on Paying Collections vs. Student Loans,"I have ~$700 in collections from medical debt as a teenager at a point when I was in college with no money and no job.  After graduating, I had trouble finding a job and ended up going back to school part time.  I say all of that to say this:  I have loans in deferment at the following balance and rates:

$2200 at 4.5%
$1000 at 5.6%
$9000 at 6.8%
$1500 of total accrued interest.

The medical debt has been handed over to collections, and originated in 2012-2013.  

My job pays ~$35k/year but I have built up an emergency fund to the point that I believe it makes more sense to pay off debt than continue to save, though my loans are in deferment for the rest of the year.  I have already paid off one loan that was ~$1k at 6.8%.

I am also trying to increase my credit score, though I am not yet looking to buy a home.  I will have to purchase a new car in the next 18 months, so my focus on increasing my credit score isn't so much a short-term concern, but sooner is better than later, and the only negatives I have on my report are those disclosed here.  No CC debt, missed payments, etc.  I do have a car loan that I pay regularly on, but the interest rate is lower than any of my student debt, and because it is one of the VW TDI vehicles subject to recall and (I think) I did a pretty good job negotiating the original (used) purchase I will get a good amount more than I paid for the car after first driving it for a few years.

Anyway, I'm just looking for advice regarding paying off the collections, setting up a payment plan for the loans, potential loan payoffs, etc. from a community that seems to have it together better than I do financially speaking.",finance

Between this summer and next summer (when I can freely work 40 hours a week instead of my usual 15 hours during school), I'm pretty positive that if I threw money at my subsidized loans, I could knock one of them out, and probably half of the other one (if not all).

personalfinance,Should I file for a federal extension?,"For the last few years my federal returns have been offset due to student loan balances in default (I know - spare me).

I got my shit together-ish and am currently in two separate federal student loan rehabilitation plans. After 9 months of payments, I will be out of default on these loans and the federal offset will be lifted.

* Loan 1 = out of default in March 2017
* Loan 2 = out of default in June 2017

It looks like my federal refund will be about $900 this year. The combined outstanding loan balance is greater than this amount (~$5000). If I file now my entire federal refund will be put towards the remaining balance of these loans.

If I do not file now and get an extension, I can receive the refund in full at a later date when the offset is lifted and use it for a high-interest credit card. I currently have about $4000 left at ~20% interest. I am paying this off aggressively at the moment.

My logic here is that once these loans are in an income-based repayment plan they will qualify as 'low-interest debt'. According to the almighty flow chart, 'high-interest debt' should be tackled first. It is my intention that once I receive my full federal refund I will put it immediately towards the high interest debt. However this will not be until, at best, July.

What would you do? Am I missing any potential issues with filing for an extension of perhaps the length of time it takes to get out from default and get a new lender? Also, as I am paying the high-interest debt now aggressively there is a chance I'll be at low to no balance by the time July comes around.",finance

What was the main cause of the change from getting a return to owing?  As of now, we are planning on changing both of our allowances to 0 and we will also check the box to withhold as if we are single.

We both have Ph.D.s, lots of debt, and were poor for many years getting our education and then careers going. We co-own a business now. Current goal is to pay off debt, but I’m worried as heck about how low our retirement savings are. 

Does it even make sense to put anything into our retirement while we are still paying all this debt? If so, what would you recommend we put into it considering our financial situation? 

Total Income minus state and federal income taxes: $193,000 (varies a LOT from year to year, but this is the average over the last 5 years - spouse and me combined). We have $15,000 in 529s for our kids and a pathetic $20,000 in retirement accounts. $4000 in personal savings, a little more in the business accounts. 

Current debt, minimum payments, and what I actually pay:

Student Loan (spouse): $145,000 at 2.875%. Not sure about min pmt – somewhere around $600 but I pay $1000/mo. As of right now, about the same amount of principal and interest are being paid toward both student loans (about $650 and $350, respectively). Both loans are consolidated, mine thru Mohela and his thru Nelnet. 

Mortgage: $304,578 at 3.375% fixed VA loan (home value ~$375,000). Min pmt is $1945.28; I pay $2200/mo.

Auto Loan: $21030 at 2.90%. Min pmt is $666.20; I pay $1000/mo.

Credit card: $0 and stellar credit

I cringe at these numbers but am also proud, because I paid these balances down a total of $40,000 last year and $46,000 the year before. 

Other expenses:

Health insurance $1700 a month (I know… horrific).

1: $1000 @ 10% for 10Yrs

2: $5000 @ 5% for 10Yrs

in order to save the most money most people would say to send additional money to the first loan because it has a higher interests rate. Reviewing the amortization schedule for these loans shows that more money goes to interest for the second loan however. wouldn't this mean that this loan costs more and additional funds should be sent to this loan to save the most money? at least until the amount going to interest is equal to that of the higher interest rate loan? wouldn't this save the most money by reducing the rate at which you're actually paying interest?

personalfinance,Not feeling too good about my family's proposed payment plan for Student Loans; would love a 2nd opinion.,"Hello community,

I showed my fiance's family (we live with them) my finances to get some direct help and they have formulated a plan to take the $10,000 I have in the bank and pay off two of the highest Federal Loans leaving me at $0. They will then take $1,500 every month out my paycheck and knock out as many smaller loans as quickly as possible. I currently earn $2k a month and have plans to increase my hours and income. 

Is this a reasonable plan? My loans are from when I was a music major and I will have to drop my Bio-engineering track to afford this. I'm really happy going to school and studying a total career change.

Is there a way to make payments to knock out these loans effectively without having my bank account hit $0 first?? This is important to me because without any security, I fall into really bad emotional places due to my abusive childhood and running away from home kind of past. 

My best example is what happened when I moved across the country to be here. Unfortunately, starting all over and not having anything in the bank, I mentally crashed; slept 8-9 hours a day, cried every waking hour, and hardly ate losing 25 lbs. I worked, but only one day a week since I didn't have any energy or ability to pull together my composure. It wasn't until I had $3,000 in the bank that I finally started getting out of bed and the depression eased, so I worked more. 

Two years later I finally saved up $10,000 and finally able to afford paying to go to school and now adding in more hours at work and picking up hobbies again. I've also gained 12 pounds back and weigh 85lbs. I've been making a minimum payment of $300 on my Fed Loans and $92 on my Navient every month.

TLDR; Please please can anyone offer financial insight to whether or not, it's necessary for me to give up the $10,000 I have in my  bank as a first move just to have a chance at paying these off?

I currently have a student loan balance of **$36k** with a monthly payment is around **$440**

*I thought most of it was at 3.5% until I looked it up last night working on another PF post...* 

Turns out the break down is more like this:

* **$23k - 7%**
* **$13k - 3.77%**  - I always thought this was fixed but when the fed increased their rate my payment went up $10 a month. 


I inherited a 401k which was rolled into a stretch IRA. The IRA has **$65k** in it. This is a stretch IRA now. I am required to take minimal distributions out of this each year. 

My original goal was to invest the IRA and take the **$440** out each month to pay for my student loans. 

My concern with cashing out the IRA to pay the student loan in a lump sum is the tax rate I will be hit with. I have to pay taxes on each distribution. My current family income is **$160k** so adding an additional 65k to our income could mean having a much hire tax bill. My income surpasses the student loan interest write off threshold which is *very frustrating.* So I have no benefit to keeping this loan.

Any feedback on what strategy I should take trying to pay off this loan? 

(edit)
*I should also note that my wife and I do have around 50k cash we are sitting on. This is our 6 month emergency fund though that is invested in a mutual fund. We could always not touch the tax free growing money and pay off the student loan with this source.*",finance

financialindependence,[Spreadsheet] Maximizing a Consistent Amount of Retirement Income,"[Link to spreadsheet](https://s3.amazonaws.com/meatstheparent/retirement_income_maximization.DEMO.v26JAN17.xlsx) (.xlsx).

TL;DR How to get the the highest consistent amount out of your money in retirement by evaluating the options to delay Social Security and outsource risk by purchasing annuities.

Full Title: **[Spreadsheet] Maximizing a Consistent Amount of Income in Retirement Among a SWR, Liability-Matching, Social Security, Pensions, and SPIAs**

---

**The Question:**

At retirement, with a certain liquid net worth, what is the maximum consistent annual income that can be had throughout retirement given: a SWR, pension(s), an annuity (SPIA), and social security?

**The ""So What?""**

So you're about to (or planning to) retire and you have a liquid nest egg and expect Social Security; now, what decisions can you make to maximize annual income from those, such that you are left with the same amount of money to spend each year. The simple answers I came up with were:

* Pick a [SWR](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Safe_withdrawal_rates)
* Choose when to start collecting Social Security (and liability match the difference)
* Buy an annuity (i.e., SPIA) and figure out at what age to do so

The trick is in finding out what combination of the above gives you the *consistent maximum* amount of income throughout the entirety of retirement. Which is why I made a spreadsheet that uses solver to find combinations of the above that maximize just that.

In the spreadsheet linked at the top, I use [Excel's Solver](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Define-and-solve-a-problem-by-using-Solver-9ed03c9f-7caf-4d99-bb6d-078f96d1652c) to find the answer to that question.

---

**How To Use:**

**1)** Modify the cells in column *N* that are green (and have the bolded word ""INPUT"" next to them):

* N13 (FRA(67)_ANNL_AMNT): Enter real expected annual Social Security benefit at full retirement age (age 67 used).
* N23 (ANNL_AMNT): Enter your real expected annual pension value at age of eligibility (defined in N22, which should also be modified) -- leave this blank ($0) if you don't have a pension.
* N27 (LIQUID_NET_WORTH_AMNT): Enter your real expected liquid net worth that can be drawn from.

**2)** (Optional) Using the [link for SPIA quotes](https://www.tsp.gov/PlanningTools/Calculators/retirementCalculator.html?tabNumber=2&amp;submitted=1&amp;amountToUse=100000&amp;ageNow=75&amp;ageFrom=75&amp;ageToLive=99&amp;birthMonth=August&amp;amountToReceive=25&amp;rateOfReturn=2&amp;haveDependent=No&amp;dependent=Spouse&amp;dependentAge=23), modify the values by age, gender, and/or marriage-status for updated quotes. Follow the formula in cells Q2 and R2 for converting the website's results into values for the spreadsheet. Note: The linked spreadsheet uses values from 25JAN17 for a male requesting a CPI-linked SPIA.

**3)** Either delete or drag rows A through G such that the first value in row A represents your retirement age.

**4)** In Data-&gt;Solver, use the ""Evolutionary"" solver method to maximize annual spending -- the maximum will be shown in column G, with the details being reflected in columns B through F.

---

**Notes:**

* SPIAs are sensitive to interest rates, age at which it is taken, gender, and whether it is joint. As such, it makes sense to price them out as interest rates change, especially as one tends towards the later years of retirement.
* When [delaying Social Security](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=102609&amp;newpost=30113740), you can take the difference and liability match it (that is, buy TIPs or some other product to match the timeline of when you need the money) -- all while reducing risk and increasing annual spending.
* This spreadsheet uses a rudimentary fixed SWR technique, which is why I defaulted to 3% instead of a higher number or modeled a variable approach.
* I want consistent spending in retirement, which is why I didn't just want to start using a SWR, only to then be eligible for Social Security and/or a pension which would drastically change my annual income profile.
* All values are real, so just ignore inflation (unless you have a pension that is not inflation-linked; watch out there).
* I do believe some version of Social Security will be around, and chose to model it as it currently is. Although, I did reduce any benefit to [77%](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/trsum/) because that is roughly the predicted imbalance after ~2035.
* If you don't want to use a SPIA, then set the max age (cell N3) to 51.
* If you use a 4% SWR, then it is unlikely that a SPIA will be recommended (at least a CPI-linked one) in this environment.",finance

Originally I intended to pull it out and move it into my account with USAA where I would keep it in CDs (certificate of deposit). However, this local credit union offered me CDs with an amazing interest rate, about double that of USAA's. They also mentioned that withdrawing the money would be difficult for them and would take some time to move assets around. Possible, just difficult because they are VERY small.

I am about to sell a house, and am considering putting the money from that sale into CDs with this credit union, as well.

I'm a tiny bit concerned about fraud and/or collapse, though. I don't have reason to distrust anyone there, but it is a tiny operation run by a handful of pretty old people; not a large institution with a ton of oversight and shareholders and a legacy to protect. Does the government protect against stuff like fraud or mismanagement? The credit union is FDIC insured, does that shield me from fraud and collapse?

My question: What are my local/municipality tax obligations? Being that I don't have any taxes (Federal/State/Local) taken out of my paycheck, am I required and/or liable for local tax obligations? I do not own a home or any property as I currently rent for my living situation.

personalfinance,"Going back to school, carrying CC debt. Save for the move, or pay off?","I'm heading to (edit: law) school in ~7 months. Apps and holiday trip back home have destroyed my savings. I'm also carrying a few grand in CC debt. It seems there are a spectrum of options for me.

* Aggressively pay off my CC debt and use fin aid to cover moving costs. Timing is an issue here, as my moving may not coincide with my moving window, and even on a maximally aggressive plan I will just zero my accounts by the time I need to pack bags.

* Aggressively save for moving etc, make minimum payments, pay off CCs once I get fin aid. I'll be able to cover moving costs, move-in costs, etc. And I'll essentially convert CC debt to student loan debt, which has a far better interest rate.

There is a spectrum between the two, of course. I'm hoping to get your thoughts on this, especially if I'm missing something important. I do that sometimes.",finance
personalfinance,My federal tax refund dramatically changed when going from standard to itemized deduction.,"Hey PF,

Hoping someone can help shed some light for me. I began to file my taxes since I have received all the necessary docs I've needed. Below you will find some high level information on my filing:

Status: Single

State: NY

Taxable income: $116K

Federal allowance: 2

State/Local allowance: 0




Itemized Deductions:

Student loan interest: (No longer qualify)

Medical Expenses: ~$300

Donations: ~$100


I was using TurboTax free version when going through the process. It showed me that my federal refund would be $1,302 if I itemized; however, when i chose standard deduction, it dropped to $68. 

My question is, does that seem too dramatic of a change? Can standard vs itemized make that much difference, seeing that the deductions weren't much? Was this a ploy for TurboTax to have me pay for their higher edition? 

Even if it was a ploy by TurboTax to have me pay them, and the difference between the two refunds are accurate, it still would make sense for me to pay the total to TurboTax ($34 for higher edition + $34 to file for State).

I know there may be some negative experiences and feelings about TurboTax, but want to make sure what I'm seeing is accurate.

Thanks for the help! let me know if more information is needed!",finance

personalfinance,Buying a car before losing job and moving out of state with not much money $#@! AGH!,"Hello!  I need some help planning moving across the country and buying a new car.  The issue I’m having is balancing my savings for my move and how much I should spend on my car.  

**Timeline**
March-April: Purchase car (ideally)
Early May: Graduating; lose my job; Begin CPA exam prep classes
Mid-August: CPA classes/taking exams should be done
September: I have to move out; Time to move out of state

**My current financial status:**
Current Liquid Cash Assets: ~ $8,500
Income: ~$1,000 a month on average. I will be out of work early May and this cash flow will stop. I’m still debating on whether or not I will find a part time job, as I will be dedicating most of my summer to studying for/taking the CPA exam. 
Debt: No debt or bills. (I will not have to pay for a large majority of my expenses through August or September)
I attached a screenshot of my current cash flows.  In the first picture, column “O” shows My savings after my budgeted expenses.   In the second picture, you can see my budgeted expenses… Starting in September, you’ll see a bunch of expenses I estimated would incur with moving out (Rent, electric, cell phone).  You’ll also see an expense highlighted in green of $5000 listed, reflecting what I think I would spend upon the purchase of a new car. The first picture’s numbers, all reflects all these budgeted expenses in the “Budgeted” section of the excel sheet. 

**Buying a new car:**
I’m looking to buy a used car this April. I think I want to spend around $15,000 with somewhere around $2,000 and $5,000 down depending on the interest rates and more research.  I do not have a car, so this is my first time shopping for one.  I would rather put more money down, however I need to find the right balance to finance my move across the country.  The reason I wish to purchase a car in April is because I will still have a job, and I presume that will make it easier to get a loan. 

**Moving:**
I have to find a new place to live by no later than October 1st.  Therefore, I want to move directly out of state shortly after I finish the CPA exam to begin my career and get a new stream of income coming as fast as possible.  I’m going to do my best to get a job in the city I’m moving to prior to my move out, but I intend on moving regardless.  Either way, I need to find a place to live, whether it be here or there, I just assume to move there though… Right?  (As said above, In the 2nd attached picture, demonstrates my estimated expenses associated with moving out starting in September.)

**Other mostly irrelevant information:**
I’m 23 and I currently live in Cincinnati, OH.  I’m aiming to move to one of the following cities: Colorado Springs, Phoenix, Salt Lake City.  I’m graduating with 2 degrees in Information Systems and Accounting.  



Any suggestions or comments or criticism would be appreciated. Especially concerning the car purchase.  I know this sounds like a nightmare… Knowingly purchasing a car before losing my job… Moving out of state after of summer of no income… Yikes.

personalfinance,Question about cashing out a whole life policy.,"My wife has a whole life policy that we're considering cashing out to put in her retirement accounts instead. From the calculations I've done, financially it seems like a no-brainer, but I want to make sure my numbers look accurate and/or if there are any implications I'm missing.

Here's some basic info on the policy:

* Policy just started it's 7th year, wife's 2017 year-end age will be 31.
* Annual premium is $1,829, paid monthly.
* The 2017 year end guaranteed cash value is $7,773.
* At year 23 (age 47) the premium is reduced to $1,654.
* At year 41 (age 65) the policy is paid up with a guaranteed cash value of $98,425, and estimated cash value of $115k.
* The guaranteed death benefit is $202,358.

I don't have the data in front of me for years 1-6, so calculations are done assuming we do this starting Jan 1, 2018, based on the 2017 year-end cash value, annual premiums and age 65 gtd cash value. From year 8 to 41 the policy grows ~2.25%/yr (slightly more if we get the est value). In that time we'll have paid in ~$59k and earned ~39k.

Since we paid $12,803 from years 1-7, cashing out at $7,773 means taking a 5k loss on the policy. However, assuming a modest interest rate of 5%, if we invested the $7,773 between her roth and traditional IRA, then continued making the same annual contributions to age 65, the return would double (~200k), more than making up for the 5k loss. 

One thing I'm not 100% sure of, is if the $7,773 is a cashout value or policy value. Though worst-case, if we forfeited the entire policy, a 5% return in her retirement accounts would still result in net gain by age 65 (~155k).

*Note*: Her average IRA RoR since 2011 is 8%, which if used instead of 5%, would yield a return of ~$400k. So my estimates are definitely on the modest side.

Doing this would obviously mean losing some life insurance, though it was originally purchased as an investment vehicle anyway. Since the policy was for her, I'm also not as concerned because I make the bulk of our income. Also, we each have $50k term-life through work.

Some additional info:

I'm currently 38. We have a 1yr old child and do not plan to have another. Our annual household income is ~85k. We each have a roth IRA, traditional IRA and 401k plan through work, with a combined value of $165k. A $20k reserve fund (5k in checking, 15k investment account), and $4,500 in a 529 college savings fund.

I think that covers it, but can provide any additional information if needed. Thanks for any help you can provide!",finance

technology,I sent emails to my Senators regarding my concern for Net Neutrality this is their responses,"I live in the state of Wisconsin and in December I became concerned about Net Neutrality being under attack again after reading a post on this subreddit. I unfortunately have not been able to locate the post that inspired me, it was concerning committee appointments that could/would bring Net Neutrality in front of the senate again. I wrote to both of my senators about my concerns and below are their replies:

____________________________________________

# Senator Tammy Baldwin (D)

Dear u/Gostaverling:

Thank you for contacting me about net neutrality.  It is good to hear from you.

I strongly support network neutrality, the guiding principle which ensures that the Internet remains open to all and guarantees everyone equal access.  I recognize the important role that openness of the Internet has played in fueling remarkable innovation and the free flow of ideas and expression.  I believe the federal government must continue to play a critical role in safeguarding the open and non-discriminatory nature of the Internet.

On February 26, 2015 the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), voted to adopt strong, sustainable rules to protect an open Internet, by reclassifying broadband Internet access as a public utility under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934.  I support this decision because it provides bright line rules that will preserve an open Internet by prohibiting activities like blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization, while making clear that over 27 provisions of Title II and 700 associated rules are not relevant to broadband service – including those related to rate-setting and tariffs. On June 14, 2016, The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia affirmed the FCC’s authority to reclassify broadband Internet as a public utility.

Our economy, democracy, and businesses large and small depend on the openness of the Internet for all.  As a member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, which has jurisdiction over telecommunications matters, please be assured of my strong support for the principles of net neutrality, should the Committee consider legislation that may affect the future of an open Internet.

Once again, thank you for contacting my office.  It is important for me to hear from the people of Wisconsin on the issues, thoughts and concerns that matter most to you.  If I can be of further assistance, please visit my website at www.baldwin.senate.gov for information on how to contact my office.

Sincerely,

Tammy Baldwin

#Senator Ron Johnson (R)

Dear u/Gostaverling,

Thank you for contacting me regarding the issue of net neutrality.  

On February 26, 2015, unelected bureaucrats at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voted 3-2 to impose heavy-handed regulations known as net neutrality on the Internet. The term ""net neutrality"" might sound good, but it is just a clever name for government control of the Internet.  

Since the Clinton administration, the FCC has wisely applied a light regulatory touch to broadband services, resulting in a highly successful broadband industry. The FCC reversed that bipartisan policy decision after consulting with outside interests rather than Congress. The decision is wrong, and the process raises serious questions about the president's inappropriate influence over what is supposed to be an independent agency overseen by Congress.

Thank you again for contacting my office. It is very helpful to hear the views of the constituents I serve. To date, my office has received more than 2,000,000 letters, emails and phone calls. My mission is to provide information to as many people as possible concerning the enormous financial and cultural challenges facing America.

I have found a better opportunity and feel school has unfortunately been a waste of money these last few years. 

I receive a federal grant. I went to my financial aid office to ask if I would possibly owe money due to this grant already paying $1700 for this semester. The best answer I was able to get from either of the financial aid staff was ""I think so"".

I understand that this is likely the case, but I would like a more definite answer than ""I think so"". And if I do need to pay the $1700, would I be able to just wait and withdraw right before the final drop date to at least lower the amount I need to pay back?

personalfinance,Question about taxes on Roth IRA withdrawn before 5 years.,"I'm trying to determine my tax obligation on a Roth IRA that I cashed before it was 5 years old. 2/3 of my account came from a pre-taxed 401k. The other 1/3 was contributions and gains. The majority of that second half was post tax contributions. In other words, it was placed into the Roth from my bank account. I did not withdraw my account for any of the exemption reasons, therefore get no tax breaks.

To help, I'm going to add numbers, as best as I can. 

In May 2013, I rolled a 401k with a value of 4896.79. This money I did not pay taxes on. At one point I was contributing 100/mo to the account, but then dialed it back in 2014 to 50/mo. This money came from my bank account and was post tax. In August, my account balance was 7852.42, which is what I withdrew. My adviser supposedly withheld 20% for taxes at the end of the year. 



My 1099R this year came in, and it reported the following boxes: 

    Gross Deductions: 7852.42
    
    Taxable amount not determined: check
    
    Total Distribution: check
    
    Federal taxes withheld: 1177.86
    
    Dist code: J
    
    State: 471.15
    
    
When I subtract taxes from the gross amount, I get the amount that was deposited into my account.

Now comes to filing my taxes and my 1099R has added 1400-1500 to what I owe to the feds. 


My income puts me right in the middle of the 25% tax bracket, I'm not sure if that makes a difference. I have no deductions, as well. 

My issue comes in at, I thought I would only be taxed on the amount that was pre-tax contributions(401k) and gains. The way the math plays out on this, I'm taxed for the full amount. I thought the amount that I deposited into the Roth would not be taxed as the money had previously been taxed as income.

We opened an account with a credit union when we bought our house in May 2016. We used this account to buy all house-related things for months (meaning: lots of purchases we weren't tracking too carefully). Our bad there.

Later in the year, in an effort to better understand our finances (after lurking here a lot), I start taking a closer look at things and notice a charge from ""Comenity"" that is unfamiliar to me. Further digging shows that they've been charging us around the same amount of money ($25) on around the same date each month.

I reach out to the credit union. They say it's an autopay to a Victoria's Secret Credit Card opened by someone else with an account number similar to ours. Sounds like they had transposed a number. Not malicious (probably) but also not great.

We file a stop payment, etc. The bank refunds 2 months worth of charges (they say this is a federal thing that they can't do more). They say to take it up with Comenity and that they can't reach out to them themselves. 

Comenity is absolutely baffled by this situation. I'm shuffled around from clueless to cluelesser and explain the situation a hundred times, to no avail.

Later, armed with this info, I reach someone who seems to have more power AND actually calls me back. We talk every week for 1.5 months as he makes calls during the weeks trying to figure out how to get my money back. 

He finally tells me today that they can't do it. There's ""no way"" to get my refund. The bank refuses to talk to them (saying I have to handle it); they can't give me any info on the person whose credit card I paid for 6 months (even though they know who it is); nobody is helping.

btc,Fire the miners: why central planning does not work,"It is well understood that the entire ecosystem has roughly built itself into a $15b ecosystem via the security and reward structure which Satoshi built to power bitcoin's supply and issuance. Trustlessness is built into the monetary policy of the currency. We don't need to ask the miners to do anything, because the structure of the code incentivizes them to mine and secure transact as part of the bitcoin economy. 

Are there edge cases? Absolutely. Throughout bitcoin's history, discussion has always been present at various academic levels around the possibilities where miners may abuse the system. There have been subsequent discussions on backup security procedures if the security system of the network is compromised. An easy and simple method is a POW fork. Miner(s) behaving maliciously? No prob, fork off, the economic majority will continue mining the main chain and they're kicked off. 

But recently, people has put forth the idea of ""firing"" the miners. Not that any malicious acts have occurred, but that the simple lack of miner support for a core developer proposal is odious. That this lack of action is equivalent to an act upon bitcoin. 

But we know that's not true. Why would miners blow up the thing they use to make money off of? The block reward (not fees) comprise 95% of miner revenue. Fees are a few sprinkles on top of a block reward cake. They have more monetary incentive than anyone to ensure that bitcoin value grows, and that it grows in-line with the block halvings to ensure that their business is protected, remaining profitable. 

Notice that none of these miners are securing the blockchain because a few of us are old high school buds and they're doing us a favor, or because they so idealistically believe in this vision of bitcoin, we're not begging the miners to do anything. 

Bitcoin works because incentives are aligned. The code has created a productive asset that serves as an effective currency as it grows. The miners are doing all of this because mining and maintaining these assets earns them money; it's how they make a living. Not surprisjng then that we've never even seem close to a hint of an at a miner attack on the bitcoin network. A 51% attack is often discussed, but we've never seen one. In fact, there was a period of time when Ghash.io *did* have over 51% of the hash rate. Guess what happened? They took no malicious act, and in the long term, cloud miners left the pool to revert to an equilibrium where miners can't even attack that vector. But the point is, the entire market is incentived to cooperate. That's how the bitcoin economy works and precisely why it is so successful. 

So we can't fire the miners even if we wanted to. They are actually operating as businesses and have explicit performance needs met to manage a p&amp;l. This isn't a fun development playground for coders. Miners aren't taking an ideological stance here in some bitcoin holy war, they are just making sure the bitcoin network continues to operate. They rejecting code that does not work. Forking away does not solve the fundamental scaling problem, because it does not resolve the issue for the miners. 

Begging or threatening the miners will only do harm. Central planning by government bureaucrats is never productive relative to a free market. Forcing the means of production to take some action, or to produce in a certain way (below 1mb blocks) is inefficient. The only solution is to actually work with the miners to determine how to best secure the blockchain for the cheapest price, because again, we all have the same incentives.

Both are about 10k and both have a 4.XX interest rate. Obviously the 401k loan is interest I'm paying myself whereas the car loans interest is to the lender. 

Is there any reason I should pay off the 401k loans before my car loan?

Additionally my credit score is above 750 so I don't really need the car loan to help establish credit.",finance

personalfinance,Disability &amp; mother in law issues,"New to Reddit- may be wrong place for this 

Mother in law has been in a disability law suit due to injury from her job for more than 8 years. Still no settlement or disability designation. 
Receiving workers comp payments amounting to $1500/month.
No health insurance/home insurance, but she does not have a house payment or car payment.
Current disability lawyer wants her to settle out at a fraction of what was originally ""promised."" Only about $20k after all his fees. 
She is mid 50s and has an attitude problem about finding a desk job (which she should be able to work) and would prefer to get on federal disability.
Has some college education and likes working with kids. 
Big problem is that she is asking for help from me and my spouse (her son) and we are in our mid 20s in school with no extra income. 
Some of her debt is my husbands college debt, which she is in default on.
She has property taxes coming up soon amounting to $2400 that she is worried she won't be able to pay.

How can I help her? Should we hold out for permanent disability and a greater settlement?
Should we take over the student loans, and if we do, can we get them into deferment since we are in school still?  (She probably took them out as regular loans, not student loans?)

Looking for advice related to the disability issue, she lives in the state of Georgia.
Also personal advice on what the best way we can help her, without enabling the types of financial mistakes that have led her to this point. 
We are doing ok financially, but we don't want to jeopardize our future either.

personalfinance,"First time filing taxes as both W2 and 1099. Very confused, many questions","So for 2016 i made $7,903.50 as a contractor and $204.13 (240-35.87) as a W2 regular employee.

My total take home pay for 2016 is $8,107.63.

So $8,107.63-$374.98=$7,732.65-$6,300(standard deduction) =**$1,432.65 taxable income?**

Do i even need to file my W2 work? I only made $240 and my former employer withheld $35.87. Is my former employer going to mail me a W2?

I don't have any other deductions i could take. So i would fall into the 10% tax bracket for federal and 1% tax bracket for California? I don't have any previous taxes to base anything on. Does this seem correct?

personalfinance,"Cut the Cards or Cancel em, and how to Complain?","So, I've been lurking on Reddit, particularly the personal finance subreddit for sometime. I finally made an account, much to the joy of my fiancé.  
I also don't know how it add ""flair"". So, Credit flair? 
I've been reading about the ins and outs of credit scores, credit cards, and debt for a while now on here and also on various websites, but I'm still at a loss as to what I should do. Forgive my negligence on my credit. I thought I was doing all the right things. Turns out I was wrong. 
Background (sorry if TMI)

* 24, almost 25 years old. 

* Gross income: $47,750; Net: $34,235 in bi-monthly paychecks.

* I have a PayPal line of credit for $1500, total balance $893. (recently learned this means nothing for credit! Hooray!)

* My parents also loaned me $2500 in cash for my car down payment which I have paid $1000 of thus far. 


* Student loans totaling $27,988 (8 separate fed loans) oldest from 2010. 

* Auto loan for $19,775. 

* Up until a few months ago I had 6 store credit cards including a Mastercard from TJ Maxx. I believed when I first started college that opening a store card was a great way to start building credit. In December my one store card cancelled, without me realizing it, due to inactivity (this was my oldest card, I didn't realize that was important). My TJMAXX card was cancelled due to a late payment.  (More on this later)

* So now I only have 4 store cards, all with a $0 balance. My active cards’ ages in order are: 2 years, 2 months; 2 years, 1 month; 11 months; and 8 months. 

* According to Credit Karma, my “Age of Credit History” is 3 years, 2 mos and my credit score is now around 660.


Now for the questions:


1. TJX card: I was late on a payment (damnit) so I went to pay a bill over the phone. Received confirmation number of said payment and never thought anything of it. Next month I received a bill with a late fee applied and a note that my card was canceled due to the late payment. Received letter AFTER that bill came that my payment wasn't processed. Called and argued with CS rep, then paid again. Called back the following day to confirm via person the payment went through. It didn't. The woman used the INCORRECT information from the previous transaction that didn't go through instead of the new info I gave over the phone. The new CS rep said he would remove the late fee, cancel the attempt of the previous transaction, and take my payment. I said I would rather pay with the late fee and get it refund once it went through, as he explained would happen. I didn’t want to fool around with the late fee not being removed on time or something happening and getting charged again. It's been 2 months and I haven't received a check. The late payment is still on my credit karma report. What should I do to have this removed and get my refund for overpaying?


2. I don't need these store credit cards. I rarely use them, if ever, and it's not like they have good perks that other cards won't grant me. Should I cancel one, some, or all of them? I know $0 balances don't have a negative effect, but will opening a new, actual card hurt me if I have 4 store cards open? I'm traveling this April and will need a rent a car, meaning I need a real credit card. I had planned to use my TJX Platinum card, as it can be used anywhere mastercard is accepted, but I'm leaving that closed because of terrible customer service. I would also prefer a real card now that I know Paypal credit is NOT a real credit “card” (thanks everyone!) to use on purchases like the airline tickets that were bought using Paypal because I thought it would play positive on my credit history. 

Any suggestions would be most fruitful! 
Thank you!

TLDR: Is canceling or just leaving store cards at $0 a better plan, and how should I go about disputing an erroneous late charge and a store canceling my card due to it? 

-Edit-  
Update! TJMAXX sent me a ""bill"" today (literally the day after I posted this) that I have a positive balance, meaning they owe me money! All I have to do is sort out getting the check. I'm waiting for the next credit check to run in a week or so to see if that derogatory mark is off my credit. I'm hoping it will be! :)",finance
personalfinance,Withdrawal of Roth IRA Contribution,"Hello! I have a quick tax question that hopefully someone can assist me with. In early 2016 I contributed $5,500 to my existing Vanguard Roth IRA. Then in late 2016, I made my first and only withdrawal from the account of $5,500. My understanding is that I can withdraw contributions made to my Roth IRA anytime, tax-and penalty-free, and only earning are subject to early withdrawal penalties.

However when I am inputting the 1099-R from Vanguard into my tax software, it is greatly increasing my taxes owed (~$2k federal and ~$650 state). The distribution code on my 1099-R is:

J - Early distribution from a Roth IRA, no known exception (in most cases, under age 59 1/2).

I'm assuming this code is the problem. When I processed the withdrawal online with Vanguard, there were no questions or selections to make regarding the type of withdrawal. I'm assuming this should probably be one of the following:

Q - Qualified distribution from a Roth IRA

T - Roth IRA distribution, exception applies

Am I correct? Is this something that can be corrected either by Vanguard or myself? I will of course be contacting them but wanted to make sure I had the correct information.

---
General background:

* 25 yo from California, single

* 2 years from graduating college, working part-time (~$200/wk)

* Living with parents


Financial Information:

* No student loans, parents pay for school

* ~$9000 car loan left with only 0.9% APR (paying $260/month)

* ~$400 balance on credit card with a 22% APR

* No savings

* No other big financial financial obligations

As the wiki suggested, I have created a budget for all my expenses and I want to start an emergency fund, save for retirement, and save for a down payment on a house.

Here is my plan so far:

* Pay off CC
* Set aside $3k for an emergency fund for 6-month's of expenses in a savings account that earns 1% interest
* Set aside $10k for retirement
* Set aside rest ($47k) for down payment on a house 

Here are my questions:

* My employer doesn't offer a 401k plan (I work in fast food). Is starting a Roth IRA and maxing it out a good idea in my case?
* I wasn't planning on buying a house for another 5-10 years. Should I invest this money or just put it in my savings account until I'm ready to buy a house? 
* Should I bother paying off my car loan immediately since the interest rate is so low? My savings account has a higher interest rate so I think I would be better off just making the payments monthly.
* Do the amounts I have set aside for each goal seem reasonable?",finance

personalfinance,Looking for some advice for a somewhat recent medical school graduate with massive student loan debts and other bills,"Hey guys! First post here. I recently graduated medical school and started a residency in July 2016. I guess it is not that recent anymore. I have been working since July.

Throughout my time getting through school, I did not really pay much attention to my expenditures and pretty much took out student loans to the max (for grad and med school). I went through college, masters, and med school (Hence, the very high loans). I guess I just survived and only now I am beginning to survey my financial damage after getting through it all. I know that I made mistakes by not being more cognizant of my spending until now. 

Here is the breakdown of my student loan debt, as well as my monthly obligations:

Debts and Liabilities
Student loans (Interest rates ranging from 5-7.9%): 424.7k (Yes, $424,700! My mind gets blown every time I see how much this number has blown up)
Car loan: just under 25k

Monthly expenses:
Student loan payments, Income based repayment: 400
Car payment: 390
Insurance: 120
Rent: 1000
Internet: 35
Electricity: 25
Gas: ~200
Groceries: ~400
Entertainment (Going out, drinks, other entertainment, dating): 400
Investment: Pay 300 monthly, just started a Wealthfront account with deposit of 3700 from checking/savings
Total of 2970

Income: 3000 post tax
Checking/Savings: 2000
Credit cards: 0

I had to buy a car at the start of residency, because the transmission on my previous car broke down right when I started in July. I ended up paying about 6k for a down payment and have a loan at 2.74% for 72 months from a credit union.

Few comments: I pay 850 a month for my rent (for a studio), but I also pay a high fee for reserved parking at my apartment complex (150 monthly). I also drive a lot because the hospitals are very spread out, but I am planning to move once my lease ends and start renting rooms (i.e. getting roommates) closer to where the hospitals are located next year. I also plan to just park the car on the street starting next year.

I have a few questions. There are varying interest rates for a number of the loans. Is it worth it to pay some of the loans off individually? I looked into consolidation to lump sump all the loans together and get a lower overall interest rate, but I would lose my ability to do income based repayment and I think that my monthly payment would actually go up. Any thoughts about this? Also, I bought the car at an inopportune time and sometimes I regret not just buying a cheaper car outright. I feel I also did not negotiate aggressively, and I feel upset that I did not really push for a better deal. Also, I knew I would need to drive daily (60 miles daily to one hospital for 9 months out of the year, 14 miles daily to a closer hospital for 3 months out of this year) so I figured it would be safer to buy a certified pre-owned car and have some peace of mind. Would it be worthwhile to sell the car and try to get a cheaper one?

I'm sorry about the very long first post! I would appreciate any feedback. Thanks!!",finance

Group A has two loans, one with $1,500 principal and one with $346 principal.  Group B has a similar situation.

I called them to ask about how to pay off the two lower balance loans since I could not figure it out using their payment system.  I got the following email response:

&gt;In response to your inquiry, unfortunately, you cannot pay off sub groups within loan groups.  However, since the interest rate is the same, it will have the same effect.

Every other loan servicer we use (AES, Mohela, FedLoan) allows us to target to specific loans within ""Groups"".  Is it true what they say about the interest rate?  I don't think that it is, because if they don't apply the money I am paying specifically to one loan, then that loan will continue to accrue interest.  I know that they are saying the overall balance will go down by the same amount, but I am not motivated in that way, I am motivated by seeing a $0 balance.

personalfinance,Yesterday I refinanced my mortgage. No one told me until I was there to sign that it was Fanny May/Freddie Mac. I've only ever heard horror stories about them. I have 3 days to cancel.,"I know it's going to sound stupid but I did not see any mention of Fanny May/Freddie Mac on any of the paperwork they sent me prior to settlement. When I got to settlement the closer from the title company was the only one there, she didn't tell me who the loan was with, I just saw it written in tiny print at the bottom of one of the pages and asked, oh are they involved or is this just a form you borrowed from them? And the closer said like it was obvious, the loan is through them. No one had ever mentioned their name before this moment. I thought it was through the bank (Washington Savings Bank). I'm aware that they are not required to tell me things like that, it's my responsibility to read what I'm signing, but still feel like they should have mentioned it.

I still signed everything and finished the closing because I knew I had 3 days to cancel afterwards and didn't want to hold everything up in case this is a non-issue.

As a side note, I am going from an FHA loan to a conventional loan. The reason for the refi was to remove PMI (house appraised very high and I actually have more than 20% equity) which I wouldn't have been able to remove for many years just paying my regular monthly payment, and can't afford to pay extra to bring it down faster. The interest rate on the new loan is also slightly higher (3.5% instead of 3.25%). The only other difference is that the loan is conventional instead of FHA.

personalfinance,"[HELP] Please help me, I am stuck wondering what the next step is after starting an amend on TurboTax.","Okay, so i filed my taxes the same night I received my W2 from work. The next shift I was told not to bc the info was incorrect. Box 12 was left blank (although is had the code DD). I started to prepare an amend on the turbotax website, but stopped halfway through. When I noticed it did not affect my return I started doing some more digging on that DD code. That DD code meant that the information in that box would not affect the outcome of my taxes, also on the FAQ section I read that there is no reason to amend b/c there is no need to. Since I had already started to prepare the amend, it is on the TT website. NOTHING was submitted and the amend is not filed. Should I just walk away or do I need to remove this prepared amend from their site? If so, how? All of their FAQ/Support can help me with is cancelling an amend that has already been filed, so I think I am good. BUT. I dont want to get effed in the A by the IRS. thanks for your time guys.

personalfinance,Got a Credit One Credit Card 1 1/2 years ago. Never used it. Now I have a 30 day late payment on my credit report.,"A year and a half ago, I was a babe in the woods regarding credit card companies. My parents were awful with their credit and I never really knew there were companies like Credit One out there. I thought they were Capital One because the logos are similar. After I received the card in the mail and went to Credit One's website, I saw they had an insane interest rate and you had to pay a fee just to make a payment! After paying the yearly fee, I figured I would let it sit in a drawer, never use it, and add the card to my credit line. 

Apparently after a year and a half, they start charging you a monthly fee of $8.99 to keep the card active! That's just insane. I didn't know this. I never received a credit card statement from them showing me the balance of this monthly fee on my card. 

They reported me 30 days late to all the credit bureaus and my credit score dropped over 100 points. I'm freaking out. Im trying to move out of my parents' house next month and get an apartment and now this late payment has damaged my credit to the point where I don't think I can even do that. I'm going to close the card, but im waiting for them to take off the late payment before I close it. 

What do I do? 

I plan on calling Credit One to ask them to remove the 30 days late report, but I dont trust them to actually do that. The customer service reps will say anything to keep you from taking any action. 

Do I dispute the late payment to the Credit Agencies? If so, how do I go about doing that? 

Do I write the Credit agencies a goodwill letter? I don't  have a bad financial situation, I was just an idiot and got a card with a fraudulent credit card company. Would this work? 

Do I just have a lawyer get it off my credit report? 

Also, how is it legal for Credit One to do this to people?! I didn't receive a Credit Card statement online or in the mail showing the balance on my card!",finance

personalfinance,"Married and debt free, 10k in EF. Trying to figure out what's next.","Two years ago my wife and I read Dave Ramsey's Total Money Makeover (highly recommend it). Since then in the last two years we've paid off my wife's 15k in student loans and my (stupid) 12k auto loan. We also paid for our wedding in cash (8k) and now have saved 10k for our EF. In 2016 our joint income was 80k.

We're in a good place and are grateful for it.  Ramsey's next baby steps are: 3B - pay off the house/buy a house and baby step 4 - invest at least 15% for retirement.

Question 1: Where to put the EF? Money market? Our current bank's interest rate on MM accounts is between .05 and .1%.

Question 2: We want to save $100k in the 5 years for a large downpayment or purchase a home. Where to put that money?

personalfinance,Helping a graduate get his adult life started on the right foot.,"Hey everyone, I'm a fresh graduate from a 4 year college that just wants to get everything off to a good start. My parents aren't the best financial advisors, so I'm learning what I can. I've read through all the pins and have a decent understanding so far though.  

My current situation:  

Take home pay: $1800 a month.  

Budget:  
Rent and Utilities: $500 ($1000 split with 1 roommate).  
Commuting: $100  
Groceries: $150  
Eating out: $50  
Insurance: $186  
Car Payment: $209 (Been paying $250)  
Entertainment: $26 (Netflix and Game subscription)  

Credit Card 1: $100 Monthly payoffs generally)  
Credit Card 2: $80 (Monthly payoffs)  
School Loan 1: $3358 @ 10.25%  
School Loan 2: $1249 @ 8.65%  
Car Loan: $4835 @ 19.73% (I know I goofed, I had no cosigner and was in desperate need of a car with no down payment).  

Savings Account: $500 currently while handling the above.  

I've got a 401k with roughly $5500 vested, I wasn't aware how serious my contribution mattered, so I'm adjusting it for this year.  

My understanding is I should knock that ridiculous car loan off, the vehicle is a 2004 and I've had no luck with refinancing the rate now that my score isn't awful and have decent credit history built up. Then prioritize the 10%, then 8%. Am I on the right path? Once all this is completed, I'll work on building my savings up for emergency fund then focusing on IRA/401k contributions.  

I've setup Mint to monitor my accounts and help budgeting which has proven to be very useful and makes me feel good being in the green.  

I'll be receiving my tax return, and a profit sharing check totalling about $2500ish combined in February, should I set it aside for emergency or try to knock down the car loan?

personalfinance,Looking to slay Home/Student Loan Debt,"Hello everyone. Looking for some advice on what debt to start attacking first. 

To give a little background, currently 27, making 110/yr, own a home, have student loan debt, 0 credit card debt, generally depleted savings after purchasing an engagement ring last year in cash, and have been living very comfortable for the last 6 years working in my field. With doing this, i was making minimals on student loan debt and mortgage. As of last year I have actually taken saving seriously, cutting out a lot of extras in my life, and as of Jan 1st this year extended on that and am now down to bare necessities, looking to slay some of this debt.

My current student loan(s) debt looks at as follows. Due to general lack of knowledge in my younger years mixed with a terrible college advisor setting up the loans, there are a ton of them, all at different rates for different amounts. 


**Total Current Balance:   $20,555.33**

Type | Remaining Balance | Interest Rate
                
Unsubsidized | $1,381.59 | 6.800% 

Unsubsidized | $1,437.14 | 6.800%

Subsidized | $1,066.13 | 6.800%

Unsubsidized | $1,346.14 | 6.800%

Unsubsidized | $3,243.11 | 6.800%

Unsubsidized | $2,006.93 | 6.800%

Subsidized | $2,682.25 | 6.000%

Subsidized | $2,079.22 | 6.000%

Subsidized | $589.93 | 6.000%

Subsidized | $3,311.04 | 5.600%

Subsidized | $1,411.85 | 4.500%


My current monthly Mortgage situation looks as follows:


**Current Principal Balance:	$114,856.07**

Effective Interest Rate:	3.25000%

Breakdown | Amount

Principal and Interest | $544.83

Hazard Insurance | $25.13

Mortgage Insurance | $118.92

County Tax | $295.00

Shortage |	$74.83

Next Payment Amount |$1,058.71

So with pairing down a lot of my monthly expenses, as well as subtractions for 401k contributions / short term savings goals, I am left with ~$3000/month (min payments of $1058 for mortgage and $395 for student loans already included) to throw at my debt. My first gut reaction after doing a lot of reading on this sub was to use the avalanche method to attack just the student loans first. This just seems much more attainable with owing a lower amount overall, and then when i can eliminate the $395 a month for the student loans, i can have a larger amount to throw at the house. 

Is this the best way to go about this? Every other day i find myself rethinking this, and switching between paying down the mortgage and student loans, or coming up with some formula to pay each at the same time. So overall, my question to you is how would you handle this situation, and do you have any tips on the best way to move forward as I'd like to settle into a method in the next few days. Thanks a ton.

We are currently stacking payments to get out as fast as possible but I still estimate we have about 2 years left. 

So my question is, would a consolidation be a good idea to expedite the process? I know they are generally not suggested due to the likelihood of just reducing payments and continuing bad habits but are they always a bad idea?? Interest rate is 17.5% on the current cards.

personalfinance,Another Request for Student Loan Advice,"I have 5 groups of student loans. Outstanding principal balance $43,887.57, total is $44,002.27.

 I've already consolidated and have an income plan that actually hits some principal in my lower interest loans every month. However, my significant other (""SO"") and I are finally financially at a point where we can start putting some of his salary towards killing my student debt (he's got none) and I'm curious about the best repayment method for my debt. When we had some extra in the past we went with hitting the principal on the highest interest loan hard. But now it's about $250 every bi-weekly paycheck that can kick to loans (while still saving for our wedding and paying our mortgage/car loan).

Group 1 is 5.350% interest, principal $3,342.80 and $8.81 in interest.

Group 2 is 4.250% interest, principal is $4,2557.11 and $8.92 in interest.

Group 3 is 6.550% interest, principal is $20,685.57 (no interest, today was a payday)

Group 4 is 5.160% interest, principal is $12,304.51 and $74.12 in interest.

Group 5 is 5.160% interest, principal is $3,097.58 and $18.71 in interest.


Under my extended graduated repayment, started 4/9/16, plan I pay $220.23 every month. On the January numbers $41.42 went to principal and $178.81 went to interest. Groups 1,2, and 3 had principal payments. Groups 4 and 5 only hit interest.

TLDR: Is the avalanche method the best choice for me? It's real tempting to try and kill off Group 1, then Group 5, and then return to aggressively hitting Group 3. But at an extra $250-500 a month on top of my $220.23, is that the choice that pays things off leaving me with the least amount of extra interest?

It's probable that interest rates will rise this year. But not certain. Do I lock in an 0.5% increase, or stick with the variable and hope to keep it lower? What would you do?",finance

If we pay extra a month (e.g bill is 300 and we pay 500) will that make it so every following payment is a little less than 300 or would it just take away one month and 200 of the other month from the total bill?,finance
personalfinance,"Broke up with girlfriend, halfway through fixed mortgage contract. help!","I'm on mobile, sorry for the format. 


Backstory short, I'm in my mid-20s living in a Canadian suburb (Quebec). Healthy and sane. I have a good job and will start school in March (2 year course). I'll keep working while in school. I make 1200CAD net every 2 weeks and have a small sideline cash revenue (~1000/month).


I have a good credit score although I have a good amount of debt. **I have 22k$ debt on a line of credit (on contract at 3,9%)**. I could sell my CRV'11 for 14-15k if I ever really need to (I love IT, it's really useful and gas cheap). 


Little text before the finance issue. 


Me and my ex broke up 4 months ago. Now we are ""roommate"" since. Yeah, I know. It's hard. We get along fine, but it's time to move on. The thing is, we own 2 dogs. Since I'm the one who's really taking care of them, Ill be taking them with me wherever I end up. That's a small problem. 


We own a condo (2 bedrooms, 1 bathroom; 1100sqft). Both of us are on the mortgage. 


The mortgage contract is a fixed interest rate for 5 years. We just made it to the 3rd year this January. 


We bought the condo for 144,000$ 3 years ago. My ex's parent gave her 40k$ as a donation, for the cashdown (31k$), notary, etc. I didn't contribute to the cashdown. She wouldn't have been approved for the mortgage without me at the time because of her revenue. We already had it planned to move in together so it was a win-win. 


Now the mortgage is at 106k$ after 3 years. 


On the sale contract with the notary, it states that she gets the full cashdown back at the sale, then the profit is 50/50.


Say we sell at the bare minimum of its value (municipal value). We can sell it for 151k$. 


Value - remaining balance
151k-106k =45k$


Profits
45k-31k(cashdown) = 16k split 50/50


8k each in profits (without fees and whatnot) 


Now, we have 4 choices; 


*1. Sell the condo and pay a 5500$ fee. 


*2. She buys my share of the condo and I leave. 


*3. I buy her share and she leaves. 


*4. We rent the condo until the contract ends. 


#1 is bad for both of us, because we lose a good amount of money and the condo isn't really in a good enough shape to be sold. 


#2 is another problem. I get out, then have to rent somewhere else (maybe near the school I'll be attending). But the problem are my dogs. I love them and REALLY DON'T want to give them away. Renting somewhere with 2 dogs is really hard. 


#3 is my financial issue I need help with. Since my share of the condo is only 8k$, I was thinking about refinancing the mortgage. What are my options? I wouldnt need to deposit a cashdown, but I would have to buy my ex's share (initial cashdown + half the profits). I would have to co-sign with my father for the new mortgage and he's fine with it. 


#4 options is a no-no. 


What should I do? I can afford the mortgage payments when I calculated it online. 380$ bi-monthly. Even tho I'll be tight for the other expenses (electricity, taxes, internet etc). I can afford it as I'm not a big spender (anymore). 


I would really like to keep the condo. It's located in the neighbourhood I grew up in; friends, family, everything nearby. It's one the best neighborhood of my city. A new express train is getting built and will improve value. The dogs will have their home. 


This situation is keeping me awake at night and I'm not the stressful kind of guy, usually. My dogs are my main motivator. My ex is indifferent towards moving or staying, it's really up to me, so I'm thankful for her patience.

personalfinance,(CAN) I can neither afford to pay my debts nor to file for bankruptcy: Do I have any other options?,"I'm a 35 Canadian male, married, who is signed on with a temp agency. This means what work I do get is infrequent, temporary, and pays a little above minimum wage here ($13 - $14 and hour).

All my debts add up to around $36K. This includes Canada Student Loans, a VISA card, an overpayment from a previous job, LASIK surgery payments, and other similar debts.

My monthly expenses include:

* $550 (rent)
* $90 (mobile phone)
* $90 (internet)
* $180 (groceries)
* 50 (other)
* TOTAL: $960/month

When I am working, I make about $800/month. To make up the difference, my spouse helps me out whenever he can.

I recently went to a debt consolidation company where I live and explored each of my options. The least expensive option I have would be bankruptcy. Including the fees for the bankruptcy itself as well as other associated cost, I'm looking at paying a total of $7500 to go bankrupt.

I can't afford this, nor can I afford to pay my debts (the interest rates are so high that I can't even pay the equivalent to the interest that accumulates on each debt).

I'd really like to one day go back to University and finish my degree so that I can get a job that pays better than what I've been stuck with my entire adult life. I don't want to have to rely on my spouse to pay the barest minimum to live on. I'd like to one day start saving for retirement.

Do I have any other options or is it really looking like I'll just be stuck with these debts for the rest of my life?",finance
personalfinance,I have 14k in savings. Should I pay off my higher interest rate student loans AND put $5500 in a Roth IRA? Or should I prioritize one over the other?,"Hi all, appreciate any advice you can give me.


So as the title states, I have 14k in savings. For additional info I am 25, live in the US, and have no retirement plan/fund at the moment. I earn about 36k (before taxes) per year as of now. I also have 27k in student loans, all with one lender but with a few different fixed interest rates. The one's I'm concerned with are the loans I have at 6.8%. There are 3 at around 2200, 4200, and 2000 each. The monthly payments for all of my loans are at about $350 and I will be paying off my car in about 6 months so my loans will be my only big monthly payment left (insurance, phone, gas, gym etc.. cost me about $350 per month as well). I have zero debt other than my student loans and think I budget/save fairly well. I still live with my parents and am thankful they let me live free of rent, so that I'm able to save and payoff my loans asap.


So my questions is, would it be better for me to pay off my loans totaling $8,500 at 6.8% and maybe hold off on my Roth IRA for one more year? Or would you suggest paying off my $4,200 loan at 6.8%, put the full $5,500 in the Roth IRA, and still have around 4k left in my savings? What's the best balance here? I also would like to note that once my car payment is up, I will be paying $400-$500 per month on my loans (whether or not I decide to pay off all/partial of my 6.8% loans), to pay them off earlier.

personalfinance,Invest more in 401k or pay more towards student loans,"Hi PF,
First post here so please be gentle :). 

I'm 26 years old making 75k a year working as a IT Project manager and currently deciding whether to increase my 401k or pay more towards my student loans. When i graduated college I had severe credit card debt (10k+) because I had to pay for living expenses out of pocket (lived at home and worked but had to pay for books, food other expenses etc.) I come from a large family and was the only one to graduate college. This was great because it allowed me to save on rent and such, but ultimately my parents were unable to help with living expenses. I finished paying off this debt this year and started making a dent in my student loans as well (had approx 45k after now its at 36k). I have been contributing to my 401k to get the match the past 3 years and was going to increase my 401k elections to 10% this year but realized it might be better to pay my student loans since its a guaranteed 6.5% per year cost saving. I have pretty good credit (~730ish) and all of my loans are federal so I tried to apply to finance and get a lower interest rate with the private lenders and was really only approved for the same rate or lower. I am looking to pay down these student loans over the next 5 years as well as start saving for a down payment on a home.


**My Questions**

Would it be better to contribute an extra 5% to my 401k or take that money and contribute it to my student loans with 6.5% interest?


I bought a 2015 Audi in 2014 and currently owe 23k. I'm seriously considering selling it to save more &amp; pay down my student loans. I convinced myself that I needed this car and now that i'm looking back it may be the worse financial decision i've made yet (even worse than the 10k credit card debt!) I reached out to the dealer i bought it from and the salesman was able to give me a range of what the car is worth. he says it would go for ~23k at auction, and if it was the dealers car they would list it at 26k. One option would be to try and sell it private sale and pay the loan to come out even.


If I sold my car I would need a replacement. My GF has a relatively new car as well so i wouldn't need anything too crazy. I live less than 5 miles from work and public transportation isn't really an option so i'm thinking of getting a used reliable car for under 10k. any recommendations on getting a affordable reliable car would be appreciated.


**Beak down of my monthly expenses**

Monthly take home after 401k (5%) &amp; health insurance - ~3700

personalfinance,Quick Question regarding student loans,"Hey guys. Like the subject says I have a quick question about my student loans. I currently have about 25K in student debt that I'm in the process of paying back. Almost all of my loans are around 3-4% interest. There are however two loans (one for 1000, one for 2200) that are instead around 6.5% interest. I have roughly around 10K in my savings and was wondering whether it would be a good idea to go ahead and kill off one of (or both) of these high interest loans. Is it better to wait until I have more cash stashed up or should I just bite the bullet and get rid of those high interest rates? For reference, my job pays fairly well for my age and is fairly stable.

personalfinance,How much house do YOU think we can afford?,"My spouse and I are going to start seriously looking at houses soon.

I've played with seemingly ALL the calculators out there, getting results of anywhere from $300k - $550k as an ""affordable"" home for our situation. Ha! Super helpful. Anyway, I've done tons of napkin math and know my front-end and back-end DTI ratios, but am wondering what YOU think is a comfortable, reasonable house price as compared to our income.

Here are the stats:

* I'm 32 years old, spouse is 33.
* No children and no immediate plans for children. We are fence-sitters and it's very possible we won't have kids.
* Income: I am employed, $100,000/year. Spouse makes $30,000 in freelance income per year.
* Debt load: 1 federal student loan of about $6200 at low interest rate (2.8%) and $10,500 car loan at 0% with a 3-year term. The current plan is to knock out the student loan once we purchase a house and can stop saving so aggressively for the down payment. We do not plan to pay off the car loan early as it is at 0%.

In our area (coastal, M-HCOL), 2 bed/1 bath ranches go for $240-$270k.  3 bed/2 baths are typically in the $325-$375k range, depending on how updated they are and the lot size/location. We probably need this size because we both require a home office. Homes bigger and nicer than we need are $390k+.

I'd love to find something great around $325k but would be willing to possibly go up to about $360k for a home we would stay in forever (well, the foreseeable ""forever"").

personalfinance,Tips for financing Graduate school? Need to finance around $125k,"I will be starting Grad school this Fall. Currently I am trying to learn about how to finance it. I have no Undergrad debt on me. So I am going to Grad school without any Student loans debt. I would have to mostly finance entire school expense. I am currently looking to apply to some scholarships etc which might help me bring down amount of money needed to be financed. But my planning is for scenario where I would not get any scholarship money. So I am not counting on that yet.

School would be for 2 years, and our program usually does not allow one to work during school, also I have spoken to current students, they dont find much time for work. I have been working in EMS, so I don`t have much of a saving, instead whatever I made, I used it to pay for classes that I have taken in last 2 years, thats why currently have no student loan debt and not much of savings. 

Cost of attendance estimate of school with everything included for 2 years comes to be around $125k. But I am very hopeful of one of our State programs in helping me with $20,000 in return of working 2 years in the State. I am very certain that I wont be moving out of State in future so that should not be an issue. 

So I have looked at some Fed student loan options and I have tried to make some calculations and write down a lot of numbers for different scenarios. But this is my first ever loan for School. I want to know what are some tips that some people might have in regards to what kind of loans are better than others. How to go about repaying and how to make sure they dont become inflated with interest etc.

This scenario is if I dont get much help anywhere else.

I make 40k (before taxes) in a larger, midwest city. After taxes, retirement, parking, and insurance my paycheck is a sad $2,100. Because of this, I picked up a part-time serving gig on the side for a few nights a week. I'm estimating I'll work around 10 shifts a month and am hoping I'll make around $800 extra per month. This hopeful $800 doesn't include weekend shifts, which I hope to work once a month once I gain more seniority there. Servers tend to make $200 a night on weekends.

Would it be foolish for me to sign a lease of $850? It would be for a 1 bedroom and includes heat, electricity, parking, lawn care and snow removal, non-coin op laundry and storage. This is a TOTAL steal for the city I'm in. I've been looking for places similar and even studio apartments end up being just as expensive with all the amenities. 

My partner is looking for a job in the same city so hopefully he'll be able to join me and pay for half the rent. However, I'm not banking on him being able to do so, so I want to be as responsible as possible. An alternative would be living with family, but I'm sure by August (which is when the lease for the $850 apartment would start) I won't want to do that anymore. I'll already have couch surfed with family from January until mid-August, and having my own space is something I really, really want.

personalfinance,Thoughts regarding student loan repayment plan?,"Just wondering if this plan is reasonable since I did a quick search and didn't find any previous posts describing a similar situation. I'll be graduating from medical school this May with approximately 150k in unsubsidized Stafford loans. I will not be utilizing Public Service Loan Forgiveness. 

Option A: standard option. Stick with REPAYE and pay ~$3.5-4k/year (10% of discretionary income) and have my total loan balance increase to approximately ~160k after 6 years (5 years of residency and 1 year of fellowship), then pay off the balance in ~2 years or so as an attending physician (salary in residency &amp; fellowship will be ~60k-70k/year and as a new attending will be 250k+). 


Option B: my parents gave me an alternative. They are almost finished paying their mortgage and they are willing to refinance it to include my student loans and then have me pay the monthly mortgage payments on the total amount I borrowed. The difference between the interest rates is significant (~5.3% average for Stafford loans and ~2.9% for a 7/1 ARM through their credit union, assuming rates do not increase again before July), although under REPAYE half of the accrued interest after the yearly minimum payments is waived and the cost of refinancing the mortgage will be at least $3k. The main advantage of going the 7/1 ARM option would be that by the time I finish my training, the principal will be down to ~$115k (@ ~$7.8k/year) which I could potentially pay off during my first year as an attending (no early payment penalties from what I can gather). 


I'm wondering if people think option B would be worth pursuing. On paper it seems like changing my student loan into an ARM would be a really good idea for someone whose income will see a significant jump at a predictable point in their career; I can take advantage of the low interest rate earlier and plan to pay off the entire balance right before the rate increases, not to mention that my principal will decrease by more than $40k compared to REPAYE. That being said, I'm not very educated on this subject so I don't know if there are any problems about this plan that I haven't considered.

First of all, I don't know if this makes a difference but I recently turned 18 and am a senior in high school. My parents don't seem to know about what to do with my taxes, and there were some things that I read on here that contradicted what they were telling me, so I just want more info:/


During 2015, I worked a part time job, and worked for about eight hours a week. My parents have a CPA they use for our restaurant taxes(? I think, and their taxes too)... Well my mom took the form I got from my employer at the beginning of 2016 and took it to their CPA to see how much my refund was. He told them about $30, and it costs $100ish to file through the CPA so my parents just told me not to bother.


I worked the same job in 2016 up until around April and then quit when I got into a six month internship where I earned around $8,000 total. I recall seeing medicaid? medicare?, social security, and federal withholding on my paycheck stubs. I think over a thousand went into federal withholding but I can't remember.


I did some research on Reddit, and found a question similar to mine, and it said something along the lines of ""you'll get all of your federal withholding back for the amount you paid up to $6000"" or something along those lines.

3. Will our family CPA calculate my taxes correctly? I've read some terrible H&amp;R block reviews about tax calculations going wrong, and am scared this might happen. If even the professionals are doing it wrong, how can I know if I'm doing it right?


4. I don't know what to put on my tax forms, and my parents seemed confused too when I was starting my job/internship. I think we guessed dependent/independent and the 0,1,2,3(?) number selection sections. What should I actually be writing on my forms?

Total monthly expense: $5000


Debt: $0 (except for the car)


Monthly savings from take home pay: 11K - 5K = 6K. 

Contribution to my 401K + employer contribution + HSA = 1K


We have only 1 car (his luxury sedan that he bought with 14K miles on it for 33K) because I work from home full time. I have unlimited PTO at work and we tend to travel a lot even though he takes a pay cut (his gross is after the cut).

Assets: 

$10K in emergency fund(temporary reduction). We will quickly bring this back up to 25K (5 months expenses on current lifestyle and 6 months if we cut back on travel) by March  

$50K in a savings account which we are planning to transfer to India to earn 7% annually until we are ready to buy a home. Currency risk but very secure (similar to FDIC insured)

30K in India on a property (just land, nothing built)

10K in Indian stock market (legacy from when I used to work in India - see below)


Reason for low assets vis-a-vis income:

My husband moved from India to the US for his Masters and has lived here since 2008. Graduated in 2010 and paid off his student debt by 2012(14% interest rates!). Paid for part of his sisters tuition when he encouraged her to move to the US in 2013. Purchased the property in India in 2014 before we got married in early 2015 (financed partly by both of us). 

I got my MBA in 2012 in India and worked there until January, 2015 (Invested in Indian stock market - made 30% annualized returns so far). Moved to the US after getting married and had to spend more than a year unemployed until I got my work permit and found a job. Started my job in the US in October, 2016.

 Until I started working, we were living on one income and saving 15% of his income. There was always the possibility of returning to India if I was unable to work in the US. I did my MBA from a great school in India (big 4, goldman sachs, JP Morgan, blackrock etc recruited at my school) and I lived on 20% of my salary even though I wasn't staying with my parents. I can't imagine staying at home even if we didn't need the income.  Unfortunately, since MBA's are mostly about brand value and network, my salary in the US is lower than my husband's. It would be the other way in India by a wide margin. 

So we were vary of investing or even contributing to retirement funds in the US until I was sure I could have a career here. Now that I'm working again, we are ready to start investing here. But with Trump, we may have to leave on short notice (My husband's green card will take at least 15 years to arrive).

We are currently not maxing my traditional 401K, only contributing 6% to get the full employer match. I need to note that my 401K is with Fidelity and the fund choices are great. Fidelity S&amp;P Index fund has a expense ratio of 0.015% for example. 
We don't have any IRA's either. I understand that we can contribute to a traditional IRA for 2016 since I only earned 25K in 2016. But might not be an option from 2017 onwards. Can we contribute to my 401K until April for 2016 like the IRA?

Apart from tax advantaged accounts, where should we park our money considering the uncertainty of our stay in the US?

personalfinance,Should I buy my Tesla Model 3 or wait?,"Looking for some opinions here.

* I have a 2008 Honda Civic which still runs great and I imagine will continue doing so for at least a few years
* I have a reservation for a Tesla Model 3 ($1000 refundable deposit). The car will supposedly be ready at the end of 2017, maybe early 2018
* I can get a $7,500 federal tax credit and a $2,500 state tax rebate in California, but these financial incentives will start to diminish once Tesla has sold a certain number of vehicles, so it may benefit me to fulfill my reservation before this happens

I have a credit score of ~790, so I should have no problem getting a low interest rate on a loan. I'm wondering if it would make more sense to:

A) Just buy the Tesla when they start production, making sure I get as much of the $10,000 in incentives as I can

B) Wait until I *need* a new car, and put the money into investment funds, instead. This would also allow me to wait for a later generation of the Model 3, when any kinks have been worked out

Right now I'm leaning towards option A, because I doubt the potential returns from investments would outweigh the $10k in incentives.

personalfinance,"Extra Income: E Fund, Pay Off Debt, or IRA?","First off, thank you all for your contributions to this subreddit. I've gotten a ton of great info reading the wikis. I've come up with a question on how to prioritize funds in the immediate future. Here's my situation:

* 26, married, combined income about $90,000, living cheap in the south
* Use YNAB for budgeting
* Have about $15,000 in an E fund in a Consumers Credit Union rewards checking account--4.59% interest up to $20,000, no fees, have met all requirements for this interest rate since September. It earned about $130 from Sep-Dec
* Essential monthly expenses total around $3000 (in an E fund scenario), $4200-4500 on average
* Debt: mortgage (1100), vehicle (250/mo at 3.9%), student loans (650/mo, 6.4%, on $250k...you figure out how to erase this and I'll name my first child after you)
* Income: about $5400 monthly

So I've been contributing to the E fund and started making curtailments on my car payment. That loan is worth ~$12,000 now that I've made $2500 in curtailments in the past two months. Neither of our current employers match retirement contributions; I contribute nothing to retirement, she contributes a small amount. The student loan will either be paid off after I finish training and make a significantly higher salary, or in 10 years with PSLF/20 years with REPAYE.

So my question is how to prioritize the $1000-1500 extra each month. 

1. Go for broke and pay off the 12k vehicle loan
2.  Get the E funds a little fatter, up to the $20,000 cap on 4.59% interest
3. Start contributing/maxing out an IRA
4. ???
5. Profit

So r/personalfinance, do I have more money than sense? What can I be doing better? Will I ever pay off that student loan? Find out on the next episode of DRAGON BAAALL ZZZZZ.

personalfinance,"20y old college student, just found out I have a ROTH IRA account with 8k in it, started years ago by my father, unsure what to do.","I'm currently 20 years old, and a junior in college, looking to graduate with roughly 25k in student loans. This past year my cost for college went up. (my dad started making more money so I will be getting less financial aid, unfortunately due to large family size my dads  pay raise is not going to translate into being able to contribute to my tuition) Whereas previously my tuition was covered through a combination of scholarships, grants and federal loans, there is now an extra 2k a semester that I will either have to pay out of pocket, or get in loans.

A couple weeks ago, I found out that my dad apparently started a ROTH IRA account for me about 10 years ago, and there is currently about 8k in the account. From what I can tell, if I chose to I could withdraw the majority of this money relatively tax free. So my question is, should I just leave that account untouched until I graduate/get a job, when I would start investing into it and take on more students loans to cover my current tuition costs, or use the 8k to cover the extra cost of my tuition for my final three semesters?

While I'm trying to not be too optimistic, I can say that I've worked hard at making sure I have been doing internships, and building connections so at this point it looks like getting a job right out of college shouldn't be too unrealistic. My goal is to pay off all my student loans within the first 3 years of graduating, at which that point I will more than likely be proposing to my current S/O of 3 years (I know that sounds cliche and youthfully optimistic).

She then told me my last 4 digits of my SSN and asked me to confirm it. I told her ""private business matter"" is way too vague for me to confirm or deny my SSN. She said she's calling regarding a debt I owe the Oregon revenue department. Apparently I didn't pay them taxes in 2015. 

I told then ""thats odd.. Oregon owed ME money.."". 
I told her Oregon didn't send me any communication about this. She said they did send letters after which they gave the debt to us. She gave me an address that was my correct NY address. That is when the call dropped and I did not get a call back.

I then created an account with the Oregon DoR and it turns out they did send me letters to my address in NY. But they were all sent after I moved away from NY. The account had digital copies of the letters.

The letter said they did not receive my federal tax return because it was not attached so they deducted/denied my federal deduction. This changed my taxable income and I now owed them some tax which has some interest added to it now.

My friend had the same thing happen to him. Oregon claimed he did not send his federal return, but he actually received the letter and resent his federal return.

personalfinance,"[debt] $197k student loans @6.8%. Paying off $2500/month. Family loaned $50k to help with interest, how best to distribute?","**Background**  

Like the title says, I have $196k in student loans from grad school.  All loans have an identical interest rate of 6.8% through Nelnet.  Current minimum payments are 2250/month. 
Loans are broken down as follows:

Loan A: Stafford Subsidized. Outstanding balance: $8.8k

Loan B: Stafford Unsubsidized: Outstanding Balance:	$43k

Loan C: Direct Subsidized: Outstanding Balance:	$8.8k

Loan D: Direct Unsubsidized: 
Outstanding Balance:	$50.6k

Loan E: Stafford Subsidized: Outstanding Balance:	$8.8k

Loan F: Stafford Unsubsidized: 
Outstanding Balance:	$45.5k

Loan G: Direct Subsidized: Outstanding Balance:	$8.8k

Loan H: Direct unsubsidized: Outstanding Balance:	$22.2k

The short version is that I was talking with my mom about my plans for paying off my loans, and how I was trying to pay it off in 4-6 years, rather than the 9 I have left . I can currently pay $250/month over the minimum payment, but I get a raise in the next 6 months, which will allow me to pay off an additional $1k-$2k/month.  My grandma offered to loan me $50k at a 3% interest rate to help reduce the overall interest I'll pay over time.  I should point out that I'll be paying her back on a 10-year plan starting immediately.  Once I'm done with the other loans I'll shift everything over to pay her off faster.

**Question**
I have the $50k sitting in my checking account at the moment. I know that if I just pay directly to nelnet it will be distributed across all my loans so that, roughly 25% of each will be paid off.  However, what I don't understand is whether or not the type of loan (Stafford vs. Direct, Subsidized vs. Unsubsidized) makes any difference in terms of which I pay off.   Do the larger debts benefit from being paid off faster here?  Motivation isn't a particular issue here, the avalanche vs. snowball method doesn't really matter to the question I'm asking. I just can't find a clear answer about whether it makes any difference which of these I pay off rest, either in terms of legality differences between the terms of some sort of math issue I'm not considering.

**tldr**
Don't know the difference between Stafford &amp; Direct or between Subsidized and Unsubsidized once I'm in repayment.  Can't determine if it matters mathematically which one I pay off.

The loan is a student loan through Navient. It was closed/charged off in late 2011. I can't tell if it was private or federal, and she can't remember.

As we approach paying 2016 taxes, I have a quick request for some guidance. 

In 2016 I was working for a company in a contract-to-hire capacity and was brought on during the summer and laid off in the fall. I had 6 months as a 1099 contractor and 5 months as a W2 employee. 

I was able to collect unemployment from them, and through that process contested my standing as a 1099 indy-contractor and it was ruled that I was behaving as an employee during my entire tenure, thus increasing the amount of unemployment I've been able to collect.

So, my question is the same, but about taxes. I would much rather my company pay for those 6 months of federal/state income taxes than myself, and given that one governmental board has already stated that I was mis-categorized as an indy-contractor, I thought the IRS might as well (and also the state of California).

2: with whom should I pursue it (both California and federally)?

I feel like even 120 years is not long enough to enjoy the wonders of life. Maybe this is because I am making such slow progress overall???

personalfinance,"Owe taxes for 2016, would contesting to an IRA for 2016 lower what I owe?","Hey everyone, here is my scenario. I am married and filing separately. I have two jobs, one full time (40hr/wk) and the other job is part time (20hr/wk). I started doing my taxes and I owe $92 in federal taxes and $288 in states taxes. I do contribute to a 401(k) for my full time employer. I made a total of $50k in 2016. Would contributing to an IRA lower my tax bill for 2016? I started a traditional IRA and started contributing for 2017. 

Another question I have is, in our W-4 for 2016, my wife and I changed or status to married but filing separately. Would doing our taxes as filing married and jointly be a bad idea? We're planning on filing jointly for 2017 (we already updated our W-4 for filing jointly in 2017).",finance

personalfinance,NY/NJ State Tax Credit Question,"So I think I took the right approach on this but wanted a sanity check. 

My tax situation is pretty straightforward. In 2016, I lived in NJ all year, but I earned substantially all my income a single job (W-2 income) in NYC. (I also earned a small amount in interest from a non-NY savings account that was allocated to NJ, but don't think that should impact things much). My understanding was always that the NY state tax, which is higher than NJ state tax, typically entirely offsets the NJ tax of those who work and earn all income in NY but who live in NJ.

On my W-2, the NY state income in box 16 (which is the same as my W-2 federal income) is about $5,000 lower than the NJ state income in box 16 of the NJ section of the W-2. My understanding is that this is because NY excludes more items from W-2 income than NJ. 

Based on HR Block, my total NY state tax liability ended up being about $10,300 (and I got a slight refund due to excess withholding). My total NJ state tax liability (before the credit for NY state tax) ended up being about $8,500. My NJ tax credit for my NY state tax paid, according to HR Block, is only about $8,250, so, since nothing was withheld, I ended up owing a bit less than $250 to NJ. 

My question is - does this make sense? What happened was, since NY and NJ count income differently, and the NJ income was $5000 ""higher"" (even though it's based on the same ""actual"" income, I included the lower NY income in the comparative calculation on the NJ return since it asked for ""income properly taxed"" by both jurisdictions), the ""maximum allowable credit percentage"" on my NJ tax return was about 97% of my total NJ tax liability, which meant I would end up owing the last 3%. 

For people in similar situations, does this sound right to you, or should I have included the same number in the ""properly taxed by both jurisdictions"" field as was included on the NJ W-2, so that 100% (or 99.9%, once I add in the NJ interest) of the NY state tax liability would be credited against NJ state tax?

Thanks in advance!",finance

The main thing that changed for 2016 was that I got almost $4k in federal grants for school, made $15 online, and $2 in dividends in my savings account. I am very confused as to why I owe $700??

I'm just thinking about just paying that $700 but I feel like it's not right.

financialindependence,WA state planning an aggressive capital gains tax on early retirees,"The WA state governor &amp; legislature is currently working on [a bill that will tax long-term capital gains exceeding $25k/person/yr @ 7.9%](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2017-18/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5111.pdf). To bypass the state constitution's ban on income taxes, it's being drafted as an ""excise tax"", although every other US state, and the IRS, would label it an income tax.

The tax will intentionally target tech sector employees who receive much of their compensation in the form of long-term capital gains from options &amp; shares, as well as those who are already in early retirement in the state. For example, someone in ""late early retirement"" distributing $60k/yr in capital gains from a taxable account will face a new $2765/yr tax, likely exceeding their federal capital gains liability.",finance

personalfinance,To Lease or not to lease my home?,"I purchased my first home in Atlanta, Georgia in 2004 at the price of $165,000.  Since that time I rode the wave of the housing crisis and now my home is worth approximately $230,000.  I was recently advised that I may be receiving a transfer outside of the state this May, and as a result I have began considering what to do with my home.  As of this posting I currently owe $77,111.49 on my mortgage and I have approximately 7 years left on my financing terms at a 2.625% interest rate.  I spoke with a realtor and she advised that I could probably rent my home out for $1,700 per month.  So my question is two prong really.  First, I have enough in my savings to pay my home off prior to leaving.  I would like to purchase a home in the new city I get transferred to, and the thought of carrying two mortgages scares me.  However, if I do pay my current house off it will take a large portion of my savings.  If I do decide to keep my home would it be wise just to pay the mortgage off or should I just sustain the mortgage and use the rental payments to pay the home off?  I ran the numbers and $1,700 per month in rental income would give me approximately $20,400 per year.  At that rate I could recover my savings payoff amount in about 3.75 years.  Which in the grand scheme of things is not that long and would also allow me to save several thousand dollars in interest from the life of the mortgage.  I know there are tax benefits to having interest in a rental property but at this point I'm not paying much interest on the home.  To give you an idea in 2016 I paid $2,200.92.  I know I also have to factor in repairs, damage, etc.  

Secondly, I have spoken to several landlords and the general consensus on renting seems to be TENANTS, TENANTS, and TENANTS.  My question for my fellow redditors who have experience with being a landlord is what would you have done differently knowing what you know now?  Should I obtain insurance for my appliances?  Should I use a realtor to obtain the best tenants possible?  Is there some specific language you wished you would have added to the last agreement?  Any information you could provide would be extremely helpful in making my decision.  Thank You!",finance
personalfinance,Cash out my Life Insurance or keep it rolling?,"My father had been paying annual premiums for a life insurance policy for me and now that I have a steady job he is handing the premium payments over to me. I'm curious if I should just discontinue the insurance and pull the cash value out of it now to pay for higher interest debts. Up to this point I've been following a pretty straightforward game plan for my finances of matching 401k contributions and building an emergency fund. I can afford the premiums at this point, I'm just curious if I need this or not. Cashing out feels cheap though since it is all my dad's money.

**Details**

* Insurance Policy: $100K Flexible Premium Adjustable with $225 Annual premium. 4.5% Interest Rate.
* Current Cash Value = $7330


My current job has a basic life insurance coverage I believe if I die on the job of $50K with the same amount for dismemberment. I'm not sure If I need to have double coverage so now I'm looking at the cash value here as an investment which I don't know if I need at this point in my life with so much debt.

I have over $95K in student loans I'm paying off currently and most of them have interest rates well over that of this life insurance policy's 4.5% (highest is 8.25%). 

I could also just keep it as a safety net. I'm not hurting for money and my current savings account is pretty miserable.

**My Financials**

* Salary: ~$90-100K/yr
* Savings: $4K
* 401k: $10K contributing 4% with 4% company match
* Student Loan Debt: $95K with a monthly payment of $1300.
* Monthly Bills: ~$1800 (not including student loan payment)

Any advice is greatly appreciated! For now I've already paid this year's premium so I'm not itching to make a move with this.",finance
personalfinance,Should I refinance my auto loan?,"I'll make this super quick, I financed a car about 3 years ago. I had bad credit at the time, and the loan has a 16.74 interest rate. Currently there are 21 months left at 280 dollars a month, with a balance of 5,118. 

Credit Karma has provided me with a list of possible loans to refinance. One of which, is a 36 month loan, extending my loan by 15 months, with a monthly payment of 150 dollars. This lowers my monthly payment by *almost half. The site is telling me the new APR would be somewhere in the range of 3.47 ( I'll take that with a grain of salt because that seems super low ) Currently my credit score is sitting just under 700.

I'm financially pretty self sufficient, I pay my rent and most of my other living expenses through working part time during the school year and interning over the summer (high paid CS internships netting ~$10,000). I only put little things I can pay off on my credit card, and I keep a budget to make sure that I can get by fine. My parents pay for some of my expenses (health insurance, phone) and I can fall back on them in case of an emergency. I'd be happy to list my income/expenses if necessary.

I currently have no student loans (thanks, scholarships!) but I do plan to take out $5500 in federal loans for my senior year (less if I get any grants). The biggest potential expense on the horizon is  (hopefully) moving from the midwest to the west coast in summer 2018 when I graduate and get a job.

personalfinance,Advice: Pay down the mortgage or Back-door Roth IRA? (and Index Fund?),"Dear All,

I am a single 34 year old man with an annual gross income of $120K living in the US. 

I own two rental properties with a total purchase value of around $850K. To finance those purchases I have two 30yr mortgages : one with outstanding principal of $360K at an annual interest rate of 4.125% (already paid down more than 20% of the value of the property, so no more PMI); and another with outstanding principal of $355K at an annual interest rate of 3.55% (less than 20% of the value of the property).

I am already maxing out my employer's contribution for the 401(k). My question is: should I keep on paying down that debt or should I contribute to a back-door Roth IRA (I can technically do a Roth IRA until I make $132K, but with bonus, I may even break through that limit this year), or even directly in an Index Fund?

What makes more financial sense?

personalfinance,How to pay $15k in CC Debt/Loans with $0 in Savings and 1.6k monthly take home?,"First time post here, I love this sub and looking for some advice about how to tackle my personal debt. I am 31 and living in Brooklyn, NY –I moved here stupidly by transferring with the same employer from Virginia Beach, VA in March of 2016. I say stupidly because as a direct result my income has stayed the same while my rent more than doubled from $450 to $985. While in VA I lived well and made good money (much lower COL) so I was doing great paying down debt but now with less money available to pay off debt I feel like it’s getting worse so I’m trying to minimize interest and taking on increased debt by freezing my credit cards. This has become extremely difficult because I have been out of work for the last 3 months (had total knee replacement) and living on the $3k I thankfully had in my savings. Now I’ve recently returned to work so I am trying to tackle all of this before it eats me alive.    

I take home about $1600 a month -- $985 of that is rent, my lease is up in May, I plan to move to a cheaper apartment or sure! $116 metrocard, $50 phone, $50 groceries, $10 spotify, about $80 utilities. Not much wiggle room, sadly.    

Debts Include:  
APR 0% ---- Discover IT Card:  $955 (offer expires August)  
APR 0% ---- Barclays Card: $3,100 (offer expires next Jan)  
APR 0% ---- CareCredit CC: $1,573.60 (offer expires May)  
APR 20.5% Citi Aadvantage CC: $1,262  
APR 18%    NavyFed GoRewards: $538.77    


TOTAL CC DEBT:  $7,279 with minimum payments of $175 a month due.    


*I also have a personal loan I am paying $350 monthly with an 18% APR with $7,690 &amp; 24 more payments left -terrible decision, never again but if anyone has advice on how to deal with this please share, should/can I balance transfer this too?    


After listing all of this I am now realizing I am very much more over my head than I thought and being out of work has been difficult but I am really determined to make changes. I would like to get all APR debt moved to my 0% Discover as I have an offer available and that would stop the interest from accruing so that’ll probably be my first step, I think one payment a month is better than 5. *I don’t go out, don’t drink, I’m preparing more meals at home and bringing lunch to work since that’s where most of my money is wasted and my entertainment consists of Hulu and Netflix which I don’t pay but I do pay spotify $10 a month which I can truly love.

personalfinance,Looking for feedback on student loan repayment,"I'm helping my girlfriend with her finances. She has a very good salary at 90k and is currently only paying the minimums on her loans.

Loan 2: government, 22k total split between 7 loans ranging from 3.15% (about11.5k) to 6.55% (about 11 bout 10.5k). $320 minimum.

She has roughly 23k in cash.

Here's what I suggested:
1. Put 8k of cash towards the 6.55% government loans (15k is a big enough efund for her)
2. Pay off remaining (roughly 2.5k) 6.55% government loans in next 3 months
3. See if either wells Fargo will lower her interest rates or she can refinance with a different lender 
4. Contribute roughly $1100/month to Wells Fargo loan until paid off. 
5. Since remaining loans are very low interest @3%, start contributing to 401k

Some of these numbers may change (e.g. she may pay more than 1100/month towards the loans)

Anything she could do differently/better? Feedback appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,Student on a budget trying to pay off $2500,"Unfortunately, I have about $2500 in credit card debt. I'm hoping to pay it off before my student loans hit (about a year). I've been making minimal - $100 payments per month but the debt does not decrease. I'm wondering how much I should make on monthly payments to make a significant difference?

personalfinance,Help choose best strategy for parent's pension options for their retirement,"My parents are 55 and are hoping to retire in 5 years. They don't have very much saved up, but do have some forms of pension they were mailed about a few weeks ago. 

Dad: former FedEx employee
He has 3 options:

1. $185,000 lump sum he can take now at 55 - rollover full amount to IRA or take out any portion with penalty
2. $970 / month for life starting at 55.
3. $1100 / month for life starting at 60.

Eligible for social security benefits at 62 (~$1300) and 67 (~$2000).

Mother: TX teacher with 30 years by age 60.
When she retires at 60, she can take a standard annuity ($2,820) with no lump sum or one of three tiered options of lump sums equal to 12 ($35,800) / 24 ($71,600) / 36 ($107,400) months of standard annuities up front with reduced amounts ($2550/$2280/$2010) of monthly pension payouts for her life.

No social security 
$11,000 sitting in IRA not invested

Now their finances haven't been all that great. They essentially live paycheck to paycheck. Here's the big issue weighing on them - they have quite a bit of debt.

1. $65,000 mortgage at 7% (can this even be refinanced with bad credit?)
2. $6,600 in various credit cards - some at 15% and some at 0% in collections
3. $18,000 in student loans at 5.3%

Mortgage and debt around $1100.
Other monthly expenses around $2800.

That's a large amount of debt at high interest rates. They're obviously considering my dad's lump sum option and taking out what they need to pay off all debts. Its something along the lines of $125,000 and after taxes and penalties it would come out to $90,000 to pay that off. Then they'd roll over remaining $60,000 into an IRA. Now sure how good of a return they'll get with only 5 years invested. But when it runs out, it runs out.

I'm hesitant for them to go through with this and have suggested that they take the early pension for dad to aggressively help pay down debt. It would take about 6 years to pay everything off if every early pension check went to debt from highest to lowest interest. And then at least when its over they'll still have three forms of income for life (2 pensions and 1 social security). Then at 60 years old, they can take mother's 24 month lump to pay off whatever's left of the debt plus keep rest as emergency fund.

I just want the best outcome for them. Obviously I don't know very much in my 20s but have tried to think it out and read as much as I can on here and their pension plan documents. Any form of help or suggestions would be great. Thanks!",finance

Clover, Dragoon &amp; Hoxton. We all walk into the bank in our suits everyone else acting natural as I cased out the place and snuck around the main lobby being wide open with civies all over and a few desks to the right was like a small break room area with a set of stairs curving up from he right wall to upstairs. The left area from the lobby having some side offices along the left wall next to that another set of stairs but right in the middle of this room was the elevator down to the vault the prize was waiting there.

I snuck pasted the few guards there where on the bottom floor and up stairs with no silencers the only way I was staying quite was Melee with My telescopic nightstick. I masked up but soon got spotted by a wandering guard I quickly ran as Her went to aim an calling for help on His walkie talkie needless to say I beat Him down an used His radio to calm the rest of security and stuffed him a extra duffle bag I then took a minute or two to pick a locked door open upstairs finding the security camera room and doing the same to the guard monitoring them and hiding them in bags in the room. Then I found the target the Bank Manager white black suit Red tie balding and kinda fat I pointed My assault rifle at Him an told Him to get down an shut up  as He did I swiped His key card for the server room an forced Him on the ground in the corner behind His desk tying His hands. I opened the server room and grabbed the Termite We'd  need to burn into the vault and I stared using electrical boxes around to disable other security measures.

Then opening the hollowed out copy machine in the server room grabbing the Thermal drill, and termite the real job starts.  I pull out My Chicago typewriter and walk down stairs tapping the trigger an the first rent a cop the other seeing Me and I turned to shoot but  He'd already sounded the alarm before I shot they'd  be here soon. I pointed the barrel up an fired a few rounds in the roof an told the hostages to get down as I set up the thermal drill I could hear the others already yelling and shooting from the lobby and I looked up checking the windows for snipers and the skylights for swat dropping in and they did and I let rip with My new toy 45 bullets riddles them as they dropped in most shot off the rope.  after a while of beating back police assault  the drill got us to the hidden door to the vault area and the others defended the door I ran back up stairs under fire and hacked the door open from the managers computer and We charged in as they pulled back again an quickly got rid of any security in there and planted the termite an lit a whole back office up trying to burn though the vault roof.  after holding them in the other half of the room the floor in the office finally gave way and We leapt down inside.

Inside the goods where untouched and around the vault loose small wades of 1'000-1'500  littered around but what We came for on a long steel table stack after stack of 37'000 to 37,500 at least 10-20+ of them.  I immediately started bagging all of the stacks before the feds got the vault open and when they did and I saw the tougher swat units backed up by two Tazers and shield guys I throw a frag at two of them an blew the two away as I went to throw another I heard that dreaded static as I was grabbed an beat down by a Cloaker that dropped in thought the roof.  Luckily Hoxton and Clover turned filling the Sam Fisher wanna be cosplayer full of holes and got Me back up and as this long an difficult fight drug out I had to carry the bags an throw them down a air duct often under swat fire and then We had to shoot our way out of the vault area. I switched back to My tommy gun and letting the 50 rounds rip though  anyone in our way and aside from having to heal an revive Dragoon and Hoxton  I got up stairs an started planting the C4 on the wall as swat snipers tried to hone Me in.  Blasting a hole thought the wall into the neighboring office and  telling every one to drop down a two swat squads bust in with shield guys. the gang distracted while I hit from the side and  We ran down stairs  single file in tight halls as swat chased an We fired back.

Finally We reached the parking garage with the garbage truck waiting with the others shooting any swat trying to get though the hallway choke point I started loading all the bags from where they fell out of  the air duct  and as I tossed the last one in We all hopped on an got out.",technology

personalfinance,Refinancing student loans? How about consolidating?,"I am wondering if anyone has any experience with refinancing your student loans?

I have 3 at 6.8% (federal), one at 8.6% (private), two at 9.13% (private) and one at 10.25% (private) and then various small federal loans at or below 4.5% APR.

I was thinking, once I graduate and begin working (this summer, hopefully), I would refinance the loans that are 6.8%APR and higher.

I was also considering consolidating all of the smaller federal loans that are at and below 4.5%APR.

I am not sure if this is a good move or not? I currently work about 32hrs a week and bring home enough to pay for rent and groceries and have a little left over for as ""just in case"" money. I can sometimes put a small amount towards the loans. With that being said, this is why I think maybe it's wiser to refinance after I graduate. OR, maybe it's not. Maybe I should just do it now?

In addition to that, I will need to take out about another 8,500 very soon, through private, since I can no longer get federal. So maybe this will effect whether or not I should wait to refinance or do it now.",finance

personalfinance,How should I be thinking about purchasing a home in my situation?,"Hi PF,

Long time lurker but never a poster.  I have a question about how I should be thinking about purchasing a home.  Here's my situation (USA):

&amp;nbsp;  

*Income and savings*

&amp;nbsp;  

**My monthly gross income:** 14,000 (YOY increase in base salary *should* be 15% - 20% for the next ~5 years, but we don't make plans around the increase or year end bonus as a rule)

**Spouse's monthly gross income:** 2,000 (will not increase)

**Savings:** ~40,000

&amp;nbsp;  

*Core monthly expenses / debt payments*

&amp;nbsp;

**Combined monthly student loan payment:** 2,500 -- around 200,000 left on principal

**Phone:** 160

**Monthly car payment:** 350 (interest &lt;2%), about 10,000 left on principal 

**Current monthly rent payment:** 1400

**Groceries / sundries:** 500

&amp;nbsp;  

*My question / goals of home ownership:* 

&amp;nbsp;  

I am basically wondering what my 'window' should be for a monthly house payment (i.e., what is the maximum I should even consider).  There's many calculators online, etc., but they yield different results.  I'm of course prepared to spend more on my mortgage payment than on rent.  The real estate market I'm in has everything from cheap suburbs with homes &lt;$200K to multimillion dollar homes with lakefront property.  My goal is to spend within my means on a nice home that I will live in for the long term, taking advantage of the currently very low interest rates coupled with my good credit score.

personalfinance,Keeping two houses or selling one?,"Some background info: we moved to Canada from Europe around 2 years ago. We are a married couple (both around 35 years of age) with 3 kids.

We want to decide whether it makes financial sense to keep our house at the other side of the pond now that we're living here.

Some background information:

**House A (in Europe)**

Located in a European country. We currently owe around 210K euro (principal) on the house. Our mortgage is around 1450 euro / month, rental income is around 750 euro / month. In the long run, we would still pay around 60K euro interest to pay off the house. If we were to sell today, I think we could fetch 350K euro. As far as housing market is concerned, I think at most a 1% value appreciation per year is to be expected (definitely not more).

**House B (in Canada)**

We bought this house last year. We payed 270K CAD for the house, and a big downpayment later we still owe 160K CAD. Our current interest rate (which could only be fixed for 5 years unfortunately) is 2.93%. We have flexibility for paying more than the current mortgage payments (around 1500 CAD / month).

Together we earn around 135K / year (that is before tax, probably 85-95K after tax). The only debt we have apart from the mortgages is 6K CAD on our single car (worth 12K). We have a small emergency fund (which we are currently actively trying to grow).

It's very tempting to sell the house in Europe, take the equity and dump it on our house in Canada, and be mortgage free quickly. But does it make financial sense?

All opinions welcome!",finance

personalfinance,Buy a house or pay off student loans?,"My SO and I have been saving for a house for the past year.  We currently have $14,000 in savings towards our down payment on top of $3,000 in savings for emergencies.  I currently earned loan forgiveness for over half my student loans that brought my total student loan debt down to $13,000.  This means we could pay off all my student loan debt right now, but it would eliminate almost all of our savings for a house.

In an ideal situation we would save 20% down (this would probably take another year) and then buy our house.  The area we are looking in has houses around $200,000 to $220,000.  Our priority when getting a house is to have a low monthly payment, so we are trying to avoid any 3% down mortgage situations.  This would be our first house, so we know there are some additional mortgage offers there, but all the ones we have found have higher monthly payments.

Things we are trying to consider are ... if we pay off my student loans, we have no debt (our cars are payed for and we pay off our credit cards in full each month).  Interest rates for mortgages are supposed to go up, and the highest interest rate I have on one of my student loans is 6.55%.  If we don't pay them off all at once, we will use the avalanche method to pay them off using the full monthly payment we did before the forgiveness went through.

We have also had a family member offer to help us with the down payment (a sort of gift/loan combo that we could pay back over several years).  We aren't opposed to this idea, but we aren't in love with it either, especially if it ends up being more of a loan situation because loans among family members tend to cause tension.

So is it better to pay off the student loans and have no debt?  Is it better to get a house before mortgage interest rates are raised again?",finance

I've been following personal finance for awhile and have liked and applied a number of things I've read, including How to handle $ which I hope you'll see I've taken to heart :).

Background on myself: 
mid 20's guy, work in sales, live in a very high cost of living metro area, live with the girlfriend, pretty stereotypical millennial lifestyle/spending habits. Grew up just below the poverty line so a lot of what I'm hoping to discuss/learn is very new to me. Risk Lover, at least when it's something that I feel my knowledge can influence. For example, I don't like to gamble in vegas or majorly on cards etc, but I do enjoy speculative investing on volatile stocks and betting on sports that I have knowledge of. 

Financial Background:


-Was broke during college so ended up with a few delinquent payments on my credit - paid all those off and negotiated most being removed, but still, a few show up. Credit rating is rising but currently around 750 most rating systems (based on what Creditkarma, what BofA provides, etc.)

-Work for a software company that provides good 401k (1:1 match up til a point, which I max out, then lower my contribution) and good ESPP (Can contribute up to 15% of income, which I max out as well)

-Recently (within the last year) started to invest via Robinhood, have about 20k in there and have performed relatively well after a couple hiccups, overall still in the black. 

-As someone in sales I try and for the most part do live off my base salary, I save my commission and use it for large purchases (gift for GF, experiences, my car, etc.)

Financial obligations:

1.4k/mo for rent

300-500/mo to support family member

no cell phone or car payments. gym is covered by work, etc.

10k in student loans, but I paid off all the bad/high interest ones. 

Financial assets:
20k in Robinhood, 50k in employee stock  
50k in 401k which my employer will give me a loan   
Vehicle with re-sell value approx 30k  
50k in savings

Questions:  
1) should I get a financial advisor? I've always seen them as a waste of money unless you have 100s of thousands to invest. I also love micromanaging the financial aspects of my life, but if it really is a better way to go, I would have to listen to reason.

2) I fall into the 33% federal tax bracket, anything I should think about to alleviate this? Seeing this+ SS on my tax return hurts. 

3) I really want to buy a house. All the above financial assets, for the most part, have been accumulated in the last 18 months. due to a couple promotions, I can say with confidence that conservatively I can double all of them in the next 12-18 months. I have always heard there are really good first-time homeowners tax breaks. Should I wait to try to buy a more expensive house so I can take further advantage of these tax breaks? 

4) If the answer is no, and I should buy a house in the next 12-18 months? Should I buy a house to live in, or should I buy a house to rent? I'm not sure I plan to stay where I am long term, but at least for the next 4-5 years. I'm completely impartial, just want to do what makes the most financial sense. Part of me wants to buy in an up and coming market vs. one that is already extremely high. If I do buy, should I 100% buy something I can put 20% toward, or would it be OK to do 10-15%? 

5) When thinking about semi-liquid assets, should I consider some of the money from my 401k? I read you can take a loan from your employer on I believe 20k of it. Is this a good idea? 

6) since I do like to micromanage $ and I am Risk-Loving, I plan to put more $ into robinhood. past year moving 2k/month in was a trial that performed well enough that I'm thinking about ramping that up to 5k/month. Good or bad idea?

7) Are there other questions I should be asking?

personalfinance,"The ol' ""how much should I pay on my student loan""?","So for the record I graduated almost a year ago with about $15,000 in student debt across 4 federal Stafford loans which average out to about a 3.4% interest rate. I just started repayment this year, not because I couldn't pay before, but because this is when the payback period officially started.

My current monthly payment for a 120 month payback period is $151 which is pretty easy. What I did starting this month and originally intended to do from here on is pay $300/month. By my calculations this reduces my total amount paid by about $1,600 (aka interest!) as well as reducing my payment period from 120 months to about 55. 

I *can* definitely afford it but it does cut into ""fun spending"" quite a bit. At the same time, the prospects of being debt free in under half the time that is planned is quite appealing and I'm just not sure if it's actually worth paying the extra bit.",finance

personalfinance,Your companies match on retirement may not be worth it if their funds earn a low interest rate,"Even if a company doubles your money, if your far enough from retirement and can earn a higher on average interest rate you may be better investing on your own. 

For example over the course of 25 years investing $5000 now into an investment that earns 11% yearly compounded monthly grows to a higher amount than a $10000 at 8% yearly compounded monthly.

personalfinance,A little upside down on used car loan. Could use some help calculating what extra payments will do.,"I took a loan that started 04 December 2015 with $7005 principal, 7.29% interest rate, and was/is a 60 month loan. I've been making the standard payments on it (couldn't do much more than that due to income), but have recently gotten some wiggle room to pay a little more. I've already made a one time payment of $200 ~9 days ago, and the principal is now at $5,525. 

How does one go about calculating what effect making one time payments of any given sum will have on the loan length and total interest accrued? 

For example, if I make a $100 payment today in addition to the other standard payments, how will that effect hoe much interest accrues daily, in total, etc?

personalfinance,Can I refinance a Sallie Mae Smart Option Student Loan?,"I recently went through a 4-month Programming Bootcamp where I live. My only option to pay for this was a Sallie Mae Smart Option Student Loan since it is not a traditional school and is not accredited. I had to take out a $25k loan with a variable interest rate starting at 9.25%.

This was a high risk/high reward situation for me. So far it has paid off very well as I landed a job making more than double what I was making before the program. I have no problems making the payments on this loan and it is my main priority right now to get it paid off. I have budgeted to pay around $1k a month, but I will still bleed thousands of dollars in interest before I can get this thing paid off. Since my income is so much higher than before, it is still by far worth it to have taken the loan out, but if I can avoid some of the interest I would like to know.

In less than 6 months the interest rate has already jumped to over 10%, and will continue to rise since interest rates have been at historic lows. I have a pretty decent credit score at ~750 so do I have any options to refinance this? More than anything I just want to get the interest rate fixed so I don't end up paying something ridiculous like 15-20%. 

Since this is not a traditional student loan I fear I may have few or no options. I have searched around and have only found information on deferring payments on this kind of loan, nothing about refinancing. 

I have thought about talking to Discover since I know they offer Student Loans and the first credit card I ever got was with them to start building my credit. I also was going to look into SoFi and similar companies as well. I was hoping someone on here might have some advice since this is such a specific and bad loan.

###Questions

I think that covers the gist of everything. Anyways I know budgeting wise I have to be careful when I am on my standard 27.5 hour weeks as I don't have a lot of free money with regular bill, but I adjust my spending as needed.

&amp;nbsp;

1. My job offers a Discounted Employee Stock Purchase Program at a discount of 5%. I would wondering if it would be beneficial at all to take advantage of it. It does have a lockout that I can not sell it for 2 years. I do have a portion of my 401k that also has company stock. If it matters it is for Class A stocks. The company stock is a bit volatile in the short term, however it does continue to increase and I don't see it tanking any time soon. (The company has been around for 110 years)

2. Is it worth keeping the 401k under the management of the provider?(Voya) I don't want to spend the time managing it so I figured it was better than just setting it and not doing anything with it. They charge $5.39 a month, at least that's been the charge the last few months, it might be a percentage based on value.

3. I am currently in repayment on my student loans as I had taken time off of school, however I am back at school part time now. Should I ask for my provider to put them back into deferment and just continue making payments or just not worry about it? I wasn't sure if going back into deferment would affect my credit or anything. I will be in school for at least another year, possible year and half to get my bachelors. Once I have my degree I will be planning on getting a higher position in the company.

4. Also on a somewhat side note, I have not filed my taxes yet for 2016. I was curious based on my situation if you think it would be worth paying to have my taxes done for me? In past years I have just been using the free version of TurboTax, although based on what I had put in so far TurboTax was saying I needed to use their Deluxe version. I was considering having them done a professional at least once just to see how they do it. I was also looking at the free options that are offered locally by volunteers, I was looking at the services United Way offers locally.

personalfinance,Missed a minor W-2 when I filed taxes...what should I do?,"Hi all,

Looking for some advice for those accountants in the audience. 

I got my family taxes done early this year...My W-2, my wife's W-2, all in. We were due a larger than expected refund (I didn't properly account for my new sons Child Tax Credit effect), so hooray, I decide to get everything in ASAP to try to get that refund pushed out to us. Could certainly use the money. 

Literally the evening after I file via TurboTax, I get a letter from a non-profit my wife worked with for 2 weeks...With a W-2 enclosed. Damnit, I forgot about it. A whole $9 worth of federal tax withheld, and $140 of income.  Literally insignificant in the grand scheme of things in regards to our income and tax base. 

Question is, what should I do? An accountant friend of mine said the practical answer was do nothing, as filing  amended taxes would just confuse the IRS (being so close together), and my money would be held for a month+ since I used both Child Tax credits, and those payments are held longer anyways since they are a target for fraud.  He says the Govt would just deduct what I owe before they send it my way, ""eventually"". 

That answer I find...Odd (they're seriously not set up to handle a amended return so close to the original return?), but I know zilch about taxes. 

What would be the best course of action here? File my amended return ASAP, or just wait it out?  What (if anything) will get me my money quicker?",finance

gaming,Anyone else notice that gaming terms tend to lose all meaning over-time?,"This is a bit of a rant post, but I'm curious to see if anyone else feels the same way.

It's something I've noticed over the two decades I've been a gamer. Particularly the names of genres. For example... The original ""Role Playing Game"" is Dungeons and Dragons. It's called a ""Role Playing Game"" because players act out their character's roles, giving them a voice and a personality, and creating a story with their Dungeon Master. However, video games took the stat-building and level progression aspect of it, and defined THAT as ""role playing"". A game with no storytelling, player choice, or any kind of interactive narrative by the player, that has some form of stat progression is still somehow called an RPG.

Another example would be the Rogue-like genre. If I click on the ""Roguelike"" tag in Steam, not a single one of those games is ANYTHING like Rogue. Rogue is a turn-based game where you move along a grid in a highly randomized dungeon, struggling to survive against difficult monsters, all while needing to keep fed. You can also do really cute things with your items, like throwing a potion you picked up at a monster and hoping that it's actually poison. But the Rogue-like genre ONLY focuses on the permanent death aspect. It's completely devolved into having almost no meaning anymore. The mainstream game series that's most similar to Rogue *doesn't even include permanent character death*.

Pokemon Mystery Dungeon is the closest (mainstream) game to Rogue. Randomized levels, high difficulty, long dungeons, lets you use items in unorthodox ways (like throwing equipment at enemies in desperation rather than using it), and all the while trying to keep yourself fed as you delve deeper. Running out of HP in a dungeon has you restart the dungeon, which is then re-randomized. Still, people will argue with me to the death and say that Pokemon Mystery Dungeon isn't a Rogue-like because the characters don't die.

Maybe the most recent and frustrating is when people refer to *all forms* of local/splitscreen play as ""co-op"". The first time I heard this was when someone told me that Halo 5: Guardians had no co-op at all. I thought to myself ""What? I know the splitscreen is gone, but they got rid of the entire co-op campaign?"". Later, I found out that yes, there still is a cooperative campaign mode. When I brought this to the attention of the person who said there was ""no co-op"", he responded with ""Yeah but that's online campaign, there's still no co-op"". One of my more petty arguments.

I thought this was a kind of localized incident, but as it turns out, A LOT of people would gladly call playing 1 on 1 Street Fighter 2 on SNES or a free for all in Super Smash Bros ""couch co-op"" as long as it's not online. [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF6vTgtEmI0) an example. Dokapon Kingdom is a VERY competitive game that destroys friendships, yet they label it as 4-Player Co-op.

personalfinance,My Mom wants to consolidate her debt into a refinanced mortgage but my name is on the title of the house. What is the best option for me to do?,"Here's the situation as best I can describe: As the title states my Mom is interested in rolling all her various debt up into a single refinanced mortgage.

2) $2,700 Credit Card Debt @ 14.74% interest

3) $1,700 CC debt @ 0% interest for 6 months - then 23% after

4) $4,500 CC debt @ 23% interest

5) $1,200 CC debt @ 23.49% interest

6) $22,000 401K loan at 4% over 7 years

She makes $1,600 every two weeks but the 401k loan requires $200 taken out of each pay check - so $1,400 net. She has minimal savings ( ~$800) and a credit score of 699. Her plan is to acquire a refinanced mortgage loan: $75,000 at 4% interest over 15 years.

personalfinance,Debt Reduction Question - Should my PMI (Private Mortgage Insurance) be a higher target on my list?,"Hello,

I currently have a short, but expensive, list of debts that include my home, 4 student loans, a loan for some land, and a furniture loan (0% interest).  I have always tracked my total amount due and paid extra when I can to provide long term savings.  To do so I have always focused on my highest interest debt first and for me that is 3 of the 4 remaining student loans. 

Question: While the interest rate on my home mortgage is only 3.62 vs 6.55 on student loans, would it be financially advantageous to pay extra toward the mortgage first to remove the PMI cost since its basically money going into the trash or do I continue to focus on higest interest debt first?

I have compared snowball and highest interest repayment methods and the highst interest always saves me more money, but in this instance I am unsure how to compare directly to ensure I am not making a financial mistake (even if a small one) for my long term goals.  

Is there a formula for comparing the PMI as if it were added interest to the loan so they are more directly comparable or is there another method I am unaware of?

Thanks in advance.",finance

personalfinance,[Retirement] What does this chart of my retirement account tells you? (MEX),"Hi there,

Before posting the actual chart here is some background info:

I'm 22 y/o (almost 23) and currently living in México, I started working as soon as I hit 18. In México we have a retirement fund usually called AFORE (the ""AFORE"" is actually the bank that manages the individual funds), based on our salary each month between 6% and 8% of it is deposited into this fund (a combination of government, employer and employee's contributions).

Without further due, this is my chart. Please note that I receive 3 statements over the course of one year:

We were initially planning on her getting the lease (terrible credit) with me cosigning (better then average credit).

The 2 scenarios coming are she's going to get approved and they're going to want ungodly interest from her, which we won't do, or that she's going to get denied, allowing me to cosign, and hopefully get an acceptable rate.

My question is, what is an acceptable loan rate? I have a 3.79% interest of my purchased car loan, but that's only because I had my mother to cosign with me at the time. What's and acceptable interest rate for a car lease? Should we take an offer that's less then 10%? less then 7%? Nothing less then 5%?",finance

personalfinance,Worth refinancing car?,"Previous life choices left me with a ~620 FICO score and a dud of a car that I owed $4000 on. So I traded the car in, got $1000 credit for it and rolled the rest into a car loan for a $12k car.

Fast forward to now, I still owe $14k on a car worth $10k and depreciating fast. 8.5% interest and on a repayment plan set to finish in Oct 2023. Everything else in my life has improved. I got a REALLY awesome job making some serious cash maxing my 401k with a generous employer match, I bought a condo right when interest rates were at their lowest and paid off most of my other debt except for $16k 3.5% student loans which I don't feel bad paying monthly for, and my wife's car which she got a great deal on and only have under a year's worth of ~$120/mo on. Wife and I have 700 and 730 credit scores now. (Maybe worth mentioning my wife has student loans too, same rate, but she works in public service; we expect those to be partially forgiven so we chose the extended graduated repayment plan. Per month payment is ridiculously low it doesn't make much of a dent in our finances as a whole)

So it seems the car is the next challenge to tackle. Given everything, I can afford to double my car's payments (from ~$250 to ~$500). If I can get the loan down to 115% (might be able to do this in one shot with tax refunds) of the cars value then I can refinance it to get a much better rate. Would the refi be worth any associated costs, or should I continue increasing the payments until it's paid off? I could potentially increase payments to $750/month as soon as a year from now. I am thinking I'd rather start contributing to an IRA than making extra car payments though. As it is I know I have enough to retire by 59 so not too worried about IRA.

Edit: by super rough calculations, I think refinancing could save me like $500 in interest.

Edit2: another note: paying some amount in mortgage insurance (I think $190/mo but I don't remember) -- would it be more worth the monetary effirt to try to get enough equity to drop that? Or am I right that my car is my next priority? Rapidly increasing home prices here might rage care of that for me soon, or at least that was the assumption I made when I choose to buy a condo without a good down payment. 3 months ago when we closed we were at 97% loan to value. I (conservatively) expect value to go up 10% in next year (similar homes in the area went up 16% last year, still lots of growth and development)",finance

personalfinance,Roth IRA Withdrawal for House Downpayment as a Proxy to Pay off Student Loans,"My wife and I (26/25) are planning on buying a fixer upper house around the 200k range. Our current plan is to put 5% down, and then put another 15k or so towards improvements for the house within the first year (doing the majority of the renovations ourselves).

150K combined income  
40K cash  
77K in 401k  
12K in Roth IRA  
9K car loan (1.9%)  
35K in student loans (15k 6.8%, 20K is under 4%)  

Down payment/closing costs/taxes/insurance will be around 20K, leaving us with 20K leftover right away, and we have around 3K leftover each month after our budget. (Rent is currently 1200 a month, mortgage is basically a sidestep +- 100 depending on insurance and utilities).

My question comes in regards to the following scenario, I can technically take 11K contributions out of my Roth IRA for the house. Of our student loans about 15K is higher interest of 6.8%. Then we can take out of our remaining cash then and pay off most/all of the higher interest rate student loans.

Obviously the plan is never to raid your retirement funds, but if we had 11K today we could choose to put it towards either an IRA or her loans, we would obviously choose the loans. Through the proxy of buying a house we can currently do the reverse and access this money without penalty or taxes, freeing up cash to knockout the higher interest rate loans. This will also get us to a point where we can up our 401k contributions again quicker, and then save on taxes for the year as well. 

The theoretical ideal outcome for the year being a house with 190K mortgage, but improvements that we’ve done (and are to our taste) making the house worth 215K + bringing us closer to 20% LTV. Moving 11k out of the Roth and some additional cash to knockout the higher loans, returning my 401k contributions to again max out for the year and thus save on taxes as well.",finance

personalfinance,Can I eliminate my PMI?,"In an effort to continue reducing my expenses, I’m wondering if I can refinance my mortgage solely to eliminate the PMI. Please forgive my ignorance for this hypothetical possibility; I’m not sure what the market is like now out there. I can provide additional info if needed but I’ll try to give as much detail as possible here. Also apologies for the formatting (I gotta figure that out here too).

&amp;nbsp;

I bought my first house back in 2013. I did not have much for a down payment...nowhere near the typical 20% for a conventional loan, so I got an FHA loan. I was only able to pony up $1000 out of my pocket and the initial mortgage lender told me about a program through HUD for first time homebuyers that would give me a $5000 grant toward the down payment...I just had to go sit in on a first-time buyers class. As far as the grant: it’s my understanding that if I pay off the entire loan, I don’t have to pay it back. If I sell the house before paying the loan off, then I have to pay the grant back. 

&amp;nbsp;

The initial price of the house was $209,900 and it appraised for $210,000 at that time. After factoring in the closing costs and applying the $6000 down payment, the amount I financed was $206,097. So of course I ended up having to pay mortgage insurance. I’m on a 30-year term with 3.75% interest. The PMI is about $200 per month.

&amp;nbsp;

So I’m just about 4 years into the loan, I’ve been making the payments on time every month, and at this point I’ve got about $191,000 left on the principle. Since owning the house I have spruced it up a little. It didn’t need much when I bought it but I have upgraded some things (my parents helped out with a $25K gift for initial repairs):

* New windows, HVAC, circuit breaker panel

* Water line from the street had to be replaced...went from blue poly to copper pipe

* Painted inside and out (wood siding)

* Replaced all interior doors from cheap brown slabs to the “nicer” white 6-panel slab and changed all hardware

* A few other smaller things just for looks

&amp;nbsp;

I’m not done but some of the stuff I want to do is cost prohibitive at this time. Some other houses in the neighborhood that are the same floor plan as mine (it’s a townhouse neighborhood) have recently sold for at least $230K, up to $245K for a couple of houses with even more upgrades.

&amp;nbsp;

My questions are…

*Can I refinance the mortgage just to eliminate the PMI?	

 * I’m content with the interest rate I currently have...the initial mortgage lender said it would’ve been .5% lower if I didn’t go the route of the FHA loan.

 * If I could refi, I don’t have anything again for a down payment or closing costs...is it even possible to use the equity in the house for this? And the grant payback?

 * I’d really like to just “pick up where I left off” as far as the term goes...is there a 25-year option available? I don’t want to reset the clock on this house with another 30 year loan and I feel like going with a 20 year loan would wipe out the potential savings that I’m dreaming of in my head.

&amp;nbsp;

Ultimately, I’m really just looking to reclaim that monthly $200 from the PMI because to me, well, it’s just wasted money and there are better things I can do with it. Are my ideas feasible?",finance
personalfinance,"I need help understanding my W4, dependents, allowances, and my tax return.","I've tried googling and searching here, but I can't seem to find an answer that makes sense to me.  Either I'm getting confused or the results are conflicting.  Please help me understand my situation:

I make roughly $74k/year, my W4 says 2 allowances, and single. Every year, I get back $3000-$4000 on my Federal tax return.  I got married last year, and while I was updating my W4 with my employer, I also wanted to adjust my withholding.  The IRS calculator said I should check ""Married with higher single rate"" and 1 allowance to net me a $650 return.

This confuses me because:
1. I was previously at the Single rate
2. I was claiming 2 allowances, which based on my understanding, should have resulted in LESS taxes taken out (compared to 1).

Now they want me to file at the same rate, but reduce the number? To add to this confusion, my boss makes it seem like I can just put any number in there for the allowances in order to adjust the withholding, regardless of the worksheets the IRS provides.  I just don't get it.  My confusion is turning to fear that I've done something wrong these past few years and I'm going to end up owing the IRS a buttload of money.

personalfinance,(CAN) Credit card debt &amp; cash advance,"This is with RBC Canada.  
  
I have a massive amount of credit card debt. While trying to pay some of it of, I instead made a cash advance by moving the money from the credit card to my account. I immediately paid it back and then made the payment, but the cash advance stuck.  
  
I tried calling in and they said they would try to switch it to a purchase. That didn't work out and I just got off the phone and there is nothing they can do. I tried asking if I could just pay off just the cash advance, but they said no.  
  
To me, this is ridiculous. If there are two separate interest rates and two separate fund allocations, why am I not allowed to pay it separately? Any payment I make will go 99% to the credit card debt and 1% to the cash advance. Essentially I will never be able to remove the cash advance interest until my credit card is paid off.  
  
Is there anything I can do? I only just started to get my head on right and started to pay off the credit card. I feel like this is going to put me over the edge and force me into bankruptcy. I just want to get rid of it so I can properly pay off my credit card.

&amp;nbsp;

Hello everyone, before I get into the gist of things, I just want to apologize beforehand for my stupidity. Please assume that I am an ignoramus who has little to no understanding of the inner workings of the legal/financial system which, to some, may be common sense. I searched the sub by relevance and wasn't able find anything similar to my situation. I live in the US, AR.
 
&amp;nbsp;

Ok, so I just turned 18 a few months ago and since then I've applied for 2 credit cards to use as they are intended to be used. I have no debts or anything of that caliber. I've also accumulated a few bank accounts from experimenting with finding a bank that suits my needs/has features I wanted. During the application process of these things, I've always selected US Citizen when/if asked because that's what I thought I was, until like a year ago. I thought it was like the 18+ prompts where it doesn't matter what you put. Since then, I've tried a few other bank accounts, no cc, and still selected the US Citizenship option, knowing that I'm actually a resident alien with a green card, as are my parents because apparently I lack the brain cells to fathom how this could affect me and my family in the near future. FUCK.

&amp;nbsp;

I just googled to see if it did matter, read some stuff, and understand that I could get deported due to citizenship fraud? I get that deportation is bad and even though my friends joked about it all the time with themselves, there was never a reason for it to be of any concern to me. I am here legally, just didn't know that what I did constituted fraud. I also have an N-400, the application for naturalization in progress. The interview is scheduled for Feb. So, I'm freaking out right now and I've no idea what to do. I'm a first generation student currently in college going for a bachelor's degree in CS with a 4.0 college gpa, and being deported now would suck to say the least. From U.S. Code § 1227:
&gt;Any alien who falsely represents, or has falsely represented, himself to be a citizen of the United States for any purpose or benefit under this chapter (including section 1324a of this title) or any Federal or State law is deportable.

What exactly constitutes a 'benefit'? Me choosing 'US Citizen' on those applications wasn't done to circumvent any regulations that choosing 'Resident Alien' on the CC or Bank applications would have otherwise. Also, I read something about an exception if I ""permanently resided in the U.S. (with a green card) before you turned 16""? Which is true, yes, I've been in the US with a green card since I was ~5. 

&amp;nbsp;

I've called my credit cards; Discover updated it in their system, and Capital One did as well. As for banks, I called Wells Fargo (checking account), and they transferred me to the relevant department and the CS said that I shouldn't worry about it, that the citizenship thing only really applies for credit related stuff. I couldn't get that in writing so I'm not sure what to think about that. I've called my other banks and the consensus is that updating the citizenship status can't be done over the phone and I'll have to go in branch to get that done. If a bank isn't local, I'll need to mail in a notarized request to have it changed.
 
&amp;nbsp;

So right now, I know that I need to get all my financial institutions to update it in their system. I'm posting this here because I don't know if that's good enough, or if there are other things I need to be aware of that I need to do? Is all this necessary? Does it even matter? What repercussions could this have in the future? Am I fucked? Will I die in a 3rd world country alone and miserable? I'm really just looking for advice and input on whether my course of action is alright and to hopefully get everything corrected and back to the way it should be. I appreciate all well substantiated input and thank you so much for taking the time to read this!!",finance

Got a raise a month ago and changed around some benefits / contributions which has given me more fluid money which I want to use wisely and really get my act together (but still enjoy life)


**Order of operations as followed...**


1.) Pay off credit card [done today actually :) ]

2.) Change 401k contribution amount to minimum 6% (max company match) and remove 4% Roth contributions

3.) Put 15% of paycheck into savings/emergency fund till I get to 5k 

4.) Put another 5% away into a car fund

5.) Make minimum student loan payments on lower interest rate loans and use any leftover money at the end of the month to pay the highest interest loan (6.55% currently)


Finance info... 

**I.) Income** -- ~3k/ month (after taxes + investments)



**II.) Monthly expenses** -- $2,592

Rent + Utilities - $1000

Food - $300-400 

Loans - $292 minimum

Gas - $100

Entertainment - $200

20% Savings - $600

Remainder would go to student loans?



**III.) Nelnet Student Loans** -- $14,758

Group A -- $2,676 @ 5.35%

Group B -- $3,386 @ 4.25%

Group C -- $7,471 @ 3.15%

Group D -- $1,225 @ 6.55%



**IV.) Investing** $22,560

401k -- $17,967 (50% match on first 6%) in Vanguard 2050 (varies in gains, my guess is 3-4% 

Roth -- $3,343

Personal -- 5 shares of TSLA @ $1,250 currently (12% growth)



**V.) The car** -- ~$900 (Nothing owed)

173,000 miles and not getting any younger. Things are starting to break, noises to be had, and the occasional slight burning smell is not unheard of. Running it into the ground though, and when that happens would buy used in the  ~6-12k range. 



**VI.) Savings/Emergency** -- $1,000

15% going to emergency till I hit 5k

5% going to car ($0 currently but I want to start)



**VII.) Tax Return**

Nearly forgot about this one. My guess is ill get 2k back (I do need to allocate ~$1,500 for a hawaii trip in may / wedding in June). Rest I was going to throw into emergency savings.

personalfinance,"Marriage, Retirement Saving, and Student debt. Need advice on how best to manage.","My wife has roughly $73k in student loans to repay that recently came out of deferment. I called Take Charge America on advice to schedule payments and learn about the [Public Service Loan Forgivemess](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/public-service) because she works for an eligible non-profit. Our combined AGI is about $90k and last year we filed joint on our tax return. Take Charge America suggested she consolidate her loans under FedLoans to be eligible for the forgiveness program and then file taxes separate and make qualifying payments under the Income-Based plan. If we file our taxes separate than her payment, which is $695/mo., should go way down. Then after 120 payments the remainder would be forgiven which could potentially save us maybe $40k in loan forgiveness after 10 years of payments.

Here is where things got complicated. I did not know that you cannot write off Traditional IRA contributions on your tax returns, negating the benefit of Traditional IRAs, and you cannot contribute to a Roth IRA at all if you are married but file separate. Filing joint seems to be essential to IRA retirement savings. Now I feel like Take Charge America greatly misled us. I am looking at this bill of $695 that may go up to over $800/mo after the first year, and I have no idea what to do. I'm not sure if making the high payments and contributing to a Roth IRA would outweigh the low payments and loan forgiveness. Also my wife would have to be committed to working at a non-profit while making 120 payments which could be out of our control if she got laid off or offered a better job.

Should I pay the high payments and contribute to our Roth IRAs or should I file separate and take a hit on the retirement savings? What kind of professional financial advisor might I be searching for to help me figure this out?",finance

I also found this on google: 
&gt;At the end of the year, when you receive your W-2 form that shows your earnings, you will notice that your wages subject to federal income tax are lower because of your 401(k) plan contributions. Since the wages are not counted in your taxable income to begin with, you do not take a deduction when you file your return.

personalfinance,Affordable stressful Calculus or more expensive less stressful Calculus?,"I had a discussion with a potential employer who really wants to make an offer after I've interviewed.

However, because the employer is federal they have to follow this [OPM standard] (https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/classification-qualifications/general-schedule-qualification-standards/1500/operations-research-series-1515/). The problem is that I have never taken Calculus so they cannot make me an offer (I fulfill there other requirements).

This is where personal finance comes into it. My college Calculus course offering (affordable) started 3 weeks ago so if I were to find a professor to accept me, I may be setting myself up for a terrific uphill battle with the coursework. To avoid this I've been looking into online self-paced Calculus courses (The course does not have to be associated with my degree or University to satisfy the OPM requirement). So far I found the following course offerings:

* At my college ($909.40 + $200 fees, but the class started 3 weeks ago)
* At local community college ($700 + $80 fees, the class also started 3 weeks ago)
* Online Self-Paced (Ideal) at the State college ($1930 + ~$100 fees)

I'm seeking any advice on how to navigate this and what will financially make the best sense. Do I take the course online for twice the price, but with less stress (up to 9 months to complete it)? Should I see if there is a professor that will accept me into their class so late? I also believe there are cheaper online alternative -- I'm just trying to be cautious of scams.

personalfinance,Owing over 3.7K to feds and 2.2K to state in taxes. Am I doing this wrong?,"I’m currently in the process of completing our tax returns. Going into this year, I knew my wife and I were going to owe money, as this is my first complete year of work after graduate school. However, we were not prepared to see how much we expect to owe the state and fed. After double checking to see if I entered everything correctly, it was clear that we were owing far more than I had anticipated. We will have to dig into our savings for a house, which we hate to do.

So here’s what we have. Our wages come in at 112K, not including 2.5K in additional earnings from interest in housing savings and mutual fund investments. We were able to subtract 3.2K from my wife’s IRA deduction and 2.5K from student loan interest, but despite the standard deduction and exemptions, the 88.3K of taxable income leads us to eventually owe the feds 3.7K

TurboTax suggests contributing to an IRA through April to increase our deductions. I can certainly encourage my wife to increase her contributions but with my employer’s retirement (pension) plan, I cannot deduct more than 900 dollars should I open an IRA.

Although 112K is a decent income, living in Los Angeles in a one-bedroom apartment certainly doesn’t make us feel wealthy. As I mentioned earlier, we are saving for a house and we are both despondent at having to owe close to 6K. Furthermore, our first born is due to arrive in March, which will definitely put a dent in our finances (but one we welcome).

Is there anything we can do to owe less money aside from increasing IRA contributions? What suggestions can you provide so that we can owe less money in the future without having to dip too much into our house/emergency savings?

I'm a 21 year old student filing for taxes for the first time. Due to a few circumstances, all of my previous jobs did not have me on any sort of US tax system. My job now is also special in the way that I don't pay any federal or state taxes, just social security and medicare. 

I have my 1098t from my school that reports around 7,000 billed to me in 2016. Only problem is that have gotten my tuition payed for by the GI bill. 

Question now is... should I even expect anything back? What can I claim as school expenses? Like I said, this is my first year filing for taxes, and considering I paid no federal tax, I'm assuming it's no.",finance

personalfinance,I have a Credit Score of 805. I am about to let a $180 bill go to collections. What are my options.,"After somewhere between 8-10 hours on hold with CenturyLink, I got to a point where, for my own mental health, I simply will not call them back.  As a result, the $180 they are trying to charge me is likely to go to collections.  The company opened up this account without my permission and I am not at fault and should not be held liable for any of it.

What are my options.  I already submitted a BBB complaint.  Can I reach out to a Congressman or is that more for issues with federal agencies?  I don't honestly care if my credit score goes down a little...but I will not pay this company a dime.",finance

personalfinance,What keeps me up at night is buying power forecast,"A few articles analyzed the fictitious Mad Men series, specifically their salaries.  The articles claims Don Draper made 30k up until he was offered 45k and awarded 15% of the company.  His 2bdrm UES penthouse was purchased for 75k.  If we are to work with those numbers - take them as they are - the analysis went on to say his salary has the equivalent as 315k today: a 7x increase over just 50 years.  His home:salary ratio is 1.66 which seems small but at the time higher mortgage interest rates reduced asking prices. Currently there are no listings in Manhattan where a 2bdrm can be bought near 523k.  I won't graph the trend but one can imagine that within a working lifetime retiring at a salary 7x their current gross will only serve to have the same buying power as they have today, no more.  And house prices are rising at a faster rate than an aggressive salary.

Understood that increases in disposable income lead to other revenue streams and retirement saving plans.  I also understand by retirement most of the major purchases will have been made and paid off.  I also understand government plans begin to pay back.

Still, if I'm feeling comfortable now with say 100k/yr I will expect to need 700k/yr by 2067 to feel the same.  That or have profitable investments supplementing for a total of 700k.  Is this fear sound?  Is this tenable for the working class to ever claw out of their tier?",finance

investing,Summary of “The Little Book That Beats The Market” by Joel Greenblatt,"Here’s a summary of the book, “The Little Book That Beats The Market” by Joel Greenblatt, a hedge fund manager, investor, writer and professor, most notably known for Magic Formula Investing - an investment strategy he outlines in this book

Right off the bat, Joel Greenblatt, the author let’s you know that most professional investors and money managers are not going to help you beat the market. You can try going with a money manager, but most of them are only trained to sell you a particular investment product. You can try going with a mutual fund, but trying to pick mutual funds that will outperform the market is like having a monkey throw darts on a list of stocks. It involves quite a bit of luck (also cleaning equipment if the monkey chooses to fling poop instead of darts). If you are one of those rich farts that uses gold bars as bookmarks, you can try going with a hedge fund but the 2-20 fee structure will kill your returns. And if you are a middle-income fart that uses regular bookmarks as bookmarks, you can try going with an index fund but they will only give you the market’s average return minus taxes and costs.

If you want to beat the market, you’re going to have to do it yourself. How can you do that? By finding out what companies are worth and then trying to buy them for less than that. And that’s the essence of value investing, bottled in one small sentence.

Sure, you can save your money by sticking it under a mattress. But it’s not going to grow. In fact, it’s going to lose value due to inflation. You can grow your money by sticking it in a bank. The bank will take your money and lend it to companies. The bank will give you a small interest rate and make coffins full of fat stacks in the process. Or you can bypass the bank and lend your money directly to companies by buying bonds, make those fat stacks yourself. Your money or investment will grow at a higher interest rate, but that also comes with a higher risk of losing your money. So what is a risk-free investment? Well, the safest investment in the world is the 10-Year Bond issued by the US Government. So any investment worth your time must give you a higher interest rate than the 10-Year US Bond. Since the interest rate on the 10-Year US Bond is what investors in the market are demanding for a risk-free investment, therefore it follows that an investment with risk must yield higher than that.

If you haven’t rage quit this window by now, you’re in luck. Because the author suggests that the best option to grow your money is buying shares in a company. This entitles you to a portion of that company’s future profits. As discussed, that portion must be higher than what you’d earn on a 10-Year US Bond. How on earth do you calculate that? Earnings Yield. 

Earnings Yield = Earnings Per Share / Market Price. 

The earnings yield of any investment must be more than the interest rate on the 10-Year US Bond. The book argues that companies with a high earnings yield are available for purchase at cheap prices relative to what they’re earning. In short, a high earnings yield gives you a bigger portion of the company’s profits at cheaper prices. Because of this, earnings yield is used as gauge of measuring if the company’s stock price is cheap or expensive. Higher the earnings yield, cheaper the company. But a company trading at cheap prices, doesn’t always stay that way because over the long term prices will rise to where they should be. And as prices rise, earnings yield will drop. Yield. Yield. That’s a very weird word if you keep repeating it over and over again. Yield.

Alright, now that we’ve established that, let’s go back to that small sentence. Finding out what companies are worth and then trying to buy them for less than that. But if you can find out what a company is worth, then so can your neighbour and the entire block, which makes it just a tinsy bit difficult to buy the company for less than that what it’s worth. Lucky for you, stock prices fluctuate wildly over short periods of time. However, the worth of the underlying company does not fluctuate as much. This provides you, your neighbour and indeed, the entire block with opportunities to buy shares at prices below the worth or value of the company and sell shares at prices above the value of the company. But having a big margin of safety is always better. A margin of safety is buying shares when they are trading at way, way below the value of the business. This is a good idea because at the end of the day, you’re only human. And as unfortunate as that sounds, it means that you will make errors and encounter unexpected scenarios that affect the underlying company. A margin of safety helps you mitigate that risk. Let’s take a moment to say thank you to the margin of safety, the unsung hero of investing. 

The stock market that fluctuates wildly over short periods of time is that same stock market that lusts after growth. It stares at growth in profits in very much the same way a broke college student stares at ready-to-eat noodles. And very much like the broke college student with his noodles, the stock market pounces on every company that shows consistent high growth in profits. But what leads to a high growth in profits? If you follow the book, it’s a high return on capital.

Return On Capital = (Net Income - Dividends) / (Equity + Debt)

The book argues that companies that earn a high return on capital have the opportunity to reinvest profits at a high rate of return. This leads to a high rate of growth. And you know what that means. That means the stock market falling over itself to throw money at the company’s stock. Companies with a high return on capital are also likely to have a special advantage of some kind that keeps competitors from destroying the ability to earn above-average profits. Higher the return on capital, better the company.

Now, here is where the book dives into the magic formula of investing. No, it doesn’t involve pulling bunnies out of a hat. And no, it doesn’t involve carrying around a never ending chain of handkerchiefs. However, it does involve buying good companies at bargain prices. What are good companies? Companies with a high return on capital. What are bargain prices? Companies with a high earnings yield. What do you get when you put those two things together? Magic. Or at the very least, market beating investment results.

To substantiate its claims, the book also offers some proof that the magic formula works. Consider the 3,500 largest publicly traded US companies. Rank these companies separately by return on capital and earnings yield. Combine these rankings. For example, a company with 32nd highest return on capital and 56th highest earnings yield would rank 88th (32+56) on the combined rankings. Over 1988-2004, owning a portfolio of 30 highest ranked stocks according to these combined rankings would’ve returned 30.8% per year whereas the S&amp;P 500 returned 12.4% per year. Those are some impressive numbers right there.

What the magic formula really does is that it ranks stocks in order of quality. Hence, it will continue to work so long as the market continues to offer stocks. And it doesn’t sound like the market is going to run out of stocks any time soon. This magic formula works for big as well as small companies, and doesn’t appear to be based on sheer luck or random chance. However, too much of a good thing can be bad. So let’s throw in some bad news. The magic formula only works over the long term. It underperforms the market once every four years. However, as the tables of data in the book corroborate, over a long term time horizon the magic formula certainly beats the market. 

By now, you should be asking, “If this new fangled formula is so good, why isn’t everyone already using it? Huh? Huh? Check-mate, mister wall street.” And even if you aren’t asking that, the book has an answer anyway. Most people will not stick to a strategy that will sometimes underperform the market. They will simply abandon the strategy. This is where the author drops the F-bomb. Faith. You need to have faith and truly believe that the magic formula will work - because it’s hard to not give up during the periods when the formula is underperforming the market. Usually, the animal instincts tend to take over and kick all rational argument overboard.

The author also tells you to give back to society and do good, now that you’re going to be all rich and famous. But you probably already have a laundry list of things to do, ready to go for when you become rich and famous. Let’s end this summary with a quote from the author - “Choosing individual stocks without any idea of what you’re looking for is like running through a dynamite factory with a burning match. You may live, but you’re still an idiot.”

personalfinance,Need help deciding what to do with my Refund,"I posted in yNAb, but they suggested I post here. 

I got way more in tax refund  than I expected. This year I'm walking away with 4836. It was pointed out that my w-4 needs correction most likely, so I will be looking into that. 

I immediately went to... what should I do with the money?

My financial situation: I just started YNAB a few weeks ago and I have no real buffer. My categories are not filled out (stuff like car maintenance, yearly auto registration fees, buffer, travel, etc.).

I have student loans, but that's not going to disappear with 4k so I'm not going to worry about this right now. I pay roughly $400 a month in loans right now.

I have one CC with 6,000 balance with 0 percent interest rate for the next 21 months. (Using the Goal Calculator: Budget $226.09 more to stay on track towards paying off your card balance by November of 2018.) I won't have any problem paying this off each mont to make sure I close the balance in 20 months and I won't be adding anything else to the card. 

I have an auto loan that's $4,420 with a 6.99 interest rate. This car is on its way OUT (due to abs and other malfunction, it's going to cost more to repair than it's valued), but I'm hoping to get another 6 months out of it. 

What would you do in my shoes?  I feel like I've wasted my refund in the past and I don't want to do that. I really want to maximize YNAB and get my financial situation under control. I'm not struggling for money, but I'm tired of the paycheck to paycheck lifestyle I found myself in this year.

My loan is at an interest rate of 6.35%",finance

He put in his W2 into his personal TurboTax account just to see what is refund would be, and it was $3,400.

So the root of my problem: At this moment I have a little under $1000 (just paid my $800 rent) in my bank account, with no emergency fund. I spent it all in June for my new lease (first, last, security, and broker fee). I'm about to get $1700 back from my last lease ending, which I plan on putting towards my taxes this year. (Last year I paid about $1100.) I have about 20k left in student loans (all FedLoan) and I'm currently on Pay As You Earn. I haven't paid anything on my student loans since 2014, when I threw $10k at them (leftover loan money). My parents also have a ton of loan money out for me, and I feel terrible about that, but that's another story. The other day, my parents told me they have a $2k check from my grandma to give me. And I also have a Charles Schwab account with $7k in it from mutual funds from when I was a little kid that I'm now in charge of. I don't fully understand how it works, but after reading this subreddit it seems like a Target Date Fund, and I really like the thought of not touching it and letting it grow.

But I guess my question is: what do I do with the $2k check? And what do I do with my Target Date Fund? Should I open it up and put it towards my loans? Should I put the $2k in my savings? Should I open a different savings account that isn't part of my current bank to get a higher interest rate? I'm sorry if I sound like a total newb, but that's because I am. I love this subreddit and it's been helping me get it together for about a year now (yay budgeting!) but I could really use more advice. Thank you so much! 

TL;DR: I'm an actor and freelancer with about $1k in the bank but no current savings, $20k of Pay As You Earn Student Loans, and I've got a $2k check and a $7k Target Date Fund from my parents and am not sure what to do with them.",finance

personalfinance,Considering purchasing a house with 0% deposit but favorable loan deal (Aus),"So I've been able to secure a loan of about $200,000 AUD at 2.5% that I can use towards the deposit of a property and must pay off in 20 years making the repayments about $1000 a month.  The loan is from a foreign company and in USD and therefore subject to not just interest rate changes but also currency changes.

In Australia the standard mortgage interest rate is 4.6%, I currently already own a property paying roughly that much in interest over 30 years, repayments currently being under $1400 a month, owing about $256,000 on it I purchased it in 2015 for $300,000 with a 10% deposit.


So with this loan I could make a 10 to 20% deposit on a property here in Australia and get the rest of the loan from a bank at ~4.6%, obviously the catch is I have no deposit on this new property and if I were to buy a house it's unlikely I can get anything for less than $400,000 (apartments and townhouses are a bit saturated in the market currently and building your own house yields significant tax savings).

I can rent out my current property and not lose anything (slight gains after claiming the property on tax) but I cannot make money renting out the new property I buy as essentially 100% of it is financed meaning I must live in it for a few years and either sell it or see if the rent has gone up enough to offset the cost of the mortgage.

I updated my budget with all things in consideration and worst case scenario assuming my current property is rented out and worst case scenario for all other bills (maximum grocery/electricity, etc) I would have about $500 left over for savings/fun expenses (movies, games etc) and in 4 years once the car is paid off that will balloon to $850 (but I might need to buy a new car or fix this one as it gets older so it's a moot point).

The two major issues I have with this loan is it's 100% with no or very little deposit on my part, the other being if the AUD falls against the US the payments would go up, in addition to the risk of the interest changing.",finance

I have a Schwab investor checking account and have had a horrible experience and want to close my account. I searched Reddit, but only found really positive advice, seems to be the #1 card suggested for frequent travelers.

I travel a lot. That's why I opened this account.

But the card gets turned off for fraud detection an unbelievably large amount of time and it's been such an inconvenience. Story below, but put question here that's all you really need to read. But if you have had similar experience or found a solution do let me know!

**So here's the question:**
&gt; Is there another recommended alternative bank/checking account. Specifically with regards to travel savings (ATMs, foreign transaction fees and currency switch rates)?

**The Problem (and rant):**
&gt; Schwab/Visa have stopped my card for fraud protection at least 15 times in the last 2 months alone. In the last 4 days I've talked to the bank and visa 3 times!!!!

Tonight was the straw that broke this camel's back. It was declined/blocked for fraud AGAIN this afternoon, after the first turn off on Friday and talking to them every day this weekend, Schwab claiming the block was lifted.

The card was declined while I was buying groceries this afternoon, at the same store I go to multiple times a week (Visa/Schwab have hundreds of logs of purchase history).

BTW I know I'm emotional right now, but I'm not exaggerating how frequent this is a problem I can show you my phone logs.

This isn't even close to the first fraud/unusable card issue.

For Christmas trip I used a travel agent and Schwab wouldn't let them charge my card. I tried talking to schwab at least three times, saying the charge was mine and not fraud. But no changes even after they claim they put a note on. Then it didn't work while travel for about half the trip.

Over an 11 day vacation I called them 4 or 5 times, I'd have to look at my phone logs but it was almost every other day.

Thank god i have a business card: Wells Fargo, platinum business checking.

I ended up actually putting more $ on my Wells Fargo. I didn't even tell Wells Fargo I was traveling. Not one single problem!

I would put my personal travel checking account at Wells Fargo but they don't offer the same travel benefits.

I'm fed up looking stupid and being embarrassed with declined cards and wasting my time on the phone with Schwab and Visa (I wish I could bill Schwab/visa for my time? my consulting rate?).

My mind is pretty much made up on closing. An emotional decision. But in theory if the card worked abroad, I love the travel benefits. Logically the card is a good idea.

personalfinance,"late blooming contractor, how to save and invest versus paying debts? brand new to r/personalfinance","Greetings Personal Finance!

I am a late bloomer here, 30 year old who just now completed a long term mission of desperation to graduate with bachelors of science degree.

I am a small business owner for approximately 8 years. I started in my parents garage and for the past few years the base of operations has been inside of another business since I moved out. I formed a unique friendship / bond with another business owner in the same industry but twice my age and a foreigner to my country. This friend of mine is more than ready to retire however his business is not ready to retire him. Both him and myself are sole proprietors of our own businesses who have helped each other to succeed. I am working more and more on his business, much of it on a volunteer basis, to help him achieve retirement. He is suffering the early onset of senile dementia so we are working every day to improve his customer records and draw out our business plans.

His business is capable of offering a small opportunity for me and possibly much more as it has an older brand and outstanding location, but I also want to keep developing my own brand. I enjoy my job because it allows me to work in the right combination of hands on labor and also graphic design and networking with other business owners. We are also working towards the point that I can branch off and open my own business location which would function in a symbiotic fashion with his business.

My business has grown slowly and steadily as I have developed my brand in a niche market on a part time basis while studying.

Complete financial independence is new for me since about 2 years ago, I have learned how to save my money and make it last for at least a few months or more while I was studying to graduate and also I have been working on a contract basis being paid only by project.

I have now entered the first point in my life when I am free to work full time through a complete year. My benchmark is that I am able to live comfortably with approximately $20,000 annual salary and a total business revenue of at least $55,000.

I am grateful for a great living situation with $500 rent (which is the steal of a lifetime in my area) and I spend approx $700 per month on food and entertainment in a city environment. I am able to further reduce my living expenses and salary a little bit more and focus on setting up a separate emergency fund for the first time.

Since I am self employed, my next step is to pay down my debts. I lumped all personal credit card debt into my federal student loans which now total approx. $28,000. Thankfully I carry no credit card debt at the moment and intend to keep it that way.

I would like to pay as close as I can to $1000 per month toward my student loans to be free within 3 years time or less. This would allow me to become totally debt free.

I am also assuming that the IRA setup also needs to happen ASAP?

My business has some room to cut costs slightly and earn more revenue.

I am also interested in investing in longer term and hands-off style mutual funds or something to this effect. I have zero experience with stock market investments and I don't know what stage is most appropriate to pursue this?

Thank you everyone in advance for your thoughtful input to helping me achieve success.",finance

Ask me anything about the importance of sharing science and my priorities for ACS!","Hi Reddit! I’m Allison Campbell, President of the American Chemical Society. Currently I am the Associate Laboratory Director of the Earth and Biological Sciences Directorate at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). A physical chemist by academic training, my research has focused on biomaterials.


My research focus is on the role of proteins in biomineralization. During my time in the Materials Science Department at PNNL, I have co-invented a process inspired by biology that allows us to grow bioactive calcium phosphate layers onto the surfaces of artificial joint implants. By mimicking bone, this innovation can extend the life of the implant and reduce implant rejection.
I hold a PhD in physical chemistry from the State University of New York at Buffalo, and a BA from Gettysburg College in Gettysburg, PA. I have been a member of the ACS since 1985 and in that time have become a member of the National Academy of Sciences Chemical Sciences Roundtable and was named an AAAS Fellow in 2013.


One aspect of science I’m most passionate about is promoting science education and sharing scientific information. As often as I can, I share my personal enthusiasm for science with young students and participate in a number of hands-on education programs. As ACS President I feel it’s so important that all us chemists out there should share with the public what chemistry is and how it helps society. This means we need to get as good at science communication as we can. I also feel it is greatly important to foster common principles and practices among the global chemistry community. You can read about these and my priorities as ACS President in my *Chemical &amp; Engineering News* statement [“Pedaling the power of chemistry.”](http://cen.acs.org/articles/95/i1/Pedaling-power-chemistry.html)


Ask me anything about my ACS priorities of sharing the value of chemistry and building its global principles and practices. You can also ask about my research in biomineralization.


Note that as a scientist employed by a federal laboratory, I am bound by the [Hatch Act]( https://osc.gov/Resources/HA%20Pamphlet%20Sept%202014.pdf) and therefore may not engage in questions of a political nature.

I've only had two credit cards my entire life and one of them was just a temporary thing because my doc didn't take a mastercard so I also got a Visa.

I'm scared and it's nice to know I have a cushion if life kicks me in the head again. But throwing it all on the card is an option I suppose. It would not cover the full amount. 

That said, I am doing okay making the minimum payments but I have to play the bill juggling game way too often to say I can afford more than the minimum on that debt. At this rate I guess I could just pay the minimum for 20ish years, but that's the best I could do. 

Alternatively, since the IRA and cheap car are the only assets to my name, I could just declare chapter 7, work out a deal with my one creditor, and not have $10k in debt hanging over my head for the next 20 years. 

What would you do? 

Note: For the purpose of your answers assume ""get a job"" is not an answer. I do work some but because of the way SSI works it does not significantly increase my income and I don't feel like trying to explain disability math to people. I am working toward being able to be a normal person with a full time income, but I'm just not there yet and I need to deal with the now.",finance

personalfinance,Was I getting screwed by Navient on my student loans for 2 years? [debt] [student loans],"Hi Reddit,

I was going through some of my student loan documents after I heard about Navient fucking over a bunch of people. I am concerned in particular about one loan that I've been overpaying on for about 2 years just recently realized it hasn't gone down as much as it should have (I have about 8 other, higher interest loans I've been prioritizing so my total number has gone down, which is why I never noticed).

During the highlighted time on this imgur link http://imgur.com/a/BcN65  the interest rate on the loan was 3.25%, which equates to about $37 of interest I should be paying per month. However, it's clear from the spread sheet that my entire payment each month (sometimes over $100) has been going towards interest! I also know for a fact that I have clicked the option that says ""Apply any leftover funds to my principal and make my next payment as scheduled"" each month.  

Can anyone ELI5 as to where my money went and why my balance did not go down all this time??? I want to call customer service, but I would like to have a solid number to tell them when I say ""You have overcharged me $XX dollars and my loan balance should be $XX"".

personalfinance,[Debt/Housing][Colorado] Does it make sense to focus debt money towards a more competitive rental application (ie. put down more rent up front) and use the rent-less months to pay debt?,"Hello Personalfinance,

My wife and I are both medical residents currently and not quite ready to buy a home due to the lack of foresight to where we'll actually be living in the future. Because of this, we're still renting as of now. Our lease is done at the end of Feb, and the rental market in my city is absolutely insane. Every single house seems to have multiple applicants, and we've fallen short on most applications (besides one that was over 30 miles from our jobs) to other people.

Because of this, we feel we need to have a more competitive application - and every landlord we've spoken to has said more money up front (first and lasts, deposit, plus more rent thrown into an escrow account for future months) would make our application music to their ears. 

We finished school with only $38,000 total debt between us both, and over the past year we've neglected our savings to pay that down. We're now at $2,792 total debt and $6,000 savings (allotted half of it to pay down the rest of that debt). $1,260 of that debt is at a 30% APR for an emergency car situation. We hated the 30% obviously, but the situation we were in we had to do it. The rest of the debt is CC debt at a very reasonable interest rate split between two other cards. Essentially, we found a house in a prime location and fits every need we have, and the landlord is willing to go with our application for first and last months rent, security deposit, and the next 2 months rent up front totaling $4,250 ($850 rent, 2 bedroom home, 900 sq. ft). The fact that it's $300 less than our current rent is amazing, and we wanted to downsize a bit anyways.

So my question is really this: Does it make sense to use the savings account to move instead of pay down the debt, and in the coming months of having no rent payment using the incoming funds to pay down the debt instead (virtually having the debt act as our rent payment)? We're having incredible trouble finding a house (our credit is fine, no evictions, great references) and we're at the point where I don't know if we'll find a property unless we actually use this method.

I appreciate any insight!

personalfinance,Why/how did I qualify for the American Opportunity Credit?,"Hello all! I need some assistance regarding a part of my taxes. If any of you could provide any assistance, I'd really appreciate it.

Here's some background:

I'm a 22-year old living in Atlanta. I'm filing using TurboTax. In 2016, I had 3 jobs total - Starbucks, Atlanta Braves and Uber. I've entered my Starbucks W-2. Still waiting on the Braves, so that's not in there. I've entered the amount I made through Uber, but I haven't deducted anything from that job as of yet. In previous years, it's always been a pretty easy filing session as all I've had to do was enter W-2s. Uber has shaken things up a bit.

I came into the education section and that's where things got weird. So I was a student last year and was a half-time student for both the spring and fall semesters. I received a 2016 1098-T (I hadn't received this form since 2013). I entered that information (payments received for qualified tuition and related expenses, scholarships/grants) from the 1098-T and included a $150 deduction for books. (I don't know if this is relevant, but I had to take out loans for school in 2016). TurboTax tells me they're maximizing my education tax break and BOOM, my federal refund shoots from ~$120 to ~$1000. Mind you, this is before entering my other W-2 and any Uber deductions.

Should I be receiving this? I'm going to run through things again and probably another couple of times after that, but I've never received this tax credit. Maybe I wasn't paying attention in previous years? Maybe it's because of the 1098-T or my loans?",finance

One of the first questions that came up about our marriage is if we would like to file jointly (most common) or separately. I went with filing jointly since I thought it would be the easiest route and we would get our taxes done quickly and efficiently. Come to find out at the end of the filing process, we were to get a good federal refund but our GA state bill was over $2k. My wife did not move to Georgia and subsequently work in Georgia until the end of October 2016 and my state W4 and her W4 shows as married but filing at single rate and 0. I at first was in shock but after doing some thinking, I wonder if the GA bill was over $2K because turbotax assumed my wife was working and living in GA the full year (instead of part time) and that therefore she owes the state for the remaining months. Because of this, I believe we should file separately and come next time assuming we still work and live in Georgia, we file jointly. Am I correct in my assessment that because of the situation of her only living in GA part time we should file separately? Either way I'll know tonight when I clear everything and attempt to file ours separately. Thank you for any advice.",finance

Two weeks later I get a call from the bank. The check couldn't be used (it was some type of check specific for a dealership, not the auto company handling the lease). The bank admitted this was their mistake, acknowledging they knew it was for a lease buyout but made a mistake in the loan processing.

Now they want to rectify the situation by having me reapply for a new loan. But they note this will be an additional pull on my credit, lowering the score, and likely increasing my interest rate by about 2%.

personalfinance,Opening a new line of credit Vs. Increasing Credit Limit,"Hello my friends!

Backstory:


I turn 22 in a couple days. I am fresh out of college and landed a good job making decent amount of money. I have now started to pay back my student loans. I took almost a 30 point hit to my credit (Currently 738 Transunion, 735 Equifax). I do a lot of traveling with the SO and I was thinking about getting a Delta skymiles card or something similar to start earning some miles! I got a credit card when I first started college and It has a pretty high Interest rate (because college students are broke) I do get some sort of points back but not sure on the ratio. 

So my question is this:

1. Should I take the small hit on my credit (7-10 points via credit karma simulator)  and get a bigger credit card that I can use for daily use and pay it off monthly?
2. Or should I increase my limit on my current credit card (It is also my oldest line)

I am taking some hits because I am using about 30%ishh on my total available credit. I am super responsible (only when it comes to my credit!) I make double payments on everything a month if that information matters

I technically have 3 cards: 

1. My first Credit card ($500 limit)
2. Rooms To Go account ($3,500 limit)
3. Newegg card ($1,000 limit)

personalfinance,My Federal withholding doubled with pay increase? This can't be right.,"Hi r/PFers,

As the title says, I'm wondering if there's a mistake on my withholdings for this month's paycheck - hoping someone can point me in the right direction. 


Background info: I received a promotion and pay increase of 15.6% which was effective January 1, 2017. My employer pays monthly on the last business day of the month, so today was my first paycheck with the increased rate. However the increase in my take-home pay was not nearly what I had figured it would be after doing some quick post-it math a few weeks ago - it was only about $40 more than my last paycheck. After reviewing my paystubs from December 2016 and January 2017 (today's), I noticed that my federal withholding almost doubled, while all other withholdings (Medicare, SS, state etc) only increased by ~15%, same as my pay increase.


My post-it math assumed a 26% tax rate. After deducting my 401k contributions (same percentage but higher salary), then 26% tax rate, then taking out medical/dental - I arrived at a $544 monthly increase in take-home. My paycheck today has a $40.59 increase. Granted, my post-it math may be off a bit, but it doesn't explain that much of a discrepancy.


I live within my means and am avoiding lifestyle creep, but I'm concerned because I was planning on shoving all of that extra take-home straight into savings, so I can put a huge chunk down on a new-to-me car later this year. Not to mention only receiving a $40 increase in take-home when I've earned a $9k salary increase would be super depressing. I'm gonna be so frustrated if this is legit.


Info:

* Salary was $58,652; as of January 1 I received a 15% increase to $67,500 - so no change in tax bracket
* My employer pays monthly in 12 equal installments, so this is my first check at increased rate
* I did not change any withholdings, 401k contributions, insurance selections, claim more dependents, nothing - all inputs for both pay periods are equal except salary.
* Federal withholding almost doubled, from $534.93 to $1047.43.


Any ideas of a) what caused this, and b) how do I go about fixing it? I've already reviewed with our comptroller who deals with our payroll company, and he didn't know why my federal withholding would double - so he has emailed his contact at the payroll company. Haven't heard back yet.


TL;DR: Received salary increase of just under $9k, however first paycheck at new rate only had $40 increase in take-home. Same tax bracket. No other changes in withholdings, insurance etc. between two pay periods. But federal withholding almost doubled. Why, and how do I fix?",finance
personalfinance,I’ve been paying interest only on my private student loan. Recently did a financial breakdown- looking for advice on anything I could do to improve my budget.,"I recently put together a breakdown of my finances for the first time in awhile. I’ve never really gotten financial advice and was fairly irresponsible in my early 20’s (29, currently). One of my biggest regrets is going to a for-profit school (Art Institute). I started school in April of 2007 and in early 2009 was suddenly told I could no longer take out any loans, so never got a degree. They told me to just put my loans in forbearance which was the only viable solution for me at the time. My loans were originally $31,125 they are now $103,974. I knew nothing about interest and how it works.  
&amp;nbsp;  
While I was in school I was repeatedly told by the financial advisors at my school that my payments would be ‘around $200-300, no more’. I should have sought outside guidance, but I had no direction and chose to trust them (very predatory school and practices, but I got myself into that situation). Regardless, I’ve been paying it back, mostly on a rate reduction program which is slightly more than just paying off the interest. My current private loan payment is $320, but if I stop doing the rate reduction and pay the standard monthly amount it’s around $750. As it stands now I have $473 remaining after all my bills. If I pay the full monthly amount on my private loan, I’ll be left with $43 at the end of the month.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Here is a snapshot of my current finances. Is there a way I could be managing better? How much should I ideally have leftover when all the bill are paid? Any advice is much appreciated.  

**Edit:** Should mention, I'm a full-time graphic design but I do some freelance projects in my spare time, which brings in an additional $100-500/mo. I didn't include it in the budget as it's not steady and some months I just don't have time.

I really would like to refinance it and I found a credit union that would refinance 120% of the car's NADA value. If I buckle down, I can have the car loan at the appropriate amount, if not way lower, by the end of February. However, I literally have nothing in my savings.

The car loan is at $17,150 and the value of the car is $13,625, according to NADA. So, this credit union would refinance up to $16,350 and give me an interest rate of 1.74%, thus bringing my monthly payments down to $260 for 65 months. I really want to get at this point so I can rebuild my savings even quicker. My long-term goal is to move out of my parents' house this year. At the same time, I feel cautious about not having any sort of backup savings. I do have a credit card with a limit of $3500, but that'd have to be a last resort if I do this.

Would it be wise for me to throw extra money at my current car loan so I can refinance soon without having any savings?

Please advise. Thank you!",finance
personalfinance,TSP loan for downpayment to avoid PMI?,"I stumbled on [this series](http://www.tspallocation.com/tsp-loan-guide/) and wanted to see some discussion specific to buying a home.  Specifically, using it to meet 20% down payment to avoid PMI.  Obviously these kinds of questions are situation specific, though I'm asking in a general sense (not buying for years, not sure if I'll got o High or Med/Low COL).  But I'll add some high COL hypotheticals at the end.

Since most people correctly recommend not borrowing against retirement, I'll list the cons first:

 - Missed compounded interest
 - Huge penalties if failure to make payments or lose the job
 - TSP loan interest payments not tax deductible, unlike mortgages 
 - Double Taxation on [interest only](http://www.tspallocation.com/tsp-loan-guide/tsp-loan-guidepart-2-pros-cons-tsp-loans/)
 - Can only take out min(50K, 50% of balance)

What are the potential advantages? Here are the generic ones:

 - Low interest rate (G-fund), which you are paying to yourself instead of a bank.  
  - Just to add a note, this only does a little to offset the missed compound interest
 - Low flat $50 fee
 - No credit check, no credit score impact, does not appear on credit report

What are the mortgage specific tradeoffs? What details affect this?  

 - Housing cost
 - % downpayment
 - Speed of repaying the TSP
 - Mortgage length
 - FHA vs Conventional (vs VA?)
 - Immediately buying out of the PMI via lumped sum?
 - Cost of the PMI
 - Credit Score
 - Length of stay

Hypotheticals to help discussion (though general discussion is encouraged):

 - Excellent credit
 - Stay at house 4-6 years
 - Pay back TSP in 1-2 years
 - **Hypothetical** Options, including moving to that COL and saving for a while:
   - High COL: 1m House: 15% down vs 20% w/ TSP
   - Medium COL: 500k House: 15% down vs 20% w/ TSP

I'm aware the %down is vastly different in amount, as it involves moving and saving in that COL for a while.

Side question: how does this work for Roth TSP?",finance
personalfinance,Refinance Sallie Mae loan,"I recently graduated from a 7 month Trade School for IT (MyComputerCareer.edu). It was $20,000 for equipment, live classes, and certifications. $5,000 of which was loaned through the US Government (Great Lakes) and the other $15,000 from Sallie Mae.

Recently I noticed that my interest on Sallie Mae has gone from 11.75% (only paying $25 a month while in school and 6 months following) to 11.875% (after the first month of full payments), to most recently 12.175%. 

I have no regrets of going to school as it got me the job I have today to afford paying the ridiculous cost of Sallie Mae, but here's my question: is it worth refinancing the Sallie Mae loan to get a lower interest rate?

If you settle this matter today, you may be entitled to get some percentage of deduction on the restitution amount. You will have to send us a promissory note in order to hold your case file from being sent to the court house.

personalfinance,"Receiving a small inheritance, please help (USA)","Hey all,

I am in need of some help with finances. I am about to receive $11,500 as a small inheritance my Grandmother left me before she passed away. Each grandchild is getting the same amount and I will have the money in my account in 3 days. I was thinking of using it to pay off one of my car loans, Car loan 1, because that would cut my monthly payments by $225, which I could then direct towards my student loans. However, because the interest rate is so low, I think it might not be the best use of the money, and that instead I should put it entirely towards my student loan 2 which has the highest interest rate of any of my loans. I have my CC paid off and have a small emergency fund (two months). Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

personalfinance,"To Refinance, or Not to Refinance?","Hey PF, I'm looking at options on my grad school student loans, and I'm hoping you can share your wisdom. Basically, I'm wondering if it makes sense to refinance our mortgage, taking out some of the equity to pay off my student loans, thus rolling the student loans into the mortgage at a lower interest rate than they are at currently.

Approximate numbers:
$100k in a federal consolidation loan at 6.25%

$215k mortgage at about 4%, enough equity to pay the whole student loan

The mortgage has an MCC, so we would likely lose that annual tax benefit and have to repay about $3k that we have received there.

I'm guessing we could refinance at around 4.5% so it would be higher than the current mortgage rate but lower than the student loans.

personalfinance,Trying to understand treasury bills,"Hi all,

I am trying to understand how treasury bills work... for some reason it just isn't clicking with me. I am looking at a US Treasury Note with a 52wk maturity. Here are its attributes, as provided by Vanguard:

* Price: $101.770
* Coupon: 2.625
* Pay frequency: Semiannually
* Yield to worst: 0.839
* Yield to maturity: 0.839
* Face value: $1,000
* Principal: $1,017.70
* Accrued interest: $0.07
* Net amount: $1,017.77

What I am trying to understand is the following:

1. If I were to buy one bond, what would I pay today?
2. What would I receive when the bond matures in 52 weeks?
3. What would happen if the Fed's interest rates were to increase by 0.5% over the next year?

I feel like this should be pretty straight-forward, but I have no experience and no knowledge with treasury bills (or bonds in general, really). 

Thanks in advance for any information.

personalfinance,Offered Settlement of $5k on $40k in private student loans. Am I making the right decision?,"As the title states, I was recently offered a settlement of the approx. $40k I held in private student loans through Navient. The settlement offer is for $5,000, with the understanding that the account is considered paid in full by Navient, reported to credit agencies as settled, and the discharged amount will be considered income for my following year's tax returns.

Assuming my income of $59k annually, plus the added 'income' for 2018's return, I would expect to pay somewhere between $3,500 and $5,000 in additional taxes.

I currently still have ~$30k in federal student loan debt (avg. interest rate of 6.5%) which is considered current and on income based repayment.  I also have a car note for $13k @ 10% interest which I plan to use the funds I was paying the settled loan toward to pay off ~1.5 years sooner than with my current payment.

Would this be considered a risky decision/unwise choice, or am I doing the best thing for my long term future in resolving my debt?",finance
