personalfinance,28% APR car loan plus $2500 fees - is it a scam?,"I’m in my early 20s and when I graduated high school my parents gave me the car I learned to drive in and put it in my name.

That car is 15 years old, has 200k miles, and has cost me $2k in repairs the last year so I’ve been looking to get something newer. I found a very promising 4 year old low mileage Ford at a local large dealership but the only problem is the financing. The car is just under $17k after tax.

They say the only way to get approved is through their guaranteed acceptance program. They give the old car $2500 trade in value but will only give me $1000 of that as a credit since there is a $1500 application fee associated with the loan. In addition the interest rate is 27.99% even after $5k cash down meaning the principal is less than $12k. The payment is $330 monthly for 6 years including $1000 fee for mandatory gap insurance.

This is my first experience with auto financing but frankly it smells like a ripoff. I’m thinking about taking the proposal to my credit union to see if they can do better. The sales person said that a credit union would deny me due to my young age even though I have a record of full time employment.

Any advice? Is this as much of a scam as it seems? What are some good options or should I be walking away from this car and find a different dealership?",finance

personalfinance,Is it a bad idea to open a new credit card to pay tuition?,"So I got into grad school this week. It’s an expensive program and will cost me about $13,000 per semester. The total cost will be about $91,000. I get tuition reimbursement from my employer, which will cover just about one semester each calendar year. With the way it breaks down, my employer will pay $50,000 total, and I am responsible for the other $41,000.

I will be attending classes part time while working full time, so I will have steady income while I am in school. Right now, my concern is how I am going to pay for this first semester. I am waiting to hear back if I qualify for a federal loan, but it’s late in the game so it might not happen. I have enough in my savings to just cover my tuition for the fall, but I don’t feel comfortable wiping away all of savings at once and having almost nothing until my tuition reimbursement hits in January. So my idea is... why don’t I open up a credit card that had 0% interest for the first 12-15 months?

The pros are that I won’t have to drain all of my savings, and I won’t have to have a private loan that will have a higher interest rate than federal loans. I’ll get a card that has a decent intro deal, since I’ll be putting a higher balance on it right away. I’ll slowly chip away during the fall until I get my tuition reimbursement, as opposed to spending all of my savings at once and having no back up funds. I’ll probably have some cash back or travel perks (to use post-covid obviously).

The con is that obviously if something happens and I’m not able to pay back in 12 months when the 0% interest goes away, I’ll have a massive interest rate. Still, I am not worried about this as much since I have enough cash to lower the balance if needed. Plus, I will have the tuition reimbursement coming at the end of the semester.

Also to note, I was living in a city, but due to COVID I moved back to my parents house (I have a parent who is receiving cancer treatment, so I’m back to help around the house). My courses this fall will be online, so I do not intend on moving back out until COVID is better managed, so my monthly expenses at this point are pretty much to cover food for me and my parents. I paid off all of my previous debts and do not carry a balance on my current credit card. I’m saving a lot of money right now by not paying $1500/month in rent.

So, is there something I’m missing about using a credit card to pay for my first semester of grad school? Is this a decent way to get by with 0% interest, or is this a disaster waiting to happen?",finance

personalfinance,Refinance Townhome now to remove equity for future home purchase?,"Background... I own a townhome and like everything else, the market has gone up. I've owned it for 4.5 years. Purchased for 170k and now it's worth 240k. I owe 106k which gives me about a 134k in equity. Loan was a 15yr loan at 3.25% and we put something like 34k down. Payment is about 1200/mo. Rentals go for 1450 right now in this area. 33M married with baby boy on the way. Steady job.

My plan is to eventually rent the townhome when we decide to move or build a house. Timeline is roughly 2-3 years from now. 

My thought was to pull equity out now, refinance to a 20-30yr loan which will lower my payment to give more buffer between rental value and mortgage.  I'd keep at least 20% equity in the townhome to avoid PMI.  

Reasons for pulling equity now:  
1. Lock in really low interest rates on refinance  
2. Have equity and refinance already done so when we're ready to move, that's one less step.  
3. Invest equity for next 2-3 years and gain more money

I've been investing heavily the last few years and that's going really well. The last year I'm currently up 107% on my personal investment account that just crossed over $100k. Between my different accounts I have about 150k of cash available that isn't part of my retirement account. My thought is if I pull out 80k in equity, invest it over the next 2-3 years, at 20% annual return which I get is a pretty high estimate according to the safe 7% average, that could balloon to 135k when I'm ready to purchase.  Am I crazy? 

Side note - If I purchase additional shares of stock I already own, does that reset the clock on if I decide to sell it for longterm or short term capital gains?",finance
personalfinance,DVM education debt - pay or stall,"Hi! 

I am in $250,000+ of debt from undergrad and veterinary school (all federal loans). Yikes, I know. Graduated from vet school last year. This past year I was an intern and made 40k, applied and qualified for income based repayment (pay as you earn) which if I make X amount of payments over 20 or 30 yrs, the rest is forgiven. My payment was about $160 a month but was paused w/ COVID. I have just taken a job earning close to 6 figures so obviously will be expected to pay more. My plans are to get into a residency in the next couple years to specialize. During residency I would make probably around 30k for 3-4 yrs but then would theoretically make quite good money (maybe high 100s to 200k). My question is - is this amount of debt even reasonable to pay off? Do I just pay the bare minimum and plan on that forgiveness? Or do I  pay as much as possible on the principal every paycheck and live frugally until it's paid off? If do not end up specializing and make like 90-100k for the rest of my career, should the plan be different?

If it matters I am almost 28, living in the PNW, single. My credit is not great, just got my first credit card to try to improve it. 

Thanks all!",finance
personalfinance,Our HSA APR is sinking. What are some better emergency fund options?,"Earlier this year, prior to the onset of COVID, my partner and I opened a high yield savings account to hold our six month emergency fund. In the beginning, the APR was set at 1.75%. Now, due to the federal rates dropping to 0, the APR on the account sank to 0.40%. I am not optimistic the APR will increase anytime soon due to the fed announcing their rates will stay near 0 for the foreseeable future. 

While I do appreciate the money being extremely liquid, we are willing to place it into another instrument or investment in order to gain better returns by sacrificing liquidity. We are also willing to take on a low amount of risk. 

What are our options other than these HYSAs are offering low APR right now? What are you guys doing?

personalfinance,Pay mortgage down or invest?,"I have around $100k in savings and I've been putting off investing it because I really felt like the market was in a big bubble. I know I shouldn't try to time the market but I'm 45yo and didn't want to lose it. I also struggle with depression and anxiety, it can be debilitating but I have managed it pretty well over the past few years. 

I recently moved $40k in to an account that my investor is managing. I think he's going to buy some different stocks over the next six months. I don't know, that's what I pay him for. 

I have a mortgage where I owe about $100k. It's a 20 year loan at 3.5% interest rate. I'm about 14 months into it. I'm trying to decide if I should pay $40k towards the principle or invest it. Or should I refinance to 10 years at 2.3%? The refinance will cost around $4500 so it's hard to say which is the better option? I also want to have at least 2 years worth of bills in case things go bad with the economy. That's somewhere around $24k if I include things like utilities and insurance.

My goal is to have no debt when I'm 50 but it's looking more like 55. I work in IT and ageism is a real concern. I want to be able to pay my bills and have some money left over,  even if I'm a greeter at Costco.",finance

stocks,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning August 3rd, 2020","Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading month ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 3rd, 2020.

# **Earnings and fiscal debate could be catalysts for stocks in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/31/the-jobs-report-and-congressional-politics-may-matter-more-for-markets-than-earnings-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; The market could lose some of its exuberance in the week ahead as the calendar turns to August, and investors await Friday’s July employment report and keep their eyes on Washington.
*****
&gt; The focus will also be squarely on politicians, as Congress struggles to find a middle ground on a new fiscal spending package and decide the fate of the $600 a week unemployment supplement that was set to expire July 31. Former vice president Joe Biden is also expected to name his running mate in the coming week.
*****
&gt; The jobs data will be crucial, particularly since the number of people filing for unemployment benefits has been edging higher, instead of falling back, as expected. According to Refinitiv, about 1.36 million new jobs are expected, well below the 4.8 million added in June, and the unemployment rate is expected to fall to 10.7% from 11.1%.
*****
&gt; Trading around the report could be volatile, since some economists expect more than 2 million jobs were added, and some even see flat or negative payrolls.
*****
&gt; Stocks have done well for the month of July, with the S&amp;P 500 finishing at 3,271, a gain of 5.5%. The Nasdaq has performed the best, rising 6.8% for the month to 10,745, after a 3.7% gain for the past week.
*****
&gt; “August has traditionally been a challenging month for investors,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. The market is entering what historically has been the worst two months for stocks.
*****
&gt; According to Stovall, the S&amp;P 500 has been higher in August 53% of the time, and its average move is a gain of just 0.01%, going back to World War II. September is worse, down 0.51% on average, and up just 48% of the time.
*****
&gt; In presidential election years, however the odds for August gains are better, as it rose 63% of the time and 73%, when the incumbent is up for re-election.
*****
&gt; There are also about 120 S&amp;P 500 companies reporting earnings, but the big earnings show for markets was this past week when four of the five biggest tech giants all reported Thursday afternoon. Three of those stocks — Apple, Amazon and Facebook — surged, helping Nasdaq outperform Friday with a more than 1.5% gain.
*****
&gt; # Earnings scorecard
&gt; “We’re only a month into the reporting period, and things are going to become less and less important from an earnings perspective,” said Stovall. “I think investors are sort of disappointed in that the bar was set so low for second quarter earnings that expectations were that we were going to see a lot of companies beat, which we have. But we were also going to see a gradual uplift of earnings expectations for forward quarters. We’re not seeing that.”
*****
&gt; Eighty-two percent of the companies reporting so far have beaten estimates, well above the average 65%, according to Refinitiv. The earnings decline is now looking closer to 33% from an initial 40%, and tech, which has been leading the market is one of the best performers. Profits for the sector now look to be up 1.4%, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.
*****
&gt; Because the tech names have contributed so much to market gains, their earnings were an important test for the market, and they didn’t disappoint. But they didn’t manage to pull up the whole market very far on Friday.
*****
&gt; Among the names reporting in the coming week are a diverse group, including Disney, ViacomCBS, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Berkshire Hathaway, AIG, Clorox, and Wayfair, to name a few.
*****
&gt; # Politics now in play
&gt; “The earnings story is over. My call had been once we had gotten through the earnings season, we would be more vulnerable to a sustainable pullback,” said Barry Knapp, Ironside Macroeconomics managing partner and director of research. “Obviously, it’s volatility season, but it’s also an election year. ... We’re more vulnerable to that next week and earnings won’t hold us up.”
*****
&gt; Knapp said if President Donald Trump and Republicans do not begin to perform better in the polls by Labor Day, the market is likely to focus on what a Democratic win would mean for taxes and regulation. That could be a negative for stocks.
*****
&gt; “If he hasn’t made headway by then, it’s likely he’s done.That’s about the point when things become pretty set in stone. The market will presume that’s the case,” Knapp said.
*****
&gt; The politics of the stimulus package could also reverberate through markets, until it looks like the Senate Republicans and House Democrats can find common ground.
*****
&gt; The two sides look to be at a standoff, but an agreement is still expected in early August. The market is particularly watching to see what happens with the enhanced unemployment benefits. Republicans have proposed cutting it to $200, but Democrats support keeping it.
*****
&gt; # The economy
&gt; Cutting the size of the payments back might be good for the labor market and persuade more workers to return to work, some strategists say. However, there is also concern that the funding has helped stimulate the economy and keep the unemployed from defaulting on loans and payments. Consumer spending on goods in June was even higher than last year, and that was also seen as getting a lift from stimulus.
*****
&gt; Besides the jobs report, there are other important data like ISM manufacturing on Monday. There are also monthly vehicle sales Monday, and ISM nonmanufacturing data Wednesday.
*****
&gt; “I think the macro data is going to be fine next week,” said Knapp. “I’m not in the camp that thinks the payroll number is going to be negative.”
*****
&gt; NatWest Markets economist Kevin Cummins is one of the economists who expects the jobs gains to be much smaller than the past two months. He expects the payrolls to come in at just 200,000. “You look at jobless claims, and you see a stalling out,” he said. “The Fed is right. There is significant downside risk to the economy.”
*****
&gt; # A trade to watch
&gt; Treasury yields, in the 2-year to 7-year range, fell to new lows in the past week. The 10-year yield, not yet at a record low, was also falling and was at 0.53% Friday. At the same time, the dollar was down more than 1% on the week and 4% for the month.
*****
&gt; Gold was a beneficiary of the lower interest rates, weaker dollar trade, rising about 5% for the week and 10% for the month.
*****
&gt; Strategist say investors are reacting to super-low interest rates, concerns about the economy, and the possibility that huge government spending will send inflation higher.
*****
&gt; Investors are also jumping into inflation-protected bonds. According to Refinitiv’s Lipper, inflation-protected bond funds took in $271 million of net new money for the fund-flows week ended July 29, the sixth week of gains. About $1 billion went into the SPDR Gold Shares ETF, (GLD) in the last week, Lipper said.
*****
&gt; During this time period, the Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities funds recorded their two best weekly net inflows ever with increases of $1.9 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, for the fund-flows weeks of June 24 and July 1.
*****
&gt; Lipper said investors started to put money into TIPS funds in the middle of the second quarter, and the flows have been . net positive in 11 out of 13 weeks since the beginning of May. This its second-worst quarterly net outflows ever as oil prices slumped in the first quarter.
*****
&gt; “I think this is going to be a much more inflationary decade. It will start out slowly. [Fed Chairman Jerome] Powell is right that more forces are putting downward pressure on inflation at present. But the market looks past that,” said Knapp. “The big story in 2021 will be the recovery of inflation. You’re already seeing it in import prices.”

&gt; # August: Top NASDAQ &amp; Russell 2000 Month of Election Years

&gt; August is amongst the worst months of the year. It is the worst DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 month over the last 32 years, 1988-2019 with average declines ranging from 0.1% by NASDAQ to 1.1% by DJIA.

&gt; Contributing to this poor performance since 1987; the second shortest bear market in history (45 days) caused by turmoil in Russia, the Asian currency crisis and the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund debacle ending August 31, 1998 with the DJIA shedding 6.4% that day. DJIA dropped a record 1344.22 points for the month, off 15.1%—which is the second worst monthly percentage DJIA loss since 1950. Saddam Hussein triggered a 10.0% slide in August 1990. The best DJIA gains occurred in 1982 (11.5%) and 1984 (9.8%) as bear markets ended. Sizeable losses in 2010, 2011, 2013 and 2015 of over 4% on DJIA have widened Augusts’ average decline.

&gt; However, in election years since 1950, Augusts’ rankings improve: #6 DJIA, #5 S&amp;P 500, #1 NASDAQ (since 1971), #1 Russell 1000 and #1 Russell 2000 (since 1979). This year, the market’s performance in August will likely depend heavily on how July closes and whether or not the rate of covid-19 infection continues to accelerate which could force some areas to roll back reopenings.

&gt; # August’s First Trading Day Bearish Last 23 Years

&gt; From the Stock Trader’s Almanac 2020 (page 88), it is known that the first trading days of each month combined gain nearly as much as all other days combined. However, the first trading day of August does not contribute to this phenomenon ranking worst among other First Trading Days in the 2020 Almanac. In the past 23 years DJIA has risen just 30.4% (up 7, down 16) of the time on the first trading day of August. Average and median losses are on the mild side due to a few sizable advances. Over the past nine years, DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have both declined nine times.

&gt; # S&amp;P 500 Stronger Underneath the Surface

&gt; Earlier today we posted a chart showing S&amp;P 500 sector performance since the Nasdaq's recent peak on 7/20 when Technology stocks began what has now been a 10-day period of consolidation. Below we have updated these performance numbers to include today's moves. While not as many sectors remain in positive territory, the majority of sectors continue to outperform the S&amp;P 500, while Technology drags the market lower. Along with Technology, Communication Services, and Consumer Discretionary are the only other sectors that have lagged the S&amp;P 500, and their performance has been dragged down by the mega-cap tech-like stocks of Alphabet (GOOGL), Facebook (FB), and Amazon (AMZN).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/073020-Sector-Performance.png))**

&gt; Expanding on this theme of underlying strength in the index, the chart below shows the average performance of stocks in the S&amp;P 500 grouped by sector. On an equal-weighted basis, the S&amp;P 500 is actually up 1.3% since 7/20, and only two sectors (Technology and Materials) have seen negative average returns. On the upside, Real Estate (4.1%) has been the big winner followed by Consumer Discretionary (3.3%), and Consumer Staples (2.2%). The fact that Consumer Discretionary at the cap-weighted sector level is down over 1.4% while the average performance of stocks in the sector has been a gain of 3.3% illustrates what a mammoth impact AMZN has on that sector.

&gt; Breadth among S&amp;P 500 stocks has also been overwhelmingly positive. For the S&amp;P 500 as a whole, 59% of stocks in the index have had positive returns since the close on 7/20. Only two sectors (Technology and Materials) have seen fewer than half of their components post positive returns over that time, while Real Estate, Consumer Staples, and Utilities have seen roughly three-quarters of their components rally since 7/20.

&gt; # Bullish Earnings Season So Far

&gt; At our Earnings Explorer tool available to clients on our website, we provide a real-time look at beat rates for both EPS and sales. Below is a snapshot from the website showing both the EPS and sales beat rates for US companies reporting earnings on a rolling 3-month basis. Currently, 64.61% of companies have exceeded consensus analyst EPS estimates over the last three months, while 63.75% of companies have beaten consensus sales estimates over the same time frame.

&gt; In looking at the chart, you can see a big spike in the EPS beat rate over the last few weeks. Since earnings season began on July 13th, nearly 80% of companies have posted stronger than expected EPS numbers. That's a huge beat rate and suggests that analysts were too bearish on Q2 numbers heading into July. The revenue beat rate held up much better than EPS beats throughout the first half of 2020, but it too is on the upswing this season.

&gt; We also monitor how share prices are reacting to earnings reports. So far this earnings season, the average stock that has reported Q2 numbers has gained 1.31% on its earnings reaction day. That compares to a historical average one-day change of just 0.06% on earnings reaction days. As shown below, stocks that have beaten EPS estimates this season have gained 2.2% on earnings reaction days, while companies that have missed EPS estimates have fallen 1.89%. It's rare to see beats gaining more than misses decline, but that's what is happening this season.

&gt; # China Running Away YTD

&gt; Every Wednesday, we publish our Global Macro Dashboard which provides a high-level summary of market and economic data of some of the world's largest economies. Of the 23 stock markets tracked, just six including the US are positive year to date at the moment (in local currency). In the chart below we show the YTD performance of these six countries as well as the global median in 2020. As shown, even though it was actually the first to tip into the green YTD following the global sell-off in February and March very briefly back in early June, the US is up the least of this group with a YTD gain of 0.4%. China's stock market is up the most at +14%. Taiwan, South Korea, South Africa, and Malaysia are also outperforming the US but are up more modestly than China with the best of these, Taiwan, gaining 4.53% this year. Meanwhile, the median country in our Global Macro Dashboard remains down 6.2% YTD.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/072920-GMD-ytd.png))**

&gt; Given it is up the most on a year to date basis, China has also gained the largest share of global equity market cap in 2020. As shown in the table below, China has gained 1.7 percentage points of global market cap in 2020 and now takes up 10.14%. China now joins the US as the only other country with a double-digit share of total world market cap. Despite this, China has actually lost share since the bear market lows on 3/23. Meanwhile, the US, Germany, Canada, India, South Korea, and Australia have all gained a significant share since 3/23.

&gt; # Do the Top 5 Stocks Pose a Risk to the Market?

&gt; Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Facebook. These five stocks have helped spawn a number of acronyms as they try to capture the rise of mega-cap tech stocks that have led the market higher for much of the past decade. The average return for those five stocks so far this year has been a gain of more than 30%, while the broad S&amp;P 500 Index is just marginally positive, at 0.4% through July 30.

&gt; While many other areas of the market have remained largely static, the total market value of these stocks has dramatically increased, making them an increasingly large piece of market cap-weighted indexes such as the S&amp;P 500. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the combined weight of the top five stocks in the S&amp;P 500 has increased to its highest level ever, at nearly 22%. Only one of those five stocks (Microsoft) was a top five name in the index during the previous peak of March 2000.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7.31.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; But does this pose a risk to the index? From a diversification standpoint, one could certainly argue it does. For instance, if any shared risks should come up, from regulation, for example, it could do outsized damage to cap-weighted indexes. However, we believe that the recent gains have been justified by the fundamentals, and we continue to favor both large caps over small caps, and growth-style stocks over value stocks. According to analysis from Credit Suisse, over the past 12 months, the top five stocks in the index have grown revenues at 11.2% vs. just 0.8% for the rest of the S&amp;P 500. Further, the remainder of the S&amp;P 500 has subtracted roughly $17 from S&amp;P 500 earnings per share (EPS), while the top five stocks have added more than $12.

&gt; Finally, while these stocks have been the face of the recent “stay-at-home trend” and may be more insulated from broader economic weakness, they are far from the only stocks making money this year. On July 30, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index hit a new all-time high and is now up more than 15% year-to-date.

&gt; “After a huge run, many of these top stocks may be due for a pause,” said LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “However, looking out over the next 6 to 12 months, we believe that investors will continue to place a premium on companies that are able to organically grow sales, especially in a low-growth environment.”

&gt; In this piece, we will focus on the view that Bitcoin is an aspirational store of value. We explore the inherent characteristics that position Bitcoin to fulfill this role in the future, consider whether it is being used in this way today, and discuss factors that may drive greater demand for such utility.

**Bitcoin’s digital scarcity**
&gt; A robust store of value asset retains purchasing power over long periods of time. An emerging store
of value grows purchasing power until it stabilizes. The key characteristics that are cited in reference
to good stores of value are scarcity, portability, durability and divisibility. The most important of these
attributes is arguably scarcity, which is essential for protecting against the depreciation of real value in
the long run. Scarcity means there is a limited quantity of the asset in question, more cannot be easily
created, and it is impossible to counterfeit. 

&gt; One of bitcoin’s most novel innovations is
its unforgeable digital scarcity. Investors
believe this property is foundational in
understanding and appreciating bitcoin.

&gt; The bitcoin supply is perfectly inelastic and is not susceptible to supply shocks. Supply does not
respond to changes in production capacity (i.e. greater hash power) in response to heightened
demand driving prices higher. Even gold, which has been used as a store of value for millennia, is not
immune to supply shocks. While the ability for increased production in response to an increase in
demand is limited, gold is not perfectly inelastic.

**Decentralized checks and balances**
&gt; Bitcoin’s monetary policy was established when it was created. Its credibility is enforced in part by
decentralization and proof-of-work mining. Bitcoin has a leaderless network of decentralized full
nodes (computers running bitcoin software), in which every node stores the ledger of transactions
and performs transaction verification independently, checking that rules are being followed. Because
of this redundancy, there is no central point of failure. Full nodes that verify transactions are distinct
from miners who expend energy to process transactions and mint bitcoin. Unlike mining, transaction
verification does not require significant resources in the form of hardware or electricity. Thus, any computer can join the distributed network to
store and verify bitcoin transactions. Today tens
of thousands of nodes perform this function.

&gt; In addition to preventing transactions that don’t follow consensus rules, the level of decentralization
that exists in the bitcoin network protects core properties such as the 21 million fixed supply by making
it virtually impossible to change. No central party has sole discretion over bitcoin’s monetary policy.
Rather, such a change would require significant social coordination among stakeholders (e.g. users,
miners and those running full nodes). Most stakeholders believe bitcoin has value because of its digital
scarcity, resulting in negligible support for such a change

**DEMAND DRIVERS**
&gt; Investors believe that the next wave of awareness and adoption could be driven by external factors
such as unprecedented levels of intervention by central banks and governments, record low interest
rates, increasing fiat money supply, deglobalization and the potential for ensuing inflation, all of which
have been accelerated by the pandemic and economic shutdown.
Longer-term tailwinds that could fuel adoption include the use of bitcoin to preserve wealth amidst
“slow and steady” inflation and the looming generational wealth transfer to millennials, who view
bitcoin more favorably than other demographics.

**Current interest in bitcoin’s store of value properties**
&gt; Tudor Investment Corporation’s decision to allocate to bitcoin in the Tudor BVI fund is evidence
that unprecedented levels of monetary growth is driving institutional interest in bitcoin’s store of
value properties. Paul Tudor Jones, founder and Chief Investment Officer, and Lorenzo Giorgianni, Head of Global Research articulated the rationale for investing in bitcoin in their May 2020 investor
letter, “The Great Monetary Inflation.” The Tudor Investments team scored financial assets, fiat cash,
gold and bitcoin based on four characteristics that define store of value assets – purchasing power,
trustworthiness, liquidity, portability. Bitcoin’s score was 60% of the score of financial assets, but
1/1200th of the market cap of financial assets and it was 66% of the score of gold, but 1/60th of the
market cap, concluding, “Something appears to be wrong here and my guess is that it’s the price of
Bitcoin.” While many have
expressed the same reasoning,
this was seen as a watershed
moment, given the thesis
and investment was from a
traditional hedge fund manager/
legendary macro investor (Paul
Tudor Jones) and former Deputy
Director of the Strategy, Policy
and Review Department at the
IMF (Lorenzo Giorgianni)ix.

**Conclusion**

&gt; Bitcoin’s inherent properties have given rise to the perspective that bitcoin has the potential to be a
store of value, with complementary and interdependent components – the decentralized settlement
network (Bitcoin) and its digitally scarce native asset (bitcoin). Equally important is the consideration
of demand for bitcoin’s unique features – there is no long-term value to create or store if there is no
sustained demand for these properties. 

&gt; External forces that are accelerating
interest and investment in bitcoin include
unprecedented levels and exotic forms
of monetary and fiscal stimulus globally
with unknown consequences. This is
exacerbating the concerns that Bitcoin was
designed to address and is leading more
investors and users towards bitcoin as an
“insurance policy” that may provide protection against the unknown consequences. Simultaneously,
the massive transfer of wealth from the older generation to a younger demographic is a more gradual
but important long-term tailwind, as younger people view bitcoin more favorably. This is an important
catalyst for bitcoin adoption as they inherit and grow their wealth.
While bitcoin is not guaranteed to succeed as a store of value, should sustainable long-term demand
for the use case not materialize, the tailwinds mentioned above should drive incremental demand 
&gt; for a novel asset with unique properties. Additionally, as we will examine in future parts in our bitcoin
investment thesis series, Bitcoin’s strength is that it has properties that allow it to serve multiple
functions, further hardening the likelihood of its success as measured by growth in value.",finance

personalfinance,20k saved: buy a car or put towards mortgage principal?,"My wife and I are going to have around 20k saved soon. She wants to buy a car. I want to refinance our house with it. 

We live in NC but want to move to AZ in the next five years or so. I believe putting it into our house will help us get there sooner bc we’ll have more equity to put towards the new house, and bc we might have enough equity to ditch the PMI on our current house which would also help us save up. We might even be able to lower our interest rate.

She says the car is a “need” because we have three kids and a dog. I admit we can’t fit everyone into one vehicle when we go to the beach, visit her family, etc. I still say it’s a “want” bc both our vehicles are paid off and running fine.

I have zero debt, but she has $160k of debt (IRS, student loans, credit cards, etc.) The average interest rate across these is 6%.

I own a $350k home outright, and other than that have $30k in investments. Once we get married, I'm considering taking out a home equity loan against the house in order to consolidate all this debt.

Obviously, having a lien against the home is not ideal. However, the way I'm thinking of it, it would basically be like we are two early 30 year olds with zero debt other than a mortgage, which is a pretty normal or even good situation to be in.

It would be a 10 year home equity loan (to get a lower interest rate), and the goal would be to pay it off earlier than that. However, it feels like it would be good peace of mind to have 1 payment we know we can make rather than all these little payments at various interest rates. Additionally, the IRS would be paid off and off our backs.

vet,"Foster kittens have repeated vomiting and watery diarrhea, but fecal tests keep coming back negative","tl;dr - at 5 weeks of age, 2 of my 5 foster kittens started having liquid, light yellow diarrhea then would go vomit - they would do this 3 times until there was nothing left in the system. They were treated with karo syrup on the gums (to increase blood sugar) and formula (to rehydrate and get them some nutrients). My 9-year old cat then caught it (manifested as 5 days of not eating very much, culminating in explosive diarrhea and vomiting). He was treated with karo, syringe fed wet food/pedialyte mixture, and SubQ fluids. Over the next 4 days he slowly regained his appetite and is now back to normal. Now the kittens are 8 weeks and it has all happened again. 2 new kittens are sick, as well as one of the original kittens. Fecal test showed nothing.

What is wrong with my kittens?!

Part 1: My friend adopted a kitten from the shelter I foster for. The day after they adopted him he started having liquid, yellow diarrhea and vomiting (vomiting could happen right before or right after the diarrhea, but they always came in pairs). The vet treated with adrenaline and for the 24-hours after treatment he would be fine (eating, more solid poop, playful, etc). The vet also said they saw coccidia in the stool, but not enough to cause the symptoms and that the kitten could pass that amount. After the 24-hr acting adrenaline wore off, the kitten would be back to diarrhea and vomiting. This repeated for a full week, and with so many vet visits and a kitten loosing weight, they returned the kitten to the shelter. After 5 days, the shelter called them back and asked if they wanted to re-adopt since the kitten had recovered.

Part 2: I start fostering five 2-week old kittens and their mom. Mom and kittens are isolated from my cat for 2-weeks. I got some of the things from my friend with the sick kitten, but cleaned the plastic things with ResCue disinfectant and washed the fabric things in the washer with detergent and white vinegar (but without bleach). Kittens had some diarrhea, but more like soft serve than liquid. Had them checked but there was nothing in the poop. They were treated with metronidazole and given Fortiflora for their food, just in case. At 4 weeks they had their first immunizations in the shelter (this was on a Monday), were treated with Strongid and Ponazuril. We saw hookworms in their stool a couple days later. On Saturday, the two girl kittens started having liquid diarrhea (yellow and smelled absolutely horrendous) and would vomit thereafter. Both were extremely lethargic and weak. We had to treat with karo and formula. After 12 hours, both kittens had fully recovered and the only way you could tell they were sick was that they had lost weight.

Part 3: My 9-year old, up-to-date-on-everything cat started picking at his food, and he usually gobbles it all down. We monitored him over the next 3 days and he continued to pick at it, so I took him in to the vet on Wednesday (not the shelter). They treated him with SubQ, Strongid, and Ponzauril. Thursday he was no better, still snubbing his food, so I took him in again to get more SubQ fluids and they gave him an anti-nausea medicine. Friday he started having liquid diarrhea and Friday night he vomited soooooo much. All of his food and a couple small hairballs. We syringe fed him wet food/pedialyte and gave SubQ to keep him hydrated. Over the next few days he started to increasingly act like himself and after 4 days he was back to 100%. (This took place when the kittens were 6-7 weeks old.)

Part 4: On Tuesday, at 7-weeks the kittens went back to the shelter for their second round of vaccines, FIV/FELV test, and Advantage treatment. Friday night we started to see some liquid yellow poop again and have identified two new kittens who are being affected, and one of the previously affected kittens. I took in another stool sample, but they did not see anything. They are concerned that there was too little sample and I was told to use a non-absorbant plastic litter to try to catch more. The kittens are doing much better even when sick, since they are so much larger. They still have appetite and play.

What in the world is happening to these kittens? I want them healthy before they get adopted next week.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,My recent experience shopping for a mortgage,"I'm buying a home right now and thought I'd share my story just in case someone else can benefit from reading.

Since mortgage terms vary depending on these types of factors, I'll give some background: I'm buying a home for $355k with 20% down from the sale of my previous home. My income is above the six figure mark and I have an excellent credit score.  Since I had to stretch to afford 20%, I was not looking to buy any points, and I have too many expenses to afford a 15 year loan (I have 4 kids and my wife is a full-time mom).

I did a few things to get started. I asked for mortgage terms from my credit union where I'd already been pre-approved, I reached out to a mortgage broker a friend recommended, and I signed up with LendingTree. Others may disagree, but I don't recommend LendingTree.  You immediately get bombarded with high volume brokers who try to steamroll you through their process.  Among them, the one I ended up talking to was Rocket Mortgage (Quicken Loans).

My credit union offers the same terms to everyone, and you either qualify or you don't.  The interest rate they offered (3.375%) was decent but had recently climbed. Their fees were low.  The local broker offered me 3.25% with similar fees.  The Rocket Mortgage agent offered me 3.625% and acted like they were doing me a favor.  I told them I had another offer at 3.25%.  The lady then tapped on her keyboard for a minute and said she could offer me 3.25%, but she would have to get it approved and she wouldn't give me a fee sheet.  Already I didn't want to work with RM, but she offered me $200 less in fees than the competition.  

I called my local lender and she said she'd offer a lender credit of $200 to match the RM offer.  Then she offered me something that made her offer stand out - she said I could add a float down to the contract for no charge.  This would mean that, if the rate dropped by at least 0.25% at any time within 15 days of closing, I could accept the lower rate.  I signed up with her.

She called me yesterday and said she could execute the float down and give me a 3% rate!   In the end, just to show the difference between what I ended up with and what I would have got if I went with the first offer from RM, the difference in my monthly mortgage payment is nearly $150!

Please shop around and make others compete for your money! It's worth the effort!  And ask about a float down! No guarantees there, but I felt great when mine worked out!",finance

personalfinance,Another car finance post from someone who should have known better. Any advice appreciated,"Hi all. A few years ago I got in a bind. I live in LA.  My credit was bad, I had no cash, my car died and I was going to lose my job if I couldn't drive to work. My friend took me to a dealer friend of his. I knew I was going to get mugged, but I really had no other option that I knew of at the time. He 'called his friend' at Wells Fargo in front of me and said we were financing through them.  I signed the paperwork. I expected to be mugged like I said, but what I didn't know was it was really going to be financed by some other company and I don't remember seeing 18% on the papers but maybe I just didn't want to see it. 

So...I was given a signature loan.  I drive a 2010 Toyota RAV4 with 130K miles. The original balance was $12,168  The interest is 18%. That is not a typo. I have so far paid $3785 in the last 2 years, 7 months. I have a remaining balance of $8383. I kept up my payments even though I was homeless at one point and they were late a lot. I built myself back up and I work 7 days a week, 13 hrs a day most days, as a care manager for seniors. I don't make a lot of money, but I can make my $315 monthly payment and I have job security until I crack from the stress. This company has never reported me late, but they hit me for late fees all the time when I was struggling and they say I have a big late fee balance separate from the numbers I already listed. I didn't ask how much because I'm already sick to my stomach. 

But this car is tired. I have 29 months left at this ridiculous rate and the man at the finance company says the $12,168 was before interest so even if I start making big payments I still have the full 8k to go. I have tried to look into refinancing but nobody will touch a ten year old car for that. Is there anything I can do to fix this situation? I feel like I could go and buy a new car for a lower rate and lower payment, couldn't I? Or maybe not. I really don't know. My credit score is 672 according to Wells Fargo and 689 according to one of my credit card's credit summary, but Wallet Hub still calls it 603.  I think that might go up in a few days though, when July gets reported. I don't want to just walk away from this loan. I also don't want still be making payments while I watch this car get towed to the junkyard. I told the loan rep I don't see the point in continuing with the loan and he said they would think about lowering the interest rate. But would that even help me at all? Can I trade it in? Would anybody take an upside down car? It's not worth what I owe. Thank you for any helpful advice. I already know I'm an idiot. No research needed on that aspect.",finance

personalfinance,Bridge loan for house purchase to cover gap in employment?,"Follow-up to my post yesterday about receiving notice of future lay-off in the midst of house purchase.

[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/i1jcbg/notified_of_upcoming_layoff_2_weeks_before/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

In short, we’re two weeks away from closing on a house. My husband was given notice by his company that his department is being consolidated and his employment will end in January ( and then he’s receive severance through May). We have enough cash savings to live off of for 3+ years (incl. mortgage payments) without income plus additional retirements funds.

We informed our lender (per the new Covid documents that require disclosure of this). Obviously, they are not keen to give us the loan without expected continued employment. The lender gave us an option to do a bridge type loan now to close the house deal, with a plan to refinance into a conventional mortgage when we have sufficient income again. We still want to buy the house for a myriad of personal reasons, but want to make sure we fully understand this two-loan option first. 

Considerations: 
-we get the house and can be settled in before school starts again vs our family of 4 living in my parents basement for months.

-the initial loan is for 1 year at 3.75% interest, would have to buy 1 point. Interest only payments, so no payment towards the principle. Term can be extended in three month increments with 1/4 fees charged again.No prepayment penalty.

- when we apply for the conventional loan, we’ll be subject to whatever interest rates are at that time.

- employment is a bit uncertain with Covid, but we expect one (or both) of us to be able to find a job with income to qualify for the loan within a year. If not, we could extend the initial loan. Worst case scenario, we can’t find a job within 2-3 years, we sell the house.

What else should we take into consideration? Any hidden issues with these bridge loans? Something we’re not taking into account?

The thing is, they are also very controlling. They come every two weeks, even when I tell them not to, and barge into the space that I live in. The whole process of anticipating their arrival is agonizing for me because I know they will begin to pester me about all the same shit like I was in highschool- for them, they just can't let go of me. They can't accept the fact that I'm an individual person, and because of our culture, the adults don't typically respect the child and that the child must always obey the adult. They don't respect my space to the point where they will even read/open all the mail addressed to me without my permission. Normally, I wouldn't care because I rarely get mail, but they take my statement from me without telling me. They monitor my credit card habits, yell at me for things I buy (these purchases are rare, about once or twice a month and don't go beyond 20 bucks), and threaten to take my card away. First, I changed the mailing address to my apartment location so they couldn't have access to it, but then when they came over, they demanded to see my statements. They check the mail thoroughly, so I can't take it before they see it, they'll realize it's gone. I'm sick of it. I've decided to get a savings account secretly and move my money from my debit account to there. I currently have about 2,800 dollars that I need to move. I'm just going to dump it all in one go, take the statement saying the money was transferred, and tuck it away (they won't notice, not with all of their focus on the family business as of late)

On the Wells Fargo site, there are two options that are open to me: Way2Save and Platinum Savings- for someone like me, who don't be getting any more income starting on the 14th of this August, which option should I choose? Is it worth paying the fee for Platinum when I can't reach the 3,500 minimum daily balance because of the interest rate and APY?

What is not included here is _indirect_ taxes or, in the case of a W2, taxes paid by the employer on your behalf. 

I can see where employer taxes are debatable.  It's much more concrete when you're self employed obviously.

Indirect taxes are hard to quantify. For example, if I buy a shirt at Walmart, the shirt costs a bit more because of the various taxes involved in manufacturering and sales and transportation. And the inputs to the shirt have taxes and so on in a very long recursion. I am obviously indirectly paying these taxes but how much???

personalfinance,Tips for getting out of debt &amp; grow net worth,"I'm currently \~$30K in cc debt, which is a little under 30% my annual (gross) salary. During the years while I was racking up debt, I lived quite frivolously without saving a penny.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the past few months, I've:

* Contacted all creditors to ask for a lower interest rate
* Stopped using all of my credit cards entirely, shifting all purchases to debit only
* Been paying significantly more than the minimums on all cards; taking the avalanche method
* Restricted my budget to necessary items only such as groceries and household supplies (COVID has definitely helped me completely halt all unnecessary spending)

&amp;#x200B;

While I pay down debt, I would like to build up my net worth. My savings account is currently below the amount that would cover 6 months of expenses. I have about $600 each month that I can save or invest; should all of this go into savings until it reaches the equivalent of 6 months of expenses or start investing as well? Do you have any additional tips for paying down debt that I've missed?

I signed out of my main account to make sure I can still sign back in and I even uninstalled and reinstalled the app a few times just to make sure.

I know I will only be living in the house for about 6yrs. If I know I will sell the house in 6yrs, and assuming nothing catastrophic happens and the value of the house stays the same maybe even increases slightly over time, is it still worth paying extra every month to pay down the principal faster whether it’s through a shorter loan period or just paying more than what I owe every month?

I’m looking to purchase a car that I’ll need to borrow about 14000$ in order to pay it in full. I just don’t understand how it works in terms of paying back and doing monthly payments to a line of credit. 

For example, let’s say at a dealership they offer you the finance option for 36 months at 400$ @3.99%. I understand that they calculate it as the total amount of your loan and determine the interest after 3 years. After 3 years of 400$ you pay off the car, it’s fixed, simple and easy..

If I borrow 14,000$ from my line of credit instead @3.45% how does that work in terms of my monthly payments? I don’t understand how it works... the dealership seems simpler because you’re paying a pre set fixed amount. Why am I so confused here? Any help? How much would I be paying monthly for the line of credit? I’m so confused :(.

personalfinance,Paying Down Principal on Mortgage vs Investing,"I just refinanced my mortgage to a 15-year fixed rate conventional at 2.625% (2.723% APR).  I've seen comments that state you shouldn't pay a cent over your monthly payment in today's climate since mortgage interest rates are well below what you could expect to earn by investing the money over the life of the loan.

For example, if I assume a 6% annual return on an S&amp;P 500 index fund, it's obviously way higher than the 2.625% interest rate on my mortgage.  But the total interest percentage (TIP) on my mortgage is 21.242%.  What rates should I be comparing when making this decision.

For my scenario, with the way I budget (50/30/20), I have about $6,000 I can pay down on the first payment of my refinance after it closes (extra paycheck in July + cashback from refinance).  Should I do ahead and pay down my mortgage or would it wiser for me to stick this in an index fund in my portfolio.

personalfinance,Europe: buying a vacation house - what should I ask myself?,"Hello.

Sorry, this is a throw-away account -- I don't want to expose the following to people who know me here and my original account shares the same nickname across other social media services.

Here is the situation. My wife and I are 40 y/o. We are both from Russia, living on a permanent residence permit in a European country. I am working as a software developer in a niche field with quite stable outlook for the next 5-ish years and quite decent pay. We've got 3 kids, all in kindergarten (pre-school) age. I am working, my wife is working with the kids the whole day at home, at least for the time being (otherwise, she was working as a software dev in the past as well). We liked certain area in a neighbouring country and thought of having an apartment or a house there. The ideal scenario for us is to have a vacation house at the moment, to be able to go there once in awhile for a week-ish stay or a long weekend and later to move there for pension time (or spend like 1/2 year while on pension). Also a note on pension -- at least up to 2020 I maxed out possible pension payments; the next step would be to work on either increasing pension allowance or decreasing pension age (65 as of 2020, but it could go up as everywhere), and either of these options are almost prohibitively expensive.

After some talking around, we decided that a house is the option and narrowed down by area and size. There are currently quite some real estate on sale, but, as usually, when you start narrowing down by size, price, age, etc it is really down to just a few. So I saw the house that is right what we wanted.

This summer we went to this are on vacation (Well, Europe is relatively opened already, within its border), and I arranged a viewing of this house. Indeed, the house was as expected, but not the location. Due to Google maps limitations, the exact address was not given (there is an unnamed local street) and it turned out to be a bit further away from, let me say, civilization and seaside. A bit further away means 15-ish minutes drive by winding roads in the hills to the nearest bakery/restaurant/etc. The house is in very relaxing area, between farmers' fields, possible to see neighbouring houses (like 100-300m aside), with nice micro-climate because of being surrounded by the hills but it is too quite and secluded for the time being. Going there with kids will be boring for them -- any activity means 20-30 minutes drive (think of a restaurant, going for a swim in the sea, etc). 

  Financially, the price of the property is less than my gross yearly income, but we'll still need some mortgage as I don't want to bleed all of the savings down to 0. The house has permission to extend it, and we already.

  My idea is to do the following (if we decide to go for the deal):

  To pay in cash about 50% of the price, take a mortgage, and do the best to pay it off during next 2-3 years, and then spend savings/current earnings on improving the house (there is a permission to build another room, which we'd like to do). I know that we'd be ""punished"" by interest rate if I try to pay out the whole amount in 2-3 years instead of 10-ish. Use this house for long weekends and provide it to friends-and-family who are ready to fly to the nearest airport, rent a car and live in such a secluded area.

  And now the question.

  My wife and I never owned a house. We are both from exUSSR where house ownership is of different concept, and since we moved to Europre we were always in rented places. Both of our families had a country house there, but the usage concept was and is quite different. So we are not sure what to consider when buying real estate aside from pure financial part (ability to pay mortgage). 

  What I want to ask you is -- what are the questions I should ask myself, myself+wife, real estate agency, etc to decide on buying such a house? I need to put emotions aside and do purely, heartless assesstment of the situation which I cannot do at the moment and that is where I seek some help. (e.g. my wife feels uncomfortable, that it could be difficult to communicate to local tradesmen due to absense of common language. For me it is of a less issue, but I do understand her; I have some considerations about mortgage in country, where I am a non-resided, but I think it's solvable)

Can you advise on this, please?

Thanks!",finance

It's a lie to tell people who don't realize that manipulation and control is the name of the game.,finance
economy,The Cantillon Effect,"Have you heard of the Cantillon effect?

Wealth inequality is a well documented problem in the United States, and more broadly across the world.

This rise in wealth inequality over the past 30 years has to a significant extent been the product of monetary policy fuelling a series of asset price bubbles.

Whenever the market booms, the share of wealth going to those at the very top increases.

When the boom goes bust, that share drops somewhat - but then comes roaring back even higher with the next asset bubble.

Also, those the very top are often diversified - thus even if their wealth as a group technically goes down due to a stock market crash, as individuals they are generally fine and it is the middle class that bear the brunt of the damage.

The redistributive effects of money creation were called Cantillon effects by Mark Blaug after the Franco-Irish economist Richard Cantillon who experienced the effect of inflation under the paper money system of John Law at the beginning of the 18th century.

**Cantillon explained that the first ones to receive the newly created money see their incomes rise whereas the last ones to receive the newly created money see their purchasing power decline as consumer price inflation comes about.**

In accordance with the Cantillon effect, inflation can increase inequality depending on the route it takes, but increasing inequality is not a necessary consequence of inflation. 

If it happened that the poorest in society were the first receivers of the newly created money, then inflation could very well be the cause of decreasing inequality since they get the money first.

Under modern central banking however, money is created and injected into the economy through the credit route and first affects financial markets.

Under this system, commercial banks and other financial institutions are not only the first receivers of the newly created money but are also the main producers of credit money.

This is because banks can grant loans unbacked by base money.

In a free-banking system, this credit creation power of banks is strictly limited by competition and the clearing process.

Under central banking however, the need for reserves is relaxed as banks can either sell financial assets to the central bank in open market operations, or the central bank can grant loans to banks at relatively low interest rates.

In both cases, central banks remove the limits of credit expansion by determining the total reserves in the banking system. In other words, commercial banks and other financial institutions are credited with so-called base money that has not existed before.

**Thus, the economics of Cantillon effects tells us that financial institutions benefit disproportionately from money creation, since they can purchase more goods, services, and assets for still relatively low prices. This conclusion is backed by numerous empirical illustrations.**

For instance, the financial sector has contributed massively to the growth of billionaire’s wealth.

One of the most visible consequences of this growth of financial markets triggered by monetary expansion is asset price inflation.

In a completely sound money system where credit only depends on the amount of saving rather than on fiduciary credit, there is very little room for generalized and persistent asset-price inflation as the amount of funds which can be used to purchase assets is strictly limited.

**In other words, the phenomenon of asset-price inflation is a child of credit inflation**.

Asset price inflation predominately benefits the richest in society for several reasons.

1. First of all, the wealthy tend to own more financial assets than the poor in proportion to income.
2. Secondly, it is easier for the richest individuals to contract debt in order to buy shares that can be sold later at a profit. Since credit easing lowers the interest rate and therefore funding costs, the profits made by selling inflated assets bought at credit will be even greater.
3. Finally, asset price inflation coming with the growth of financial markets will benefit those working in the financial sector. It will also benefit the CEO's of the publicly traded companies who will be paid more as the market cap of their company increases.

Hence, the correlation between asset prices and income inequality has been, as expected, very strong.

Despite this, many economists have failed to see asset-price inflation as a consequence of an inflated money supply.

**The conclusion is: our monetary system itself increases inequality**.

financial,Unemployment overfunding.,"This question partains to general unemployment not the recent federal assitance.

personalfinance,Medium-Term Investing: Time for a New Model? Throwing out Three-Fund Portfolios,"Interested in getting others' thoughts.
For context, I'm a 23M, poor family but full-scholarship college degree and now top-quintile income, so my perception of risk may be fundamentally skewed.

This sub recommends that 'if you need your money within five years, you should not be investing in the market'.  Assuming an effective emergency fund is already in place, so that investors are at least not extremely risk-averse.

Currently bond funds pay effectively jack.  30y US Treasury is below inflation. 10y high-grade corp debt pays effectively at inflation (1.5%).

Meanwhile the SPX returns ~7%/year in price, PLUS ~2% in dividends.  Equity is, in effect, positive carry vs. bonds.  You can argue bonds were useful hedging when the natural rate of interest was 2%... but now there is effectively zero capital gains upside to bonds (unless the Fed goes negative, but the chance of that seems quite low).  

So let's compare.  Anything above 3% bonds right nke you're talking high yield and beginning to see substantial risk of default - at least in this economy, so let's say 2%, full stop.  I want to buy a house in three years.  Let's assume a 20% dip in the market at some point.  The market returns 5% + 1.8% divs/annually until the dip, and 7% + 1.8% divs afterwards.

On a three year time horizon, the worst return we see is ~97%.  The bond fund meanwhile returns 106%.  The maximum return (assuming no dip at all) for the market is ~121% over the next three three years, and that's with reasonably conservative assumptions (note 2019 was a +35% year, and hit a new high of over 10% above the prior high in January 2020).

I think that the advice of 'investment time horizons' may be worth reconsidering given the current state of bond returns.",finance
investing,WSJ: The Federal Reserve is preparing to effectively abandon its strategy of pre-emptively lifting interest rates to head off higher inflation,"https://twitter.com/NickTimiraos/status/1289949000980783106

https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-weighs-abandoning-pre-emptive-rate-moves-to-curb-inflation-11596360600

&gt; The Federal Reserve is preparing to effectively abandon its strategy of pre-emptively lifting interest rates to head off higher inflation, a practice it has followed for more than three decades.
&gt; 
&gt; Instead, Fed officials would take a more relaxed view by allowing for periods in which inflation would run slightly above the central bank’s 2% target, to make up for past episodes in which inflation ran below the target.
&gt; 
&gt; “It would be a significant change in terms of how they are thinking about” the trade-off between employment and inflation, said Jan Hatzius of Goldman Sachs. “A lot of those things look very different now from the way they looked a few years ago,” he said.
&gt; 
&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell hinted at the shift at a news conference last week when he said the central bank would soon conclude a comprehensive review of its policy-making strategy that began last year.
&gt; 
&gt; Mr. Powell initiated the review with an eye toward beefing up the Fed’s ability to counteract downturns in a world where interest rates are lower and more likely to remain pinned at zero.
&gt; 
&gt; Even before the severe shock from the coronavirus pandemic, the Fed had grown concerned about spells of low inflation that have bedeviled authorities in Japan over the past two decades and in Europe for the past decade.
&gt; 
&gt; The change being contemplated now is a way of essentially telling markets that rates will stay low for a very long time. Markets have likely already picked up on this change, given the continued declines in long-term interest rates.
&gt; 
&gt; The changes on their own will do little to provide more support to the economy right now because investors already understand that the Fed isn’t likely to raise interest rates for years, said Steven Blitz, chief U.S. economist at research firm TS Lombard. “It is a change at this point without meaning. It’s just words,” he said.
&gt; 
&gt; The Fed would formally adopt changes by altering a statement of long-run goals that it approves annually, something it last did in January 2019. “The changes we’ll make…are really codifying the way we’re already acting with our policies,” Mr. Powell said last week.
&gt; 
&gt; One way for the Fed to do that would be to amend that document to say inflation should average 2% “over time.”

personalfinance,Employer cut wages but increased hours,"Hello,

I work for a small business that recently cut hourly wages due to COVID. I signed a contract that went into effect at the end of July that my pay would be cut to $13/hr at 32 hours per week. However, the scheduler put me for 40 hours in August because we're understaffed and have no one else to work the shifts. I have worked 32 hours for the last year or so working for them, and it's an exhausting (outdoors, on your feet all day) place to work 40 hours (which I've worked for them in the past)

Any advice on my rights in this situation? I don't want to burn bridges as I'm applying for schools and this is applicable experience towards getting into a grad program. Am I within my rights to say I won't work 40 hours due to the contract?

stocks,August - Market Outlook,"Last week the market shrugged off pandemic setbacks, received comforting remarks from the Fed, great earnings from the big tech stocks and GDP with a record decline. With the U.S. presidential election only a few months away, August will likely be a stimulating month for the markets. 

**Fundamental**: Q2 GDP advance estimate showed a decrease of 32.9%, which was significantly better than the original projections of a 40-50% decrease. This was the worst quarterly decline on record. For reference the worst quarter during the financial crisis of 2008-2009 was a decline off 6.3% in March of 2009. Based on the markets recent reaction, it seems that people are confident that the worst has passed and that further economic shutdowns will not take place. Weekly jobless claims are also well off their peak of 6.6M, although they have picked up slightly and have remained well above 1 million as many areas of the economy remain closed or are taking steps backwards. Earning reports have been well above the overly pessimistic expectations as well. 

**Technical**: NASDAQ within 1% of all-time highs. S&amp;P 500 positive year-to-date, DJIA is trailing both and Russell 2000 is down over 10% on the year. This divide is also in the overall economy and is likely to persist until the pandemic diminishes. The NASDAQ, S&amp;P and DIJA are bullishly above their respective 50- and 200-day moving averages. NASDAQ and S&amp;P 500 are strongest with their 50-day moving averages above their 200-day moving averages. Previous highs are likely to prove formidable resistance for DJIA and S&amp;P 500. NASDAQ’s Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon all with better than expected earnings. 

**Monetary**: 0 – 0.25%. At the Fed meeting earlier this week, the tone was overall cautiously optimistic. Chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, stated that activity has picked up since the lows but remains below pre-pandemic levels. They also pointed out a fair amount of uncertainty present and that the “path of the economy will depend significantly on the course of the virus.” Nothing truly shocking. To alleviate some of this uncertainty, the Fed further committed to do everything in its power to support the recovery.

**Seasonal**: Neutral. August has been the worst DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ month of the year since 1988. This election year could be different since the pandemic has changed the date and structure of the conventions which have historically taken place in July.

**Psychological**: Overall sentiment is hovering right around levels seen near recent highs going back to late 2018. Sentiment has often lingered at elevated bullish levels for varying lengths of time before any meaningful retreat occurs. As long as the major indexes hold up, sentiment is likely to remain bullish.

personalfinance,"Try and get a mortgage with no loan history, or buy a car and wait a few more years?","Hey everyone, I tried looking around for this answer on the web and on this subreddit, but I can't seem to find exactly what I'm looking for.

I'm 22 and rent in Austin, TX and I'm tired of throwing so much money into rent, so I started looking into the possibility of purchasing a house in the next 1-2 years. Factoring in property taxes, HOA, extra utilities, paying off a DPA grant from Texas' First Time Homebuyer Incentive and of course the mortgage itself; I found that when it comes to straight monthly out-of-pocket I can afford a pretty decent house outside of Austin for what I spend on rent.

I've been fortunate enough to not have any student loans and I was given a car by my parents when I was a teenager that is now fully paid off. The bad side of that is that I have no credit history of long term loans. All I have is typical credit cards that I've always paid in full with no exception (only two years of history though) and I have a credit score in the upper range of ""Good."" What I have been told is that it may be hard for me to get approved for a mortgage at an average interest rate and with a decent bank without any sort of proof that I can pay things off long term.

In **scenario A**, my idea was to move outside of central Austin when my lease is up in November and find a roommate (I'm doing this in either scenario). That would cut my rent by a third so I could start to save money for a downpayment and a larger security cushion. Then when I have about 7.5% of my budget's downpayment take the incentive and start looking for a house. However, I've been told by some friends who have a similar credit history to me that have tried to get mortgages and could not get approved for anything. Granted, they said either 0-down or very little down or don't have the same level of income as I do.  

I've been given advice that maybe I'm trying to move too fast and right now that I should go get a car and push back getting a house closer to 25 or even after. That way when it is time, I have the history and would be better off in the long run. That brings **scenario B.**

My current car is 6 years old, it's worth a good amount, it's super low mileage, it's caused me no issues apart from normal wear-and-tear and I could see myself being happy with it for a few more years. However, I do see how trading it in could make sense. Since I'm moving farther away from my office in November, having a nice newer daily driver would be nice. Getting a newer car reduces the chances of something going wrong right after I've signed a mortgage. I can overpay my auto loan today so my payment is lower (or paid off) when it comes time to get a house. The value of my current car is only going to go down from here. And of course, I get some history under my belt.

For a car that I feel is an upgrade and worth taking a loan out on, I'd be out around $300-$400 a month including extra insurance cost and the car payment. I just don't know if it's smart to be throwing $400/month at a car that I don't really need other than for a financial advantage when I could just be using that $4,800/year towards a downpayment and get to that 7.5% faster. However, I don't want to have to settle on mortgage terms because I don't have a history. 

Any advice on either scenario or scenario Cs is appreciated! Thank-you!",finance

personalfinance,Trying to work out the math of borrowing money from parents at a low interest rate to help with a home downpayment,"My parents are nearing retirement and have moved much of their retirement assets into stable, low risk accounts that are earning between 0.8 and 1.2% annual interest.  They suggested putting up $40k for my fiancee and I to add to our home downpayment.  

Being concerned about taking money from them and paying it back at a later date, as well as taking from their investment income, I suggested we treat this as an official loan and work out an interest rate and payment schedule with a contract to back it up.  What we've come to is a 1.1% APR paid over 5 years, and we decided to call the total interest a flat $1200.  That works out to about $686 per month for five years.

We found a boilerplate contract that we edited to spell out all the terms and conditions - there's no recourse for them to demand payment of the loan beyond the monthly schedule, which they're fine with because it's money they're not going to need to touch any time soon.  I can also make advance payments that go entirely toward the principle of the loan.  

-----

What I'm trying to figure out now is whether this makes financial sense to do.  I'm in a good financial situation: 
 my credit score was 803, my DTI ratio is 12% and I got preapproved for a $700k loan with a 20% downpayment, which I have available in liquid assets today.  

Assuming my rate ends up at around 3% for a 30 year fixed mortgage, that's a monthly payment of $2360 and total interest paid of about $289k.  If I put the extra 40k into the down payment, my monthly payment is $2192 and the total interest paid is about $269k.  

So I'd be paying $1200 in interest over 5 years to save $20k in interest over 30 years.  But that would mean my net monthly payment over the first 5 years would be $2878

-----

**What I'm really wondering and struggling to figure out is,** If, instead of borrowing from my parents, I were to the extra $686 per month I would be paying to them and put it into advance payments on the mortgage every month for 5 years, how much more would I end up paying than if I took the loan from my parents and dumped it into the down payment from the get-go?  

Thanks in advance for your help.  I've tried to figure out the math on this bit but I don't really understand enough about how mortgage amortization works to figure it out.",finance

personalfinance,Negotiating retention after my company asks for more time,"I am a mid-level financial analyst at a company that just announced it will be closing its doors, but will be completing contracted projects over the next two years or so.  I was offered a 2-month salary retention bonus to stay on for the next six months, where 33% is paid after a few months and 66% paid at the end of employment.  There was also a small, separate severance package. This sounded like an OK deal so I went ahead and signed the agreement.

Since that time, half of my team has left the company, leaving our group understaffed to complete our projects.  I am now being asked if I would be interested in staying an additional six months - for almost the exact same retention bonus (the math works out to about 2.5 months salary, an extra half month salary), and the same vesting schedule - 33% in a few months, and 67% on my last day, which is now six months later.  So I'm getting a little more money, but it won't be paid out until six months later than the original agreement - I'll also be doing the work of my coworkers that left the company.

I have only been working here a couple years but I now find myself as the #2 or #3 analyst at the company.  I found the initial retention offer to be attractive, but the additional six months feels like more risk than reward - my agreement ""guarantees"" the severance even if I am laid off, unless it is for cause.  There is also the potential we will be bought out - my contract states the retention will still be paid if this occurs, but I don' t know how this can be assured.

I feel I have a strong case for negotiating the retention bonus amount as well as the vesting schedule.  I planned to ask for another month's salary (so 3 months bonus for 11 months of work), and a more front-loaded vesting where I get more money sooner.  Does this seem reasonable - too much, not enough?  What else should I be concerned about here?",finance

So, for the past quarter, I've had a bit of freelance work. However, it's been so thin and light-paying (rough times) that I was able to qualify for PUA insurance (which requires earning under $504 a week). So that's how the past few weeks/months have been going. Naturally, I asked the feds to withhold the taxable portion of that PUA insurance, since that's an option.
  
Now that it's August and, by extension, estimated quarterly tax time, I'm wondering how much I need to pay. Obviously I have to pay taxes for my freelance income, but what about the PUA insurance? Did the Feds withhold enough PUA money to cover self-employment taxes, or did they just withhold the standard 1099 amount and I still need to pay self-employment taxes on the PUA $ in my quarterly estimates? How do I know if the right amount of tax $ was withheld by Big Brother?
  
I really only care about avoiding penalties, so I'm going to pay the amount needed to reach last year's tax liability and achieve safe harbor status no matter what. But I'm curious if this PUA stuff means I'll have a thicker tax bill at year's end, even with the Feds withholding some of that money preemptively.",finance

Now I understand this, but what doesn’t make sense to me is that if interest rates go up, the NAVs of older bonds should go up bc now they are returning more, hence more people would want to buy that bond.

stocks,$RWB $RWBYF U.S. Pot Stocks Are Heating Up and This Lesser-Known Cannabis Name Looks Poised to Catapult to the Top,"* **Many Investors Placed Their Bets on the Illinois Cannabis Market, But Michigan is Now Surging, and When All is Said and Done, the Great Lakes State Could Be the Come Behind Winner**
* **An Effective Combo of Being in the Right Place, at the Right Time, With the Right People Has Red White &amp; Bloom Set to Change the Cannabis Game in the United States**

 In the American cannabis market, Illinois made the most sense for investors due to its upside potential and large user base. While not discounting this incredible opportunity, serious cannabis investors should also be looking at Michigan, which is an underdog with a potentially massive pathway to profitability. 

 One lesser-known entity is about to conceivably bust open the vast riches of Michigan’s cannabis market, an arena that Michigan State University predicts will mature into a $3 billion industry over the next few years. This is an organization that understands the importance of walking the less-beaten path to maximize growth and stakeholder returns 

 Among the available prospects in the financial markets today, very few have the allure and tantalizing potential of the legal marijuana industry. When all is said and done, we’re talking about a once illegal enterprise becoming a fully legal (and therefore taxable) industry. With fiscal budgets now a huge, perhaps crippling concern across international governing bodies, legalizing cannabis has economic appeal. 

 At the same time, several cannabis stocks have been among the most disappointing for embattled stakeholders. Frankly, many hard-hit organizations simply grew too fast and irresponsibly. As well, unforeseen administrative issues, particularly in the Canadian cannabis space, have resulted in a sharp crash back toward reality. 

 In 2020, U.S. Pot Stocks are finally being rewarded for their much stronger fundamentals compared to their Canadian counterparts, and as a result, have rebounded sharply and appear to be in the very early stages of a brand new cannabis bull market run. 

 To summarize the key headwinds impacting the early volley of the cannabis investment market (i.e. initial legalization and “Cannabis 2.0”), sector players have been hurt by these three obstacles: 

 

* Less-than-favourable geographic markets
* Poor corporate planning/execution
* Unfortunate geopolitical timing

 Let’s tackle these three issues one-by-one, juxtaposing earlier setbacks against the potential profitability of Michigan’s legal marijuana market and a rapidly rising upstart in the cannabis space. 

 **Opportunity Calling in the Great Lakes State** 

 As you know, Canada generated much fanfare when it became the first G7 member nation to legalize recreational marijuana. Immediately, investor dollars poured – almost indiscriminately – into any and all “weedpreneurs.” Unfortunately, the Canadian government could not handle the deluge of applications for dispensaries and other cannabis-related enterprises 

 Invariably, one of the consequences of this dynamic was that applications were granted haphazardly without consideration to maximum efficiency – we are talking about the government, after all. Thus, many high-profile Canadian markets often received low cannabis retailer density on a per-capita basis. 

 Simultaneously, several cannabis firms poured resources into production facilities whose end goods would have difficulty finding a home. Despite the obstacles, though, industry analysts project Canada’s 2020 medical marijuana sales to [hit $1.513 billion](https://www.statista.com/statistics/587568/estimated-medical-marijuana-market-size-canada/) (2.03 billion CAD). And by 2022, the country may experience a peak in medical marijuana sales of $1.774 billion (2.38 billion CAD). 

 Now, let’s take a look at Michigan. Though overshadowed in the media by other marijuana-friendly regions like California, the Great Lakes State is quite a green powerhouse. As a report from [24/7 Wall Street](https://247wallst.com/) and published by [Huff Post](https://www.huffpost.com/news/us-news) reveals, Michigan had over [1.3 million marijuana](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/12-states-smoking-the-most-marijuana_b_577e900be4b03288ddc58433) users in 2016. Because of its smaller nominal population size, however, it has a higher per-capita density of weed users (15.6%), than stalwart California at 14.9%. 

 But even on a nominal basis, Michigan is home to the sixth-largest cannabis consumer market. According to the state’s [Marijuana Regulatory Agency](https://www.michigan.gov/mra/), by September of this year, Michigan’s cannabis industry will generate [$390 million in recreational sales](https://www.mlive.com/public-interest/2019/12/michigans-recreational-marijuana-industry-poised-to-grow-exponentially-in-2020.html). By the end of 2021, the recreational market will explode to nearly $1.5 billion. 

 Such projections are begging a well-run organization to establish dominance in this ripe-for-the-picking and undervalued market. And that company could very well be [**Red White &amp; Bloom (CSE: RWB) (OTCQX: RWBYF)**](https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/tag/Red-White-And-Bloom/). 

 **RWB is a Firecracker of an Upstart** 

 Unlike other cannabis firms that have been plagued by poor planning and myopic leadership, Red White &amp; Bloom focuses on prudent, responsible growth. Primarily, RWB accomplishes this by exclusively targeting large, viable markets. RWB CEO [Brad Rogers](https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/tag/Brad-Rogers/) has on many occasions referred to the company not as a multi-state operator (MSO), but a “[Super State Operator](https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/tag/Super-State-Operator/).” 

 “We’re very disciplined in what we’re doing. We call ourselves Super State Operators. We’re not a multi-state operator. We’re super state, meaning that we go in \[states\] with a big footprint, and we dominate wherever we go,” [explained Rogers in an interview with TraderTV Live](https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/tradertv-live-interviews-brad-rogers-ceo-of-super-state-operator-red-white-bloom/). 

 Just as importantly, Red White &amp; Bloom enter qualified regions with the appropriate scale, thereby integrating strategy with execution. 

 And the proof, as they say, is in the pudding. By securing the first-mover advantage, RWB now [controls a dominant 22% share of the Michigan cannabis market](https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/michigans-cannabis-industry-is-thriving-and-this-company-is-dominating-the-state-with-a-22-share-of-the-market/). Breaking it down, the company has 41 cannabis licenses, which cover the full spectrum of the value chain: cultivation, retail, delivery and consumption events. As well, the company has 10 dispensaries, eight of which are ready to open. 

 Further, Red White &amp; Bloom levers 23 individual facilities, which are spaced out to serve the majority of Michigan’s 10 million residents. Also, its five cultivation facilities translate to over one million square feet of indoor and outdoor growing space. 

 Better yet, Red White &amp; Bloom is a burgeoning [multi-state operator (MSO),](https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/tag/Multi-State-Operator) and the only one of its kind in [Michigan](https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/tag/Michigan). For the most part, MSOs can be difficult to operate because each state has different nuanced laws and regulations. As well, the consumer base varies in taste and preferences. A marketing campaign that works in one state may not work in another. However, RWB is so far the sole MSO that has unlocked the code to the vast riches of Michigan’s cannabis market. 

 Additionally, RWB has licenses in [Illinois](https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/tag/Illinois/) and [Massachusetts](https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/tag/Massachusetts/) and is targeting expansion in [Florida](https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/tag/Florida/) and [California](https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/tag/California/). For Illinois, RWB offers a uniquely attractive portfolio featuring a [3.6 million sq ft indoor hemp/CBD cultivation and processing facility](https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/tidal-royalty-releases-red-white-bloom-corporate-update-with-pictures/). RWB’s Illinois facility is said to be the largest in the world and is capable of producing 600,000 pounds of biomass per year. 

 The end goal here is the incredible profit potential of the global cannabidiol (CBD) market. To quickly recap, CBD is cannabis without the psychoactive compound THC. Because of this pivotal distinction and the passage of the [2018 Farm Bill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_United_States_farm_bill), CBD is no longer considered “marijuana” under federal law. And it’s possible that other countries will eventually follow suit, making Illinois a potential goldmine in the making. 

 For Massachusetts, this is one of the latest states to legalize cannabis. Here, experts predict that its market will exceed $1 billion. RWB has three licenses in the state, two for cultivation and one for processing. What stands out is that Massachusetts is a limited license state, translating to approximately 0.3 square feet of cultivation per resident. Thus, with Red White and Bloom’s presence, it will be tremendously difficult for competitors to unseat this MSO. 

 And competitors will come. According to a study by Michigan State University on behalf of the Marijuana Regulatory Agency, Michigan marijuana sales will eventually hit approximately [$3 billion per year](https://www.marijuanamoment.net/michigan-marijuana-market-maturing-rapidly-but-faces-barriers-to-growth-state-report-finds/). However, the tenacious management team at Red White &amp; Bloom have already grown revenues to $100 million during the most challenging period in the marijuana industry. Plus, by cementing a foothold in Michigan’s broader retail machinery, RWB is well prepared to address any competitive concerns. 

 **Massive Cannabis Catalyst on the Horizon** 

 Undeniably, 2020 will forever be marked by the COVID-19 pandemic. On scales both large and small, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus may permanently change how business is conducted. Yet even within this health catastrophe, certain political elements see opportunity. 

 Principally, the outbreak may give the Trump administration its final lifeline to save what was an otherwise feasible campaign for the 2020 presidential election. Pre-pandemic, public opinion polls favoured Trump, mostly because he ran on a strong economy. At the time, the headline numbers, such as Wall Street valuations and multi-year low unemployment, supported this narrative. 

 However, the coronavirus ruined everything. And as the pandemic crushed several states, the probability of success for a second term diminished substantially. But as the [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-may-give-trump-an-edge-11595373340) points out, [President Trump](https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/tag/Trump/) could corral this crisis into a political catalyst. The [WSJ notes](https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-may-give-trump-an-edge-11595373340) that Trump supporters “are more enthusiastic than Biden’s, and may be less fearful of going to the polls.” 

 Still, mere pandering alone may not be enough. Frankly, the economy is at an inflection point. Strong leadership and a chips-on-the-table approach to saving the country may prevent an apocalyptic disaster. Additionally, astute political strategists will observe that marijuana is also at an inflection point. All it takes is one major piece of legislation to move the momentum forward. 

 Clearly, this is a win-win partnership. Although speculative, the COVID-19 pandemic may be the pivotal tailwind for which cannabis investors have been seeking. 

 As Michigan State reported, it’s not just the $3 billion annual revenue stream that should interest prospective investors of RWB stock. Instead, it’s the 13,500 jobs that the green industry will create. Plus, the tax revenue from the projected sales should amount to nearly half-a-billion dollars annually for the state government. 

 In a single strike, both state and federal authorities could open an unnecessarily capped economic engine. And that’s precisely what the U.S. needs – jobs and robust tax revenue streams. 

 To that end, investors should consider the broader bullish case for RWB stock. In addition to the incredible production footprint that Red White &amp; Bloom leverages, RWB is set to [acquire 100% of the incredibly successful American cannabis company, Platinum Vape](https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/red-white-bloom-to-acquire-premium-cannabis-brand-with-over-70-million-in-annualized-revenue/). A specialist in vaping and cannabis-infused products such as edibles, [Platinum Vape](https://houseofplatinum.com/) products are sold at over 700 retail locations throughout the U.S. 

 In particular, this acquisition will bring revenue streams from [California](https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/tag/California/) and [Oklahoma](https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/tag/Oklahoma/) under the Red White &amp; Bloom umbrella. The former has always been a vaping stronghold, and the practice has exploded in popularity in the latter. 

 In addition to the Platinum Vape deal, just last week, Red White &amp; Bloom announced that the company [exercised its call option to acquire 100% of the Michigan-based cannabis company PharmaCo](https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/red-white-bloom-exercises-call-option-to-acquire-100-of-michigan-based-pharmaco/). 

 “PharmaCo has established significant market share within the state of Michigan. Now that we have completed our go public transaction, we felt that the time was right for us to take the next step of rolling our critical mass asset base together in what we believe is one of the top 3 most important cannabis states by market size and potential,” [said RWB CEO Brad Rogers](https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/red-white-bloom-exercises-call-option-to-acquire-100-of-michigan-based-pharmaco/). 

 Best of all, in mid-June, RWB closed a [game-changing exclusive licensing agreement with High Times](https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/red-white-bloom-closes-landmark-high-times-deal/). Inarguably the vanguard of cannabis pop culture, [High Times](https://hightimes.com/) enjoys millions of monthly page views, as well as 8.9 million social media followers. The deal cements the RWB brand to the single-largest consumer portal possible, facilitating a daunting firewall against would-be competitors. 

 **Putting It All Together** 

 Notwithstanding the incredible potential of RWB stock, perhaps the most remarkable aspect of Red White &amp; Bloom is how [deeply undervalued it is](https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/this-u-s-cannabis-stock-appears-to-be-way-undervalued-and-may-actually-benefit-from-a-second-wave-of-the-pandemic/). In a way, this shouldn’t be too surprising. As we discussed at the top, many investors were burnt when the [Canadian cannabis bubble burst in late 2018](https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/cannabis-boom-2-0-heres-why-some-pot-stocks-are-soaring-like-we-havent-seen-since-2018/). It’s understandable that some investors may be a little gun shy when it comes to cannabis stocks for this reason, but the massive American market, which is yet to fully open up and is full of huge potential catalysts, is a whole new ball game. 

 As mentioned, U.S. pot stocks have begun to take off and many experts are calling this move the beginning of a [new bull market in marijuana or simply, the Cannabis Boom 2.0](https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/cannabis-boom-2-0-heres-why-some-pot-stocks-are-soaring-like-we-havent-seen-since-2018/). Top U.S. MSOs such as [Curaleaf (CSE: CURA) (OTCQX: CURLF)](https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/tag/Curaleaf), [Trulieve (CSE: TRUL) (OTCQX: TCNNF)](https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/tag/Trulieve) and [Green Thumb (CSE: GTII) (OTCQX: GTBIF) (FRA: R9U2)](https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/tag/GTII/) are finally getting the love they deserve as a result of strong earnings and it won’t be long until RWB is right up there with them 

 The Red White &amp; Bloom story is very compelling and it becomes clearer when you stack the underlying company up against leading Canadian cannabis firms. With an assumed share price of $1.25, Red White &amp; Bloom has an enterprise value of $375 million. 

 From an [EV/EBITDA](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ev-ebitda.asp) calculation, RWB has a ratio of 6.5. That is half the valuation of many leading Canadian cannabis firms’ valuation. However, if we ramp up the EV/EBITDA ratio to 19.2 – the median ratio of select Canadian competitors – the implied enterprise value will hit slightly over $1.1 billion. And this will translate to a stock price of $4.58. 

 Even more enticing, it’s possible RWB’s valuation could exceed projections. While cannabis is capturing new adherents, the vanguards of the adult liberties markets – alcohol, tobacco and big pharmaceuticals – are losing market share. To stay relevant in this new age, the top players may end up opening their wallets and partnering with strong, sustainable cannabis firms. 

 Indeed, we’ve already seen this happen with [Canopy Growth (TSX: WEED) (NYSE: CGC) (FRA: 11L1)](https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/tag/Canopy-Growth/) and [Cronos Group (TSX: CRON) (NASDAQ: CRON) (FRA: 7CI)](https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/tag/Cronos-Group/), which secured partnerships with alcoholic beverage maker [Constellation Brands (NYSE: STZ) (FRA: CB1A)](https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/tag/Constellation-Brands/) and tobacco giant [Altria Group (NYSE: MO) (FRA: PHM7)](https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/tag/Altria/), respectively. Though nothing is set in stone, there’s no reason to believe such major deals won’t happen again, but this time, with top U.S. cannabis names. 

 When you factor in Red White &amp; Bloom’s dominance in Michigan’s burgeoning cannabis market, along with expanding its MSO footprint in key regions, RWB is well-positioned for any breakthroughs in the legal environment. But the most potent opportunity could be now when the crowd has yet to sniff out this budding firecracker.",finance
personalfinance,How many times can I refinance a loan?,"I have about $60,000k in student loans. They started with about 4 separate loans and I refinanced last summer to consolidate them into one. I am realizing now that the interest is what really kicks your ass and would love to get an even better interest rate (because my credit has gone up since the refinance).

btc,If you found out that ABC was trying to intentionally derail Bitcoin Cash would you continue using their client? Their actions have pushed for centralization along with actively destroying utility. Please stop using ABC.,"I need to spell this out for new users here.

Bitcoin Cash has been and continues to be the original immutable Bitcoin ledger since it was launched in 2008. In 2017 Bitcoin got an upgrade with larger blocks and the Bitcoin described in the [Whitepaper](https://bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf) is now called Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin Cash continues to be peer-to-peer electronic cash. It doesn't require a business, government middleman, 2nd-layer hub-spoke junk model or centralized development team to continue and flourish. That's what makes Bitcoin Cash so powerful. It gives you back control of the money you rightfully earn and save.

Bitcoin Cash scales and it can do so cheaply for even small transaction amounts. The world can start using Bitcoin Cash today and it will scale elegantly where other centralized and intentionally crippled coins like BitcoinBTC will fail.

The above facts make Bcore fanboys shivver in their timbers. That's why they're here attacking this project. Bitcoin Core is garbage software and Bitcoin Core fan boys were dumb enough to buy into a pump-and-dump scheme rather than actual coin utility. 


More facts:

* Central banks feel threatened. They technically own your money, keep 5% of it in reserve and engage in high-risk gambling with the rest.

* Government dictatorships feel threatened. Bitcoin Cash is cross-border and can't be frozen. They can't stop foreign capital outflows and with proper obfuscation they can't use your transaction history against you for political persecution.

* Consolidated-power entities like the federal reserve feel threatened. They push a button and create trillions of bogus fiat dollars out of thin air. Bitcoin Cash teaches people that money is an idea that we all agree upon; not a face on a piece of fancy paper or some fake number in a centralized database. 

* Many other groups attack BCH for many other reasons. If it's not something they can control or a scam they can benefit from, they will attack it.


To make it crystal clear, Bitcoin Cash is and will continue to be under social attack in this subreddit. Don't be surprised to see trolls troll'in. They are here and they mean to destroy this project despite it being a benefit to them in their actual lives, since they too use Money.


**In regards to ABC:**

The recent IFP miner tax theft attempt was an attack on decentralization of the Bitcoin Cash protocol. We got lucky... very lucky.

ABC's more recent DAA Grasberg change would slow blocks, making Bitcoin Cash less useful, while also invalidating time contracts built on top of it. It's another clear attack on the utility of Bitcoin Cash.

It's obvious that ABC is making changes that will undermine Bitcoin Cash. Maybe it's a government actor that is forcing these harmful changes. Not sure, and there's no way to know, but it's clear that these are incredibly harmful changes that would only be pushed by someone trying to do serious harm.

**Please use BCHN, Bitcoin Unlimited or one of the other great wallets. These projects have BETTER developers than ABC and they don't appear to be actively trying to undermine it.**

personalfinance,My temporary pay cut is probably going to be permanent and I don’t have enough experience to get another position,"Long story short, I need help

Maybe the answer to this lies in ‘just keep applying for new jobs’

I’m 24. Been a restaurant employee for years but have a BA. In December I started working at a bankruptcy/foreclosure (creditor’s side) law firm. I work in the bankruptcy department. I was picking up multiple night shifts a week at the restaurant along side this first ever desk job 

I was making about $20/hour at the firm and good money at night. Covid happened and the restaurant closed. The federal eviction moratorium caused the firm to terminate the entire foreclosure department and gave the bankruptcy department a 25% pay cut despite most of our clients continuing their operations. Because they cut my team I actually have more work to do

The restaurant is running with a skeleton crew still and the people working are hardly making any money. Because the eviction moratorium was extended until the 31st and now potentially longer with a new coronavirus relief bill I might not see my pay reinstated for a long time.

I have less than a year of experience and no one will hire me. I have 10k saved but now that I make $1800 a month, and my bills are about 1,200 I don’t know what to do. I’m taking savings out every month to salvage my sanity and get chipotle some times. My student loans, car, and I lose my free health insurance (through tricare. Spouse just left military) on sept 1 so ill be uninsured are all creeping up fast

What the hell do I do? Second job at Walmart at night? Are my restaurant friends fucked if the relief bill doesn’t help them? I’m honestly terrified. Idk what to do.",finance

gaming,Every competitive shooter has the following kind of players:,"1) The Coppers Cucks: Mostly here because they haven't played the game enough to learn it yet, but are too egotistical to accept that so they play ranked for that sweet sweet validation. They don't get it. 

2) The Bronze Bastards: They've learned the game but are generally bad at shooters, therefore they're stuck here. They don't give a fuck about their rank. They will probably jump into ranked first thing after shelving the game for 6 months. 

3) The Silver Shitbags: They're actually decent players. They have good strategies, communicate well, and are generally dependable. Don't trash talk a lot either. They make you wonder why they're at that rank and not higher. It's because of the elo hell. 

4) The Low Gold Gatekeepers: They just got into gold and let it get to their head. They don't play too much after hitting gold 3 because they know they're not good enough to maintain that rank. Also, they trash talk. A lot. They're like flies, and they just won't shut the fuck up. 

5) The High Gold Harlots: They also trash talk. But they can also back it up with skill. Really frustrating to play against. Were most likely beefed up bullies in high school.

6) The Low Plat Pussies: These are carried low golds. Evolved to be even more fucking annoying and useless. Their sole purpose is to flaunt the fact that they're plats and to teamkill. When you play against them you wonder how the fuck they got there because they sure a hell don't have the required skills. 

7) The High Plats Hoes: They're the ones that 360 reverse flip Tokyo drift headshot you into next week within 10 seconds of the match starting. Your confidence will probably rage quit before you do when you go up against them. 

8) The Diamond Dickheads: You've never seen them ingame. They're a myth. No one know how they play. You can only watch them on YouTube. 1% of the gaming world. Elitist as fuck.

stocks,Advice for currency risk on ETFs,"Dear Fellow Redditors,

A little background:
I built up my own business with partners and so far I put my money in the business and we did not pay ourselves crazy salaries in the first years. Business is going well now and we can pay ourselves a good salary and we can also pay out fair amounts of dividends. 

So i really want to start saving as much as i can and invest this money – I live in Switzerland by the way.

I want to understand and learn investing and have been reading a lot (and will continue to do so). So I don't want to put my money into a managed ""solution"" due to costs and also I do not want to use a roboadvisor. My strategy is not final but I'm planning to go for a very simple portfolio that consists of a few diversified ETFs.

Something very simple could be like:

70% - 80% World Stocks (Vanguard Total World, VT)
20% - 30% Shares Core SPI

A small amount i want to use to ""play around"" and burn my fingers on direct stock investments..

As said, this is nothing final but the direction i want to go. Anyways i want to have a part in an ETF for Swiss Stocks and a bigger part allocated to more global and US-Focused Stocks. Swiss Bonds seem to be not very attractive to invest into.

For the global/us focused stocks it seems that Vanguard offers very good ETFs with really good TERs so I'd really like to have a large chunk invested in Vanguard ETFs (whichever it might be). My investment horizon is ~25 Years, I plan to stay in switzerland for the forseeable future and i plan to invest through an Interactive Brokers account (... or degiro).

Now to my actual question: As said, to me it seems that Vanguard offers very attractive ETFs for me to invest in – but they are USD based. I'm really afraid that with this setup i face a big risk with currency exchange rates. The swiss frank is very stable and I'm afraid that the US Dollar might not be (no offence to anybody) considering the current situation and the FED ""printing money"" pretty actively. So basically, even if the ETFs do well, if the Dollar loses a lot of value towards the swiss frank this has a lot of impact for me..

Do you have advice on this currency risk issue? 

Thank you!",finance

stocks,Timing the coming crash?,"It should be obvious that the stock market is completely detached from the economy, kept high only by infusions of Federal money.  Like Wile E Coyote, they have stepped off a cliff and hang in mid-air until they look down and realize there is nothing supporting them.

The whole thing is a pump and dump scheme.  

But when will the dump occur?  If you understand that the stock market is being artificially inflated in an effort to get Trump re-elected, then the dump should occur immediately after he fails to get elected.

I am currently 50/50 stocks and bonds in my 401k.  Plan on getting out of stocks completely in late October, then wait a month to see what happens (there  are no service fees for investment transfers, I can do this every day if I feel like it).

So tell me I am wrong and explain to me why I am wrong.",finance

stocks,Thoughts on gold in a overvalued market,"Currently, I think that the only thing driving stocks up are:
1. Government money for unemployment thrown into stocks
2. Share buyback to inflate P/E ratio and share price
3. Institutional investor unable to buy bonds at 0% interest rate, they look for yield in stocks.
4. Money printer goes brrrrr

At times like this, I think gold holds quite a valuable position in the portfolio to protect us against:
1. Devaluing of currency
2. Market crashes

Edit: What I mean is gold as an anti/non-correlation to stocks as a hedge. Since we all know that compounding is the key to investing, I will say boldly that protecting ourselves against major losses is more important than yield.

What are your thoughts on gold vs stocks, and how does your portfolio looks?",finance
personalfinance,Car buying - Cash vs Loan,"So I consider myself pretty finically literate, I create NPV and IRR models for minerals investments as part of my job. I have few older men (Dad, FIL,Bose) who are all very good with money, and have taught me a lot about investing and managing. 

I want to buy a late model car, but the people I trust have conflicting recommendations. 

1) Use my available cash to pay for the car outright, because I should ‘avoid debt when ever possible’ and the saving rate sucks right now anyway.
2) interest rates are amazing, money is cheap, and you should save your cash when ever you can. Take out a long 72 month loan and get a low payment. 

Im pretty secure in my job, and I have more the 3 months salary on hand in a savings account too. Just looking for some advice from the hive mind.",finance
personalfinance,What's the catch with these? There's gotta be a catch right?,"Looking at refinancing our mortgage. You can compare interest rates and fees from different lenders on various sites (I'm using NerdWallet for example). Here's what one of the cheaper options says for fees:

https://imgur.com/a/WLVucIJ

The 'other 3rd party fees may apply' part is what sets my spidey sense a tingling. I seem to recall the fees for our initial mortgage were on the order of 5k or something like that, so how is it possible they would only charge 1/10th of that? Legit or bait &amp; switch? What should I expect to pay in fees to refinance?",finance

personalfinance,Kill Student Loans or 20% Downpayment On A House?,"**INCOME**

My income: 75k

Wife's income: 60k \*She is staying home this year to be with the kids, returning Fall 21. We consider her income as ""disposable (saving) income,"" and don't want to rely on it for housing payments/bills.

If we went for 20% on a house, we'd nail the student loan debt away as soon as she returned to work.

**STUDENT LOAN SITUATION**

30k federal student loans. Interest rates: 10k @ 6%, 6k @ 5%, 14k @ 3-3.5%.

**HOUSING IN NEW HAMPSHIRE**

Current ""month to month"" Rent: $1,300 (expected to rise - unsure by how much)

Payment with 20% on 300k (30yr): $1,500-$1,600 month depending on town's taxes

Payment with 10% on 300k (30 yr): $1,800-$1,900 month depending on town taxes and includes PMI

**HOUSING MARKET**

Moved here in summer of 2017 thinking things were overpriced and we'd wait and try and buy in the 250k range. Boy were we wrong. COVID made everything worse and everyone is flocking to NH. Most ""starter"" homes are beyond 300k currently. For example our friends bought in 2015 @ 250k and their house is now worth 350k no improvements.

Offers are currently 30-50k over asking, and waived inspections. We've been outbid on waived inspections the past 3 years (3 bids total as we've been picky/patient).

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**FINAL THOUGHTS**

I personally lean towards doing 20% as the monthly payment on a house is less daunting. Either way, when my wife returns to work we'd nail away the debt or build back to 20% as fast as possible. I guess I just worry with the current housing market that unless we have 20% we just don't stand a chance.

gaming,What games are machine guns actually good weapons?,"As the title ask. What games are machine guns actually good weapons? Maybe it's because I'm older than the current gaming crowd, but I still remember back in the days when machine guns were cool and awesome weapons in gaming. I think it was PS2 when machine guns were still good. 

After that point was when the ""realistic"" era of gaming came when machine guns are not only weak as piss that it takes like 50 bullets to kill a single enemy. But wait, game developers also nerfed machine guns even harder by not just making them the weakest weapons in the game, they're also the most inaccurate weapon in the game that spraying bullets will make you miss even more that you might as well try and snipe enemies with a shotgun. Actually if this is the Battlefield games, you actually can snipe enemies with a shotgun better than you can with a machine gun. 

I'm sick of playing games where I feel like I'm being punished for being a machine gun fan because that's not cool anymore. What recent games are there that machine guns are actually good weapons? Only games I can think of are Borderlands (where gun usefulness are dependant on levels), State of Decay (where guns damage is based off of caliber) and Ratchet and Clank (though it's debatable if those blasters in the games are meant to be machine guns or just high capacity handguns).

stocks,Thoughts on aviation from inside the industry,"I see a ton of talk and speculation on this sub about airlines - some good but some totally wrong and showing a clear lack of understanding of the industry instead, but more so how COVID is affecting it. I am an experienced airport operations manager who holds a BS in Aviation Management, so I hope that I can provide a bit of insight. I’m not a financial advisor so I can’t advise you to actually buy or sell anything. A lot of my info is coming from internal docs so I can’t share them as they contain information that can’t be shared. The information I share is likely verifiable with other public sources. 

Obviously we’re all aware that traffic is way down. But to show you how much it is, in the USA the daily average passenger throughput at commercial service airports this time last year was approx 2.5M. The past four weeks have been hovering at ~750K and are now starting to decline with the most recent data showing just shy of 700K and likely declining through September. Speaking of, airlines have been publishing massive schedule reductions (feel free to buy a Diio subscription if you want data) through September and continue to do so week after week. There is some hope in that the October schedule is being elevated but my personal take is that they are just pushing the schedule in hopes something changes. Hawaii flights have been doing this for months - just having their schedules pushed each month Hawaii renews their quarantine orders. The only somewhat stable international travel I’ve noticed is Mexico flights which are, for something reason, even growing in some capacity. All of this is to say that just because your state is opening doesn’t mean that air travel is returning yet. In fact, I see it declining until the holiday season which is actually normal in a seasonal sense, but is much more drastic right now. 

Does that mean you shouldn’t invest in airlines? I don’t think so. I think that there needs to be a bit more waiting as the aviation industry tends to lag behind general industry and we’ll see some more discounts on airlines like we did back in March. EXCEPT for maybe Southwest because they have insane cash reserves. Also remember that airlines are not “too big to fail” in the financial sense, only the laymen sense. I see a ton of talk on this sub like “Trump would never let American Airlines go under!” It’s not up to Trump, and he would - especially if he had a shiny penny to make off of it. Airlines go under all the time. American is actually a conglomeration of bankrupted airlines at this point. American as a label will probably exist forever, but they could bankrupt and send shares to $0 in the process. 

This does not mean that aviation is doomed forever as I’ve seen on this sub. Do you really think that the fastest and safest transportation method known to modern society will stay dormant forever? Even if Covid never ends our society will perform its own large scale Darwinism experiment. People will fly to Disneyworld or wherever regardless as long as someone is willing to sell them a ticket.  

Im sorry that this post became more of a rant, but I had no real focus for it in the first place. Let me know if you have questions and I’ll try to answer.

**Edit**

just finished some Monday reporting and August continues to bleed air traffic as well, as well as continuing to more in sept with pushes to November for resuming service on some routes. 

As I added in another comment chain - cargo is king right now. Thanks to the explosion in e-commerce, airlines are starting to spread out to keep operating and are even filling seats with packages. Domestic US airlines will probably only carry USPS (or affiliated) items as at least at my airfield FedEx and UPS have their own dedicated flight departments. Speaking of, FedEx and UPS are obviously huge global cargo handlers! Along with DHL as well.

Wow I didn’t expect this post to get this kind of attention. Sorry if I didn’t get around to replying to you",finance
personalfinance,Refinance or continue to make additional payments on principal?,"We are considering refinancing our house and have received a few quotes. I am wondering if it is a good idea though or if we should continue our path of making additional payments on the principal amount. Details:

Currently owe $150,000, 4.5% interest rate, 30 year fixed loan. Payment is $1000 month including escrow. Only 17 years left after 5 years of paying loan due to additional payments of $200 on principal each payment. 

New quote: 2.5% interest rate, 2.85% APR ($6,000 in closing costs, includes fees and escrow funds), 15 year fixed. Payment would be $1200/month including escrow. So essentially what we are paying now except we would likely be unable to pay any additional on principal and we’d be paying the extra fees and time for our loan to process which they said is about 90 days right now. 

What’s a good calculator to plug in additional principal payments to compare refinance options? I haven’t found any with that option. Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,"Best Way to Use An Extra $1,000/month","Next month, my boyfriend is going to be moving in to the house I own and will be renting out his house.  He is planning on paying me somewhere around $1,000 per month to contribute to expenses (mortgage, taxes, utilities, etc.).  I'm used to paying all of these by myself, so I want to figure out the best way to use the extra money for our goals.

We are planning on staying in my house for about 5-6 more years.  We figure by then, we will most likely want to move into a larger home to accommodate a growing family.  We plan on buying that new house together.  Based on today's numbers, we are looking at homes around $350,000.  

Without getting into too much detail, my boyfriend had an accident as a child and spent many months in and out of hospitals for his injuries.  He luckily is not disabled - he only has scars to show from the accident.  But as a result, he wound up with a settlement payment that he will receive for the rest of his life.

Our ""dream house"" is pretty specific, so listing my house for sale and then hoping we can find our dream home before my house sells seems unrealistic. We most likely will just buy the next house when we find it, and then worry about selling my house afterwards.  As a result, we have agreed that I do not need to have the money in cash for the down payment on our dream house, since he will have the funds available for that. 

My house is currently valued at $230,000 and I owe $170,000 on it.  My monthly payment is $1,400 including taxes (thanks, New York) and my interest rate is 3.625%.  

In terms of my financial situation, I do not have any debt other than my mortgage, so I don't need to use the extra money to pay anything off.  I recently learned more about investing and realized the $10,000 I had in a Money Market account wasn't really going to grow, so I moved it to a different mutual fund account.  So I now have about $10,000 in investments and $25,000 in a savings account. 

I currently see two options:

* Invest the extra $1,000 in the stock market.  I'm not really sure what kinds of returns to expect in a normal stock market account, but have played with some online calculators which used a default 7% rate of return.  This results in $103,000 in six years, including the $10,000 I already have invested, so a net of $93,000.
* Pay $1,000 extra per month towards the principle of my mortgage.  Based on the amortization table I'm using, this would result in my house being paid off in 2029.  If we move around 2026, it means I would owe about $60,000 on my house when I go to sell.  Not knowing what the housing market will do between now and then and just using today's value as a selling price, I would make about $145,000 on the house.  Subtracting the $42,000 I put down when I bought it, this means I would net $103,000.

First of all, do my above calculations seems correct?  Am I missing anything or do any of the details seem off?

Based on these numbers, it seems like I should put the money towards the mortgage, which goes against the advice I typically hear.  I'd appreciate any input.",finance
personalfinance,"Sister needs surgery, no health insurance","My sister recently reached out to me for advice and I thought I'd seek the wisdom of this sub.

My sister began experiencing debilitating pain early this year and has since lost the ability to walk except with a cane.  She got x-rays and apparently has a disc compressing her spine and needs back surgery to fix. Hospital won't schedule the surgery unless she shows proof of insurance or pays for it in advance.

She lives in a state that did not expand Medicaid and prior to covid made too much to qualify for Medicaid and not enough to qualify for an ACA subsidy so she doesn't have insurance.  Also in March she was laid off due to COVID and has been receiving unemployment since.  She recently applied for state medicaid again and was rejected because the state's unemployment income she gets is apparently $83 a month too high to qualify for medicaid.

She is under the impression that if she got approved for Social Security Disability then she would qualify for Medicaid automatically.  She has started the process of applying but has been told it may take a long time to get approved and may not get approved since she's young and her condition should be fixable by surgery.

Options I've come up with:  

* Stop claiming unemployment so she qualifies for medicaid (but then she wouldn't have any income to pay for food, shelter, etc.)  

* Apply for an ACA subsidy and claim her income will be high enough to qualify for an ACA plan with the biggest subsidy.  If the extra $600 a week of unemployment were to continue then her income would end up being that high but I know that's not likely to happen so right now it's really impossible to know what she's going to end up making this year.  She very well could make enough to get above the threshhold.  It's not clear what the consequences would be if she got an ACA plan and subsidy and then did not end up making enough.  Also we would have to get approved for a special enrollment period.  I saw one of the conditions is a change in income.  her income has gone up since the federal unemployment payments started so maybe that would qualify?

* Apply for disability and try to wait until it gets approved and live with the crippling pain until then.  Not a good option since there's no guarantee it will ever get approved and it could take 1 or 2 years even if it did eventually get approved.

personalfinance,tiered responses to the low interest rates?,"Hi all,

I've been seeing a lot of talk about the low interest rates and how people are reacting to them (e.g. take out a loan and buy stocks, thanks r/investing). I'm just hoping to get a small discussion about what people should consider in these times of depressed interest rates. I wouldn't call my family financially illiterate, but they're not educated about it either. It's just never really talked about.

I'm wondering what options might be more appealing with these low interest rates. Like, could we have a short little list like 'what to do with $100,1.000,10.000, or 100.000 in these times? I'm not looking to wholly change my financial situation, I'm just trying to improve my outlook. Like, I hear the interest rates are low but I literally have no response to it, no idea if or how I should respond.

Again, I'm not hoping your advice will get me rich and I'm not looking to make significant changes based upon some internet comments. I just see people talking about 'taking out a loan and buying gold' or other things (again, a lot of talk over on r/investing). I just feel like I could do more than nothing right now, but I don't know what that would look like.

Banking,Fairly simple CD question,"Hoping someone can validate that I have this right. For my final project, I have been asked to code the below CD balance by month.

I went ahead with the latter approach but interestingly, going with the former yields an extra month as coincidentally, the final month before interest is exactly $725:  

&gt;*Assume that you have deposited* ***$5000*** *into a CD \[Certificate of Deposit\] account and that the account allows one withdrawal of* ***$725*** *fixed amount* ***per month*** ***without*** *a withdrawal penalty. The* ***annual*** *interest rate on the CD is* ***3%*** ***compounded monthly****.  In how many months will the CD balance contain less than $725 and what will that amount be?*

I will be taking care of him as well, but he is not at retirement age (58), my grandfather is in his late 70s. My mother will be working, and I will be staying in their home. My grandfather is receiving medicaid. My father has been on permanent disability.

Some background on me, I'm 22, have worked in hospitals and in the health field, but do not have a CNA certification at this time, but I could potentially pursue one. I filed as a dependent last year because I was staying with my parents while in school. I have a bachelors. I will attend school again in January.

I have read that you can get paid to take care of sick family members, which I would like so I can work on my student loans and generally afford to live without completely relying on my parents. I do not plan on caring for my father or grandfather for longer than a year, ideally my father should recover and take care of my grandfather, or my brother who is more financially secure will house and relocate them.

personalfinance,Advice?: refinance balance on variable Heloc to a Fixed rate HELOC for peace of mind. No first mortgage.,"Currently have a Variable HELOC with Third Federal with balance of $65K, current rate variable rate of 2.24% That's all that's owed on house, no first mortgage. House is appraised at 135,000. We took this out this past Nov because our old HElOC which was taken out many years ago to basically payoff original mortgage, had higher rate.While I love this current rate, its still variable, who knows what Prime will be 6 months from now, hell, let alone 3 months from now.Back in Nov, and even now, dont need a line of credit, but here in NY, closing costs on mortgages are insane for such a low amount. Around $4K.

Anyway, there is a local credit union SEFCU that offers a fixed rate HELOC(didnt know such a thing existed) with rates starting at 2.95% Only fee out of pocket is mortgage tax which was $537 back in Nov and Im assuming would be around the same now.. No annual fees. TF charges $65/yr. So Im think of essentially refi and close my home current HELOC. There are no recapture fees with TF if I were to do this.

When I called, was told rates based on credit history/scores. Im at 770-795 depending on agency so I would assume I would end up at 2.95 fixed. based on 15 years with 5 year draw.

We not talking a huge balance and we currently pay $600/month which is what we are comfortable at. We plan on bumping that up to $1K/month soon, just not right now unfortunately.

For peace of mind, Id feel better in a fixed rate, because if prime goes bonkers, Id feel awful watching my variable rate shoot up, who knows how high. Too much uncertainty going on in the world economically.

So in a nutshell, Id be going from 2.24 var to probably 2.95 fixed and an out of pocket cost of around $540 to do so. Since its a HELOC, Id still have the ability to draw on it if needed for 5 years at that rate which is a nice safety net if needed as opposed to a home loan.

Any thoughts? or am I being a worry wart about future prime? anyone know who else offers Fixed rate HELOCs??",finance

So, I'm a college sophomore who became unemployed mid-March due to COVID. While employed between September 2019 - March 2020, I never filed my own taxes, since I wasn't sure if I was supposed to. During this time, I also got a $1k federal student loan. (Sorry for info dumping lol)

Anyway, I've been getting unemployment and for four weeks, I chose not to withhold taxes until now -- I just didn't know what that meant. From what I gathered, for the four weeks I opted not to withhold taxes, I will have to pay the taxes in one go within a small time frame.

I tried going to the IRS website and making an online account in order to check how much I owe but I couldn't verify my identity with the account number from my federal student loan (which is the only document I have).

So now my questions are: who do I turn to in order to find out how much money I owe in taxes?  Am I able to pay the taxes off as quickly as possible so as to avoid owing even more than I decided not to withhold?

Any recommendations?","Long story short, credit was ruined some time ago. I'll leave that story as a foot note for those curious at the end. But now, I'm out of college and trying to build my credit up. I was told I should get a credit card, make regular payments on it as soon as I can, and basically pretend its my debit card (don't spend any money I don't have). 

I am going to apply for one today. But what should I use? I have horrible credit currently, so there's probably some places who wouldn't give me a  card unless they have horrible terms. 

Also, I want ones with interest rates that would be most helpful to my score. 

Any ideas? Someone told me get a credit card from a store like walmart. Other said get it from my regular bank (PNC bank) whom also holds my student loans. 

Who would you recommend? 

And for those curious, I'd ruined my credit because I changed schools midway through college, and apparently my NEW school at the time (they don't do it this way any more) was one of the only schools who won't actually certify that you're currently enrolled until you pay your tuition. I would have my grandma as my cosigner, but she doesn't even own a computer, so in order to get her to cosign, I had to arrange to visit her and do it all for her. It was complicated, so it wasn't unusual for me to pay my tuition late. No biggie, my OLD school would just add like a 50 dollar late fee. Apparently the NEW school I later learned wouldn't report my attendance, so my creditors marked down that i had dropped out of school instead of simply transferring. So a few weeks later, I got a call from my private loan service that I would enter repayment soon. I told them ""no im still in school"" and they asked for proof, which by that time i was able to get, and it was fine. but apparently my federal loans and private loans aren't serviced by the same people (i know this now, but i didn't at the time). Apparently 2 different loan servicing agencies don't share that kind of info. and my FEDERAL loan agency didn't have my correct contact information. So they put me into repayment for months and I had no idea. I finally got a mail notification after some months, and I learned what had happened. It took literally weeks of talking with the department of education to get myself out of delinquency and default. I tried to appeal the negative credit reporting, even went to constituent services in my area to have my local united states representative see if they could help. They could not (fuck you Mike Kelly). So now i'm stuck with the worst credit score my loan officer has ever seen in her entire career. It was like 400 something (now its up in the 500's thankfully, i'm not sure why it increased, maybe just months of not being delinquent). So again, what card should i get to help my credit?",finance

personalfinance,Refinancing: Better interest rate or lower closing costs?,"Refinancing my current home and weighing a couple options on a 200k mortgage.

The bank has a $500 closing cost special on a 7/1 arm at 3% interest. I've never considered an ARM but since it's locked in for 7 years and I'm very confident I'll move in the next 2-6 years I figure it's worth considering. I could also do a $500 closing cost 15yr fixed at 3.5%

Or I can do $4000 in closing cost but lock in a 2.625% on a 15 yr fixed. 

By my math if I move in the next 2-3 years it'd be better to do the ARM and low closing costs, if I end up staying longer it'd be better to do the regular closing and fixed rate. I could also do the ARM now and refinance with a regular in a year if I had a better sense of my timeline, but that's assuming the rates are better then.

Is there anything I'm not considering that should factor into my decision?",finance
personalfinance,What factors should I consider when determining how much to put down for a house?,"Going to be purchasing a home soon, and trying to figure out how much money I should put down.

**Here are the factors I can think about:**

* 20% down needed to avoid PMI insurance
* Low interest rates presents opportunity cost. Possibly, I can invest the money in equities instead 
* How about estimated home appreciation? If the home is expected to appreciate 1% a year, do you consider that?

So, right now I'm thinking that I should consider (mortgate rate + PMI) vs.  (expected equity return), and if expected equity return is higher than the mortgage + PMI, put as little down as I can. 

Am I thinking of this wrong or missing anything?

personalfinance,Rental Property Question,"Good Evening, looking for some advice here on the following scenario:

I own an out of state rental property (can’t sell because of the Neighborhood it’s in) that I get $800 a month for.  The mortgage  balance is just over $57,000 and my current payment is $659 a month with a 4.24% interest rate.   I carry a line of credit on the property that has a balance of $8,000 with a interest rate of 5.25%.   I’m making money on the rental property and the tenant is decent.   I recently switched my landlord insurance and I am saving about $3,000 a year on the policy which is great.   When I got my refund check from the last insurance provider I put $3,500 down on the balance on the line of credit (it was $11,500 at the time) knowing that when they re-evaluated my escrow account I would have to pay the shortage.

My dilemma is I just got my escrow statement and my two options are:

Options 1 - Over 12 months my payment would be $639.69 if I do nothing
Option 2 - If I pay the shortage of $1,896.20 before mid August my new payment would be $481.68, I would take that payout out of my line of credit that has a 5.25% rate.

With the normal $800 a month rent payment I normally make the full mortgage payment and then the remainder is paid fully to the line of credit.

Which option would you take and why?",finance

personalfinance,Refinance for 20 year conventional loan or keep 30 year HSA and make principal payments each month?,"Hi, 

I got an FHA loan for 30 years 2 years ago with an interest rate at 4.375% and now I noticed interest rates are about 3.25% for 20 years or 3.375% for 30 years conventional loans. I did some calculations and it seems like I should switch to a 20 year conventional loan but it's $100 more a month which includes interest. 

I bought my house for $150,000, put a few grand down for down payment and been paying the rest for 2 years. I currently owe about $141,500. The house is worth about $159,000. The banks tell me that the closing costs to back into the loan so essentially I'll be refinancing for $148,500 with I think $500 out of pocket. With that said, the new loan terms would be 3.25% for 20 years and my payment goes up $100. With some online calculators, I save about $8000 over 5 years. 

I heard it's worth it to refinance if I can get more than 1% off interest. The problems I run into are I don't want to pay closing costs again when I just did 2 years ago even though it's added to the loan. My next problem is that I might want to move in 5 years or so because my wife and I are having kids and my house is only a 2 bedroom. We have 1 baby already and could have 2 more within 5 years. 

If I just pay extra in principal every month, would it be better for me than refinancing? It would certainly be easier and still paying off the house faster. 

Thank you",finance
personalfinance,High Yield Savings Accounts Vs Dividend Stocks/ETFs - Emergency Savings,"Hi All,

Wanted to gather your thoughts on courses of action in regards to the old emergency savings. As you well know, rates are low and seemingly likely only getting lower. Some high yield savings accounts have dipped below 1% in August. Of course, investing in stocks carries some degree of risk - That's a given. However, barring a complete collapse like we saw in February into March, do you think it's worth putting those savings in a dividend ETF like Schwab's SCHD, that at least pays you dividends quarterly and has significantly lower risk than individual stocks? It might fluctuate a bit here and there, but like I said, barring a complete and utter collapse, it seems like the slight risk is worth making next to nothing in a HYSA. Or, are you firmly in the camp that says if it's for an emergency and you might need the cash within 3 years, just take the low interest rate with 0 risk?",finance

personalfinance,401k/Roth IRA Investing Advice for a 23 Year Old. Help me!!,"First off, I hope everyone is safe and doing well!

I recently turned 23 and graduated college with a finance degree this past December, and just started my career in banking this January. I am enrolled in my companies 401k and making Roth contributions (their contributions of 3% go into a pre-tax 401k). My contribution percentage varies as different things come up, but I consistently put a minimum of 6% (to get my full 3% match (crappy I know)) and sometimes go up to around 20%-40% contributions. I currently have around $4000, which I am very proud of.

I am a believer in low-cost index funds, but want to be diversified as much as possible to get the maximum return. I like the idea of dividend paying stocks and/or bonds to give myself income within the investments, but really just want my plan to do the best it can. I am attaching my current investment percentages along with future elections and my options.  I just changed my future elections, so that is why they do not line up with my balances.

I enjoy seeing other peoples strategies and learning from others, even in a field I feel fairly knowledgeable in. Any and all advice is completely appreciated!

personalfinance,TIFU by filing PUA and UI,"So we're clear, UI is Unemployment, PUA is the special Pandemic Unemployment Assistance.

February, I quit my job (even gave em two weeks) and left for Navy boot camp. It sucked and they sent me home because depression and what was termed as suicidal ideation. I have a reenlistment code so I can join back up later, which is my plan in about a year's time. 

I got back home to my wife late April. I file for unemployment with Nevada, where I reside and rent an apartment. The company I worked for previously had a 401k and I was not following the prime directive and invested heavily into it, then pulled it out leaving behind 20% for tax purposed but taking advantage of the CARES act addendum that allowed no further penalties. Ended up paying off two credit cards and saving the rest. 

End of may rolls around and my previous work still isn't hiring me back. Throw around JAG and Federal Law and still nothing. 

Go figure. 

I call and call and unemployment can't seem to figure out from my submitted DD214 that I no longer worked for that previous company when I went to Chicago. 

Ok. 

So they actually tell me keep filing for UI, but also try PUA and maybe the claim will go through faster. 

I've been keeping us afloat on PUA, even manage to have some savings for the first time in years. Get a call two days ago from UI that they finally have somebody call me to confirm yes I did leave my job to pursue a military career and I did actually quit working to go to Chicago for two months.

So: how screwed am I? I reactivated my UI claim as it lapsed and they did decide that I am eligible for UI but that my separation from the Navy was other than honorable even though it's not dishonorable since it's entry-level separation. 

My thought here is that if they do indeed send me notice to pay the PUA money back, it'll just be exactly as much as I would have gotten from UI, and I would just give them that money, no harm no foul. And technically, I was kept from working a job because of the pandemic. The company I worked for wasn't hiring anyone and they've been draggin ass hiring me back when they did start rehires. Literally been since mid-June they said they were going to start rehires. 

As of right now, I have a temp job making $4 less than previous job and I start work Monday. 

I know I kinda fucked my retirement by the amt I pulled to keep myself and my wife afloat but it was literally necessary and I only write it here to give a sense of the jam I've been in. 

Will they ask I repay PUA? How screwed am I?",finance

personalfinance,Should I follow through with this refinance?,"I have 20-21 years left on my FHA mortgage at a fixed rate of **4.25%**. With interest rates being so low, I checked in with my bank for a refinance and they offered me a 15 or 30 year loan at a fixed rate of **2.875%**. I need to do an FHA streamline refinance because I started my own business over a year ago and therefore do not have the financial history to get a regular mortgage.

The plus side is I will save about $175 per month in just interest alone. The loan representative I was working with on the refinance crunched the numbers and if I kept making the same monthly payments I'm currently making, I would pay off the mortgage in 13.5 years.

The downside is because it is an FHA streamline, it will start my PMI insurance over again. I pay about $101 a month for it and have about 7-8 years left to pay on it. With the new refinance, I will have to restart the 11 years required to pay this. I also have to pay closing costs of $2,800 for the refinance.

I was thinking of going with the 30 year option. This will make my monthly payment $300 less (I'm currently paying just under $1,500). I can keep making the same payment and pay the loan off much quicker or use that $300 per month and invest it somewhere more beneficial. A lower payment option will also help if I ever run into any lean months.

personalfinance,Debt Management Post-Divorce,"So I finally wrapped up my divorce last week and am trying to get my head around my finances.  My main concern is debt.  Ex lost her job due to COVID so rather than splitting our credit card debt as I had been assuming we would I was stuck with all of it.  I'll lay out the numbers and then some of my thoughts on moving forward.

CREDIT CARDS: $16,800 @ $365/mo

Discover It, $4830 @ $100/mo
Chase Freedom, $3800 @ $35/mo
Capital One, $3433 @ $101/mo
Home Depot, $2790 @ $93/mo
Kohls, $1937 @ $35/mo


Auto Loan (2016 Honda Civic, 105k miles)
$12,400 @ $330/mo 

Studen Loans
$18,500 @ $450/mo

Income: $5475 (this is estimated on my median paycheck for this year)
Expenses: $2026 + $2516 (Child Support+Alimony)
Disposable: $900/mo

So first things, none of the credit cards have been or are being used.  I was instructed by my lawyer to freeze/lock them and only make minimum payments during the year my divorce was in progress.  We assumed my ex would take roughly half the debt.  Had I known I'd be stuck with all of it I would have started paying it down from day 1.    
My student loan payment is currently based on last year's taxes and I made way, way more money than anticipated due to overtime.  I know for sure this payment will come down due to my adjusted income, just not sure how much yet.  

Right now my thoughts are to consolidate the CCs, pay the car down to 10K or under and refi for a lower monthly payment and contact FedLoan to have the student loan payment adjusted.  I think between refinancing the car and lowering the student loan payment I could net another $300 +/- a month.  I want to pay the CCs down to hit a 30% usage rate (I'm at 40% currently), then take a break and divert some money to my emergency account which I used to pay my lawyer throughout the divorce as well as settle some debt with my ex.  As far as my income goes I can always figure out ways to work in some extra OT, I have a $1.00/hr raise coming in the fall so I'm not overly concerned about that; I do have a fair bit of money left over each month at the moment, the main reason is I'm living rent-free currently (although that situation is becoming untenable).  

Let me know what you all think about the current plan.

Edit:  My credit score is around 730",finance

**Text:**

U.S. air-safety regulators will weigh public comments before issuing a final order that will allow passenger service after two fatal crashes.

U.S. air-safety regulators for the first time publicly spelled out the full range of hardware, software, crew training and maintenance changes they are proposing before Boeing Co.’s 737 MAX jets will be allowed to resume flying passengers.

The 36-page document released Monday—filled with detailed technical explanations and multiple new emergency checklists for pilots—had been expected. Many of the four proposed design changes and extra equipment tests largely track the various safety enhancements Federal Aviation Administration officials began crafting even before the MAX was grounded globally in March 2019, following two fatal crashes that took 346 lives.

Still, the proposal marks a decisive moment for the MAX fleet, along with Boeing and its airline customers, because it signals that the FAA, foreign regulators and the company have reached consensus on the most important fixes and controversial technical details.  Subject to a 45-day public comment period and what is likely to be weeks of additional FAA analysis and responses, Monday’s move appears to keep the MAX on track for what government and industry officials project could be a return to widespread commercial service by early next year.


Before that can occur, however, the FAA will wait for the results of a series of independent technical reviews, simulator tests by international pilots and further public comments on specific pilot-training requirements. Those simulator sessions are projected to begin in three weeks at Boeing’s pilot-training facilities at Gatwick Airport outside London, according to one person familiar with the details, though the timetable could slip.

A Boeing spokesman said: “While we still have a lot of work in front of us, this is an important milestone in the certification process.”

The document technically covers only 73 Max airliners registered to U.S. carriers. But with few exceptions, foreign regulators and carriers appear poised to go along with the proposal for some 400 aircraft Boeing previously delivered around the world. Regulators in Canada, the European Union and Brazil, who have been most closely involved in the deliberations, are expected to follow the FAA’s lead.

Another roughly 450 of the planes, which haven’t been delivered to airlines, are expected to be subject to the same requirements before they can enter service. And jets rolling off the assembly line also will have to incorporate the eventual modifications.

As part of the FAA’s action, the agency released an extensive companion report indicating the lessons learned from what it described as more than 60,000 hours of work by some 40 agency experts, including pilots and engineers, including analysis of some 4,000 hours of flight and simulator sessions. In addition to the design failures and improper assumptions about pilot reaction time that played roles in both crashes, the report notes that the FAA has resolved “additional safety concerns beyond those identified during the accident investigations.”

The FAA outlined additional checklists to be used in dealing with unreliable airspeed, as well as pilots relying on more automation when halting a descent toward landing and then climbing away from a runway. In one of the more unusual features of the proposal, the FAA suggests that under some circumstances, it may require both pilots to manually crank a control wheel in the cockpit to raise the aircraft’s nose.

Between them, the two documents cover issues that have been central to the MAX’s safety shortcomings, from automated flight-control systems prone to dangerously misfire to inoperative cockpit warnings to hazardous wiring that could cause electric short-circuits. The FAA, as expected, also proposed adding a safeguard by requiring both of the MAX’s flight-control computers to operate simultaneously.

In addition, agency experts want enhanced sensor tests and “an operational readiness flight prior to returning each airplane to service.”


A major goal of the safety effort is to provide pilots more timely and clear-cut information, cockpit warnings and memorized emergency procedures in the event of sensor malfunctions or other system failures. By reducing pilot workload in emergencies—and eliminating the cacophony of conflicting warnings such as those crews experienced before the dual crashes—the FAA aims to dramatically enhance the fleet’s safety.

The FAA is proposing revisions to checklists pilots use in various emergencies, such as when they face contradictory cockpit readings and alerts.

Under the proposed changes, for instance, pilots would use a revised checklist for an emergency known as a runaway stabilizer, which can unexpectedly push the plane’s nose down without pilot commands.

The new procedure would include memorized steps, such as one pertaining to thumb switches the pilot can use to level the aircraft’s nose. Pilots’ inability to recover using these switches were at issue in the two MAX accidents.

The MAX crisis has eroded trust in the Chicago plane maker among many customers, regulators and passengers, while sparking a flurry of federal criminal, civil and congressional investigations that are still under way.

I am a US citizen and almost all of my family is except one. I need to disburse a sum to this family member residing outside of the USA. I read that 401k and pension accounts need to be rolled over to the beneficiary's IRA or it incurs a 20% federal income tax.


Is it possible to roll over the disbursement into an IRA for a foreign national or is a lump sum the only choice? I also read that if the 20% federal income tax is collected, a tax return must be filed for that year even if the person is a foreign national. Where would I find a CPA specializing in this niche?

personalfinance,Should I pay off a no interest loan or make a partial payment towards an interest loan.,"I am getting a bonus and looking to pay off some debt.  My father is a CPA and he really wants me to pay off a couch loan.  A while back me and the wife bought a couch from Rooms 2 Go and we qualified for a loan with no interest rate.  It's been automatically taking $40 a month out and has about 1.5 years left.  My father thinks I should use my bonus to pay off this loan.  I feel that having a loan with constant payments like this is good for my credit score.  The fact that there is no interest doesn't really give me any incentive to pay it off immediately.  I think it is far more valuable to leave it as a credit score booster.  I feel like I should use that money towards one of our car loans or mortgage.

personalfinance,Private Student Loan Debt,"$100k Student Loans

North East, USA

I made the stupid decision at 18 to get a bachelors degree after I finished high school. I attended a respectable state school and to get a discount on instate tuition. I dormed my first year and commuted every year subsequently, it took me 4 and a half years to complete my degree in a Social Science. 

As of January 2020 I have graduated with over $110,000 in student loan debt. My family was unable to assist me with any tuition but they were above the threshold to qualify for much financial aid. As of such I had to apply for private student loans through discover my interest rates vary per loan but the highest rate is 13% and my lowest is 8%. I owe $87,000 to Discover Student Loans and owe the federal government $20,000. My grace period is up as of August and after trying to negotiate with Discover the best they can help me with is $800 a month in interest only payments for six months. I cannot meet this in my current situation

I am fortunately employed and make $47,000 a year. $2800 a month after taxes. I owe $200 a month on car insurance, $500 on car payments. I need the car and cannot get rid of it, I commute over 700 miles a week and need something reliable for work. I spend about $200 a month on gas and another $300 on tolls. 

I have credit cards bills equaling around $3000 combined. As well as an out standing personal loan for $10,000 at 22% interest which costs me $300 a month. I tried to refinance but no luck. I live at home but i’m engaged and we want to move out of our parents household when we’re married, which will probably be in a year time. I don’t think I’ll be able to afford any actual wedding.

My consolidation and refinance rates for my private student loans is 6% for 20 years at approximately $900 a month. I highly doubt I’ll be able to pay off my undergraduate degree by even then.

These private loans student loans are killing me. My family can’t help me. And i’m on the edge of a cliff here. I don’t want to be a slave to debt for the next 20 years of my life but it’s not looking like i have many options. I’m banking on income based payments to help me for the federal loans because if they start asking for repayment then i’m royally fucked.

I am 23 with at least $150k in total debt. I feel like my only options are to jump off a cliff or flee the country. Although i’m open to other suggestions. My fiancé doesn’t like the idea of getting a second job despite all this as i likely won’t have time to see her since we live an hour away from one another. I’m not working in an industry in which I even studied so there’s little room for advancement and it’s impossible looking for other jobs in this economy, especially with my degree.

I feel like there’s going to be an influx of you should’ve known better or understood what you were getting yourself into and to be honest I should have. But now i’m just trying to fix this mess.

cybersecurity,Without sounding too obnoxious and pretentious.,"**TLDR: M.S. in infosec, Don't want to go take sec+ because a high school graduate can take that exam without exp. Maybe my $40k student loan proves that I'm familiar with infosec. What materials should I read or classes to take, tools to practice on to get a job remotely in this pandemic world?**  


  


  
Not sure how to start this post, but let me state some facts. Months are estimates.  


2007 - Graduated my BS, Majored in Forensics  
2010 - Cert in Computer (Related in A+/network+ cert)  
Mid 2014 - I learned about cybersecurity and started to take some CEH classes  
End 2015 - Got hired in ops team, level 2 tech support in an R&amp;D tech  
Mid 2016 - Started MS in Cybersecurity   
(Transferred to Security Operations Center same company \^, project management and trainer)  
End 2018 - Graduated MS in Cybersecurity   
Start 2019 - Present - Got very sick, had to start working from home. From \^ and became gig worker in cybersecurity lost job because of COVID. Thanks, COVID!  


\- Types of gig jobs (All remote)  
More SOC experience (Endpoint Security a little SEIM)  
Wrote Risk Analysis  
Wrote Articles (Ghost Writer)  


I don't have any certs but I'm thinking of taking some classes (again???!!) Just to renew/reboot knowledge. But it's not like I just left cybersecurity. But most work that I did was non-technical.  


I guess my questions are:  


Should I start thinking about the CISSP? But what benefit will that give me? I was reviewing before and was ready to take the exam, but it looked useless since I was going to end up with an Associate.   


Should I take Security+ instead? But what benefit will that give me? Entry-level Cert.

I don't want to work in government. I feel like certs (CISSP, CEH, Sec+) plague the feds more than it does private companies so I'd rather stay in private. Plus I really don't want to waste $900 CISSP on a cert just to prove that the hiring manager and I speak the same language. Maybe my $40k student loan proves that I am familiar and knowledgable of infosec, instead of a $300 sec+ cert that any a high school graduate can take without any exp? Maybe 2 years of research to get a goddamn MS in infosec is proof enough that I know things in infosec and not a total newbie in the field.  


Instead of mindlessly reviewing for an exam for 1 month, I'd rather use tools, or learn new tech that I can show to hiring managers that I can work remotely. Etc.   


Any tips on how to look for remote jobs on the interwebs? Any tips on what tools to relearn? What classes to take? Where should I restart? At this point, I don't care what job to take, I'll take the lowest-paid job you can think of.  I don't care anymore. Something to do so I can use this goddamn M.S.   


P.S. Lets see how many Sec+ I'll trigger with my post. Not stepping on your cert bruv, I might end up taking it anyway even if I loathe the idea.",technology

Didn’t realize until doing this that I’ve freed up over $500/mo and raised my income $13k/year! Feeling pretty proud right now! I also have eating out in my budget but it’s extremely low compared to what I was spending last year. Basically, I throw an additional $1,300-$1,700/mo at debt right now on top of the minimum payments.

In a year, I’ve learned a ton about personal finance. I now know I need to focus on the whole amount of my debts rather than just their monthly payments, which I was trying to avoid looking at. I didn’t put it in that post but at that point I was $118,500 in debt at 26. Since then, I’ve slowly chipped away and am down to $104,000 and just turned 27.

I’ve mostly followed the Dave baby steps but have recently decided that after my final credit card is gone (est. October 2020), I’d like to save for a $5k minimum emergency fund rather than $1k (started to consult the flowchart in this sub rather than being a stickler with the baby steps), and then I plan on attacking my car loan. I’m fine having a larger car loan - I’m not planning on getting rid of my car until it dies.

Once my car loan is gone (or down to the final 10 payments, I’ve read mortgage lenders can choose not to count this toward your DTI if you have less than 10 payments left?), I’ll only have my student loan debt, which is still hefty but more manageable. At that point, my federal loans will also be out of in-school deferment (est. March 2021), so I’ll have to pay \~$250/mo. Once I only have the student loans left, I’d like to save for a down payment on a house and then start attacking my student loans once again. 

I should also mention that refinancing has been my friend. I refinanced my car loan in June and it went from a 6.4% interest at $450/mo to a 3.96% interest at $416/mo. I also refinanced my private student loan in January from a 7.4% interest at $350/mo to a 6.7% interest at $232/mo. I’d like to get that interest rate lower - I’ll probably look around again in January 2021 or so.

I’m also considering putting my monthly bills (ie. phone bill, internet) on my paid off credit cards and then having an automatic payment every month from the checking account I usually pay them with. I’m thinking that would be a good way to bank some rewards plus keep them open for my credit score so when I apply a mortgage, I’ll be in good shape. This time last year I wouldn’t have done this because I didn’t trust myself with credit but I feel much more responsible now. Thoughts?

I just wanted to say thank you to this sub! Honestly it’s because of this sub that my finances have turned around.

However, last night I checked it and saw that it was pretty good, I'd kinda forgotten about it and it was sorta like finding a bunch of money you'd forgotten under your couch cushions.

One thing I noticed though was that my interest rate on the account was just above 0% a year, so it's not really doing anything other than sitting there. I've been toying with the idea of basically putting a lot of it into shares of the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF, and then placing a stop-loss order on it at, or slightly under, the price I buy in at. I've already got a separate retirement account, maxed out on employer contributions. And I don't exactly want to put this in fund with a target date or something similar. I'd prefer to view this as a kind of medium-term savings account I can tap relatively easily if I need/want to.

My thinking is, if there's a decline in value then my stop loss order would kick in and shield me from all or most of the losses, so I'm about even or no worse off than leaving it in my savings account. If there's a almost no gain, I'd at least get the dividend yield from the money in it (which is currently about 1.74%, still higher than my savings account). And if there is a gain then I'd reap the benefits of the added value in addition. 

I'm not planning on dumping in all my savings into something like this, just wondering if there's some downside I'm not seeing or don't understand. Also, I've got my retirement accounts maxed out so it's not like I'm missing any potential gains there. Appreciate any help or advice!",finance
personalfinance,"First-time home buyer, confused about pre-approval terms","Hi all,

My fiancé and I are in the market to purchase our first home together. We submitting an application for pre-approval back in January and were approved for a non-agency mortgage for a 30-year fixed loan at 3.725% interest. It was good for three months, and we ended up letting it lapse because we couldn't find anything that excited us enough. In July, we decided to start again, and so we used the same lender as before. About a month later, we received a counter-offer that said the original product is no longer offered, and essentially changed the terms from a non-agency at 3.725% to an agency mortgage at 3%. We signed and were just pre-approved today.

At the time, my research led me to believe that this was a good thing, since 3% is a lot lower than 3.725% over the life of the loan. The fact that it was changed from a non-agency to an agency loan struck me immaterial to us as the borrower (based on my very limited understanding of the two types).

My fiancé has done her own research and now thinks that we should seek a pre-approval from someone else. She has read that agency loans are used for high-risk borrowers, and require mortgage insurance that can amount to as much as 2-3% of the total loan amount. Since we have no problem paying the down-payment amount, and both have secure employment, with some savings to cover potential periods of unemployment, she believes that we should be able to get better terms elsewhere.

While I don't disagree with shopping around, I feel like we are a bit in over our heads in terms of financial literacy. Is she correct that we will need mortgage insurance, and if so, is the implication that we would only need mortgage insurance for an agency loan correct? Am I correct to assume that any non-agency loan would likely require a higher interest rate as it is by definition riskier for the lender? Is it simply a matter of doing the math to compare whether the mortgage insurance is greater than or less than the difference in interest paid over the life of the two loans?",finance

personalfinance,Wells Fargo Double Reported Credit Card to Credit Reporting Agency,"Yesterday morning I received a notification from Credit Karma that a new Wells Fargo account was opened. I had opened a 0% interest card back in March, so was surprised to see this message now in August. I then open the app, see that my credit score has dropped by 30 points, and then read Credit Karma’s statement that it had “found no changes to my Equifax report”.

I thought that was odd and maybe just an error by Credit Karma but wanted to make sure, so I then opened an account with Experian to verify the accounts reported on my credit bureau report. **Come to find out, my Wells Fargo credit card was reported twice. One account reported my statement balance from two statements ago. The other account reported my most recent statement balance.** I tried to file a dispute with Equifax online but their system gave me a message stating it was currently down and for me to call their help line.

**After speaking with a representative from Experian, he verified that it indeed was a duplicate account; as he noted both accounts had the same account number and the similarity in balances.** I filed a dispute with him and he then recommended me calling Wells Fargo to file a dispute, which I then did. If it isn’t resolved quickly, I’ll file a complaint with the CFPB.

**This all comes at a very unfortunate time, as I was planning on applying for pre-approval on a mortgage this week.** A 30 point drop in my credit score adversely effects the interest rate on a mortgage, significantly raising the interest expenses on said mortgage over an extended period.

**While my career has been spent on the commercial side of Credit, I’m no expert in consumer credit regulations and the recourses available. Does anyone have any recommended courses of action to expedite having Wells Fargo’s mistake corrected?**",finance
personalfinance,Investment Property - Refinance Help,"Hello - I'm wondering which is the better refi scenario to go with below and why.

Existing Investment Property: Loan balance is $96k at 5.125% interest rate on a 30 year loan maturing 4/1/2039. The current monthly payment is $691 and $267 is principal and $413 interest.

&amp;#x200B;

Lender 1 Refi: 3.25% interest on a 30 year fixed w/ total closing costs of $4,997 ($4,261 in closing and $736 in prepaid interest). Monthly payment of $444/mo. ($168 P and $276 Int.)

Lender 2A Refi (on $100k loan balance instead of $96k): 3.625% interest on a 30 year fixed w/ total closing costs \~$4,000. Monthly payment of $474/mo ($160 in P and $314 in Int.)

Lender 2B Refi (""...""):  3.375% interest on a 15 year fixed w/ total closing costs of $4,000. Monthly payment of $737/mo. ($444 in P and $293 in Int.)

Lender 2 also has 1 point options for 30 year and 15 year.

&amp;#x200B;

The plan is to keep the investment property in the family for generations, so we don't plan on selling, maybe a 30 year makes more sense because of this? This would also be better for short-term returns. Looks like both lenders wrapped financing costs into the loans, is this normal? Lender 1 has points, I've heard generally paying points is a bad idea?

Thank you for any help.",finance
personalfinance,Choosing between snowball and avalanche in regards to student loans,"Hello. I have joined reddit just to ask you all this question (on the suggestion of a housemate). 

To put it in round numbers and rounding up a bit, I have $165K of student loans, mostly from graduate school (and I would not be making what I presently do without the degree I have). When I began replaying my student loans in late 2015, I was an hourly employee but have since become salaried. I started out with fifteen loans of varying amounts and interest rates , but while I am on the income-based repayment plan, I have tried to budget 'extra' payments for as many months as I am able to. If I get a trip reimbursement from work, that goes to my student loans. If I get an unexpected amount of money, that goes to my student loans. My tax refund goes to student loans. But even after nearly five years of paying on my loans, I owe more than when I started, which is deeply frustrating. I've been using the snowball method because it feels amazing when I get rid of a loan completely.

When the pandemic relief dropped most of my loans into forbearance but I was still earning my regular amount (while working remotely), I strategized as best I could and paid off one loan and brought accrued but uncapitalized interest down to zero on all but three of the loans (the total of the remaining interest is about $18,000). 

So I have brought the number of loans down from fifteen to ten. Nine of the remaining loans are serviced by Nelnet (two of which are D loans and the rest are E loans, all of which are on the IBR plan); the tenth loan is serviced by ECSI and has a standard monthly payment of $40.00 (it is my smallest remaining loan, at less than $2000). The remaining interest rates (excluding the ECSI loan) range from 3.4% to 7.210% (and that 7.210% is on my largest loan from graduate school, which explains how it's accrued nearly $8800 in interest).

Here is how things presently stand each month:

* Present monthly take-home: $3900
* Present monthly payment (Nelnet, IBR): $413.78
* Monthly standard loan payment (ECSI, standard): $40.00
* Essential bills (including my 1/3 portion of rent, utilities, insurance, etc): $1123.84
* Emergency fund addition: $50 \[emergency fund is nearly at $3000\]
* Gas for vehicle: $120-$150 \[though I've been saving here since I've been working remotely, but that won't last forever\]
* Food (including restaurants): $550 \[probably could reduce this but I would need to have more resources on eating healthfully BUT cheaply\]
* Subscriptions (Newspaper, streaming service, gym membership): \~$300 \[it fluctuates depending on what's due when\]
* The rest is split up among housewares, pet supplies, unexpected life expenses (such as wedding gifts), and the additional loan payment (which ranges from $120-$150)

When I was directed here by my housemate, I used the unbury tool linked in the wiki (using the monthly payment amounts in the loan summaries, which is decidedly *not* the IBR amount) and was dismayed to find that an actual 'minimum payment' would be nearly $1870 a month and that, using those amounts, I wouldn't be paying off this debt until mid-2030, regardless of which method I used (which is the question that the flowchart was saying I needed to figure out). \[And by 'dismayed' I mean I burst into tears.\]

I was thinking of paying off the ECSI loan completely (as it's now my smallest loan), but it's steadily working its way to being paid off, and the next smallest is one of the ones at 6.8%. I don't know if tackling the smaller loans (which, excluding the ECSI one, range from $3400 to $5500) would be better than throwing everything I can at the biggest one, which has a lot of accrued interest and the highest interest rate.

With the job I presently have, it's difficult to have enough time to really have a second or third job, so I was considering doing some freelance work (but then I wondered at what point that sort of work requires me to do self-employment taxes). 

*I have no other debt. It's just the student loans. But it's way way too much.*

I guess by all this I am wondering:

* Does it matter which method I use to keep tackling my loans? The wiki says this subreddit leans towards tackling the higher interest ones but if I were to do that, it means it would feel like I wasn't making a lot of progress for a long time.
* Where could I possibly 'trim fat' from my budget? If in the food section, then how do I ensure that I can eat healthfully while not breaking the bank? If elsewhere, how do I make sure that I am not completely miserable while paying this all off? 
* How do I not despair about this?
* Where could I find freelance work to do? The first thing off the top of my head is that I can do writing and editing, but I don't even know where to look for that sort of thing.",finance

I’ve calculated I have a cushion to throw an extra $1K toward any one of these. I’ve come to three outcomes:

(1) Continue investments with the $1K/mo and make it $2K/mo;

(2) Pause investments and push for $2K + $400 each month on the cards, knocking them out in 4-5 months;

(3) Pause investments and push for the same $2400/mo in (2) plus the $525/mo toward student loans, knocking those out in a little over a year.

I feel like (2) makes the most sense because I’ll beat the 0% grace period, and I’ll have an extra $400/mo to invest.

I was doing Dave Ramsey, but with my private loans being so low in interest, I feel the need to catch up with other places. If I keep paying only 1,000 a month, I will be done in 5 years. I plan to keep most of my savings and investments the same but put my increased income towards paying the private loans quicker.

Saving is a lot, but I want to practice paying yourself first. I will have a few more significant items (bike, weddings, trip) this next year if the pandemic allows.

I have not been paying my federal loans while they are paused, but will have to work that into the budget if there isn't another bill. Most likely, this will be from savings and acorns, until my pay raise this Jan.

I feel like I am really, really, really, behind for 28. I think focusing on paying debt and growing wealth at the same time is ideal- but also understand paying down debt is a guaranteed return.

I really want to settle on a plan and let it ride- I know only time will get me out of the hole, but it feels like it is going to take forever.",finance
personalfinance,(FIN) 5% interst savings account - Should I put money anywhere else?,"(TLDR at bottom of post)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 18, moving out to college in a week and a half. I live and will study in Finland, where college is free. Previously, I haven't really had much personal finance to manage but I got a job for the summer and since I'm moving out of my parents place, I figure I ought to get my shit together when it comes to managing my money. During my time studying, my income won't be gigantic, I still intend to live frugally and have some left over to save each month if possible. The government pays each student 250 eur a month in study assistance, plus rent/living assistance, the sum of which depends on your rent (for me, about 200 as my rent is dirt cheap). Others who live in the center of the capital may get up to 400 I've heard.).

 In Finland, there are also student loans backed by the government. This loan is 650/month. The interest on the student loan is extremely low (about 0.48 percent from my bank right now.) Many students use this to live off of, either because they have no other choice, or because they just live a lifestyle of spending alot (drinking, partying, eating out, etc.). I don't intend on doing this, instead I plan on saving and investing this money. Also, if you complete your studies on time, you get some of the loan forgiven for free (around 7000 eur is the maximum.)

In Finland, we don't have any roth IRA or 401k. However, for younger people saving up for a home (usually apartment) to buy, there is the option of an ´[asp-account](https://www.nordea.fi/en/personal/our-services/savings-investments/savings-accounts/asp-account.html)'. The asp-account is a savings account for your first apartment, with 1 percent interest annually, plus 4 percent for the first 5 years after opening the account. (Coincidentally, my university is a 5 year program, 3+2 for bachelor and masters) Once your asp-account contains at least 10% of the cost of the property you intend to buy, the bank will loan you the rest of the money, currently up to around 180k euros. This sort of account is offered by all banks. The maximum you can put into an asp-account is 3000 euros per quarter, and the minimum is 150. The main requirement is that you use the money you save to your asp account, and the loan that you're given, to purchase your first home. 

So obviously this asp-account seems like a great option, especially with otherwise historically low interest rates, and it would basically let me buy an apartment right out of college if I play my cards right, don't spend too much, and get work during the summer and save the money I earn. My question is whether I should put money anywhere else, and if so, where? The other obvious one seems to be index funds, which I think give a return of about 8-10 percent, which would be even higher than the asp-account. The caveat there is that they're not as secure as this asp-account, and with all the apocalyptic talks of the stock market, plus some people talking about an [index fund bubble](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocJH1HRR09g), it seems scary. Additionally, investing gains get taxed whereas asp-interest doesn't. 

Should I diversify, and if so, how much of my income and where? The asp-account will be my primary place to save extra money as I want to buy an apartment at as young an age as possible, but diversification may be smart anyhow.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I'm an 18 year old college student living in Finland. I want to save and manage my finances. The bank here offers an ""asp"" account with a 5 percent interest on the first 5 years after opening, with the idea of spending the money you saved there on your first home. Once you've saved 10 percent of the price of the home onto the asp-account, the bank loans you the rest. I'm wondering if it's worth putting money into anything else, e.g. index funds, or if this is the best possible option and I should put everything I can onto the asp-account as the interest is very good, especially for todays standard. The only caveat with the asp-account is that you can't use the money on anything else.

personalfinance,"About to take out ~$50,000 in student loans: should I pick variable or fixed APR?","I am starting a program this fall for which I will be taking out roughly 50k in student loans. Financial aid dept has indicated that I will be able to get around 18k in stafford/federal loans which I will take. The remaining 32k I am looking at private student loans. 

I am wondering whether or not I should select a variable or fixed APR for this private student loan of 32k. I am leaning towards variable as it is a lower rate and I intend to pay off the loan in &lt;2 years. However, I really don't know how much variable rates move generally. Is it possible it could jump past what a fixed rate would have been/I would be paying more? Or can I assume variable will stay roughly where it is over 1.5-2 years. 

Some relevant details: the length of the program is 15 months (accelerated BSN). This will be my 2nd bachelors - I have no previous student loans or loans of any kind. I will be working very little once the program starts and therefore will defer my loans until graduation.",finance

stocks,The next rally for beaten down stocks,"Beginning June 11 many beaten down stocks/industries have been going sideways or faced a mild downtrend. Take a look at stocks like JWN, NCLH, WFC, MGM, DENN... highly volatile before June 11 but mostly going steady, after. I have no idea when the next big rally for stocks like these will come but it’s bound to arrive eventually. Why? Because there’s more good news to come. Stimuli packages, FED money printing, decreasing infection curves, more going stuff going back to normal and of course hopefully someday a vaccine. 

The way I see it, the tech bubble may burst.. I’m not willing to take that risk. I’d rather stay sideways or take a little hit facing a slow descend while I wait for a huge rally to arrive. Then I’ll probably sell and switch to tech then because my guess the two may coincide; tech could go down when these other beaten down stocks go up.

science,"Science Discussion Series: We are mental health professionals and researchers with expertise in Black mental health, racial identity, and race-based trauma. Let’s discuss!","[Hi reddit](https://i.imgur.com/DGWqasT.png)! For far too long, the mental health profession has taken a race-blind approach to treatment, research, and conceptualizing human behavior. The result has been that Black people and other people of color are underrepresented in psychological research, and are subsequently assumed to have similar experiences, adversities, cultural backgrounds, and reactions to treatment as do their White counterparts. White experiences and behaviors are often the assumed normative default, leading to mental health disparities both in who has access to mental health treatment, and who feels understood and represented in both research and treatment. We are practitioners and researchers whose work focuses on these long-neglected areas. 

As mentioned in a [previous announcement post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/comments/h0afge/rscience_affirms_that_black_lives_matter_heres/), the moderators of /r/science have worked in collaboration with the moderators of /r/blackpeopletwitter and /r/blackladies to create this series of discussion panels focused on race in America. These panels will be led by subject area specialists including scientists, researchers, and policy professionals so that we can engage with multiple expert perspectives on those important topics.

gaming,Higher rear volume in 5.1 games,"It is an old problem for me and happens across different pcs and consoles but i am fed up

Whenever i play a game on ps4 or pc with surround sound, the rear speakers volume are much higher than the front ones (the headphones too) 

Take Sekiro as an example, whenever i am standing infront of a bonfire the fire sound is faint from the front speakers, once i turn 180 degree the fire comes from the rear speakers with much higer volume 2x the front ones or more

My pc and ps4 setup, 1080ti gpu, hdmi, windows 10, 5.1 windows setting, denon x1300 receiver connected to a jbl 5.1 system, all windows sound enhancements turned off, receiver dynamic volume turned off/on

Is this normal?! I can lower the rear speakers volume to match the front but i feel the result is not consistent and that some sounds are amplified from within the game not the av receiver, also it is a hassle to do this than cancel it whenever i want to watch a movie

I would appreciate if someone tried sekiro and told me whether he has the same problem or not, it is not present in sekiro only but sekiro's bonfire sound is a fine example for the problem",technology

I didn't change anything else on it. I haven't changed my tax elections or 401k info.

Message from TransUnion on Healthy America:

In a world forever changed by the COVID-19 crisis, we’re committed to protecting American lives. TransUnion and its US-based healthcare technology partners have developed HealthyAmericaTM. This unique solution enables people to securely share test results, helping businesses, schools and consumers assess risks stemming from COVID-19 and interact in a safe, confident manner.
HealthyAmerica combines the power of TransUnion’s identity and fraud solutions, clinical data management capabilities of SiriusIQ, and business transformation assets of UST Global — together forming CLX Health, LLC. By leveraging and deploying our existing technology in a way consumers and businesses can readily adopt, it will be easier to mitigate risk in everyday interactions while maintaining individual privacy. Going forward, we expect airlines, large event organizers, restaurants and others will leverage the tool — which will easily adapt to changes in science parameters, including the evolution of a seasonal vaccine.
(https://solutions.transunion.com/healthy-america/?=undefined)

What Healthy America is:

CLX Health LLC, a joint venture company, has developed the HealthyAmericaTM mobile application to be deployed as a key component of the HealthyAmericaTM Solution Architecture and Database. The CLX Consortium of partner companies have come together to manage the spread of COVID-19 and other viruses by accessing real-time laboratory testing data for operational business and consumer decision support, ultimately allowing the economy to scale back up to capacity.
Utilizing existing technology and infrastructure critical to delivering a solution now, the CLX Consortium has network access to over 1 million physician offices, 22 largest by volume clinical laboratories, 40 major hospital systems and 20 Federally Qualified Health Clinics (FQHC) in the United States.
In much the same way TSA PreCheckTM provided airline passengers with an increased level of confidence after 9/11, the HealthyAmerica application is positioned to mitigate risk of businesses and individuals. With TSA PreCheck in place, passengers returned to travel with assurance that fellow travelers had been screened and posed little to no risk. The HealthyAmerica application manages real-time and batch files of health status requests for consumers to provide businesses and facilities operational decision-making capabilities that can mitigate exposure to employees and clients.
Like the TSA PreCheck status, which is delivered in bulk to airlines and directly to the consumer via a Quick Response (QR) code, HealthyAmerica enables consumers to present a QR code indicating health status. With the HealthyAmerica QR code, individuals can securely gain access to government-restricted sites, such as airports and/or sporting events, as examples.
The HealthyAmerica application works in the following manner, first requiring the individual consumer to register. Consumer identity is verified in combination with mobile device authentication, then the consumer selects a laboratory, schedules testing and receives validated test results—all within the application on the consumer’s verified device. The HealthyAmerica application stores diagnostic or antibodies test results received directly from an FDA-approved laboratory and generates a QR code indicating current health status.(https://www.siriusiq.com/siriusiq-introduces-clx-health-and-develops-healthyamerica-tm-as-virus-response-mobile-application/)
My summary and analysis:

Okay so this app basically gives verification to other people on whether you have Covid-19 or not wherever you go. First you start off by scheduling a testing through the app for antibodies and then you send the tests to SiriusIQ labs where they see if you have antibodies. TransUnion then verifies your identity through your social security number making sure it’s you. Then the data is stored in the app which is federally regulated and presents proof of your safety from Covid-19. You can also opt in or not for contact tracing on it to see who is infected and not. I think businesses, airports and big events like baseball games will soon require this because it‘s as simple as scanning a QR code or sending a verification online through the app to wherever you're going to check if you are safe to be there both to yourself and others. It provides a more organized and safer way to open up the country and European countries as well and yes they have been approved by the European Union on this. Anyways I think this can allow countries to  open up in a safer way then the first time they tried. This would help both the economy and stock market. This will all go down on August 6th at 3 pm (EDT) when they announce the application and the media is to announce it at that time as well.

stocks,Forced retrospective: what could cause a reversal?,"Hypothetically speaking, let’s say it’s 6 months from now, and we are back into bear market territory. 

Looking back on the second half of 2020, what would have caused the drop?

With interest rates as low as they are, stocks are the only place many people see fit to put their cash. Additionally, insane valuations in tech stocks are likely (at least partially) being driven by millennials and an influx of investments into these individual stocks. Additionally, the value of the dollar continues to drop.

personalfinance,Home Mortgage Refinance - Did I make the right choice?,"I bought a property for $245K just under 4.5 years ago, with a 30-year fixed @ 4.675% w/ 20% down (there was a good reason for the higher interest rate than the going rate at the time, but I’ll leave that out of the conversation).  My mortgage was for $196,000 after the 20% down ($49k).

When interest rates were going down and my new mortgage balance was $180K, I refinanced to a 15-year fixed @ 3.375%.  With closing costs rolled into the new loan, the new mortgage was for $185,500.  After about 8-9 months of mortgage payments post-refinance, my mortgage balance is down to just under $179K.

The reason I went with the re-fi to a 15-year fixed at a 1.3% lower interest rate rather than make extra payments towards principal on my original 30-year fixed loan was that I had calculated that in order to pay off the 30-year fixed by the same time as the 15-year fixed, my monthly additional payments towards principal on the former would have to be even more than just paying the higher regular monthly payments on the 15-year re-fi.

When I checked my break-even point for the re-fi, the online calculators I used showed it to be around 2.5 years.

So I decided to do the re-fi, since it would be nice to have the property completely paid off by the time I retire, so I’m not having to make mortgage payments on it post-retirement.

I’ve noticed how much more quickly my loan balance is going down each month vs my original 30 year fixed, and that’s a nice thing to see.  But in the back of my mind, I keep wondering if I made the most prudent decision...

I may or may not rent out the property at some point.  Based on current rents in the area for comparable properties in this location, I can probably ask $1700-1800/mo.  At $1700/mo, it would cover the principal, interest, taxes and insurance plus the HOA dues.  So I wouldn’t be making anything extra by doing so, unless I rent it out for $1800/mo.  I’d just be having someone else pay off the mortgage for me.  Had I not refinanced, my monthly payments would be lower by roughly $350/mo, so I’d have that extra money coming in renting it out without re-fi.

My questions are (and I could use some help with the correct supporting math):

&amp;#x200B;

1. Did I make a mistake by refiancing to a 15-year rather than keeping my original 30-year loan?
2. Given that I refinanced to a rate of 3.375%, how do I determine at what point (should interest rates drop further) it could be worth re-evaluating another re-fi?  And if such a point arrived, would it be better to do the 30-year vs 15-year?
3. Would you ever do a cash-out refi (I think I could do a max of $100K out of the $170K equity I have currently) ever make sense for renting out the re-financed and then buying another property as your new primary residence?  I know it’d make the monthly payments much higher by doing the cash-out refi, even beyond the payments of a 15-year fixed.

personalfinance,Refi or Payoff House with Snowball?,"I'm trying to decide on which direction I should take with refinancing our house vs just paying it all off and could use some advice.

Here's the backstory:

Last year I sold an investment property and walked away with about 100k in gross profits. After paying back contractors, taxes, and some CC debt I'm left with about 70k.

The original plan pre-covid was to take that 70k and reinvest into additional properties, mostly buy-hold but maybe a flip too.

Covid and ""the new reality"" got me thinking. I saw where interest rates are headed and I decided I should refinance my primary residence. We currently have a 30yr 3.85% MTG that we took out in 2012 but after talking to my broker we're in the process of doing a 15yr ~2.5%. We will be cutting out about 8yrs on payback and getting rid of PMI in the process. Closing costs are around 5-6k.

I started doing some math and realized if I take that 70k and use that to jump start debt paydown using the snowball method I could pay off a small loan and a car immediately, then my house in less than 4 years. But that's assuming I use the full 70k. Once the house is paid off I could do the same to some student loans and all debt should be gone in 6.8 yrs. 

I already mostly stick to a budget using YNAB and pretty much payoff all CC spending every couple of weeks. 

That also leaves me with a 4k emergency fund which I automatically contribute around 200$ monthly through payroll deductions. 

I'm putting 10% of my income into a 401k and my wife is contributing 6% into an IRA.

So considering the closing costs for the refinance would that basically just be throwing 5-6k away if I'm on target to payoff the house in 4yrs or does the interest and PMI savings make sense to go ahead and have less for the initial snowball payment?",finance
personalfinance,Looking to buy a house in 11 months. Not sure where to keep money for a down payment in the meantime.,"I'm familiar with the prime directive but interest rates are so low now and changing so I'm not sure what the best current practice would be. I have $18k in a money market fund, $15k in a (now not so much) high interest savings account at .8% APY. After tax-advantaged savings I'll be able to put about another $1k/mo into other savings.

I'm expecting to need about $20k for a down payment in 11 months. I'll need more money for furnishings/yard care stuff at that time but if I have to I can slum it for a little bit or borrow needed stuff from family. They won't mind but I'd like to avoid if possible. Plus I'll want to have some money handy for an emergency fund even though my job is very stable now. I can fall back on retirement accounts if absolutely necessary but I don't suspect I'll need that.

So I'm wondering where to put my money in the meantime? Savings account yields are low now. So are CDs, and most better rates are for 1yr+ but my lease is up in 11 months so I'd rather have a house before a year. Who knows where the stock market will be a month from now, let alone a year?

Anyway, I am not focused on average rates, since these capture differences in borrower creditworthiness, properties, etc.

For the same exact borrower and the same exact property, are conforming mortgages always going to be cheaper? This would seem to be the case, since jumbos don't carry the cheap default insurance from Fannie/Freddie and are harder to offload from a bank's books, not to mention the fact that the down payment would presumably need to be higher on a property to reduce the mortgage need from jumbo size down to conforming...

While I know that in the vast majority of situations, its a simple equation of whether or not you expect to be in a higher tax bracket now or later for whether you want a traditional or Roth 401k/IRA, I read an article which talked about how if you are able to max a 401k out either pre or post-tax, a Roth offers more effective contributions than a Traditional 401k can as it is post tax, meaning that your Roth would end up being worth far more than your Traditional would.  However, this article did not seem to consider the additional take home salary that the tax breaks of a Traditional 401k would provide that could also be invested in a similar retirement fund, with only the relatively lesser capital gains tax to be paid on those earnings.  Are there any good articles on whether the Roth or Traditional 401k is better in a situation like this?

They are higher interest as far as federal loans go (something like 6% -- I can't confirm though, since the servicer is currently showing 0% rates on my dashboard due to COVID). I have gone back and forth on aggressively paying down the loans vs. investing over the years (some years I'd pay them down a lot, other years I wouldn't), but being able to wipe out the loans entirely in one transfer makes it feel different.

Would we be better off being on a pretty low fixed rate for a long time or staying on a slightly higher variable rate and paying more off the actual house to eventually own the property ourselves?

Our long term goal is to move out of this house in 5-10 years and rent this one out while we upgrade. A fixed rate will put a cap on how much money we can use to lower the interest charged but we can't actually put anything more onto paying off the principle. While the variable means we can put as much as we want towards keeping the interest down and then put some extra into paying off the house itself. Paying off the house quicker would mean paying a higher interest rate but on less money owed. The fixed rate would be easily affordable but still take the whole duration of the loan to pay off.

personalfinance,Wells Fargo Double Reporting Account to Credit Reporting Agency. Possible Quicker Resolutions?,"*This is a repost as I didn’t receive any responses yesterday.*

Monday morning I received a notification from Credit Karma that a new Wells Fargo account was opened. I had opened a 0% interest card back in March, so was surprised to see this message now in August. I then open the app, see that my credit score has dropped by 30 points, and then read Credit Karma’s statement that it had “found no changes to my Equifax report”.

I thought that was odd and maybe just an error by Credit Karma but wanted to make sure, so I then opened an account with Experian to verify the accounts reported on my credit bureau report. **Come to find out, my Wells Fargo credit card was reported twice. One account reported my statement balance from two statements ago. The other account reported my most recent statement balance.** I tried to file a dispute with Equifax online but their system gave me a message stating it was currently down and for me to call their help line.

**After speaking with a representative from Experian, he verified that it indeed was a duplicate account; as he noted both accounts had the same account number and the similarity in balances.** I filed a dispute with him and he then recommended me calling Wells Fargo to file a dispute, which I then did. If it isn’t resolved quickly, I’ll file a complaint with the CFPB.

**This all comes at a very unfortunate time, as I was planning on applying for pre-approval on a mortgage this week.** A 30 point drop in my credit score adversely effects the interest rate on a mortgage, significantly raising the interest expenses on said mortgage over an extended period.

personalfinance,"I've changed my mindset on Doordash. Instead of it devaluing my car and wearing it down, I think of it as converting illiquid value in my car into liquid cash.","This line of thinking depends on your situation (value of car, age of car, miles, wear, and cost of gas) but it works out really well for me (see bottom for limitations).

I'm a software engineer by day ($69k base salary). My wife just quit her job as a CNA because she's 5 months pregnant and they were clearly taking advantage of her work ethic with no regard to her health or well being so we were looking into other options for her. This led us to delivery with Doordash and I figured I would give it a shot.

I drive a 2000 Lexus ES 300. It currently has \~160k miles on it. If I were to sell it now, I could get maybe $2k-$3k for it. 

However, I've found that driving for door dash in my area, I've averaged around $20/hr (upper middle class tip really well), but for my example, I'll use the $12/hr national average. I'll also assume $1.80 miles per gallon. The city mpg for my car is 19 (though I regularly get 21-26). Some other assumptions I'll take into account are oil changes (filter and fluid), transmission fluid, and tires.

# Costs (Assumed values. Take with a grain of salt)

|Wear Item|Cost per Unit|Cost per 100 miles (Aprox. 4 Hrs of delivery)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Gas|$1.80 per gallon|$9.47 (assuming 19 mpg)|
|Oil|$20 for 5qt|$0.40 (changing every 5k miles)|
|Oil Filter|$13|$0.0866 (changing every 15k miles)|
|Transmission Fluid|$60 |$0.24 (changing every 25k miles)|
|Tires|$450 for 4|$0.75|
|Total Cost||$10.54|

I didn't take into account insurance or registration fees because I owned and drove this car for other things anyways. 

# Weeks until surpassing the value of my car

|Income|Net Profit per 4 hour session after wear and gas costs.|Weeks to surpass the value of my $3k car (4 hr sessions, 4 times per week)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|$7.25/hr (minimum wage)|$18.46|40.62 Weeks |
|$12/hr (driver average)|$37.46|20.02 Weeks|
|$20/hr (my average)|$69.46|10.7 Weeks|

So basically, in as little as 2 and a half months, I can get more money out of my car driving for door dash than I could if I sold it. And even if I got more selling it, I would be out of a car unable to run errands or go to work (if the office was open). Another way to look at it is that I'm converting illiquid value of my car into liquid cash without having to sell my car. Once my car dies finally dies, if I've been responsible with the income, I can buy another cheap yet reliable car with cash, and do it all over again.

# Limitations

My situation works out really well due to several things.

1. My area is in the upper/middle class and they tip really well allowing me to make $20/hr. Your area will be different.
2. I live in a relatively low COL state (Texas). No state income taxes is a blessing. However, as a ""contractor"" for Doordash, I need to set aside \~15% for the ~~federal Ponzi scheme~~ FICA and medicare taxes.
3. I don't live on this income. I do this after work to supplement my day job salary so I can pad my emergency fund and pay off student loans.
4. My car is hella old with lots of miles already and paid off. It doesn't lose much value by driving it everywhere. A brand new car would suffer tremendously from value loss (unless you plan on keeping the car until it breaks in which case that really isn't a factor). 
5. My car is super reliable. Ask any mechanic about Toyota engines and transmissions from the 90s and nearly every one will attest that these cars will outlive your grandkids (as long as you maintain it well). The same can't be said for other brands (\*cough\* Chrysler \*cough\*).
6. I also do all the maintenance myself so I don't have to pay for labor. I highly recommend you do so as well because 1) it's cheaper, 2) you learn valuable skills, and 3) you feel like [Ron Swanson](https://youtu.be/P1UJR-dvq4s?t=538) when you're done, the car is running, and your hands are covered in grease and knuckles are bleeding. The caveat is that you may need some tools depending on the maintenance that you're doing, but it's usually worth the investment.

financialindependence,Difficulties with FIRE and 4% rule going forward,"Asset return at fair value is generally considered to be risk free cash rate + risk premium. Over the short term, this is highly volatile, but long term asset returns had historically been highly predictable. 

The 4% rule had been generated using past index returns as a reference with historical rates of inflation to show a strategy that succeeds 95% of the time over 30 years. 

The current stock market valuations, for example in the United States predicting a 10 year yield of only about 4% risk premium + 0% risk free cash rate. 

Massive QE and COVID related helicopter money is also likely to result in increased inflation, which will either erode into buying power or cause interest rates to go up driving an asset market crash.

Post COVID and the increasingly globalized economy continues to drive wages down, and make the workplace more competitive. This means someone who fails FIRE and leaves the workforce for too long may become non-viable in the workforce.

To summarize, given:

1. The stock market is almost certain to produce under average returns (especially in USA) over the next 7-15 years. For most markets, the annual return average will sit at 6-7% and USA at 4% over this period. **This number is pre-tax.**

2. Massive fiat printing accelerated by COVID lockdown will eventually lead to inflation, which would erode buying power and lead to pressure on increasing interest rates, which if actioned, will drive markets down.

3. With the job market becoming more globalized, hence competitive, the risk of failed FIRE becomes even more severe and one could end up in a terrible financial situation running out of money and simultaneously being unable to find meaningful employment having been out of the job market for too long.

Is FIRE, especially on the lower net worth range (e.g. low 7 digits) still a viable strategy for a reasonable quality of life? Why or why not?",finance

I currently have and keep well over six figures in savings in several personal accounts, and opened a new business checking with them a few months ago. I recently relocated from CA to NM (Albuquerque) for a new job and created an LLC for a 1099 gig I have out here. Unfortunately, there aren't any Chase branches in NM, and since I've only ever used WF, I decided to open my business checking with them to keep all my accounts consolidated with one bank.

I'm trying to set up a monthly transfer from my business checking to a coworker's business checking (to cover monthly insurance premiums he is paying). Pretty much seems I'll have to pay an additional fee each month to make this happen (Zelle isn't an option, and wire transfers and Business Bill Pay costs an additional fee).

I'm wondering if anyone can recommend a better option for me. I understand it's a specific request (Albuquerque), but figured I'd try. I'm ready to move all my finances away from WF, and interested in a better option for me. Thank you.",finance

personalfinance,Lump sum payment against student loan... Best option?,"Good evening,

I have a 33,000 student loan at a 5.6% interest rate with a $440 per month payment.  I have received a $20,000 lump sum.

My emergency fund is established, I have a mortgage (3.8%), and no car payment.  I am stably employed, no cc debt, have a retirement account through work, and my own Roth IRA that I do not yet max.

I would like to increase my monthly cash on hand to get closer to maxing  the Roth, and to save for a down payment on a car in 1-3 years.  

My thought is to pay off a significant portion of the student loan, thus reducing the monthly payment, and overall interest on the loan.  My rough calculations show a 20k payment reducing the monthly loan payment a disappointing $280.

Thoughts or any better ideas? Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,"Planning Retirement: Roth w/ Schwab, TSP, and Question","I am 30 and I work for the feds, non-military. I contribute as much as I can to TSP, $6,000 a year so I have about $10,000 in there now. Split between the 2045 and 2055 funds. Looks like folks are saying I should switch that to the C and S funds. What kind of allocation there makes sense? 50-50? 75-25? And how should this change over time? Thanks for your help here.

To that end, this is not my first job. I have about $25,000 which was spread across former 401k programs and a Roth IRA w/ USAA from when I was younger. The USAA was an under performing fund so I have divested. Now that I have been moved over to Schwab, I am looking to move that money into something better. I think at this point everything I have been in was pretty conservative and it makes sense to be pretty aggressive. It looks like the Schwab mutual funds have low expense ratios which, from what i am reading here, is a key positive indicator. What are folks thinking as far as being aggressive right now? It seems like a decent time to invest but I would love to hear people's thoughts. The decision between ETFs and Mutual Funds is also something I could use advice on, it seems like ETFs are generally more aggressive. Is that right?

Once things are set, what is the best way to move forward? It doesn't seem like I make enough to actually open a brokerage and could do all my investing in the Roth. I have heard both that there is a $19,500 limit for TSP but I know there is a $6,000 limit for Roth IRA. Are they separate? The same? Does that mean my max contribution is $25,500 a year? Does it make sense to invest more heavily in TSP or the Roth IRA?

Finally, I have $6,000 in total debt remaining and I received a bonus at work for the same amount of money. Should I pay that debt off? Invest the money? A hybrid approach? For reference and with the bonus I have about $12,000 in the bank and the debt is 0% interest until June 2021.

Bitcoin,"Serious question about bitcoin use in 30 years - If bitcoin stabilizes and becomes a deflationary currency, what will incentivize you to ever lend your bitcoin to a new small business owner?","If the rate of deflation is such that the value of your bitcoin increases a certain percent every year, let's say 15%, why would you ever bother lending bitcoin to new small business owners?

I'm curious how the economic system would work in this situation. What would it actually look like?

Is this just a case of higher interest rates for lending out bitcoin? 

For example. If you can get 15% through deflation without lending your money, then you would need to lend out at a high enough interest rate so that your return would exceed the automatic deflationary increase of 15%? 

Is that the basics of it? So the interest rate of borrowing bitcoin would effectively always be related to the deflation of bitcoin and the inflation from new supply. Whatever that balances out to? (Assuming overall demand has somewhat stabilized through the economy by then so you don't get huge price swings.)",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,I'm going to be building a custom home soon and would like to get a pool with it. There are three finance options I know of and would like to use the best one.,"-edit- Err the title, finance options for the pool!

About three years ago I bought a house in an area that I was sure would skyrocket in value. Every personal finance readers dream I'm sure. Three years later and the house is suddenly, over the past few months, ""worth"" 50 percent more than what I bought it for. If all goes well I could walk away without about 80-100k over the initial purchase price.

I'm rolling that into a new build custom which I'm also getting a good deal on. Knowing the builder has its perks I suppose you could say. About 20k will be going into owned solar panels, no leasing that. On top of that there is land prices that go anywhere from 15k for an acre to 100k for an acre. Middle of nowhere with no utilities to prime location with utilities ready to tie in respectively. I could buy the land outright with the profits on my sell, however, VA loans have the option to include the land in the mortgage if the lender is willing to do it. I may just buy the land though. Not directly related to the pool question but some background info. Either way, all the profits from this sell are going into the new house in one way or another.

For the pool I know of 3 options.

1. Is a secured loan (2nd mortgage) Ill assume this carries the best rates, however, it also opens you up getting a lien on your house. I'm financially stable and hold a good job, but you never know, I could wake up with a basketball sized tumor on my skull one morning.

2. Unsecured. Carries more risk to the lender I assume which would mean higher interest rates?

3. 1st Mortgage loan. I did not know this existed until 20 minutes ago. Basically the cost of the pool gets put into the home loan, which I thought was not allowed in the past. I'm going to assume for a risk perspective the bank would only be willing to do this if you have extremely good credit (which I do) and/or enough positive equity from downpayment ect to make it worth the risk. 

I'm leaning towards the 1st mortgage option, however, I feel like I don't know enough about it to know if it's a really good idea or not. I do know that the pool loan becomes part of the 30 year home loan. If interest rates were high that would obviously be a terrible idea. But with rates rock bottom for mortgages and my credit score getting me the lowest rate possible, it may actually be a good idea? I think financing a pool alone would be about 5-6 percent interest over 15 years if I am correct.

I don't really trust lenders to look out for the customer over the bank. So I am doing the responsible thing and turning to completely random internet strangers! :)",finance

With about 55% equity in our home and 23 years remaining on our 4.125% mortgage, we were anticipating cashing out $80k-$100k and renewing for a 20 year term.  Despite how low interest rates have gotten, our excellent credit scores (802 and 806) and stable income, we were having trouble finding a lender who would give us a sub-3% interest rate with no points/low closing costs.  

We were explaining what we were up to when my father in law offered to lend us the $100k at a 2% interest rate for a 15 year term.  He's very financially savvy and operates by the book and we are very responsible with no debt aside from our mortgage (and he knows this). I'm tempted by the offer, though one thing that makes me nervous is the possibility of something happening in our lives that prevents us from making payments owed to him.  I'm not naiive - there are all sorts of unknowns in life and covid has taught us that.  There's illness, economic instability, divorce, etc.  (by the way, I have no reason to believe we would divorce).  We have almost $30k in emergency savings and a lot in retirement, so I think we'd find a way to repay, but it's a risk nonetheless. 

Any words of wisdom?  Has anyone done this before with success or failure?  Is there anything I'm not thinking of? I'm hesitant to mix family with business, but I think this could be a smart move if we handle it well.",finance

The out the door price of the car is ~$27500 and I can secure a 60 month loan with 1.9% APR. I've been going back and forth with how much I should put into the down payment with such a low interest rate.

I currently have 18k in my savings (10k is emergency). My monthly net pay is ~$4500 and due to my current living situation I'll be saving a vast majority of August's income, so I'm looking at having about 22,000 in savings in 3 weeks when I likely make a purchase. By the end of the year I'm planning on having ~$30,000 in savings minus the down payment I decide on.

My initial gut instinct was to make as large of a down payment as possible (8-12k) to minimize my losses on interest. However, I'm beginning to wonder if it's not worth it to lose the financial flexibility to save ~$1,000 in interest over a 5 year loan. 

Other goals of mine within the next 2-4 years include buying a house (~40,000 downpayment), get engaged and married, and travel with my SO if the pandemic ever ends.",finance

I've been putting half of each paycheck into investments; half of that into crypto-assets; and half of that into USDC. I've been using Coinbase as my exchange, and exporting all of my USDC to my NEXO wallet, as I am drawing 8% interest off of stablecoin assets.

First, I have to admit that I wasn’t prepared to buy my first car and I learned the big lesson in my life. As a result, the funny businesses from car dealership put me in tough situation.

Last month, I purchased new Honda Civic from Honda dealership in California. I provided my SSN, bought all the extras like GAP and protection plan, had no pre-approval loans to negotiate. I accepted the deal of 2.9% APR with 72 months term. The contract is under my name and co-sign with my relative. After a week of purchase, they asked for documents like pay stubs, SSN card, and residency for funding purposes. The process seems to have no problem. Later, the sale manager called me, and offered a better deal from Ally Bank with lower payments, but higher rates. I asked what happened to the 2.9% deal, they said that it didn’t go through. Last week, they kept rushing me to sign the new contract because they need the deal finalized as soon as possible. The interest rates will be higher from 2.9% to 7% on 72 months term.

After I did some research, I discovered the “spot delivery” and “yo-yo finance” strategies. Now, I have the anxiety that I might fall into the trap. On the positive side, I think the dealer finds the fair deal for both parties. I never experience this before and I really need advices and suggestions on my current situation.

Should I just sign the new contract to ease my mind? Are there any alternatives that I can approach?

Thank you everyone for your help. I hope my story will be useful to others as well.

personalfinance,Saving for a future car vs. paying off house principal,"Hey everyone, I currently have a good problem to have. My partner and I bought a house in Oct 2019, 30yr fixed, 3.77%. We are currently going through a refi and got the interest rate down to 2.75%. According to our calculations this is going to save us roughly $300/mo. I am debating putting that extra cash towards the principal of the house or saving for a car. 

Additional info - We have one van we share, a 2000 Toyota Sienna with 194,000 miles on it (obviously no car payment). It runs like a champ, no issues at all, we keep up with maintenance and just had the timing belt, starter, and some oil leaks fixed on it. I'm guessing I can get another 50k miles out of it no problem so I'm really looking at getting a car next year at the earliest unless something changes. I have a work truck I commute in and my partner works from home/uses public transportation to commute so the van gets 3k miles on it like every 5 months. We want to eventually replace it with another Toyota, probably a Corolla hatchback or something comparable. Probably will buy new and keep it forever (we obviously don't care about replacing cars on the regular) which puts us at like a $20ish k car loan. We also have emergency savings set up, and I contribute to both a 401k and Roth 401k and I have a pension from my job. Partner contributes to a Roth IRA and has PERA/pension from his job. 

Mostly just curious if that potentially saved $20ish k would be better utilized for buying a new car outright/with no car loan when the time comes or to put it towards the principal on our mortgage and just take out a car loan? Other note, definitely staying in this house long term, probably 10+ years. No kids. I've never had a car loan so I'm not sure what to expect from getting one vs. buying the car outright.",finance

personalfinance,How badly will it hurt me to close an established credit card?,"Past me made some less than stellar financial choices, but current me is doing much better. I track all of my family’s purchases in a budgeting app and pay our credit card balance in full each month. My emergency fund is almost where I want it. I have consolidated all of our previous credit card debt into a personal loan with a lower interest rate. We are contributing to 401k and paying down debt. My credit score is looking good, and I’d like to keep it that way. However, I still have a card open that I’d like to close…

In 2016 I opened a Delta Skymiles Gold AMEX credit card with a promotional offer for a free year of membership and 30,000 miles. Since I was unable to pay it back within the year (no one is surprised), I entered the endless credit card cycle and ended up keeping the card for two or so years before consolidating the debt and getting my finances in order. After consolidating our debt, I was concerned about hurting my credit by closing the card and figured if I was going to keep it, I might as well start using it and paying the balance to get some rewards and improve my credit score. I added my husband as an authorized user so that he could build credit with it as well. The card carries a $0 balance, never late, and they continued to increase my credit limit over the years. Now, the card is one of my oldest accounts, and it has the highest credit limit ($14.2k).

I also have a card from 2014 which is officially my oldest credit account, but the credit limit is lower ($8k), it was never used regularly, and my husband is not on it.

A couple months ago, we got the CITI Double Cashback card ($8k limit), and we’ve moved our regular purchasing to that card since the rewards are better and there’s no fee. That means I’ve now got an old credit card with a yearly fee that isn’t being used and offers no real benefit to me.

Since the card is a Delta Skymiles card, it’s not an option for me to be upgraded/downgraded to a different AMEX card with no fee (none exist in the Delta category as far as I can tell), so I think my options are to keep it and continue paying the membership fee or close the account and suffer the hit to mine and my husband’s credit scores. I was planning to start using some of the airline miles to take trips, in which case the free checked bags would be nice, but with COVID-19 making travel basically a thing of the past, I really do not need travel rewards. Plus, the cashback we get on our new card will more than pay for checked bags and flights if we need them, and the miles I have already accumulated are mine to keep even if I close the account.

Basically, I don’t need this card anymore, but if I close it, I’m worried about how badly our scores will be tanked. How badly does closing an old account with a high limit tank your score, and how quickly will my credit recover if I close it? I am planning to buy a house in the next 2-3 years but definitely not within 12 months, and probably not within 24 months. Is that enough time for our scores to get back to a good place before we apply for a mortgage?

TL;DR I opened a credit card in 2016 that I am now paying $99/year for and the rewards are airline miles which I really don’t need. I don't have an option for a no-fee card with this lender. How bad will it hurt me to close it?",finance
personalfinance,Question about debt payoff and living situation,"Hi everyone, I've made some solid progress since the last time I posted here (when I was $58,500 in student loan debt), many thanks to this subreddit for guiding me in the right direction. Now I'm back with one last question as I enter the home stretch of my debt-free journey. I started with over $120k in student loan debt with a degree in Communications. Yes, I know... dumb.

I now have a total of $37,383 of debt left as of this writing, making $45k a year at 27 years old.

I just recently paid off a 7% interest loan that started at like $40k and had a min. payment of $300 a month. I feel great about it, but now it's on to the next one. Here's what's left...

**THIS IS THE LOAN I'VE BEEN FOCUSING ON. $431 MIN. PAYMENT.**  
Private loan (MOHELA): $23,425 (3.75%... was 6% but I refinanced!)

**THESE LOANS ARE ON COVID-19 FORBEARANCE UNTIL OCTOBER. NOT SURE WHAT MIN. PAYMENTS WILL BE WHEN THEY RESUME.**  
Federal loan (NELNET): $3,975 (4.66%)  
Federal loan: $4,128 (3.86%)  
Federal loan: $5,899 (3.4%)

So here are my questions:

1. I still live at home and it's giving me an amazing opportunity to pay this off as quickly as possible. Of course, I want to move out ASAP even though my relationship with my parents is good.

I've been with the same girl for five years and I plan on proposing once we're in a good financial situation. Should I just suck it up and stay at home until it's all paid off? Should I wait until the big loan is gone then move out? Or should I just move out and rent a cheap place now? Buying a house right now would be dumb, right? (She has 40k saved right now and no debt).

2. Should I take the debt snowball approach even though I want that big $431 min. payment out of my life ASAP?

3. During COVID-19, should I pay the minimums on my debts until I build a six-month emergency fund? I currently have $1,000 saved and everything else is going toward my debts because I've been following Dave Ramsey's methods, but that's definitely tough to feel safe with.

personalfinance,Car Budget &amp; Buying Decision -- Long Term Buy or Short Term Holdover?,"Hey r/personalfinance,

I'm trying to determine what I can afford to spend on a car, and whether I should buy one for the longer term (8-10 years) or get something to hold me over until I have a better idea on my future situation. My lease in NYC ended and I've been working remote from my parents house due to covid. No concrete plan or strong urge to go back to NYC, job is remote permanently.  

I'm in my mid 20s, single, work in tech, and make around 100k/yr before taxes. I have a $10k emergency fund, \~$30k in Roth&amp;401k, \~$30k in other investments, and $17k in cash savings (can use for car). No debt, and expenses are pretty light (no rent).

I don't really NEED to go anywhere since I'm working remote, but it would open up a lot of doors for convenience / errands / outdoor time, and probably help with my sanity. I'm in a fairly rural small town, so anything outside the house requires a car. I have also entertained the idea of renting a room for a few months in the nearby mid-sized city to be closer to friends and people my age, but I think a car would be a prerequisite. Along those same lines, if things stay on the same track, I'd like to live in a ski town for 3 months or so (Jan-March 2021) to take advantage of my situation. 

Other than that, barring a new job, I don't have any plans yet for a relocation. NYC is a slight possibly, in which case I wouldn't need the car anymore, but for almost every other city in the country a car would be nice to have or even a necessity. 

So given the context, the big question is, do I buy a fairly new car that I plan to use for the next 8-10 years, buy a cheap used car as a short term holdover, or try to go without? Are there other options I haven't considered like medium term (months at a time) renting?

How much should I spend? Should I finance the car (interest rates are quite low) or pay with my cash savings (\~17k)? 

Other than insurance and gas, any other gotchas?

personalfinance,Short term investment advice given low interest rate environment,"I'm looking to purchase a condo in 8-12 months. I have the money I plan to use for a down payment (plus an emergency fund) in an Ally savings account, which is earning a whopping 1.00% right now. I also have a Vanguard investment account that I use to invest in US/International stock funds, which is about a quarter of the size of my savings account.

I put 10% of my paycheck into the investment account, and the rest goes into the savings account from which I pay rent/bills/expenses as well as save for the down payment. Rent/bills/expenses are about 35% of my paycheck, so ultimately 55% of my paycheck is allocated towards increasing my down payment fund. 

Two questions:
1)
Are there better short term strategies available given the low rate environment? 6 month T-Bill rates are hovering around 0.1% which leads me to believe Ally savings is the best option, but looking for others' opinions. 

2)
Should I discontinue allocating money to the investment account and instead focus solely on growing the pool of money for the condo down payment? Right now I have enough saved to put about 15% down on a condo, but I'm hoping to put closer to 20% down (just by accumulating pay checks for the next several months I should be able to reach this goal). But the more I save for the down payment, the lower the loan I'd need (or I could afford a more expensive condo). Given the low interest rates, is there any benefit to putting more than 20% down, or would the extra money be better invested in stock funds?

We totally *could* afford the slightly higher (+$125/month) payments of a 15 year mortgage, but like the idea of having a 30 year and just putting additional cash towards our principal every month, the equivalent of what the 15-year mortgage payment would be. Then we would have the option to pay less if we ever run into a hard month (we both have variable income as freelancers). If the interest rates were the same and we confirm with the lender that overpayments go directly to the principal, would there be any difference in these two approaches? 

Both options would break even from closing costs in &lt;2 years.",finance

My employer has a 401k but they have stopped matching since covid started so I do know contribute to it. I net about $3600 a month, still live with parents and have about $700 a month in expenses + credit card. I also have about $29K in federal student loans at 4-5.5% interest that are interest deffered until November that I have made no payments on. I have an emergency fund so Im all set there.  

I have only been putting $100 a month in the IRA, mostly because I am afraid to have too much money tied up. I know I can contribute more into it comfortably. I also work in the medical field and see many lives cut short so I intend to live my life to the fullest and not go super heavy on retirement at my young age. But of course I also intend to retire one day and would like to live comfortably then also.

https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/interactives/householdcredit/data/pdf/HHDC_2020Q2.pdf

*Credit card balances fell sharply, marking the steepest decline on record*

NEW YORK – The Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Center for Microeconomic Data today issued its Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit, which shows that total household debt decreased by $34 billion (0.2%) to $14.27 trillion in second quarter of 2020. This marks the first decline since the second quarter of 2014 and is the largest decline since the second quarter of 2013. The Report is based on data from the New York Fed’s Consumer Credit Panel, a nationally representative sample of individual- and household-level debt and credit records drawn from anonymized Equifax credit data. This latest report reflects consumer credit data as of June 30, 2020. 
Mortgage balances—the largest component of household debt—rose by $63 billion in the second quarter to $9.78 trillion. Mortgage originations, which include mortgage refinances, reached $846 billion, the highest volume seen since the refinance boom in 2013. Origination credit scores for mortgages increased notably in the second quarter of 2020. 

Reflecting the sharp decline in overall consumer spending due to the COVID-19 pandemic and related social distancing orders, credit card balances fell sharply by $76 billion in the second quarter. This was the steepest decline in card balances seen in the history of the data. Auto and student loan balances were roughly flat in the second quarter. In total, non-housing balances (including credit card, auto loan, student loan, and other debts) saw the largest drop in the history of this report, with an $86 billion decline. 

Aggregate delinquency rates dropped markedly in the second quarter, reflecting increased uptake of forbearances, which were provided by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. Note that accounts in forbearance are typically marked as current on consumer credit reports. The share of mortgages in early delinquency that transitioned ‘to current’ rose to 61.1%, while there was a decline in the share of mortgages in early delinquency whose status worsened during Q2 2020. Like mortgages, credit cards, student and auto loans also showed lower transition rates into delinquency, likely reflecting the impact of government stimulus programs and various forbearance options for troubled borrowers. Approximately 7.0% of aggregate student debt was 90+ days delinquent or in default in Q2 2020 as compared to 10.8 % in Q1 2020. The sharp decline in student debt delinquency reflects a Department of Education decision to automatically qualify all federal student loans for CARES Act forbearances and report their status as current.

“Protections afforded to American consumers through the CARES Act have prevented large-scale delinquency from appearing on credit reports and damaging future credit access” said Joelle Scally, Administrator of the Center for Microeconomic Data at the New York Fed. “However, these temporary relief measures may also mask the very real financial challenges that Americans may be experiencing as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent economic slowdown.” 

The New York Fed also issued an accompanying [Liberty Street Economics blog post](https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2020/08/a-monthly-peek-into-americans-credit-during-the-covid-19-pandemic.html) that examined key developments on consumer balance sheets, at a monthly frequency, in the period since the COVID-19 pandemic began.

The Report includes a one-page summary of key takeaways and their supporting data points. Overarching trends from the Report’s summary include:
 
**Housing Debt**

•	Approximately 0.5% of current mortgage balances became delinquent in Q2 2020, as many borrowers enrolled in forbearance programs.

•	Approximately 24,000 individuals had a new foreclosure notation added to their credit reports between April 1 and June 30. This is the lowest level seen since the beginning of the report in 1999.
 
**Student Debt**

•	Outstanding student debt stood at $1.54 trillion in the second quarter, roughly flat with the previous quarter.

•	Approximately 7.0% of aggregate student debt was 90+ days delinquent or in default in Q2 2020.[1] The sharp decline in student debt delinquency reflects a Department of Education decision to report current status on loans eligible for CARES forbearances.
 
**Account Closings, Bankruptcy Notations and Credit Inquiries**

•	The number of credit inquiries within the past six months – an indicator of consumer credit demand – was at 127 million, a small decline from the previous quarter. A change in the treatment of inquiries for utility accounts may have also contributed to the decline.

•	Account openings declined by 15 million accounts to 203 million, the largest drop in the history of the series. Account closings ticked up slightly, with 210 million accounts closed within the past 12 months.",finance

personalfinance,Should i refinance,"Should i refinance my mortgage from a 2.5% to a 3.5%?  The difference between my current monthly payment (P/I+Ins+Tax) and the new monthly payment $260.  Please let me know if my numbers look right and whether it makes sense to pull on the deal.

I originally closed on my house in October 2019 (starting balance $424,000 w/ 20% down).  The interest rate I was offered without points was 3.875%.  I paid for points and it reduced to 3.5%.  

**Previous Loan Costs from October 2019**

Points paid=  -$7,420

Origination Fee= -$1465

Lender Credit= +$2,713

Title cost= -$2,145.00

*Total Closing Costs @ 3.75%* = $8,317.00

Breakpoint to recoup points paid costs about 82.5 months (6.88 years).  

Monthly Payment = +$2,758.95

**Refinancing Loan Costs** 

Title cost= -$1900 (approximentaly)

New Monthly Payment = $2,497.41

\~\~\~\~\~

Because the only cost to me is the title cost, the title cost to me is really a point cost.  Thus, the new breakpoint to recoup the points paid would be the points I had paid with the previous closing costs of $7,420 and the title costs to be paid with the new closing costs of $1,900, which is $9, 320 in total.  Ignoring the months in between the closing of the previous loan and the refinanced loan, I estimate about 39.5 months (or 3.29 years) to break even at the $260 difference.  

Is my logic sound?",finance
personalfinance,"Wanting to get serious about Student Loan Debt, but concerned about savings.","Lots of background information first and then my question:

My wife and I got married last year and bought a new house in November 2019. Our total combined income fluctuates some due to the nature of our jobs, but a safe average is about $280k-$300k annually. However because my pay is based on a monthly draw and quarterly bonuses, our general combined monthly take home excluding any bonus for me is about $10,500 per month.  That number is generally a bit higher, but my wife's hours have been reduced due to COVID. This year, all extra bonus money which was probably another $20k to date went to some house items and savings.  

Currently we have about $102,000 in cash on hand (between checking and savings) and I expect a bonus of about another $50,000 next month bringing our total cash on hand to $152,000 approximately. That bonus is after I contribute 4% of my annual salary to my 401k which is done once a year at the end of our fiscal year. Our retirement accounts are about $118k in value. 

General Debt:

* Revolving CC of about $4800 which we'll payoff at the end of the month -- as a note most of our monthly expenses go on credit cards, so this is not in addition to the expenses listed below; 
* Promotional 0% CC of about $16000 which expires in May 2021;
* Student Loan Debt of about $153,000 of which $142,000 is at 6.3% to 7.5% interest;

Monthly Expenses:

I budgeted out every recurring expense (and for annual expenses I divided the annual by 12) on a monthly basis that we routinely spend and they total about $9000 per month. This includes:

* House payment ($3k/mo) for a 3600 sq foot house in the mid $500k range including HOA fees;
* Car payment ($670/mo);
* Utilities ($416/mo) for Internet, cable, power, gas, water;
* Minimum student loan payment ($890/mo);
* Insurance payments (life, auto, dental, pet, malpractice, disability) ($537/mo)
* Minimum payments on promotional CC debt ($360/mo), 
* Minimum payments on promotional health care debt from a hospitalization ($189/mo)
* House services (lawn, pest control, etc);
* Food ($1500/mo estimated although in reality I think this is closer to $1000/mo)
* Miscellaneous other spending. 

If I take a pen to the budget and eliminate all elective items I am down to about $6200/mo (from $9000). If I use that as a baseline, my 6 months required savings is $37k and my 12 months required savings is $74k in the event we both lost our jobs. That scenario is unlikely as I am a shareholder of my law firm and while my income may be reduced due to less hours worked, I don't expect it to ever drop below $120k a year (which is what my monthly draw with no bonus works out to). My wife is in healthcare and has great flexibility in her work hours as well. She'll probably bring in at least $30k a year assuming absolute worst case scenarios (can't imagine much worse than COVID). 

Now for the question:

We want to get the student debt off of our shoulders. All are federal loans in my name. Pre-COVID, I paid about $890 a month of which about $850 went to interest. Basically just lighting money on fire for years at this point. My original balance was about $250k so I have paid off about $100k just due to large chunks of bonus money being sent in on it. Currently we are paying nothing on the COVID waiver which is going to expire in September. We are likely going to refinance the high interest portion down to about 4%, but I'm going to wait until I find out what Congress will due with any future COVID relief packages. 

We want to throw a large chunk at it with the bonus coming up, but in getting serious about tackling the debt, I feel we have too much savings in the first place and it could benefit me more by going to reducing debt. As information, other potential uses for portions of the bonus payment include replacing our failing AC units on the house ($10k-$15k) and doing a bathroom renovation necessitated by our master shower leaking ($20k). We can probably get by another year with the ACs and the leak is fine since we just stopped using that shower, but it's a pain. 

What do you think of the following plan (any suggestions or modifications or disagreement welcome)? 

* Generally tighten the spending belt moving forward. 
* Payoff the promotional CC debt and health care debt (total about $8500) to free up about $540 in cash flow a month. 
* Complete the bathroom renovation to give us use of our master bathroom back and to add value to the home in the long run. 
* Put off the ACs until next year. 
* Put all remaining cash on hand above $75k savings on the student loans (so about $50k to loans).
* On a monthly basis moving forward--put all available funds in excess of $75k savings on the loans. 
* Alternatively, make a bigger payment on student loans (like the previous bullet), but also make sizable payments on the $16000 of promotional CC debt so as to pay it off by May 2021 without interest penalty. 

Sorry for the wall of text, but I tend to panic when I spend money out of savings, but feel we have too much and could reduce it and make our money work better for us. Suggestions, thoughts, modifications, or disagreements with my plan are welcome. We'd love to get out from under this and move on with our lives.",finance
personalfinance,A freind in a bad financial situaiton wants to sell a car back to a dealership before driving it off the lot - what would be a fair price? Is there an alternative?,"First, apologies if there is a better subreddit, more automobile-focused, in which to ask this question. If there is, I'd be happy to learn about it.  


I'm trying to help out a friend who was in a traumatic situation last month and made some unwise decisions while trying to get out of it, motivated partly by panic and partly by a lack of life experience.   


One of the things that she did was to purchase a brand new SUV in a city 3 states away from our currently location (they fedexed her the paperwork and had her fedex it back to them), in a city in which she has no friends or family. She does not currently have stable employment and when she gets it it will likely be at a low wage, possibly minimum wage, so she is ill-equipped to afford that car note. After speaking to myself and a few other friends in her support circle, she has decided to undo that car sale by whatever means available and acquire a cheaper car in her current city, so long as that can be done without a huge financial loss.  


I've spoken only briefly to the dealership at this point; I have not yet spoken to the bank that is her lender for the car note the dealership set her up with. A brief query of the internet on this topic indicates to me that there isn't any simple way to hit ""undo"" on the purchaing paperwork she has signed. She didn't keep a copy of what she signed, and the dealership has objected to sending us a copy of it by email, citing privacy concerns; she had been telling them that she would come to the city in person to pick up the vehicle, so they had been intended to give her a hard copy. Regardless, they say that the sale is final and can't be reversed, and my understanding based on google searching is that that is indeed the standard for car purchases.   


In my brief conversation with them, the dealership indicated that her options were to sell the car back to them or essentially do a trade-in for another vehicle, but they wouldn't quote me a price because she wasn't on the line with me at the time, and they objected to speaking about her transactions without her present (understandable). We are inteneding to call them back soon together to find out what price they would offer her.   


I don't know what price she paid, but it was a new Mitsibishi SUV so I imagine it was in the ballpark of $30k. I believe her interest rate is in the neighborhood of 8%. She was not able to put any money down. The dealership is in Tennessee.   


As you can tell from some of these details my friend was not in the best state of mind while making this purchase, but in the dealership's defense she may very well have been presenting as a reasonable person making a rational decision. She doesn't have any current disability status or diagnosis of mental illness, although that might be something she will look into in the near future, and she did sign legal documents without coercion...so I don't know if there is any case that could be made that the transaction should not have been valid.  


My questions are:

  
1. Is it correct that selling the car back to the dealership might be her best option for undoing this decision and recouping most of the loss? Or are there other options that I could pursue with her?  


2. In this situation, what would you consider to be a fair price for them to offer her, relative to the price she purchased it for? She hasn't driven the car off the lot, but I understand that conducting the sale requires some labor on their end that should be paid for, and I also understand that the basic rules of supply and demand are different when selling to a dealership vs. buying the same car from a dealership....and furthermore I understand that if selling the car to them is truly her best option, they have her at an incredible bargaining disadvantage.

We had used one as the deposit on a house we were renting, and one to pay for our honeymoon; we've been making progress recently, setting up payment agreements with the various institutions we have credit with, and it's all budgeted in and doable since we've finally gotten some decent income going, and we're even starting some side businesses in addition to the work we both do as houseparents at a children's home.   


But my main question is whether or not it would be a good idea for us to get something like a personal loan, as a way to get a financial cushion, pay down some cards, and build credit by paying it back? I've been using CreditKarma to monitor my credit, and over the last year and I've gotten it up about 150 points from the abysmal 470 it was at, (it's okay to laugh a little) and one of the things it's suggesting is a $10k personal loan. My only hangup is that the interest rate on it is INSANE, something like 27.4%. we'd be paying back like $15k over 3 years with \~$400 payments.

Would the benefits of doing this as a method to build credit outweigh the cost? another factor is that it's been difficult for us to build any savings or have a financial cushion. Pretty paycheck to paycheck right now, especially given how long it took me to finally get a grip on our finances, so would it be worth it to have that cushion from the money leftover once we pay some cards down?    


Any advice or input from those who know more than I do would be great. Just looking for some general guidance since I'm still figuring all this out. Thanks everyone.",finance

personalfinance,Trying to rebuild my credit,"So, like so many people, I killed my credit score in my teens/20s and am taking steps to rebuild it. So far I’ve primarily focused on accounts in collections. I had four accounts totaling $3k and now I’m down to one at $750. I also have a private student loan that I’m current on but I do have one missed payment reported on that.

One thing I’m seeing is that my Sallie Mae account seems to be the only account that I have that reports my on time payments and I have 1 missed payment from 2017. So Credit Karma has my payments 97% on time which is bad. 

Also my federal student loans are in default, which I am going to start rehabbing soon, but that isn’t showing up on my CK account for some reason.

So the next steps are obvious right? Pay off that last collections account, rehab my big student loan, and get a secured credit card. But I still have questions!

It seems that other than the collections account, my on time payments are the biggest thing hurting me. One thought that I had was to look in to the Self Credit builder. Now before I get in to this just know I ran a search on the subject and it seems as though some people sorta missed the point, which is to add “on time” payments to your report. If I were to get my secured card (I’m leaning toward the Discover It, but am totally open to other suggestions) and set up autopay for the Self on my CC and set up autopay for my CC on my bank I would effectively be tripling my monthly on time payments. 

The other idea that I had was to actually take out two secured cards, set up something cheap like my Spotify account to one CC, autopay that CC with the other and pay that with my bank account, which would also triple my on time payments. And of course I could quadruple that with the Self builds AND two CCs

Now I’m sure there’s at least one fault to my logic here so please educate me! Am I correctly understanding how this will play out? What am I missing here? 

One thing I thought of is that once my Self loan is payed off it would lower my average account age, as would a secured card that doesn’t have the option to graduate to an unsecured card (Once my score is good enough for an unsecured card I see no need to keep the secured card, and if I just stopped using it the creditor would probably close the account anyway right?)

Oh and I would be paying these cards off during my grace period to avoid interest of course!",finance
personalfinance,Pay debt down vs build emergency fund,"My student loans (like many) have been put on a forbearance until Nov. 1 (when next payment is due) I'm almost done with a private loan that has a variable interest rate.

My husband and I disagree on which takes priority, so I'm looking at all my options.
I was initially planning on rolling over the payment i was making on my private loan into the federal one (1000/mo to pay down quickly) i have 64k in federal loans so it would take a few years regardless.

My husband thinks i should go to the min. Payment until we have a very cushy emergency fund (atm there's about 3k) and then pay the loans down. 

I want to get rid of the loan as fast as possible so we can qualify for a mortgage or build an emergency fund easily.

personalfinance,FHA Streamlined Refinance Advice,"Hey Folks!

I had a conversation today with my mortgage company about taking advantage of the new rates through an FHA Streamlined Refinance.  They are offering to change my interest rate from 4.375 to 2.875 with a savings of 235/mo.  Currently we have been paying 200/mo extra for principal only since day one of the loan, we currently have 26 years remaining.  The new refinance will keep the same term.

I asked the mortgage company why they are offering to lower the rates, they said it was for customer retention to reduce the number of home owners refinancing elsewhere.  We have had zero problems with this lender and have no problem staying with them.

My question is this.  Is there a catch an FHA Streamline Refinance that I am missing?  Are there any ""gotchas"" I need to look out for before signing the new loan?  Are there any CONs I am missing here?

I appreciate the advice!",finance

solar,"Washington state, USA: Please evaluate this install proposal","I'm in Southwest Washington state, specifically Vancouver WA. (It's just north of Portland, OR.)

The proposed 10.2kW system is using 30x Hanwha Q CELLS-BLK-G6+ panels paired 2-to-1 with 15x AP Systems YC600 microinverters. The gross, pre-federal-incentive cost is $23,450, or $2.29/watt. The home also needs a roof tear-off and replacement, and the same company is quoting $10,500 for a 31-squares-of-material Certainteed roof. 

Other quotes I've received are higher, typically in the $2.75-$3.00/watt (again pre-incentive) range. Those competing quotes use different, possibly higher quality components, though: typically Solaria or Panasonic panels paired 1-1 with Enphase microinverters.

Based on what I know, the prices in this quote seem good, except my experience with solar is about 6 years stale (this is the second building I've installed panels on).

My home has an unfortunately small amount of roof space which is usable for solar, only about 30% of the total roof surface area. This of course means power density is a huge concern, and that I'm paying higher prices for appropriate panels.

I know of one poster on here, /u/combatwombat007, who DIYd a 10kW system in my area for $16,000. Assuming equal materials costs, that means the labor cost in the quote I mention above is about $7,500.

personalfinance,Mortgage Refinance: Why shouldn't I pay points if the costs are added to the principal?,"Title should be mostly self-explanatory I think. I'm looking to refinance my mortgage, and saw that I could pay points to drop the interest rate, and just add the costs to the principle (rather than pay it at closing).

The funny thing about this was, the more points I paid (and the higher the principal went), the lower my monthly payment was (because of the interest rate dropping). Now unless I'm missing something, as long as the term of the loan is the same (e.g. 30 years), and my monthly payments are getting smaller, I shouldn't really care how much I'm adding to the principal. I will still end up paying less over the life of the loan.

Am I missing something here? Is there some downside?",finance
personalfinance,I have a lot of questions about paying for college,"I'm an incoming Freshman at UT Austin. I received a voucher that pays off my tuition for the 1st year of college at UT. However, I still have to pay room and board. I'll probably need 17k to be safe. I received 1500 dollars in grants, so that brings the total down to 15.5k.

Once I take out the Federal direct subsidized and unsubsidized loans, I'll need exactly 10k more. How should I get this? Is it better to take out a federal direct parent loan, or should I go with a private loan?

Another question: If I were to only take out the 5500 dollars in loans and try to pay off the rest via working, how would that work? Would I get the first few months of housing paid off, and then pay off the rest when the bill comes? Is room and board even billed monthly?

My instinct was to pay off the debt by the end of this year, then save for a down payment after. But I started thinking, house values in our area are absolutely increasing at a rate significantly higher than the interest rate on our loans, so wouldn't it make more sense financially to purchase a house sooner?

cardano,The Cardano Shelly Hybrid Era and the d parameter,"Hi, we’re ADABros.com (Ticker: [ABRO](https://pooltool.io/pool/2b86af0e2d02fde9b5e06785870bb271d3f891ecd14d40a75180a7ce/delegators)) Cardano Stake Pool and we are excited to share this latest development. This write up and info is sourced from the original [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiDHg-Ql2hU) posted by [Charles Hoskinson](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiJiqEvUZxT6isIaXK7RXTg) CEO of IOHK and founder of Cardano.

On July 29th 2020 Cardano network [transitioned into Shelly era](https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/shelley-is-here-the-cardano-blockchain-undergoes-a-historic-hard-fork-en/) with a [hard fork](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hard-fork.asp#:~:text=A%20hard%20fork%20(or%20hardfork,version%20of%20the%20protocol%20software.)). We have this concept of *d* (decentralisation) parameter and right now it’s set to *d*=1. It’s kind of like a wall that gets slowly but surely get taken down.

https://preview.redd.it/y6oql85jchf51.png?width=479&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=486565084cbcd519627ed936f02b8c39d3a8d786

The Cardano network gets fully decentralised when *d*=0. What the *d* parameter represent is the proportion of the block that are made by the stake pool operators (such as [ADABros](http://adabros.com/)), not the [OBFT](https://forum.cardano.org/t/cardano-obft-hard-fork-explained/30186) protocol managed by [IOHK](https://iohk.io/).

Right now the network is operating in a static and federated mode, so these IOHK’s OBFT pools are operating at for no profit whats so ever, just making blocks and upholding the network.

Now that the hard fork is done, all the logic is in place to turn on [Ouroboros Praos](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/573.pdf), which is what Shelly is running under. This is accomplished by setting *d* parameter to something less than 1, which means a percentage of blocks will be made by the Stake Pool Operators (SPO), instead of the OBFT nodes.

There are three phases to this and is determined by the value of *d* parameter:

https://preview.redd.it/pe3lrrkmchf51.png?width=875&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f668e6cc2488c7fa21112faced156bd287318e88

On the 14th of August 2020, a blog post will be released by IOHK that outlines the steps to bring down the value of d parameter towards 0.

We will have a new variable (let’s call it alpha α) that will act as a constant decay rate of the *d* parameter. Every epoch (where 1 epoch is 5 days), the value of *d* will decrement by the value of *α* marching towards 0.

Initial straw man value appears to be around 0.025, which means approximately in 200 days the *d* parameter will be 0 where the network will achieve complete decentralisation.",cryptocurrency

Loan 2 - Direct Student Plus - rate 7.08% - Principal $15,000 / interest accrued $392

Loan 3 - Direct Unsub Stafford - rate 6.08% - Principal $4,167 / interest accrued $0

All loans are federal and currently have 0% interest rate until 9/30/20. New federal student loans this year have interest rates that have dropped to 4.3% for Direct Unsub Stafford and 5.3% for Direct Student Plus. After completing my budget for this semester my financial need for everything school related / living expenses comes out to $21,516. My loan options for this semester are

Loan 1 - Direct Unsub Stafford - $16,500 - rate 4.3%

Loan 2 - Direct Student Plus (Federal Grad Plus) - $10,350 - rate 5.3%

My question is, would it be wise to take the max of both of these loans ($26,850) and use the amount leftover (roughly 5k) to put towards my higher interest loans (the Direct Student Plus from last year) or should I  follow the usual rule of student loans and take out only the bare minimum that I need ($21,516)?

stocks,Fed Vice Chair Clarida still sees the economy staging a comeback this year,"Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Richard Clarida said Wednesday he expects the economy to continue to recover through the year and likely return to its pre-pandemic level by the end of the 2021.

In an interview with [Steve Liesman](https://www.cnbc.com/id/15838058) on CNBC’s “[Squawk Box](https://www.cnbc.com/squawk-box-us/),” the central bank’s director of bank supervision said he hasn’t changed his forecast despite [a swell in Covid-19 cases](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/05/coronavirus-live-updates.html) that has caused a general slowing in resumption of activities.

“The economy took a huge hit in the spring,” Clarida  said. “My own personal forecast is that we’ll see a rebound in economic activity in the third-quarter data. The course of the economy is going to depend on the course of the virus, and it’s a complex picture.”

Clarida spoke just minutes after [ADP reported a sharp slowdown in private payroll growth](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/05/adp-private-payroll-growth-at-167000-in-july-well-below-expectations.html) for July. Companies added just 167,000 positions for the month after a surge of 4.3 million in June.

Though the number was well below the Wall Street estimate of 1 million, Clarida said he would reserve judgment on the jobs market until seeing Friday’s nonfarm payrolls report from the Labor Department. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones are expecting growth of nearly 1.5 million after the record 4.8 million in June.

“It will take some time I believe before we get back to the level of activity we were at in February before the pandemic hit,” he said. “My baseline view is that we could get back to the level of activity perhaps towards the end of 2021. There are a lot of moving parts with the virus and the global outlook.”

One factor causing Clarida to hold to his forecast is the expectation for [more rescue funding from Congress](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/04/coronavirus-stimulus-bill-updates-talks-on-unemployment-evictions-continue.html).

Though an impasse between congressional Democrats and the White House allowed extended unemployment compensation benefits to expire, talks are ongoing and leaders in Washington have expressed a likelihood that some compromise will be reached.

“The longer this drags on, the greater risk there is to long-term damage to the economy,” Clarida said. “I don’t think we’re at that point yet.”",finance

I have a vehicle with about 11000 left on the loan. I really would like to take that money out on the value of the house to pay it off. However adding that money to the value of the loan will push me over 80% which will add points to the loan. 

My question is, do I take out the loan and save the money going straight to 2.625 with no points or anything? Basically free refinance. Or do I add a point or two and a higher percentage. 2.8-3.0 and add that extra cash to pay off the vehicle loan?

I've been ignoring my finances for quite a while and I am looking for some advice on how to do all this right.

So I graduated from college last year. As of now, I have 20k in student loans with interest rates ranging from 6.7% to 9.2%. Currently paying that off at around $250ish per month with automated payments. I should probably be paying that off more aggressively now that I actually look at it, right?

I got a job at the beginning of the year with a salary of 105k, living in San Jose, CA. I have a checking account with 27.5k and a savings account of 15k with Wells Fargo that's kind of just been sitting there. I've started looking into different accounts and learned that Wells Fargo is super bad with APY's and such, so I've been looking to move that account somewhere more productive. I know Ally has a decent HYSA so I was thinking about moving my savings there, but IDK about my checking account. I don't often need to physically withdraw money since most of my transactions are online, but being able to withdraw once in a while is preferred. 

I've been contributing to my companies 401(k) account and grabbing my max employer contribution. Currently, I have 9.9k in my Fidelity account, with 7% going to my pre-tax contribution and 8% going to my Roth. 

I won't be having any major purchasing coming anytime soon. I feel like my money is just sitting around so I'm wondering what the best thing to do in my position. Moving checking/savings accounts is the obvious thing to me, but I'm not sure what the best options are. Is an HYSA actually the best thing to do? Should I be contributing more to my 401(k) instead of money  just sitting around in a bank account?

MachineLearning,[P] I built an API to return AI-generated faces specifically by gender and age,"I'm sure you're all familiar with thispersondoesnotexist and similar sites which generate realistic but non-real human faces using AI.

I was creating a game which needed thousands of these faces and was frustrated by the inability to generate this sort of image with specific gender and age criteria. There are a few sites out there but they either have very small sample sets (leading to duplicates if you are generating many faces) or don't have usable APIs.

So I created [https://fakeface.rest](https://fakeface.rest) which took c 15,000 human faces generated by thispersondoesnotexist, fed them through a ML algorithm to identify gender and age and then exposed the output via a web API. It's free.

So, for instance, you can specify:

[https://fakeface.rest/face/view?gender=male](https://fakeface.rest/face/view?gender=male)

or [https://fakeface.rest/face/view?gender=female&amp;minimum\_age=25&amp;maximum\_age=50](https://fakeface.rest/face/view?gender=female&amp;minimum_age=25&amp;maximum_age=50)

or if you want the JSON then [https://fakeface.rest/face/json?minimum\_age=40](https://fakeface.rest/face/json?minimum_age=40)

It can return JSON, serve an image directly (helpful if you want to insert into a web page) or provide a simple link. The file names are also intuitive so you can run processing on them locally as well if you save them.

You'd be +$1000 from investment growth, but -$2,000 from debt growth.

personalfinance,Should I pay off car?,"Hubs and I recently ran into a large sum of money.  We paid off credit cards (about 5k) and my student loans (about 6k) already. We plan on taking some money for home improvements (about 10-15k).

My question is should I pay off my car loan?  The car loan is a six year loan and I’m about a year in. I’ve been paying a little extra on it each month, so it will definitely be done before six years. Right now my payoff amount is about 20k. Will it hurt my credit score having no debt? I do have most my bills charged to a credit card, but I pay that monthly.

personalfinance,10 short(ish) planning/Roth IRA/investing/retirement questions that I still have after reading the wiki,"Hi, everyone. Lurker here, posting up since I want to take some steps toward a better financial future. That's why I flaired this as ""planning,"" since it encapsulates investing and retirement. I've read the wiki and, as all good instructional materials do, it's left me with more questions than I had to begin with (which is good, since the new questions I have are more in-depth). These should be easy/quick to answer, I think, but Google's giving me contradictory claims on some of these things, hence why I'm here.
  
I'm a self-employed freelancer with very little money to my name, but I do have a couple grand spare so it seems like a good time to set up a Roth IRA and get going on the retirement planning train since I'm still in my twenties. I have questions about that, and the investing that comes with it.  
  
Roth IRA questions:   
  
1) I keep seeing that Roth IRAs operate with ""post-tax"" money, but I get different answers when I ask the question ""so when/how do taxes come into play?"" Is there any point in the whole Roth IRA process when I have to give the government money and/or taxes, assuming I play by the rules and don't withdraw any interest/gains before I'm basically 60 years old? Or is the big benefit of the Roth route that taxes never come into play?
  
2) Is there any consequence at all to me yanking out some of my principal investments if I need them at some point, leaving only the accrued interest/gains in the Roth IRA? I figure that'd negatively impact my investment returns in a major way, but beyond that, no actual penalties, right? Even with a target date fund?
  
The investing side of Roth IRA questions:
  
3) When it comes to target date funds, does, say, Vanguard offer different ways to go about it (are there different target date funds/plans to pick from)? Or do I just give Vanguard my money once a year, a target date I want to yoink the money out at, and they handle every step?   
4) If I go with a target date/set-it-and-forget-it, is it permanent for the 40 years I'd set in motion, or can I take over and choose ETFs/mutual funds/bonds of my own choice at any time, if at some point I become inclined to learn about and handle things directly?  
5) Do you guys see any big downsides to the set-it route as opposed to handling it firsthand? I'd like to do this: where I put in around 5,000-ish each year and end up with 1.2 mil (ish) in 40 years' time. Is it reasonable to expect the set-it route to achieve this? Are there any major gains for someone who's clueless about this stuff, like me, to refuse the set-it route?  
6) If I go the set-it route, what are the odds (on a 1-100% scale, let's say) that Vanguard completely fumbles the investments and I end up putting in 200K over 40 years just to walk away with literally $0? What are the odds of just barely breaking even? And most importantly, what are the odds of hitting that approx. $1.2 million number derived from a standard ""7-10% interest rate"" (which I've heard isn't interest, it's actually just straight stock/bond gains)?  
7) Is interest the only thing that gains me money in this whole process? How does the actual value of stocks I'm indirectly invested in translate to interest, as opposed to gains? Some sites use these terms interchangeably but that seems wrong.  
8) Will Vanguard invest in ETFs/low-risk options, and will they diversify, or will they go insane with high-risk stocks? Do I have any say in the matter as the process unfolds over months/years? Can I set stock/bond ratios for them?   
9) As opposed to me just pussyfooting around the matter and not wanting to dive into the pool (or spending copious amounts of time researching the DIY approach to the point where I just abandon the whole idea), is there any real reason for me not to set up a Roth account right now, put the money in, go the set-it route with Vanguard and be off to the races in the next 24 hours?  
  
The plain old investing questions:  
  
10) Since I'm young, I'd like to at least invest a little money in returns that I'll see before I'm old and crotchety. Is there anything like a Roth IRA/Vanguard target-date that young people can use for the short-term (5 or 8 years from now, etc.) that requires minimal knowledge? Or, is there any low-risk way to test the water independently that requires a bit of knowledge but is easy enough to try out? As a low-income freelancer, I don't see the major benefits of a 401K. And since Roth IRAs have a very specific, low ceiling for how much they can be utilized per annum, I'm wondering if there are any avenues I'm missing here for gaining ""easy"" interest over time. Are there any rules/regulations on independently investing outside of your Roth IRA's activities?  
  
Also, and this isn't tied to any of the above questions, but... is this really what ""retirement planning"" is, for US citizens? Just making investments and praying to God that the stock/bond market plays nice with you over the decades? Seems kind of scary.",finance
personalfinance,Amex affecting dti for mortgage application,"I have an American Express platinum charge card. Basically everything you charge during the month is due that month. Charge $2000, pay $2000. I essentially use it instead of my debit card and put everything on there.

American Express apparently reports strangely on credit reports. My dti was already high due to medical debt (on credit cards. Decreasing but high.). So the American Express makes it look like my DTI is enormous when in reality I'm getting dinged for stuff I would put on my debit card each month.

personalfinance,Question about Re-Financing,"Hey Guys, 

Backstory.  Last year I was rear ended on my bike and it was a total loss.  I was thinking about upgrading anyways and had just paid off my car loan.

It's back up to a 750 and they've offered me their best rates if I want to re-finance.  I show up there this morning to sign the paperwork and they tell me I have to get the bike safetied again and pay the tax on it again because the only way for them to transfer the financing from one institution to another is for them to buy the bike back off me and re-sell it to me.

personalfinance,Upside Down on Auto Loan,"So as the subject notes - I'm upside down on my auto loan and sort of curious what my options are. I think I have a bit of a unique situation so... some details below:

&amp;#x200B;

* Bought the car out of my 2-year lease @ $20k with a $2k down-payment (I mainly did this because I was WAY over my mileage on the lease due to unexpected job location change). 
   * 6 year loan @ 4.34% interest rate (my credit score is 'great' so I don't know why I have such a high interest rate)
* Made some advanced payments and currently at $13.2k remaining balance.
* Currently at 64k miles
* Year of vehicle - 2017

The unique details:

* Engine block had a coolant leak and received a brand new engine under warranty (got lucky - I was at 59k miles when the powertrain warranty is at 60k). Engine is \~6 months old now.
* Wheels were stolen 1 year ago and replaced with brand new ones from insurance. This didn't affect my insurance rate. 

&amp;#x200B;

I contacted by current loaner about refinancing and they stated that I need at least 1.5k equity before refinancing, and that I'm negative on the loan. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. I have a good savings that I can spare towards paying off the car. Should I aim to get that 1.5k equity so I can refinance and get a better interest rate? 
2. Better yet, am I able to refinance with another credit union? Would they require me to have equity on the vehicle?
3. Should I aim to completely pay off the car since I essentially have a 'new' car?",finance
personalfinance,Taking advantage of low interest rates,"All,

personalfinance,Help with Quit Claim and a Refi,"Like the title says, I am looking for some help regarding the best way to proceed doing a refi and a quit claim deed.  Here is a little background:
 
I am on my home’s deed with my parents but our mortgage is in their name only.  We want to Quit Claim them off, add my significant other to the deed, and refinance the mortgage in our names, and take out a small bit of equity to do repairs.  My parent’s did this previously with my sister and her husband but it took a while for the mortgage company to “figure it all out” but now my parent’s seem convinced we need to stay with our current company because they did it before. 
 
We currently have a pretty high interest rate (just under 6%) and our current company said that due to my credit, we would have to “buy in” to a lower rate (4.2% for $5,000).  My credit was right at the 640 mark but my SO’s is over 720 and we have already been paying the current mortgage ourselves for over 5 years.  Two months ago, I paid off more than half my debt and, at the advice of our mortgage company, my parents added me to two of their high limit credit cards as an authorized user (to help with my utilization).  Since all of that, my credit is now still only between 650-680 (across the 3 bureaus).  My credit card debt is less than $5,000 and my utilization is around 14%.  I reached back out to my mortgage company and they said that’s still not good enough as they take the middle of my score, the middle of my SO’s score and then take the lower of those two.  With the additional buy in and $20,000 in equity, even with the lower interest rate, we would end up paying $100 more a month based on their current offer.  When my sister did this before, the mortgage company used proof that she had been paying the mortgage the whole time (like 2 or 3 years) to supplement her less than ideal credit but they are not offering me the same.
 
So here are my questions:
What is the best way to do a quit claim and a refi?  Is this something that mortgage companies are used to doing (contrary to my parent’s experience) or is this a really strange/abnormal thing?
Is it normal for the person with the higher credit score to not actually matter at all?  (since they are just taking my middle score only) Should our income matter/play a larger role?
Would I get a better rate if I shopped around?  If so, will other companies know how to do this (see Q1)?
 
Any additional advice would be greatly appreciated!!",finance

defi,Why would someone use defi over traditional finance? And are borrowers required to pay back loans?,"\#1 I keep reading how defi is supposed revolutionize traditional finance, but I don't understand how defi benefits everyday people.

In traditional finance, if you want to take out a loan, the bank will ask you to put down 10% and put up your purchase whether a car or house as collateral. For the average joe, loans are a way of obtaining money that they don't have. While nothing stops millionaires from taking out loans as a cheap of leveraging, most Americans participate in the finance system because they don't have money.

In the defi space, instead of 10%, platforms ask borrowers to put up 150%. This is where I question who the beneficiaries of defi are. If the average joe wants a loan for a $100k house, he's not going to put down $150k worth of ETH. I could try to rationalize a person who doesn't want to let go of their ETH, so they put up their ETH as a collateral to take out a loan to buy a house. But I just don't find this very sensible. This borrowing interest rate is too high and the volatility risk is too great. You are more likely to just sell a portion of your ETH and buy a house.

This leaves the only type of person who would take this loan is a speculator. They would put down $150k worth of ETH and then go buy another $100k of ETH. For this scenario, defi is mainly used for leverage, and the borrower hopes the price of ETH goes up faster than the interest rate.

If this is how defi works, it doesn't seem defi has done anything to revolutionize traditional finance, or benefit everyday working people. Is this accurate?

&amp;#x200B;

\#2 In defi, what happens if the borrowers never pay back?

Let's say a borrower puts up $1500 of ETH at $1000/ETH and gets $1000 DAI. If the price of ETH flash crashes down to $100/ETH, can the borrower just say ""fuck it, I don't want my ETH back, I'll just keep my DAI because its worth more.""

If this is the path i choose, i would also likely invest in a S&amp;P index fund on a monthly basis with the money i save, although it would likely amount to very little every month (100-200 dollars). Still, as my income grows this investment does too.

My second choice is to buy a condo. Due to the nature of my job, i have access to mortgage interest rates at a 2% discount. This of course, is highly attractive but comes with caveats. If i ever leave my job, i lose this discount and rates go back to normal, so I would only consider it if the non-discounted rate was attractive in, in itself. My mother is willing to also lend me a down payment of anywhere between 50,000-70,000 interest free, under the condition that we split the capital gains when the condo is sold and i pay for all expenses.

I can either move out alone, although i don't think i would be able to viably afford this or purchase a 2-3 bedroom and rent the rooms to my buddies, although this as well, would be awkward as i would be their landlord - but i believe, a smarter decision.

Would i even be able to realistically afford a 1,2 or 3 bedroom in a decent neighbourhood in Toronto, with all the unknown fees of owning and maintaining anything involved?

I would also like to mention i have about $25,000 in student loans and would prefer to pay these off quite aggressively.

I am still in the very grass roots planning phase. I apologize if i lack knowledge or am missing details, this is the first step in making a decision for me. Thank you for reading!",finance
personalfinance,Is my loan from Sallie Mae reasonable?,"I finally got approved for a loan with Sallie Mae. I went to approve it, and I was planning to pay the interest rate through college.

personalfinance,Advice for buying a new car and what to do at the dealership itself (NY).,"Hello all,

My mom is looking to buy a new car, specifically a new Hyundai Elantra, and asked me to go with her to the dealership.

(I know the usual advice is to buy used, but she does not want to and is concerned about unexpected/irregular costs, and Hyundai's warranty/complimentary maintenance has appeal in that regard. Her old Elantra was her favorite car, and she wants to have another one for a very long time.)

I was just looking for advice on what I should do/say/expect. I do not know anything about cars (I do not even drive). Namely:

- There would not be any circumstances under which leasing would be preferable or more financially beneficial right? I do not know how exactly lease-to-buy pricing works, but I can't imagine it would be better than just financing it in the first place.

- Advice for negotiating? I assume that there probably isn't *that* much wiggle room, but I don't really know the proper way to haggle about this kind of thing, so to speak. Do I say we are also looking at other dealerships, with other companies, etc. Should I aim for a price a certain amount below MSRP? Does the time of the year (and pandemic) factor into what I should shoot for?

- Is there a down payment it makes most sense to shoot for? What should I say regarding the interest rate (note, she does have good credit)?

- Anyone know anything about Hyundai in particular that it would be beneficial for me to know?

I've read the sidebar info and searched many conversations on the same issue, but was hoping for some advice that was a little more specific to my situation.

Thank you all.",finance
personalfinance,Giant veterinary debt,"Hi there!

I just recently graduated veterinary school (mainland, public school for the curious). As you may know, with veterinarians comes absurd debt to income ratios. I know the decisions I have made in the past aren’t the brightest, but I’m willing to accept them and face this thing head on without excuses. I have a principle of 300,000 federal loans that with interest over 4 years added in amounts to 336,000. Yuck. I did choose to consolidate to lock in an average of 6.4% interest. I may or may not regret that.

In school they taught us with high debt loads to just use IBR and save for the 20 years for the tax bomb. I was fine with this plan during school when there was every professor under the sun telling us it would be fine. but the more I think about it, the less I want to watch this already daunting loan balance climb as it has for many of my colleagues. So I’m thinking of a plan to attack it. A couple of facts:

1) I’ll be starting out in a busy mixed practice at an $80,000 pre tax salary. I’ll have full benefits. With taxes and deductions, I’m thinking I’ll get a little over 4,000 monthly. I’ll be doing emergency call 15 days per month and will get some extra cash flow from that as well. The salary does have the potential to go up as soon as within a few months. 

2) don’t yell at me but I took out a 22,000 car loan on a relatively newer, pre owned pickup truck, albeit a make known for it’s durability. I hope to keep it for a long time even after paying it off and next truck pay cash. payments are $455 monthly. It’s not flashy, will be great for the work I’m going into, and I desperately needed a new vehicle AND to build credit. So it is what it is.

3) I don’t have rent. I don’t have a mortgage. I’m blessed to have a place to stay for free (minus utilities etc) and I’m hoping to milk that for all it is worth. But will likely need to rent eventually. I live rural and COL is dirt cheap. 


4) I’ve budgeted my needs and ran a lot of scenarios, and I’m thinking I’d like to shoot starting loan payments at $2800 monthly, and chip in more as I advance in the career over the years. This is just a few 100 over the minimum payment on the standard 25 year, but if things go according to plan, I can have this bear gone in a little under 16 years, and that’s not accounting for the fact that I’ll be paying even more on the loan likely when the truck is paid off in a few years, or potentially own a clinic, etc. 

5)I am near an area that qualifies for USDA rural repayment assistance (25k/year for 3 years) If I can use my truck as a mobile practice and see patients in that area, I may be able to apply for this benefit. But that is highly competitive and isn’t guaranteed so I haven’t included it in my calculations at all. I think of it as a nice bonus if it is in the cards for me at all. 

6) I’m building an emergency fund. Had a little over 1,000, but had to use some today so down to 800. Oops! Plan to get to 6 months of expenses, and can do this fast even with the loan payment amounts discussed above. I’ll do 401k and some index funds as budget allows. Having no rent/mortgage right now really helps. 

So, some questions. I’ve considered snowballing. I can pay my truck off next year if I do that. The bad news is my student loan balance will bubble and I don’t want it to rise and not be able to have the payments under control. I’ve applied for REPAYE, as I am single, and my understanding is I can still make the payments I want but will just have that minimum 10% payment (probably $0 for this year.... no thanks). If anyone knows if you will be penalized for paying more than minimum on IBR please let me know because I haven’t seen any evidence to suggest it lol. I’d like to have it as a safety net, honestly in case I can’t make as high of a payment I want in any particular month. 

I know I’m facing quite the climb, but have I lost my mind or does this plan seem even a bit cohesive? Interested in your feedback",finance
personalfinance,How much of a lower interest rate on a student loan is worth refinancing?,"My wife refinanced her federal student loans earlier this year (right before they stopped interest on fed loans, ugh). Anyway, there were four loans totaling 75k with rates between 4-6.4% that were consolidated and refinanced to 3.54% fixed for five years. Now that we got all of our other debt paid off, we’re tackling her student loan which we have down to 55k already.

stocks,One more reason to hate Trump.,"I know the popular belief is that a republican is good for the stock market.

I for one think that the markets will collapse IF all the Fed support and money printing stops, since that is his only chance of getting re-elected. What do you think is going happen if he is?

We have about enough to pay off one of his loans that has a 2.4% interest rate OR we have enough to pay off about 13% of his loan with the highest interest rate of 6%.  Should we pay off the low interest loan so we no longer have that monthly payment or would the money be better spent lowering the principle his 6% loan?

Hello all,

tl;dr Can I clone my win10 laptop hardrive to ""upgrade"" my win7 desktop. And can I clone my win7 desktop hardrive to make my sh*tty laptop run better? 

I have a very slow i3 2bg ram laptop that runs win10 from factory. I use this for college and typing on the go.
I also have a ""gaming pc"" that I salvaged from a Dell Inspiron motherboard (i5 cpu) that runs win7 Ultimate. I upgraded the ram to 12gb and threw in a beefy gpu and it run almost every game at ultra (50fps average). I use this for gaming and digital mapping software. It works great.

I am very fed up with the slowness of the laptop. It takes FOREVER to do anything. Opening a document takes atleast 5mins and chrome is an absolute nightmare. I've tried using ""light"" browsers and other writing apps but it barely makes a difference. Especially when I'm trying to multitask.

I've been wanting to upgrade my desktop to win10 and I want to downgrade my laptop to win7.

Here's my Q's: Can I just clone the laptop hardrive to a 3.5' hardrive and use that in my desktop?

And can I do the vice versa for the laptop?

Will downgrading my sh*tty laptop to win7 even help? I've been wanting to upgrade the laptop ram to 4gb or 6gb since it hase an empty ram slot so should I do that rather first?

I've also been told the SSDs are much better for laptops but they are still mad expensive in my country.

Any advice is appreciated.

# **Markets could be challenged by Washington stimulus talks and China tensions  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/07/markets-could-be-challenged-by-washington-stimulus-talks-and-china-tensions.html)**
*****
&gt; The debate in Washington over the next round of fiscal stimulus and rising tensions between the White House and China could act as brakes on the stock market in the coming week.
*****
&gt; Stocks rallied in the past week but were more sluggish Friday, as investors watched stimulus talks between Democrats and the Trump administration stall out. Investors also were concerned that President Donald Trump’s executive order banning U.S. transactions with Tencent’s We Chat and Bytedance’s Tik Tok would accelerate the deterioration of relations between the U.S. and China and draw retribution.
*****
&gt; Just ahead of Friday’s market close, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said just that he is recommending the White House move forward with executive orders on unemployment, student loans and rental foreclosures. He said a compromise could not be reached with Democrats, who wanted a $2 trillion package. Stocks edged higher after the announcement though details of the orders and how any assistance could be funded were unclear.
*****
&gt; “It’s an attempt to bring the Democrats back to the table to negotiate a deal by threatening to use an executive order. They may be able to get some things down, but it won’t be enough to create the bridge they need while the economy continues to repair itself,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was up 2.4% for the week, ending at 3,351, after a 2 point gain Friday. The Nasdaq was down 0.9% Friday, ending at 11,010. It was up 2.5% for the week.
*****
&gt; “Part of the reason stocks have held in there well and continue to melt up is that one of the things that is priced in is a fifth fiscal policy package of $1.5 trillion. if we don’t get one, I do think the market will retrace lower to reflect a lack of stimulus,” said Arone. “The recovery will stall out without one.”
*****
&gt; As for China, it has so far not taken actions against U.S. companies, even with the Trump administration’s moves to block Chinese telecom giant Huawei from using U.S. parts. The latest steps, however, raised concerns that China could find ways to retaliate, and that the U.S. will bar Chinese IPOs.
*****
&gt; “On balance, continued hostility toward China is going to be a continued net negative for U.S. companies that are revenue exposed to China,” said Julian Emanuel, head of equities and derivatives strategy at BTIG. “We know the exposure is very centered in the Nasdaq names.”
*****
&gt; Emanuel said the stock market is entering a seasonally weak time, and while market psychology is still strong it could start to change. “The seasonals are starting to shift negatively. We all know September is a poor month and the degree of the escalation of the tensions between the U.S. in China is not a surprise, but the degree of the escalation over the last 48 hours is,” he said. “It’s not changing psychology, but it’s challenging bullish psychology.”
*****
&gt; In the coming week, there are some final earnings of the season, including technology company Cisco and food company Sysco. Some travel companies including Royal Caribbean report, as does consumer goods company Tapestry. In the week after, big retailers roll out their reports in the final earnings burst of the quarter.
*****
&gt; Economic reports could be important in the coming week, as investors watch consumer price index inflation data Wednesday and retail sales Friday. Retail sales should provide a window into the consumer, as workers returned to their jobs but also faced uncertainty because of reclosings.
*****
&gt; CPI is important as the market has been assuming inflation will ultimately start to show gains because of the weakening dollar and ballooning budget deficits. CPI last month showed a 0.6% increase month over month.
*****
&gt; The pro-inflation trade has become important and has driven investors into stocks, gold, and out of the dollar.
*****
&gt; # Watch this trade
The dollar could be the key to the fate of markets in the coming week. The U.S. currency was edging higher Friday but is still down about 3.5% over the past four weeks. Gold declined Friday, and Treasury yields moved lower.
*****
&gt; “The dollar ... to me it just continues to be an important barometer that has a unique intersection of rates, inflation and risk assets,” said Arone. “With rising China, U.S. tensions and combined with the fact that there’s uncertainty about the fiscal policy package and the fact the dollar has declined so quickly, many are expecting it to catch a bid here and rebound.”
*****
&gt; Part of the move in the dollar was based on the idea that huge government spending would increase the government’s deficit and Treasury issuance. Emanuel said the news on stimulus could have a big impact on the trade.
*****
&gt; “We would make the argument the baseline expectation was a trillion dollars worth of stimulus to be implemented sometime in the month of August. Anything below that expectation is likely to cause the dollar to strengthen,” said Emanuel. “It’s a momentum and positioning trade as well as what has been ... the unwind of an asset diversification trade.”
*****
&gt; The stalling of talks could shift the market’s view that the U.S. is willing to spend any amount to fight the impact of the coronavirus. “It’s changing the market psychology that the government’s propensity to spend infinitely is not as great as it was earlier in the week,,” Emanuel said. “The dollar rallying, from our perspective, is a direct threat to a lot of these momentum trades.”
*****
&gt; Strategists said a strengthening dollar could be a headwind for stocks.
*****
&gt; “Given the friction with China, to the extent the inflation numbers come in weaker than expected, the argument being that whole weaker dollar asset diversification has helped feed into increasing inflation expectations,” said Emanuel. “If the inflation data does surprise to the downside, given the rally in inflation ...it’s further potential for the unwinding of the short dollar trade and the unwinding of the long gold trade which in our view bleeds over into stocks.”

&gt; # Individual Investors Still Don't Believe

&gt; As mentioned in a prior post, in the past week the S&amp;P 500 has moved within 2% of its 2/19 high, but at the same time, less than a quarter of AAII respondents are optimistic for the future of stocks over the next six months. That begs the question- if there have been past times that sentiment and price action have been so detached from one another. Since the start of the AAII survey in 1987, there have been 10 periods (including the current one) in which the S&amp;P 500 was within 2% of an all-time high but bullish sentiment was less than 25% without another occurrence in the prior three months. The most recent prior occurrence was not even a full year ago. Back in October, sentiment was only slightly higher as the S&amp;P 500 was 1.84% from its all-time high. Prior to that, there were some scattered instances throughout 2013, 2015, and 2016 but before that, you would have to go back to 1993 to find another similar period. The one occurrence in 2013 stands out as it was both the lowest sentiment reading of these prior occurrences and the only one that occurred with the S&amp;P 500 right at an all-time high.

&gt; As for where things stand after such instances, sentiment has tended to reverse higher in the following six months as the S&amp;P 500 has tended to move higher. The S&amp;P 500 has actually tended towards better than average returns over the next three months, although performance six months out has been modestly worse than average, even as it has been higher more often than not. Additionally, as shown in the second chart below, of the more recent occurrences of the past decade, they haven't marked any major top or bottom for the S&amp;P 500 with occurrences clustered both coming off of lows and in the middle of longer-term uptrends.

&gt; # Silver Takes the Gold

&gt; Gold and silver prices were already on a tear heading into this week, but they've only seen their gains accelerate even more. With more than a day and a half of trading left in the week, front-month gold futures have rallied, but silver has been the real show stopper with a gain of 16%!

&gt; Taking a look at a one-year chart of silver over the last year, things have really gone parabolic this week as the front-month futures contract is trading more than 40% above its 50-day moving average (DMA) and 62% above its 200-DMA.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/080620-Silver.png))**

&gt; Were it not for the move in silver, gold's move would be getting all the attention. Prices for gold have also seen a major surge in the last month, rising from under $1,800 to the current level of $2,060 per ounce. While not as extended as silver, gold currently trades 14% above its 50-DMA and 26% above its 200-DMA.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/080620-Gold.png))**

&gt; With gold 25.7% above its 200-DMA and silver 62.2% above, the average spread of the two commodities currently stands at 44.3%. In the 40+ year history of the two futures contracts, there have only been a handful of prior periods where the average spread of the two commodities was larger or even above 35% for that matter with the most recent occurring back in early 2011. This recent rally in the two commodities has certainly been one for the ages.

&gt; Within the US equity market, we've seen some major moves in individual stocks off their 52-week lows over the last few months. Look at the table below. Within the Russell 1000, which tracks the performance of the largest companies in the US, stocks in the index are up an average of 87.6% from their respective 52-week lows. Looking at performance by individual sectors, stocks in the Energy sector are up an average of 136.8%, while the average Consumer Discretionary stock has rallied 131.4%. The Technology sector wasn't hit nearly as hard by the Covid-crash as other sectors, but stocks in the sector have doubled on an average basis relative to their 52-week lows. The only sector where stocks are up less than 50% on an average basis from their 52-week lows is Utilities at 46.33%.

&gt; For many investors, the holy grail of stock picking is the proverbial ten-bagger. A ten-bagger is a stock that multiplies by ten times its original price. Usually, this happens over the span of years, but in the Covid-economy, we've actually seen a number of these ten-baggers play out in the span of months. While most of these examples are in the small-cap space, shares of Wayfair (W), which has a current market cap of $27.5 billion, have rallied from $21.70 on March 19th to its current price of $290.85 now. That's a gain of more than 1,200% in less than five months!

&gt; Within the entire Russell 1,000, 257 stocks have at least doubled off their 52-week lows, and in the table below we highlight the 34 stocks that are at least a quarter of the way to the ten-bagger club and have rallied more than 250%. As mentioned above, W tops the list, but Fastly (FSLY), which has barely been public for a year, is just shy of the club with a gain of 992%. Behind FSLY, Livongo Health (LVGO) is up 855%. Given that LVGO just got a takeover offer from Teladoc (TDOC), the 11th best-performing stock on the list, it may only make the ten-bagger club under the banner of the TDOC ticker.

&gt; In looking through the list of stocks shown, many of these names come from the Health Care, Technology, and Consumer Discretionary sectors and have been direct beneficiaries of the new Covid-economy. At the same time, six stocks from the Energy sector made the list as well as they recovered from their bombed-out levels after oil prices briefly traded in negative territory earlier this year.

&gt; # Bullish Earnings Season So Far

&gt; At our Earnings Explorer tool available to clients on our website, we provide a real-time look at beat rates for both EPS and sales. Below is a snapshot from the website showing both the EPS and sales beat rates for US companies reporting earnings on a rolling 3-month basis. Currently, 64.61% of companies have exceeded consensus analyst EPS estimates over the last three months, while 63.75% of companies have beaten consensus sales estimates over the same time frame.

&gt; In looking at the chart, you can see a big spike in the EPS beat rate over the last few weeks. Since earnings season began on July 13th, nearly 80% of companies have posted stronger than expected EPS numbers. That's a huge beat rate and suggests that analysts were too bearish on Q2 numbers heading into July. The revenue beat rate held up much better than EPS beats throughout the first half of 2020, but it too is on the upswing this season.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/epssales.png))**

&gt; We also monitor how share prices are reacting to earnings reports. So far this earnings season, the average stock that has reported Q2 numbers has gained 1.31% on its earnings reaction day. That compares to a historical average one-day change of just 0.06% on earnings reaction days. As shown below, stocks that have beaten EPS estimates this season have gained 2.2% on earnings reaction days, while companies that have missed EPS estimates have fallen 1.89%. It's rare to see beats gaining more than misses decline, but that's what is happening this season.

&gt; # Labor Market Continues Summer Momentum

&gt; After falling the most on record in April, the US labor market has rebounded with three consecutive months of job gains, adding back more than 9 million of the 22 million jobs lost in March and April. In July, the economy added back nearly 1.8 million jobs, ahead of Bloomberg consensus estimates for 1.5 million and lowering the unemployment rate from 11.1% to 10.2%, but lingering measurement issues could add 1% to that number, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, job gains were broad based across industries, with a third of the increase coming from the leisure and hospitality sector—the “scene of the accident” industries—while only information, and mining and logging posted declines in July.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.7.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “March and April were historically brutal months for the labor market, but the labor market’s resiliency this summer has been a welcome development,” stated LPL Chief Investment Officer Burt White. “However, the next few months will be critical for the economy as schools reopen and additional fiscal stimulus still hangs in the balance.”

&gt; The July report also comes on the heels of a rise in COVID-19 cases across the Sunbelt region of the United States. Because of the date of the survey, it may not fully reflect the economic impact of some of the more recent high-frequency data that has captured some of the effect of rising cases. Still, the jobs report shows that the US economy is continuing to heal despite the long road ahead.

&gt; # Are Recessions Good For Stocks?

&gt; This isn’t like any recession we’ve ever seen, as it was sparked by a horrible pandemic and happened because people were told to stay inside. The impact was the worst contraction in gross domestic product (GDP) last quarter that anyone who is reading this has ever seen. But what is quite surprising is the fact the Nasdaq has made 30 all-time highs so far in 2020, while the S&amp;P 500 Index has gained four consecutive months, all while the unemployment rate remains above 10%.

&gt; Why is this happening? There are two main schools of thought. One is that stocks are forecasting a better economy later this year and into 2021; remember, stocks tend to lead the economy and could be doing so once again. Another school of thought is that the massive fiscal and monetary policy are boosting equity prices, while not helping the overall economy quite as much.

&gt; Here’s the catch. It actually isn’t abnormal to see stocks gain during a recession. “This is one that might surprise many people, but stocks have actually gained during 7 of the past 12 recessions,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “There’s no question the difference between what is happening on Wall Street compared with Main Street is about as wide as we’ve ever seen, but maybe it shouldn’t be as big of a surprise that stocks have been strong.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 actually gained 1.3% on average when looking at the 12 previous recessions going back to World War II, with a very impressive median advance of 5.7% (the average is skewed lower due to 2008). We continue to expect this recession to end soon, if it isn’t over already. In fact, when the end of the recession is officially declared at a later date, we could have yet another recession that saw stock market gains.

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks.",finance
computers,Fed up seeks knowledgeable and patient,[deleted],technology
personalfinance,Lender offering credit to pay for points,"I'm refinancing with rocket mortgage and they're offering a 2.75% interest rate, no appraisal fee. Current principle is $280K, refi principle will be $286K paying nothing out of pocket. $2800 of that is escrow that will be refunded for post-close (I'll more than likely pay closing costs out of pocket to keep the principle the same for personal preference)

They said that I'm technically getting 1.375 points for the rate, but they added $3582 in lender credits to offest. My understanding is that points are tax deductible so it's something that can work to my benefit? Should I be weary?",finance
personalfinance,Need advice on old 401(k) as well as budgeting and paying down debt.,"Hi,  so I had been on disability and then worked at grocery store and over  time switched from that to fully working for myself (over about two  years) and finally quit my grocery store job for good this week (hadn't  been doing my one day since March).

During this I went from making about 30k a year to what will be about 50-60k this year.

I  have 30k-ish in student loan debt (not paid at all), 10k car note,  about 2k in medical bills (on payment plans), and about 2k credit card  debit (which is zero interest until the end of the year and I will pay  it off by then).

I have about 5k  in a 401k from my old job and 5k cash, and that's it. Credit score is  about 740. Rent in South FL. Single, mid-30s, live alone.

What  should I be doing? How do I deal with my old 401k? Should I create some  kind of investment account, and if so can I self-manage it or should I  hire someone? I know I'm not making that much money but I've never been  in the position before to actually save/plan money and want to build a  future for myself. My car note is only $180 a month and has a high interest rate so I'm planning on starting to pay more towards that,  assuming that's a good idea.

MachineLearning,[D] RNN-T: How does the prediction network work in inference mode?,"One of the strangest parts reading about the RNN-T architecture in the context of ASR for me is that several papers, such as [this one](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.00841.pdf), describe the the idea that ""during each step of inference, the RNN-T model is fed the next acoustic frame x_t **and the previously predicted label y_u-1.**"" The label goes into the *prediction network,* which is analogous to a language model. This seems in stark contrast to training, where the prediction network is instead fed in the correct label sequence off the bat.  

The problem is that *there is no predicted label* -- the output of RNN-T networks is a softmax distribution at each timestep. We need to use decoding, like beam search, to come up with hypotheses, but beam search produces multiple hypotheses, and RNN-T apparently needs to know a firm label at each timestep, which would imply that we're locked into a label once we guess it. The paper even purports to use beam search. What am I missing here?",technology
personalfinance,Home refi - Long process but rates are lower,"I started my home refinance process about a month and a half ago and was locked into a 2.99% interest rate. I didn’t expect the process to take this long, and now it looks that rates are even lower, around 2.6%. We haven’t closed yet, we’re in underwriting still I believe.

Some of the slowness process was my fault in submitting things incorrectly, but most of it is their fault, they weren’t able to verify some legal things (I guess there’s someone with my same first and last name with a lien against them in my county, but they should’ve been able to take the abundance of personal info I gave them and verify the lien isn’t against me, just general slowness, etc.)

Should I hackle them to get me today’s rate? What approach should I take?

EDIT: Turns out that our interest rate lock ends tomorrow so I’ll probably be looking at deciding on a new rate again. I’m not 100% sure they’re as low as I thought although it seems likely because of the more recent government stimulus. What’s the best quick way to find this out for sure? (I don’t trust the mail I get that promises insane rates, lol)",finance
personalfinance,Interest rates for convenience loans?,"I am in the process of purchasing a home, and they are using a convenience loan, my question is that the lender is telling me that the loan is locked at 3.5 but I see that rates have gone down to less than 3 in the last week's, can I renegotiate or look somewhere else?",finance
personalfinance,Thoughts on using the high-interest savings account on VARO?,"Currently I have a local credit union in my area and I'm receiving pretty much no interest on my savings. I was thinking about switching to VARO for the high interest savings account but had a few questions: 

1. For higher interest, do the deposits have to be direct deposit or can they be transfers from another bank?
2. What is the limit on transfers to and from another bank? Both in terms of the amount and frequency.
3. Is the debit card linked to the savings account or would a checking account be necessary as well?
4. If there was a direct deposit of $1000 one month and a portion of that was either spent or transferred would that month still be eligible for the higher interest rate (assuming the other qualifications were met)?
5.  In the unlikely event that VARO dissolved, what would the process be like to get the money back that has been insured? Would it be the entire amount or only a portion (&lt;$250k).",finance

personalfinance,Better to pay a larger down payment or buy points?,"Hello, I purchased my first house for $335,000. Property tax is estimated to be \~$7,000 - $8,000. HOA fees are about $100/month. I put down $10,000 as a deposit/earnest money. 

(It's a new under-construction house, so the property taxes are an estimate based on surrounding neighborhoods.)

The loan officer gave me a rate of 2.6% APR + $800 origination fee for a 15-year fixed rate. Unfortunately we were unable to lock the rate in because we don't have an exact date for closing. It will happen sometime in December.

I was originally going to put down the bare minimum 20%, \~$57,000, as a deposit payment. This would put our monthly payments at \~$2,700 (incl. mortgage, property tax, HOA, and home insurance). 

Interest rates will probably go up by the time we will be able to close on a house (btw is this normal? That the L.O. will not lock a rate until we are closer to closing?) 

I have roughly $120,000 sitting in my bank account and was considering dumping $100,000 as the down payment to make our monthly payments smaller. Or would it be better to pay those interest rate points? 

My S.O. and I make roughly \~150,000 combined per year (pre-taxes), so we have roughly \~$8,500 per-month take home.",finance

computers,Trying to clean up fossil computer and it won’t let me download anti-virus?,"Today, much against my wishes, as my dad knows I’m waiting for a refurbished MacBook Pro to arrive, he decided to send me his 2004 Acer aspire 5720-6249 laptop. It’s loaded with XP. Even though I would never log into anything on there without giving it an exorcism, I’ve decided to spend the day cleaning it up and trying to make it run somewhat like new, for fun. Things went great for deleting extraneous apps and files, zipping his stuff. 

I hit a snag after deleting the sketchy version of AVG security it had. This snag is that I can’t download anything on it. I can surf sites but when I tried to download Norton Security, Linux Fedora, or a modern version of Chrome it said “site not found.” The main websites for these companies were found, it’s just hitting the download button things got messed up. 

I reset all security settings, deleted all security toolbars and nothing. Except, despite successfully removing it, I get AVG pop ups with just source code inside when I click to downloaf these things. I’m guessing that all this means that this computer is crawling with malware.  Do you have any suggestions for getting these to download? Or should I just wipe it and lock it in a closet somewhere?",technology

personalfinance,How much money should I have after I purchase a home?,"My fiancé and I are in the process of purchasing a home in the SF Bay Area, where we live. The home's sale price is $980,000 and we plan to put down at least $215,000 for down payment, possibly more if it makes sense to buy points (we can currently get either 3.125% or 3% with 0.371 points, translating into an extra $2,800 up front). Apparently interest rates jump if you borrow more than $765,600 because of federal guidelines so we'll have to put down a bit more than the traditional 20%. We've also allocated about $15,000 to closing costs so our total down will be $230,000-$235,000.

This will leave us with about $35,000 in savings and my brokerage. Would this be a good enough amount of savings to re-start building our nest egg? We do have some bonuses coming up in the latter half of the year so we expect some cash inflows, but are feeling a bit uneasy with that amount in case something goes wrong with the house before we get those bonuses.",finance

personalfinance,One of my goals for a car loan is credit building ( I have no credit history)- dealership says this is an excellent idea. Are they right?,"They said while the interest rate will be quite high (13%), I can make a big down payment and then pay small monthly payments for a year- a year being the minimum loan length to reflect strongly on my credit score, and they said car loans are far superior to things like credit card payments.

 He claims  it's so superior in fact, that it's worth the interest payments, which is estimated to be about $200 for this $10k car loan if I make the big down payment. Though insurance will be more expensive due to financing, about another $200 more per year, and also GAP coverage with the loan will add about $300. So we're looking at about $700 to essentially fast track credit building. I think it may be worth it, and I'm feeling pretty convinced, but I figured it would be a mistake  to just take their word for it. What do you guys think?",finance
personalfinance,Buying out my half or mortgage,"Hello, I own a duplex in Portland Oregon with a friend. We bought the property in 2016 for 380k. We currently owe 335k and the interest rate is 3.25% on a 30 year fixed-rate mortgage. We are estimating the property to be worth 439K although it hasn't been formally appraised. My friend lives in half of the duplex and we have renters living on the other side.  The renters cover my half of the mortgage ($1,100) and what is left ($75 monthly) is put into a savings account that we use for repairs/improvements. We currently have 6k in that account. We have both put in an equal amount into the equity and the savings account.

My friend and I get along very well and there is no strain or tension in the relationship. My family situation has changed and I have moved out of the city. I don't see myself returning and living in my half of the duplex. We have started to have conversations about her buying me out as she would like to live there long term.

I would like to be fair to my friend, but I want to make sure that this would be a smart financial decision for me as well. Does anyone here have experience with this sort of a mortgage transaction or does anyone have any advice on how to approach the conversation with a friend? I'm not even sure how the process works. Also, bonus points for any pointers or things we might not be thinking about.

personalfinance,Pay down debt or invest? Flow Chart Step 5,"Hey Reddit,

I've listed my debts/totals below. My mixed interest rate is 2.60% which is well under the 4% that the FLOW CHART lists as moderate interest debt. The flow chart never addresses the payment of low interest debt so I'm trying to figure out when I ought to pay off the low interest debt. I'm planning on upping my TSP contribution to 15% next month. I've cleared all the other relevant portions of the flow chart, which puts me at Step 5 on the chart give or take.

I should have about 800 - 1000 extra monthly towards either debt or investing. I have a Robinhood Account and a TSP. And the debt is below - the Big Card has a promo rate until July 2021 so I plan on paying that one more aggressively overall. The rest of the interest rates are fixed.

|Debts|Minimum Monthly Payment|Total Owed|Interest|
:--|--:|--:|--:|
|Mortgage|$ 1,250.00|$ 120,000.00|2.63%|
|Student Loans|$ 75.00|$ 20,000.00|3.50%|
|TSP Loan|$ 260.00|$ 11,800.00|2.13%|
|Big Card|$ 175.00|$ 14,000.00|1.99%|
|Total|$ 1,760.00|$ 165,800.00|2.60%​|

So what do you think? Pay the debt first? Invest first? A little of both?Any calculators that could help me mathematically choose the best way forward would be appreciated.

**EDIT** I knew I forgot something - I will be getting 18k over 6 checks in the coming months, the 800 - 1000 is on top of the amount. So I could knock out the big card with that money, among other options!",finance
stocks,Market Notes 8-8-2020 (Part 1),"**SENTIMENT REMAINS BEARISH AS STOCKS KEEP RISING; GOLD IS EXPLODING**

We are in a market melt-up and it just keeps on going. AAII investor sentiment was slightly less bearish than last week, but still far above its historical  average, finishing the week at 47.6 *bearish* (vs. a 30.5% historical average), and only 23.3% bullish (vs. an average of 38%). There is in fact, every reason to be bearish on the economy right now, but try telling that to the stock market, as nearly every major index improved significantly in the past week: large caps, midcaps, small caps, tech stocks, and even transports, although only the NASDAQ notched a new high at another big round number, 11,000, the S&amp;P 500 is almost there as well. 

 The fact that Congress is at an impasse on restoring the unemployment pay of 30 million people, we are on the brink of a cold war with China, three foreign governments are bent on interfering with our elections, Covid-19 cases keep increasing, and so many other things we took for granted for so long, like dinner and a movie, sports events, vacations etc. now seem like experiences from a bygone era, feels completely incongruous with a rising stock market, as I have said before. This is UNCERTAINTY3 (for those who hate math symbols, that means uncertainty to the third power). That usually precipitates a correction, but not this time so far.

Even Tom Lee of Fundstrat, the perennial bull, was circumspect this week, saying he was worried that there could be a correction. The risks are enormous – election risk, including but not limited to the possibility that the president will refuse to leave office if he loses, a more serious trade/cold war with China, massive homelessness if Congress doesn’t pass a new aid package, massive debt if it does, negative real interest rates, inability of the Fed to lower rates to stimulate the economy in a near-depression scenario, a possible huge drop in consumer spending, huge spikes in Covid-19 cases as schools reopen, potential collapse of the airline, hotel, and restaurant industries, collapse of city and state infrastructures, and about fifty other things that would ordinarily constitute important concerns but which are overshadowed by the crisis this virus has wreaked upon us all.",finance
personalfinance,Should we refinance?,"Hi there! I’m wondering if we should refinance our home. Hoping to lay out the facts needed to make a call on this below, if I’m missing anything that would be helpful please let me know. 

- 380k loan in 2018 
- now at 366k 
- rate around 4.5% 
- zero down loan 
- PMI around 270 
- next door neighbors just sold their house at 405k 
- the worst part about our house is the deck needs to be redone (wondering if this will play into appraisal)
- houses in our neighborhood are off the market in 48 hours or less 
- we’ve paid off about 20k in credit debt since we bought the house 
- my credit score is over 800 now, partners is high 700s 
- carrying zero credit debt month to month 
- I have just under 60k student loans that I’m paying off. Payments total to $600 per month (but the federal ones right now are zero) 
- partner has a car loan just under 20k 
- we don’t have more cash that we want to put towards equity right now. We’re paying more than the mortgage each month to help 
- joint income has gone up around 30k since we bought 

The worst part is that a year after we bought our house with a zero down deal from our credit union, they came out with a deal a year later for zero down AND they pay your PMI. You can only get it if you buy again, not refinancing. 

From what I understand if our new equity is about 10% it could lower our PMI?

personalfinance,Pay off cars or drop lump sum into student loans?,"My wife and I have saved up about 30k while student loan interest and payments have been suspended to drop into student loans when the suspension expires. For now we've been leaving it in a savings account to accrue interest (at about 1%). Wondering if this was a poor decision as we also each have car loans (@2.9 and 3.9%). We have enough to pay off both cars and have some left over for student loans. 

However our student loan interest rates are higher (between 5-7%). Does it make sense to pay off the card now since student loans are on pause and take advantage of the time value of money or does the higher interest rate on student loans outweigh this benefit in the long term since the suspension is only temporary?

personalfinance,Physicians Mortgage and Credit Questions,"I’m looking at getting pre approval for a 30 year fixed mortgage.  I’ve sent emails to 3 different lenders.  I asked 2 about a physicians loan and 1 about a Standard loan.  

As I understand it, the physician loans are supposed to have a higher interest rate, but you can put less money down, and you don’t have PMI.  Traditional Loans are lower, but you pay a PMI

The loan estimates for the physician loan were 2.85% ($2,696/mth) and 3.25% ($2,828/mth).

Then the traditional quote was 2.65% ($2,623/mth) with a PMI of $412/month (Total $3,035/mth)

The traditional loan doesn’t seem worth it against either of the other lenders.  Am I misunderstanding how this works?  Are there more back end fees?  It feels a bit too good to be true.

My questions:

1. Do these rates seem reasonably accurate for someone with good credit?  
2. Are there any reasons I should be wary of the Physicians loan?
3. Should I get preapproved for financing before I put in any offers?  I want to be ready to move if we want to get a place, but I don’t want to feel forced to buy a place within 3 months.  Does it affect my credit score if I have to extend it or get another offer in the spring?",finance

At the dealership, they ran my credit to see what i qualify for. I dont recall the rate. but we also ran it with my mom as a cosigner. And as well as her as primary and me as cosigner. the 3rd option gave the best interest rate (for obvious reasons, as her credit history is much older). So i just went ahead with that option.

so technically, my mom is the ""primary"" and im the cosigner. and thats the part im wondering about.

does the cosigner have the same ""power"" as the primary? in the future, will it show other lenders that I took out a loan for a car as a cosigner or just in general?",finance

MachineLearning,[D] Spectral Norm Regularization for Improving the Generalizability of Deep Learning,"Hello!

I go over a paper on spectral norm regularization for deep learning which is a promising regularization technique which works by trying to lower the spectral norm of the weight matrices.

video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-cckDPsWWU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-cckDPsWWU)

paper: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10941](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?redir_token=QUFFLUhqbExjQzlYbTdReWVJZHBGT1VERl9KVDVsMmRzd3xBQ3Jtc0ttWUtrZGVacHNBcGIwdjZzazFkYmx6WGFhOE52VDhuSHBENE9GSjd1M2VmdjBTb295cUxBUU1oM2cteG5iaUVyazBSV3lMVlY4RjN4S0FiWTdVdHRNMHRYVHhTUm9IbFVkUGtVdDBUSkZ4SmZNQzNNbw%3D%3D&amp;event=video_description&amp;v=F-cckDPsWWU&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Farxiv.org%2Fabs%2F1705.10941)

abstract:       We investigate the generalizability of deep learning based on the sensitivity to input perturbation. We hypothesize that the high sensitivity to the perturbation of data degrades the performance on it. To reduce the sensitivity to perturbation, we propose a simple and effective regularization method, referred to as spectral norm regularization, which penalizes the high spectral norm of weight matrices in neural networks. We provide supportive evidence for the abovementioned hypothesis by experimentally confirming that the models trained using spectral norm regularization exhibit better generalizability than other baseline methods.

2200 expenses 

After taxes my take-home from job #1 is about $1600/month. I’ve been picking up overtime once a week when childcare allows, so the last couple months I’ve made closer to $2200/month to scrape by. Job #2 has been inconsistent. I was working one day a week, making about $960/month before the pandemic. But they cut all of my hours since March and only started allowing me to work again in mid-July. They usually text out the day of asking for me to pick up. The hours are still pretty limited (usually night shifts only) so I usually can’t find childcare to pick up these shifts. 

Credit score is currently 670. I currently have about $500 in my savings. Not great, I know. 

I am actively testing for a career as a firefighter/paramedic which, in my area, has an average income of $70-90k. If I can get hired in the next few months (which is likely), I will probably start making that salary in January. But I also know better than to count on money I don’t have yet. There is a high need for paramedics in my area and I am one, so the likelihood of me getting hired soon is pretty high. I just need to pass the physical test, which had been a struggle in the past. I’ve been working out every day and I think I will pass it in early September. 

I am struggling to meet my monthly payments and I recently had to borrow money from my parents, which I hate. I am contemplating getting a personal loan through Upstart to consolidate my debt, get rid of credit card debt, and give me a little more cushion. I realize there is a chance I might just be digging myself deeper, which is why I’m here seeking advice. Upstart has preapproved me for a $15,000 personal loan with a 17% interest rate. Monthly payment would be about $350. I could potentially pay off Card 2 and most of Card 1. Or I could pay off my car (to get rid of that ridiculous monthly payment) and Card 2. 

I am also contemplating borrowing money from my retirement. At job #1, I have a retirement fund around $10,000 and I could borrow any amount and pay it back over the course of 10-20 years. Interest rate would be about 3%. So a few dollars would get taken out of my monthly paycheck. The downside is that if I get hired and start my new job in January, I’ll have to pay it back in a lump sum (which my parents said they would help with). 

Until now I have been doing the snowball method to get rid of credit card debt and I am actually doing much better than I was a year ago. Just trying to figure out the best method to continue moving forward. My SO has a trip in six months that I would also like to save up so I can join them and our daughter.

personalfinance,Zoning Issues affecting loans,"So I recently realized that purchasing a house is in my future. Current landlord wanted me to buy my rental, I looked into the financing and saw that it was not only possible but I'd make out on monthly costs. Then the appraisal hit and landlord was unwilling to negotiate back to our original estimate or even close. Now I'm packing and searching.

Found a place that is ideal on many fronts. Turns out that it is zoned 'Residential/Commercial', which is interesting, but with the relatively new caveat of 'if 50% of the home is damaged, the property must be reestablished as commercial only.' New as in the Municipality just wrote that in after it was listed.

The realtor that showed me the place was not the listing agent, and has never dealt with something like this, nor have I nor anyone I know. Evidently all of the lenders this particular realtor work with can't write a 'Conventional Mortgage' because of this stipulation. I'm preapproved by someone else for the ammount and have a hefty down payment built up, but am told I need a different type of loan, 'Unconventional' with a much higher interest rate.

I don't want the place so badly as to pay double in interest what I would otherwise, but wonder if anyone has dealt with this before.

I can't seem to determine if there is an actual legal reason for not underwriting the loan and I HAVE to go that route, or if I just need to find a willing lender.

Also, how would one insure something like this? 49.9% of the home value plus contents?

I'm fairly certain this is not a scam, but I'm not sure if this is at all doable regardless of it meeting ALL my criteria.",finance
personalfinance,Will getting a car loan raise my credit score faster/higher than just buying a bunch of stuff and paying it off in full?,"So I am fairly young, 19... My family members have been telling me that to raise my credit score fast, getting a car loan would help. The thing is, I don't have the need, or want to spend $15,000+ on a car. My old truck does just fine and gets me where I need to go, and the maintenance is cheap.

I've only had my chase credit card for about two months now and my score has gone from 650 to 692 in that time period. I work a trade so I buy a lot of tools and stuff like that. Also my truck gets horrible gas mileage so I end up paying a lot for gas. 

Everything I just mentioned I pay in full using my credit card. My end goal is to be able to make a 40% downpayment on a $300,000 house by the time I'm in my mid 20s with a nice interest rate.

personalfinance,Amending 2019 return on Turbotax... should I report 1099-B for sale of RSUs?,"I filed my 2019 tax return a couple months ago. Got my federal refund but not my state refund (CA). Called the FTB and they said they needed me to send my W2 and 1099 so they can check that the values are correct. Not sure if this is normal. 

Before I do that I'm trying to see if I filed it correctly in the first place. Looking at my tax return on Turbotax I can see that my gross income was a lot higher than I expected... the difference being the amount of gains on my 1099-B. 

What's shown on the 1099-B are my previous employer's stock options that I sold. I think these were reported as regular income on my W2 and on the 1099-B I can see that it was properly taxed (Fed, ssn, med, state, etc).

personalfinance,Student loan debt- What to do??,"I graduated with my masters of science earlier this year and have acquired about 55k from doing so. This is my first time having debt as I was fortunate enough to have saved enough money to pay for undergraduate education out right. I’m starting to really regret furthering my education because of this debt and not seeing an increase in my annual income (43K) and now the added financial stress of trying to save for a home, needing a new car, and now paying off student loans. 

I am still in deferment for my loans as it’s been less than 6 months but am trying to plan for the future. As of now I have 4 different unsubsidized federal student loans with interest rates ranging from 6-6.8%. The loan amounts range around 5K, 10K, 15K, and 22K give or take. 

I’m needing some advice on what option will help me pay this off the smartest way. I’ve considered consolidating them federally, for an interest rate of 6.3% and the possibility of student loan forgiveness.

Does investment mean basically saving money for a specific purpose? I see how education is a good example because in the long run you'll have a good job that can pay off the loans/debt. But why are car loans or mortage an example? How does mortage or car loans produce more wealth in the long run?

2. For credit cards why are there annual fees and high interest rates? Wouldn't everyone choose low interest if its cheaper? Or is there a benifit of choosing high interest vs low interest, if so any real life common examples where that applies?

3 ""Keep the lowest credit limit possible"" (The total balance you can have on your credit card). What happens if you exceed the limit? And what is the limit? Is the limit told to you and how do you know if you go over the limit?

personalfinance,Should we buy our 2nd home now or save for a year or two first?,"Hi there,

We're looking to rent out our current house and buy a bigger 2nd home that will be our primary residence.




New home: $300-$400k
Existing home: $100k equity, $100k left on mortgage. 
$1.5k/month mortgage





Is it better, with interest rates so low right now, for us to just buy a 2nd house without a down payment now and finance the full amount? Or should we stick to our original plan of saving up a down payment for 1 or 2 years, then buying the 2nd home? We'd save up between $25-$50k in that time. 





We plan to rent our existing home out no matter what the timeline is on moving into our next home. Rent will probably be $300-$500 more per month than our existing mortgage payment with insurance /taxes /escrow included. Several homes of our size and value in the same area rent for $2k/month. 




How does it work to own 2 homes? One huge mortgage with both houses rolled into one loan or two separate loans? 





We also plan on having a property management company rent the house out etc. Is that a bad idea? I'm very handy and can do most tasks around a home, but I'm also crazy busy at work and usually work 7 days a week. So time would be the biggest factor in maintaining a property.

personalfinance,Looking for resources regarding refinancing a mortgage,"Hi,

We have a 30-year mortgage with about 27 years left on the loan. The principal loan amount is now about $465,000 with an interest rate of 3.75% APR. The loan is an FHA loan, so we spend about $300 per month just to mortgage insurance, and our total monthly payment (including escrow) is almost $3000/month. The amount of equity based on current estimates we have of our house is around 17.5%.

It seems like current rates have dropped about a percentage point below, and even lower, what our current rate is. Given the life of the loan (we don't intend on moving out anytime soon), we want to know if it would make sense to refinance.

To this end, we contacted our originating mortgage lender when interest rates were higher than they are currently, and the closing costs were going to be around $5k so it didn't make much sense to refinance. Does anyone have any sort of calculator where we could find out if doing the refinance makes sense? With rates being so low I think it definitely will, especially so if we can drop the mortgage insurance. 

1) Are there any links out there that would help us determine if it would be worth it?

2) Who should we get the refinance through? There is no reason why we would need a mortgage lender that can close fast (we had to choose a lender that could close quickly because we bought our house before the holiday season), so whatever ends up being cheapest would be preferable.

3) Is it possible to keep the lifetime of the loan constant, i.e., keep the loan term to 27 years? We don't want to be reset to 30 years and could potentially go lower depending on the monthly payment.",finance

I’m sure there is no right answer, but wondering what others do and if my thoughts on setup are at all useful or am I over engineering this?

My partner and I are engaged and have been talking for over a year already about condensing our bank accounts, but what is efficient here? I’d like to at least condense our savings accounts (since her interest rate is trash), and keep our checking accounts and some credit cards separate. That way, we both have “our own” money to spend on our own separate interests, and maybe gifts for each other without the other knowing, etc - it’s not just to buy things and hide them from the other, but just to have our own freedom to spend our own fun money and kind of manage it ourselves. 

But then I think about bills and other necessities that we pay for each month. For these I feel like we should maybe have another joint checking account - call this the house fund, for mortgage, bills, food, gas, house decorations, etc etc. Both of us would contribute a portion to of our monthly income to the house fund to meet our necessities, a portion into our joint savings and our retirement plans, and then keep whatever is left in our separate accounts to spend however we want. 

This way, all of our combined expenses come from one account we both contribute to, but we can still buy each other things with our own money and add new value to it - i.e. we could use the house fund for dinner out one night, or I could say my treat and use my own fun money.

I can either:
a) sell everything (lots of coins) and go balls deep in Nexo and their 10% interest - fixed and stable

b) split the entire stash (25%/25%/25%/25%) across Nexo, Compound, dydx, Aave - in order to minimize risk (or so I think).  

The coins:
1) 80% of my holdings are in DAI, and I prefer DAI over any other stable coin.  
2) I also hold some MANA, ZRX, KNC, ETH and others.  

Current strategy:
Deposit my EOS, TRX, BTC, ETH, USDC, XRP, XLM (together worth about $20k) and another $20k in DAI on Nexo.   

Deposit $40k in DAI on Compound  
Deposit $39k in DAI and $1k in BAT on Aave

Why so many coins? I've been hodling them for a long time, and when I learned Nexo offers a 5% interest on non-stablecoins, I figured it's better than just having them sit in a wallet.

personalfinance,Question about paying off a credit card,"I have a credit card through Synchrony Bank. It is specific to Amazon. At any given time, it has a balance between $500 and $1,000. It has a $4,000 credit line. The interest rate is pretty high. I think it's 25%, but it might be 21%. I pay $100-$200/month on the card. The minimum payment is about $40. 

I'm not sure if it's worth it to make one of my financial goals, ""Pay off the Amazon card.""   


On the one hand, that's a high interest rate. I have asked them and I can't lower it. It was locked in when I signed up. I'm not sure if, in general, a person can pay off a card, close it, and re-open the same card/carrier to get a lower interest rate. I didn't think to ask that. **Does anyone know if you can do that??** 

On the other hand, I use this card a lot. I have cut down on my Amazon purchases a great amount, since I'm trying to lower my spending and save more money, but I don't think I'll ever just *stop using Amazon*. It's really quite convenient and I do like being able to get things we need and pay for them over time. We used this for our new kitchenware when we bought our house. We used it for our children's school clothes. It is rather convenient.

If I did close out the Amazon card, I would basically pay it off, close it, and then start limiting myself to $100-$200/month on Amazon, so that it's still about the same amount of money. But it would take some time to pay it off. For example, I pay (on average we'll say) $150/month, but I'm still spending about $60/month on new purchases. Kind of three steps forward, one step back.

stocks,Investing vs Trading: A reminder of tax implications,"*TOP EDIT:* This post has gotten a lot more attention than I expected. Due to some critiques posted in this thread, let me preface this post with this statement: Please consult your own personal and trusted tax professional. Don't believe anything you read on the internet without verifying all the information yourself. Tax code in the US is complicated, and this post is primarily US focused. The information in here may be over simplified, but its meant to get people thinking about the implications of various trading activities on their taxable income. Its better to start now thinking about your 2020 tax burden rather than in December when you can't do anything about it.

 = = =

We've seen lots of posts recently from ""new"" investors freaking out over recent dips in the market and deciding whether they should get in or out. This is just a quick little post (and reminder) that anyone buying stocks should remind themselves about the impact of taxes on the trades their making.

Lets take the most recent meme stocks example: FSLY and NET

Lets assume you bought FSLY and NET on July 1 because you felt bullish going into the July 4th weekend. You would have bought Net at $37 and FSLY at $86.50.

Now lets assume that you were smart enough to get out at the peak, which was August 4 for both stocks. FSLY would have sold for $116 and Net for $42.50. That means a 34% gain on FSLY and 15% gain on NET.

But here's something you should ALWAYS think about: if you sell you need to subtract 34% for the tax man since that holding was less than 1 year and it is taxed as income. So your 34% gain on FSLY is actually a 22% gain, and your 15% gain on NET is actually a 10% gain.

Now lets do the numbers:

If you held FSLY for 1 year (until July 1, 2021), you only needed to get it to a price of $105 (not $116) to make the same money. For NET you had to hit a price of $40.70 (not $42.50).

Keep all this in perspective when you look to ""take profits"" or ""should I keep holding my stock"".

Also, this DOES NOT take into effect the reallocation of capital. If you only have $100 to play with, and you bought FSLY at $86.50, holding for 1 year could be opportunity cost on other potential plays. In that case, you probably fucked up in timing your entry and exist. If you only have $100 to play, then what were your objectives on a stock that is already up 400% in 3 months? Did you expect another 100% movement after earnings because you prayed to JPow for more stimulus?

Be realistic and critical about each move. These ""the stock is down, what should I do?"" posts are getting old. Here's a better question that should be posted to this sub: ""The stock is down to X, which is Y times the revenue to market cap ratio. I've done this research to indicate that the company can grow at this rate, which doesn't align to analysts. What are other people's opinion of my research so that I can more accurately assess my own personal price target for this stock I own, or am planning to own"" &lt;/rant&gt;

Effective tax rates for someone making $150,000 a year would be around 20% for federal income tax. Beyond that, I think its also important to know that long term capital gains tax is a graduated system where most people would be at 15% step: 
https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital_gains_tax.asp

If you're single filing tax payer, and you're making $150,000 a year, then the difference between selling short term and long term is more like 5%. Sell now and realize the gains as income (ie. 20% effective tax rate) or hold and sell later to realize the gains as capital gains (ie. &lt; 15% effective tax rate). The question is, can you reliably put up gains via trading that exceed that 5% buffer. If you cannot, then buy and hold. If you can, then trade!

**Edit2:** In addition to taxes, I think to be a better trader, every person at the end of the year should do a comparison of what every stock they bought/sold would have netted them if they had just bought and held. Obviously, this assumes infinite capital since you can't do any reallocation. But it would be a good exercise! Spend a couple hours calculating how much money you made doing trading, then compare it to if you had just bought a couple of good movement stocks (ie. reliable like AAPL, MSFT, or more volatile like SHOP, SQ, TSLA) and just held them. Replaying trades is important, and understanding the tax implications of each strategy, and then weigh that against how much time and effort it took to trade. If the numbers don't add up, change up your strategy.",finance

personalfinance,"Should I pay off my heartland student loan (at $3,500) or some of the principal of my fed loans (total amount is 43,000)?","Hi friends, so I’m about to reach my emergency savings goal (of $14K) and since the student loans are gonna be pushed back again, I’ve been trying to think of a game plan. 

Some more context, I make 40K a year and will be renting a house after my apartment lease is up in January, so my rent is going to go up slightly. In the next couple months I want to divert my leftover money to student loans. There’s my private loan through heartland that’s 3,500 and there’s the big lump of federal loans that I could pay a chunk of about the same amount towards the principal. 

I like the idea of paying the private loan off because that’s one less bill I don’t have to pay every month whereas I’d still have to pay both loans monthly if I threw a chunk of money at the fed loans. But then I feel bad cause it’s a great opportunity right now to pay on some of the principal while there’s no interest on my federal loans. 

I’ve been obsessively going back and forth on this for the last two days because that’s just my overthinking brain, and now I have a stupid headache, so I’m turning to you guys for advice now. Big purchases/payments give me major anxiety because I grew up poor and am terrified of ruining myself financially. Uuuggghhhhhh",finance

personalfinance,"$1900 rent or monthly mortgage of $5000? Also, are those rent/buy calculators actually accurate?","We live in a nice neighborhood in Los Angeles and don’t want to leave this area due to proximity to work and other reasons. Our apartment is essentially a two bedroom. We have a down payment of $200K. We don’t have kids but even if we did, one kid is all we’d have. We’re happy in our apartment although having a backyard would be nice. We both can probably get the best interest rate out there too. We are not interested in buying a condo and unfortunately homes in our area start at 900K. 

Rent versus buy calculators online say that we should never buy a house at this price range when we rent for $1900, even thirty years down the road with inflation and increases in rental prices. Are these calculators accurate?

To complicate things, we also spoke with a financial manager who said that we shouldn’t buy a home either and should just invest some of our down payment instead. This is probably biased information coming from him..but is it still sound advice based on the above numbers? 

Any of you guys looking at the same numbers and if so, what did you do and are you happy you made that choice? 

Thanks ahead for your insights.

[UPDATE: you guys are awesome strangers and I appreciate your time and thoughts in responding to my post. I think for now, we’ll keep renting and lay low and see what 2021 has to bring us in terms of buying a house. In the meantime, we will put away half of our down payment in our vanguard and keep the other half for emergency/home buying. We plan on splitting our future savings half to vanguard and half to replenishing our down payment in a a high interest savings account.]",finance

personalfinance,Never give out personal or financial information on a call you did not initiate,"It happens often, and it seems like common sense. But, how often have you been called by your loan company, or your phone company, or your insurance company, or internet company, and that call has started with something like:

&gt; ""Hello, this is Sandra from Comcast calling about your account. Before going any further, for your security, please verify the last four digits of your social security number.""

And then you just tell them.

This is *insanely* easy to spoof. It doesn't matter if you have legitimate business with the company, or if you owe them money. It doesn't matter if you're worried that ignoring them will ""make them angry"" or anything like that.  **It doesn't matter if the caller ID matches the number you expect it come from.**

Even these simple phone calls should be refused.

&gt; ""I do not give out any personal information to someone who calls me. I have no way of verifying who *you* are, or if the phone number has been spoofed. Please tell me what matter this is about, and I will call the number posted on your company website to discuss it.""

If they refuse, then hang up. If you are worried, then call the official number anyway and tell the representative that you just received a call that got disconnected, and you'd like to know what the call was about.

Do not let them make you feel crazy. Do not let them make you feel paranoid. Do not give in no matter how reasonable it may seem.

Once, I was 45 days late on my car payment. They obviously called me about that. They always tried to verify. I always refused. This didn't result in anything extra on my credit, this didn't result in anything worse for me, it didn't make them pursue legal action. It didn't affect my future customer service with them.

I simply called back on the number that I usually contacted them, *then* verified who I was, then I explained my situation and when I planned on bringing my account back up to date.

Never, ever, ever give out any Personally Identifiable Information on a call unless you made the call *and* you trust the other party. This includes, but isn't limited to:

- Address
- Full name
- Drivers license
- Bank information
- Credit card information
- Payment history information
- Current balance information
- Connect/Disconnect dates
- Account numbers (even for non-financial accounts like your electric company)
- SSN
- Tax information
- Employment information
- Names of relatives
- Names of people you live with

Don't give *any* information to someone who calls you and claims to be with a company that has business with you.

EDIT:

I should note, **this includes calls from a government agency that calls you, such as a tax authority, a licensing board, or a welfare agency**. No government agency is going to throw you in jail for refusing to give personal information over the phone in nearly every country on the planet.

EDIT2:

This also includes **asking them questions which reveal personal information**. Such as, ""do you have my new address?"" or ""Did you send an email to [address]?"" or ""What was the amount I paid last month?""

You might ask these questions in an attempt to reverse it and make *them* verify themselves. But even questions like the last example above give away information you don't want a scammer to have. You don't want a scammer to know for sure that you *have* made payments to a specific company, you don't want them to know you recently changed addresses, you don't want them to know your email address.

This is why, as I said above, you should hang up instead of trying to make them verify who they are. **This is true even if it's from a company you know you do not have business with**. If you get a call ""from Comcast"" about your account, but you have a different provider, don't let the caller know that you don't have a Comcast account, and don't let them know who your provider actually is. Tell them the same thing you would tell them if you did have an account:

""What is the matter about so that I can call the normal customer service line and discuss it?""

EDIT3: 

This is true **even if they volunteer some kind of verification**. A scammer might know the last four digits of your SSN, or know the last four digits of your credit card, and then leverage than into getting more information from you. It doesn't matter what they say, or what they provide as proof. **You still never give out personal information over the phone unless you made the call yourself**.",finance

gaming,Cancelling Preorders Process (Sony &amp; Microsoft),"Hey all- I was one of the folks ready to dive in head first into Avengers and preordered both Digital Deluxe Editions for XBox One and PS4. After the Spider-Man exclusivity and disappointment in the beta, I decided not to take a stand and not support this game with my hard earned money.

This weekend I decided to cancel both preorders, but in doing so I had to go through hoops with Sony while Microsoft's process was very easy and automated. Here's some tips on cancelling preorders for those that might be having difficulty - particularly with Sony.

**Sony Preorders:** 

* Cannot cancel through console, must do it through Sony Website.
* Must go through a ""RefundBot"" who doesn't actually do anything other than give you a Support ID
* Following up on this over the weekend forces you to use Live Chat. I got an error and was forced to abandon queue.
* Today (Monday) I did the same process and called the ***phone number 855-413-3938*** which got me a much quicker result. Note this live support number is only staffed M-F 9am-6pm pacific.  Much better than the live chat process.
* Agent on the phone confirmed my information and confirmed cancellation of product over phone and email. The call was less than 5 minutes.

**XBox Preorders:**

* Cannot cancel through console, must do it through Microsoft Website.
* On the support page, use the ""Ask a question"" virtual agent option.   [https://support.xbox.com/contact-us](https://support.xbox.com/contact-us) 
* After answering a series of questions by the bot, it was able to pull my order information immediately.  I was able to cancel my preorder without having to call anyone or speak to a live agent.  Fully automated.
* Self-service process took roughly 5 minutes.

I hope these help some of you that decide not to purchase this game.  Of course, I made the mistake of preordering to begin with, I guess the comic book nerd in me got the best of my impulses.",technology

I’m a recent May graduate with my BA in Economics and Data Analytics. In May, I accepted a job with a pharmaceutical company for a data analyst role. The pay is hourly until I hit six months, it’s not bad but I know it’s low for the field. I’ll be honest, I took the job because I was at wits end trying to land something, especially in the current labor market climate. This role is really just organizing data to meet certain federal standards-nothing too “analyst”.

I’ve always thought about this job as a placeholder until something better comes along. I plan on being here for around a year, because by then I’ll have some sort of experience. 

My question is, is it wrong for me to continue to look for a different job that aligns more with what I want to do? What else can I do while working full time to make me more attractive to employers?

Currently I’m saving a chunk of my paychecks in a Marcus savings account but with interest rates continuing to drop, I was thinking of maybe investing in low risk bond funds or index funds to help put my money to work. Is this a bad idea due to taxes?",finance
personalfinance,Legit Debt Consolidation Options?,"I hope you're doing well. I'm looking for some pointers on how to deal with significant debt. Below are the details, be warned, this is a hot mess and I'm less than proud of the decisions i've made:

Age 27

Consumer Debt: 
$19,094 total, spread across 4 cards (I don't use them any more) with rates between 16 and 24% APR. Paying only the minimum on all, the debt will be paid off in February 2026 (ouch). Monthly minimums are about $450 total.

The bulk of this debt was accumulated during the initial stages of renovating the house (see below) after I was burned by a contractor I hired (and fired). This was a long process where I was repeatedly deceived, exploited for more cash and threatened with legal action all while trying desperately to finish the construction of the property. My first home. There were several points that I thought using cards were my only option, sucker as I am, and accumulated this consumer debt trying to finish the project. 

Other Debt:
Mortgage on my house  $124,966 principle with a 5.375 interest rate. Around $70,000 of this was for the purchase of a gutted home, and the rest of the mortgage is an escrow account to fund the renovation (which is finally nearing completion) Mortgage, taxes and insurance are at $911 total

Income: $35,000 year, try not to laugh as this includes a recent raise. I'm trying to put a side hustle together but no results to speak of yet. So income is about 2,200/month. After the mortgage and card bills, much of what's left is going into utilities or projects for renovating the house, so some of that will free up this fall as the project is completed. Though to be sure I could spend less in other places (food especially)

Credit Score:
582, down from 730 when I bought the house 18 months ago. 100% on time payments but utilization is through the roof, and I've only had active accounts for 2.5 years.

 I get junk mail offers weekly offering debt consolidation, but I am afraid they are scams of one sort or another. I know legitimate consolidation services exist but how to know which are a good deal? I think I could get a handle on things if I wasn't paying double digits of interest. I applied for a loan to consolidate from my local credit union but was of course denied, you've seen my debt to income. 

I'm aware of strategies for paying cards down, targeting the highest interest first, but I don't have much left over after the minimum payments anyway. I am working to reduce unneeded spending to address my debt emergency and some of those gains can go toward the card. But I still have no savings to speak of so paying more than the minimum will only a marginal gain at this point. Debt consolidation seems like it's worth exploring but I don't know where to start. 

Any input would be appreciated. thanks!",finance

personalfinance,Denied refinancing for car due to “limited credit experience”. What can I do at this point? Credit score on denial letter is 774.,"I am 22 with 5 credit cards, first credit card was in 2016. I have no debt and bought a new car last month. We got a good OTD price with Toyota so they shot up my interest rate. I figured since I can refinance with my score, I took the deal. 

My first payment is next month and I applied to refinance at Alliant.At the dealership, I only put 2k down since I planned to refi anyway. For the refi, I wanted to put 5k down. I was denied due to limited credit experience (unfortunately this was my first big loan besides credit cards)

Toyota Finance : $24500 PAYOFF, 5.6% interest at 60 months. I planned to play it off earlier as well but the interest rate is crazy.

What I put on Alliant app: $19.5k amount hoping to finance (after my 5k down payment) at 72 months.


I don’t really know what I did wrong since my credit score is good off the report they pulled. I can’t fix my limited credit experience since this is my first big loan. I really want to refi ASAP to get away with that interest rate. I feel like my hands are tied since I have the funds to make this work but just someone to approve me. 

I actually thought I was in a good financial spot but this hurt my feelings hahaha. But no really, is it just a matter of unions accepting me now? Is it likely that I’ll be denied from other places due to this factor?


EDIT: Submitted another app to a credit union the next day. Got approved for 3.2%!!",finance

personalfinance,Reported an asst manager for hit and run and told to give my time card to him tomorrow after I resigned from the position,"Large company contractor, rhymes with T-Rex. Been on the job for 2 days and the driver training me (who also happens to be an assistant manager) backs into an apartment complex's covered parking section, totally obliterating it. I ask him, what was that? He says, nothing just a gutter. He then proceeds to tell me there's no office so we won't need to report it.

This doesn't sit well with me. I ask him 30 min later if we will be reporting the incident to the general manager. Tells me not to worry about he will do it at the end of the day.

Continues to drive like a maniac, turning corners so hard packages are flying off shelves and hitting speed bumps as if they don't exist at all.

At this point I have determined the guy might literally kill me so I called the manager myself to report the incident. Manager seems unconcerned so I tell him I'm not re-entering the truck and have my wife pick me up.

This evening the manager tells me that I need to pass a drug test before I can come back to work. I'm confused, did I hit the covered parking or did the assistant manager who was driving hit it? You'd assume a felony(?) hit and run would result in a suspension or investigation of some type, right?

Well guess what!? The self proclaimed concealed weapon carrying assistant manager was not disciplined (edit: this is an assumption due to the fact he's clearly working the next day) and the manager told me to take my time card to him (assistant manager) tomorrow morning. Obviously I declined to work for them further. 

How can I make sure I get paid for the 18 hours I worked in the last two days?

EDIT Thank you for all your responses. I'm going to reach out to the apartment complex and confirm someone from FedEx contacted them. If nobody has I'm going to file a police report and provide thorough details to the apartment manager. I don't *need* the job money wise, I just got tired of sitting around for 3+ months doing nothing. At my previous job I managed routes for 20+ vending machine drivers and regularly had to deal with these types of issues the correct way. Also worth noting I had about 5 other companies that wanted to hire me after 12 interviews so I have no problem finding more work.

EDIT2 pics @ https://imgur.com/a/KMx919i -- there was a car below the damage when it happened but he left so quick I didn't see if there was any damage to any vehicles.

EDIT3 clarification of drug test request - I was hired on after telling them I need a few weeks to pee clean (Marijuana is legal in Washington State). The manager told me it was no problem and I could train without driving until I passed a drug test. After this incident they won't employ me until I pass the drug test first.

EDIT4 Manager telling me I'm wasting his time following up.

UPDATE spoke with the owner of the contracted delivery company and he assured me I will be paid and the incident was reported to FedEx and the apartment complex.

investing,"We do not live in a political and institutional vacuum, you should keep that in mind","Every now and then, people on here think they have some “brilliant” thought about the markets. Often it’s something they believe no one else has thought of, and will make them money. And it goes both ways, bulls see a coming surge. Bears have analyzed the markets and “know” they’re in for a large dip. I claim that whoever in here believes he or she timed the markets,  is fooled by randomness. 

Either way, let’s talk about one common trait among a lot of bearish posts in here...

... They seem to imply we live in a proverbial vacuum. Every time the world doesn’t end, I see posts and comments along the lines “of only the Fed hadn’t X” or “if only the lawmakers hadn’t Y”. Well, ok, interesting theories, but we live in a developed world. Governments will always do X and Y, and institutions are always ready for Y. And if they’re not, the legislative bodies are ready to step in to fix whatever systematic faults need to be addressed. The whole market economy is just a set of laws and regulations, and those laws and regulations are being adjusted and amended all the time. Therefor, any analysis made on the assumption that the world will just stay passive when there’s a risk of it burning, is sloppy and irrelevant.

“The Congress can’t just...”, yes they can. “The Fed can’t keep...”, yes they can. Same goes for the EU. Don’t underestimate the political will of the European Union member states. “They can’t save Italy should their bond yields skyrocket...”, yes they can and they will.

personalfinance,Dealing with medical related credit card debt,"Hello, I am seeking advice for dealing with about $37,000 in credit card debt that I incurred when I couldn’t work for about 9 months back in 2018.  My current payments are around $1,000 per month and that is mostly interest.  I make a decent amount now (about $92,000 per year) so I’ve been able to afford this but I can’t get ahead as I also have a car loan, ongoing medical bills, student loans, and I pretty much fully support my mom who lives with me (except her $25,000 a year social security).  

I recently sold a condo I owned part of, and netted about $20,000.  I also owe $12,000 in back medical bills to various facilities, doctors, etc.

So my question is how can I actually pay these cards off?  I’ve been through non-profit debt counseling before and done a program to reduce my interest rates and paid off cards in 5 years but that was for a relatively small amount of debt, when I was in my early 20s and knew nothing about credit and made $25,000 a year.

I’d really like to both reduce my monthly payments to free up some money for ongoing medical costs, and reduce my interest rates so I can actually pay off the cards in a reasonable amount of time. 

I figure my options are:

1.  Go through non-profit debt counseling again.

2.  Go with one of those companies that promises to settle your debt and you make one lower monthly payment to them, but they seem sort of sketchy and aggressive and too good to be true.

3.  Pay off my car (about $11,000) and otherwise spend down my condo profits and declare bankruptcy.

personalfinance,My Credit Score Dropped 176 points overnight,"I have spent YEARS closely guarding my credit score, and it was all the way up to a 755. Long story short, I came out of forbearance with some of my private student loans (not federal). Due to the pandemic, dealing with special needs son etc, I completely missed the emails they were sending about setting up a new payment plan. I get that I made that mistake. 

However, overnight, my score dropped to a 580.

Please refrain from bashing me and telling me it's my fault for letting this happen. I understand I slipped up and didn't realize I wasn't in forbearance.

personalfinance,Closing on a house with 2.875% rate - put less down to attack student loans? My partner and I are slightly at odds.,"Hello all - 

My partner and I are closing on a home in a couple of weeks. As stated, we secured a 2.875% rate for 10% down at 30 years. 

We have \~100k in liquid cash at the moment. We also have $86k in student loans. 26k of that is at an abysmal 8% rate, with the rest at still-troubling 6.55% rates. 

No matter what happens, we will be paying off the 8% loan in full. 

We are currently planning to put the 10% down, which would be $33,750. All told, after the down payment, paying off the 8% loan, stocking away 6 months of emergency fund, and a 1% home repair fund, we will be left with $6,000 for initial home furniture/update money for the new house. 

I have recently become keen on the idea of putting down only 5% which would give us another \~$16,000 to put into our student loans. Given the low interest rate of the mortgage compared to the more-than-double-that rates of our student loans, I am struggling to see why this would be a bad idea. The interest rate would not change. Obviously our monthly mortgage payment would rise, but other than that I don't see a downside.

Bitcoin,Coinmama Experience,"Poor rates aside, I had a pretty bad experience with Coinmama that I thought I'd share.

I tried to purchase about $USD 5,000 on their platform using a bank transfer. I had previously purchased a few amounts of $500 - 3000 using this method and it went through okay. When I transferred the $USD 5,000, it took a long time for the transaction to credit my account. Usually, it was 1 -3 business days. This time it had been over a week. I was quite disappointed as the BTC price had shot up at that time and they only lock in the rate when they see the funds in their account.

Eventually, customer support finally reverted back to me saying there had been an error and they had **not noticed** the funds in their account. They said it was a bank error that they had not been notified. They said they couldn't give me the previous rate of when the funds arrived and had to credit my account with fewer BTC due to the new rate now that they noticed the funds. I was pretty miffed but agreed as I needed quite an amount of BTC and would have to buy more down the line anyway.

A few more days passed and they still hadn't credited my wallet. They again contacted me saying there was some mysterious error and they had to return the money. I reluctantly agreed. I needed to once again give them my bank account information for them to wire my money back less of transfer fees.

They offered me a coupon (which barely covered my transfer fees, let alone lost value in the delay of my purchase) for my troubles to be used with my next transaction on their platform. I tried to redeem it this time using the credit card method which I presumed would be faster, I was only redeeming the coupon amount so I didn't think the effect of the fees was too bad. That request is still in processing.

The silver lining is that it pushed me to find someone locally who I was able to buy much more BTC at a less egregious rate. These initial transactions were just a test of the platform on whether it would be okay for me to purchase a larger amount in which case I would have been incredibly burned by their poor rates.

Its the first platform I've ever tried to purchase crypto on and I'd say overall it was a very disappointing experience. I wouldn't have purchased had I not had the need for large amounts of crypto for a few poker tournaments going on this summer online since COVID has moved the bulk of the WSOP online.

I don't know if this is the standard service for fiat gateway platforms but it was pretty bad and probably a bit of a blight on adoption and the overall price rising. 

Looking back now I should have probably done more due diligence on the platform as it does seem that there are plenty of poor reviews on the /r/coinmama. So just putting this out there for further visibility and as another data point on the poor service.

For what it's worth, it did seem like the customer service rep was just the messenger. It's hard to know where the actual error was on the bank side / their side. But they did say the funds were actually in their account shortly after I transferred and they simply didn't notice. The fact that I would end up paying a much higher rate because of their failure to notice I had already transferred the money seemed very unfair.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Next steps and planning for the future with housing market,"With the housing market and mortgage rates, we have recently started looking into selling our current house and purchasing a bigger more future proof house. There are features that are missing on our house that we would like to have, but we aren't dying to have them.  


A little about where we are now. We are a 30/27 yr old couple that live in a house I purchased when I was 21. It was during a recession and for some reason they trusted me. The house was 110,000 at 4.5% interest and I have not refinanced since purchasing. I still owe 90,000 on it, but while looking at options and possibly purchasing a bigger house it only led to more questions. I do not have any other debts except for the g/f's car, which is next on our list to tackle. I max my roth IRA yearly and do company matching for 401k. 
  
**Option 1**  
The house is currently worth over $200,000 with the upgrades we have done and how much the neighborhood has grown. This has led us to being tempted to sell it and use the equity to purchase a bigger house in a better neighborhood. The new house would be in the 315,000 (3% interest) and we would have at least a 25% down payment. In addition to upgrading, we would be dodging a few upgrades we know that are coming. New roof, sewer line replacement, new fence, and air conditioner. Although, we don't know what we would be buying into 100% either and what repairs would be needed there. The fear is also losing this current sellers market where our house is valued so high.

**Option 2**  
I currently pay about 18% of my take home salary to the mortgage. We could refinance the house to a 12 year loan at ~3% interest which would take the monthly payments to roughly 12% of my monthly income. We could then save extremely hard and pay for the upgrades as they are needed and look to purchase a bigger house when the market is more friendly to buyers. We'd sell the house after saving for at least a year to break even on the refinance cost.  

**Option 3**  
 We've also toyed around with our current house turning into a rental property where the income would be about 500-700 over the mortgage once we refinanced. This would mean staying here until we find the right house and have the full down payment without using our current equity. There is no telling what interest rates would be like that, but the extra income from the rental property would be a nice boost to income.   

  
I know I am missing other considerations and if there is anything I can help to add some clarity, let me know",finance

personalfinance,Advice for a student trying to take out a private loan?,"Hi there, I'm currently about to start my senior year of college and my family has recently been hit with some financial struggles. I take out loans for school but the ones I have so far have all been federal. My parents take advantage of the PLUS loans normally, but this year they were denied due to some things appearing their credit scores from 5 to 6 years ago that weren't there the past three times they applied. I took summer courses and need to pay the balance on that, but my federal aid doesn't extend to summer months. The refund we normally receive from the PLUS loan would've normally been sufficient to pay off the summer balance, but we aren't sure if the denial on the loan will be appealed as of right now. Anyways, I've tried applying for some private loans without a cosigner and I don't have a good enough credit history to get approved without a cosigner. The issue is that my parents are struggling financially right now so they think either of them cosigning won't do any good. I'm about to be a full time student again as well as working a part time job on the side. What other options do I have? The credit score I have itself isn't bad but I have a large amount to pay back on one of my credit cards (none of these payments have been late either). My parents have never been transparent about finances with me until now and I know I'm old enough to hold myself accountable but I never knew the severity of the situation until now. I would really appreciate any realistic advice and if I need to provide any other information I can.",finance

personalfinance,I'm trying to pick the best option for the refinance of my home loan.,"My loan balance is currently 150,500 ant 3.75 interest rate on a 30 year loan. I pay about 977 for principal and interest.   I am looking to shorten my term to a 15 year loan with a lower interest rate and try to keep my payments the same or at least close to what I am paying now. I have searched around and found a credit union with the best rate but there are three options I can chose from. my three options are:

option 1

15 year loan at 2.625% and I'm going to roll the closing cost of 4500 into the loan amount for a total loan amount of 155,500.  My total payment will be 1,043 per month.

option 2

15 year loan at 3.0% interest rate with no closing cost.  the total loan amount will be 150,500. my total payment will be 1,039 per month.

option 3

15 year loan at 2.625% interest rate and pay 4500 out of pocket to make the loan amount 150,500. My total payment will be 1,012 per month.

I just want to know which will be the best option in the long run.",finance

personalfinance,Student Loan Settlement Offer -- What do I need to consider/do?,"Hello everyone.  History:

I made very stupid choices with little guidance as a young adult.  I currently have almost 100k worth of signature student loans originally through Sallie Mae, now Navient (nearly half of which is interest).  These are four separate private loans.  The interest rate is currently 0% for all loans and the loan status for all four is listed as ""repayment"" on the Navient website.  I have not made a payment ever.  The loans are over ten years old.  The loans have been in collections for many years.  Currently they do not show on my credit report, though my credit is still pretty dismal from years of nonpayment on these loans.

Any other debt I have is in good standing.  I am now at a point in my life where I want to fix my credit and have been overwhelmed trying to figure out where to start with these loans.  I recently received a settlement offer from a debt collection agency for an amount that I may be able to afford with help (approximately 15% of my total outstanding balance with Navient).

I know that the amount of the loan forgiven will be reported to the IRS; however, I am wondering if my understanding of insolvency is correct: that I will not have to pay taxes on the amount of the loan forgiven past my current assets at the time of forgiveness.  Is this understanding correct?  And will the cost of the settlement count as part of my assets?

I have verified with my Navient account that the settlement offer letter lists the correct amount of debt (both principal and interest), collection charges, and last four digits of my Navient account number. However, the letter lists four account numbers (one for each loan) that do not match my Navient account numbers.

Lastly, what else do I need to consider/do?  And should I meet with a debt attorney or a financial advisor?  I would appreciate any insight into this situation.  I am aware that the settlement will likely hurt my credit, but at this point I need to start rebuilding anyway--will settling make this impossible?",finance

My partner and I are currently saving $75k over the next four years to travel in 2024. All of our other finances are sound (emergency fund, fully-funded retirement plans, etc.) so please no lectures on why we're choosing to do this.

Given the current financial situation, I am torn about how to invest the money over a 4-year time horizon. I ideally want to keep up with inflation but that just may not be possible without more risk than we're willing to incur.

Our savings account: 1.0% APY

3- and 4-year CDs: \~1.2-1.5% APY

Bonds: ?? I don't understand the bond market as well as I would like but with interest rates being so low, bonds seem like a poor choice at the moment. Is that correct?

personalfinance,How to improve credit score and suspected credit score manipulation.,"I'm here because I recently applied for a vehicle loan that had a very attractive interest rate based on individuals in the highest credit score bracket. To my surprise, I was told I only qualify for an interest rate that was 3 times higher than that advertised. I logged into my experian account thinking that something must have been wrong since my credit score has been over 800 (like 805-810) for years only to find that there was around a 50 point drop in my score for no apparent reason. I've never missed a payment, and I've successfully paid off two vehicle loans and a career starter loan out of college but did see that after the redesign, the website was suggesting that I only had 3 of the 5 recommended open credit cards which reflected negatively on my credit. Further, I noticed that they are offering a ""credit boost"" service that artificially inflates your credit score if you pay for it. My credit has been fluctuating back and forth between 750-760 every month for the last 7 months or so and I can't see any reason for the massive drop. Also, I routinely request credit increases (about once a year) to improve my credit-debt ratio. 

My question is how can I improve my credit score back into the ""excellent"" category without getting additional unnecessary credit cards or loans? Will this issue eventually fix itself or will I be stuck in ""very good"" credit score purgatory?

I use my credit cards for all my routine expenses and just pay them off every month.",finance

personalfinance,Is this a big mistake? Used Honda Accord EX-L 6MT,"TL;DR: would it be wise to get a $10k-$15k loan for an Accord EX-L 6MT (in the near future)? Currently 21, $1300/month income, 725 FICO, $10k in savings. 

Hello everyone,

So I've been thinking about buying my own car for the first time, and I'm really lusting over the Honda Accord Coupe. More specifically, the EX and EX-L trims (model years 2008-2017) with the V6 engine and 6 speed manual transmission. They tend to go for around $10-20k for decent examples.

This post is already pretty specific about the car, so I'll try not to geek out too much lol. But I think it's relevant to know that this car in the configuration I just described is highly regarded by enthusiasts for the fact that it's fast, safe, fun, reliable, and comfortable for a sports coupe. It's also the last of its kind, since you can't really find a more affordable midsize sports coupe.

With that being said, while all Accords have depreciated at the normal rate, I would expect the EX-L manual coupes to stop depreciating soon (and possibly even climb up a tad) since they're starting to get sought after by enthusiasts. Bear with me, this is just my assumption lol.

I'm 21 years old with a $1300/month income and about $10k in savings. My credit score is 725, I have absolutely no debt in my name whatsoever. My only expenses are gas and a few misc. items, I currently drive a very economical Ford Focus lol. *Theoretically*, I could get a $15k (say I put $5k down on the car), 4 year car loan with a 4.25% interest rate and be able to afford the car with little trouble. 

However, I don't think I should do it until I graduate college. I'm getting a bachelor's in mechanical engineering, and I'm taking a break from school at the moment since it's probably too risky for me to go back atm. Hopefully I can return next spring, and I don't think I would be able to handle a car payment while having a job and a full time class load at the same time. After college I expect to make $60-70k/yr. By then it would be easier for me to handle a car payment.

Is this a stupid idea? Let me know. Thanks for reading",finance
Bitcoin,Base Bitcoin and Broad Bitcoin,"I've been hodling since the ATH in 2017 and I'm bullish Bitcoin, so please don't dismiss my thoughts as nocoiner FUD.

In the fiat system there is base money (M0 -bank reserves) and broad money (M1 - what we see in our checking accounts). When the money printer goes brrr, the Fed is actually crediting banks' federal reserve accounts with M0 bank reserves in exchange for securities. Jeff Snider says this M0 (he calls them laundry tokens) mostly just sits there and the Fed is actually desperate to create some of the M1 inflation we fear. Banks don't and can't lend out these M0 reserves, when you take out a mortgage they don't give you a duffel bag of cash and they don't credit your federal reserve account because you don't have one. Banks create M1 out of thin air when they extend loans, that is the money printer that matters and right now that press is not running. (This is fiscal policy, monetary policy like the stimulus checks actually does result in M1.)

Anyway, Bitcoin is unique in that it is all M0. Holding your private keys would be the equivalent of having a federal reserve account. But as Bitcoin increases in popularity, there is going to be a significant portion of users who are unwilling or (effectively) unable to hold their own private keys. Not even on a nice wallet app, they'll want something like how you can buy Bitcoin on the cash app. They'll want the sound money features of Bitcoin but they'll want someone to be responsible for custody. It's possible that eventually cash app, venmo, zelle and whatever else will allow you to send ""Bitcoin"" to other people on and across these platforms. These transfers won't occur on the main chain, it would be like a centralized, trust-reliant 2nd layer. And these apps will hold real Bitcoin, but just like banks, they'll catch on that they only need to hold onto about 5-10% of their bitcoin liabilities to be liquid. They would transfer more ""Bitcoin"" then they actually held and this ""Bitcoin"" would be the M1 and it would extend beyond the 21M cap. There could be 21,000,000 M0 Bitcoin and another (gulp) 200,000,000 or so M1 Bitcoin.

Before the Fed, banks issued their own banknotes and their worth varied based on the perception of how many reserves each bank held. So I think if such a Bitcoin M1 emerged, it's worth would have to depend on how much actual Bitcoin these apps held. 

(Note, I'm not talking about 2nd layer solutions like the lightning network, that is still M0 Bitcoin programmed to have 100% reserve requirements.)

Does anyone else have thoughts on a Bitcoin M1 emerging?",cryptocurrency
solar,Help With Solar and NJ TRECs,"Hi All,

I am trying to make the leap to solar and could use some help. I am in NJ and I've gotten a few quotes but Tesla is by far the cheaper but I fall between their system sizes. They offer 4.08 (8200 before Federal Credit) and 8.16 kW ($16,400 before Federal Credit) systems and other companies have told me between a 4.2 and 5.6kw system is what I need to offset my usage. 

I am trying to figure out what makes the most sense in terms of sizing of systems for me. I feel like I might be just beyond the 4.08 sizing and end up not generating enough energy but don't want to produce a ton of excess energy if there's no tangible benefit especially at double the initial cost.

That's where my question about TRECs comes in. I understand the reasoning behind them what I don't get is the practical application of them. As a residential user am I guaranteed a certain number annually based on the size of my system at the established priced of $91.20? And do I have to actually sell these or what is the process to actually capitalize on them? Finally How can I predict how many TRECs I would receive to have a more accurate payback estimation for the system. 

Then there is the option where Tesla offers to buy your TRECs up front ($2938 for 4.08 and $5875 for 8.16 system) which I know isn't a great deal but curious how bad of a deal it is based on the explanation of TRECs.

Any insights are really helpful. I talked to Tesla today trying to see if I can get a system in between the 4.08 and 8.16 system but have yet to hear back on that. Anyone have luck with this? I was told they are more flexible with systems over 15kW but because mine would be small it has to be cookie cutter sizing.

Usage: My bill averages $85/month, my annual usage around 5100 kWh.",energy

personalfinance,"Condo refinance conundrum, Miami-Dade, FL","Asking for my mom, this is her primary residence. She does not need any fees rolled in to the loan. Originally a loan for about 70k in 2008 at 6.125% apr, and today it's at about 44k. She pays $360/month and that's important to her. Can she keep her overall mortgage payment below $400/month and also save money by refinance at current interest rates?


First road bump was that the association doesn't have a maintenance reserve, which disqualifies various institutions.

Second road bump, at the second institution, was that she doesn't have condo insurance. I guess that requirement came in after she got the original loan. The first quote she got for HO6 was 950 to over 2k a year. (depending on inclusion of hurricane coverage. the lending institution representative would not specify minimum coverage needed other than saying the agent would know what's needed) This immediately increases the overall cost of the refinance, which has me at a stand still until I can figure out how best for her to proceed.

I just made a post in r/insurance to get some guidance on the condo insurance situation, but I hope someone around here may have overall thoughts on how she might move forward. She feels she should just keep working on her current mortgage because it doesn't *seem* like refinancing will help her.

personalfinance,"Am I in a position to buy this house, or is waiting my better option","I have begun to browse houses just to kind of research the market in my area, and saw a house that really stuck out to me. My actual target date that I had for myself savings wise for a house was actually a year out, but I decided to go ahead and go through the pre-approval process anyway just to see what my range was. Mortgage rates seemed low so I applied. After talking with the loan consultant, he made a pretty convincing case for putting 3% down on a house, buying the points on the loan (3.25% rate down to 2.5% rate for slightly under 5k), and pointed out PMI with my current credit is extremely low ($43).

When he explained it to me in this way, it made saving for a 250k house seem semi-reasonable (5k closing/7.5k down/5k to buy the points). I haven't seen many houses online that I've really liked and I'm unsure if I should move forward and contact a real estate agent to view the only house I have seen that I like. Should I ignore this urge and continue to save up for a larger down payment? I estimate that if my offer was accepted I would be looking at a mortgage payment of 1.5k\~1.6k/mo, which is about the price of renting a nice apartment in the area. Part of me feels it's better to continue to save (living with parents rent free), however the other part of me feels anxious like mortgage rates may never be this good again. Am I crazy for even considering a 3% down conventional loan, buying the points with my current savings for a 30 year-fixed 2.5% interest rate?

The amount I owe is $9577.12 and the interest rate is 4.5% as today. Let's say if I refinance my car to a lower interest rate, in the long run I won't pay as much interest and the monthly payment will be lower.

2. Pay extra amount on top of the monthly payment towards the principle?

Save student loans or save up cash over 2 years.

I do have a day job and we we're offered RSU.  I do not plan to stay past 2023.

I make 60k now

I have 16-17k Emergency funds.

1 federal loan at 34k at 6.8%

1 federal loan at 20k at 3.8%

second lender:

1 federal loan 7k at 6.8%

1 private loan at 22k

&amp;#x200B;

Ran some calculations.

This is how much money I would expect to have if I just saved and paid the minimum on student loans.

year 1: 18k (estimated)

year 2: 36k (estimated)

&amp;#x200B;

This is how much I would expect to save, if I moved some of the money towards student loans and tried to save the rest.

year 1: 12k (estimated)

year 2: 24k (estimated)

&amp;#x200B;

Some other mitigating factors are RSU's and potential pay increases.  I don't think I'm going to see further pay raises or RSU's.  Even then I think I would still feel like I should prepare for an exit.  Also forgot about tax returns have to decide to move those towards debt or invest those into IRA.

This was one month after I finally managed to pay off all the debt! (old car broke down)We can afford the car and make the monthly payments. Minimum payment is 265,-I am paying 400 each month to pay it off quicker. The projected date is JUL 2023. (with extra payments)The remaining amount on the loan is: 13,000.-

I don't like having a loan for that long so I am considering using some of the money I have saved to pay it of. **This money is separate from our emergency fund**. We have saved up nearly 6 months worth of expenses. Using that would not be an option for me.

The money I am considering using was for a down-payment for a house. My wife told me she would rather fix up the old house we live in since it's mortgage free than buy a new house. I agreed.We have saved up 8,000.- and my goal was 10.000,-

Now I am wondering if I should pay down the car until it hits 10.000,- and then use the money we saved for the house and just pay off the car.

On the plus side this would mean:- No more debt.- Car payed off.- It would take 7 months to get our savings back for the house.(400,- per month in car payments and together with the 1000,- per month for the house.10.000,- divided 1400,- = 7.14 months).

On the negative side:It would take 7 months to get part of our savings back. Right now with the Corona virus and job insecurity I am not sure if that's smart.We would have to wait fixing up the house.

TLDR:With the current Corona virus job insecurities I don't like having a 13,000.- liability.. But paying it off now would mean I don't have access to 10.000 for 7 months..

I have a good salary and my husband does too.  We make enough to cover our expenses, save a little, and pay down some debt.  We are fortunate and are counting our blessings.

Here's what happened, is there anything I can do (I guess, specifically about the late payments hitting the report?)

* My oldest credit card was cancelled.  I haven't used the thing in 10 years or so and the interest rate was something outrageous, but the cancellation of the oldest account and reduction of my overall credit limit did not help.
   * As soon as I found this out, I called the company, but they said they could not reopen the old account, just a new one.  I declined this option because it wouldn't help my score and I didn't actually need the credit.
   * unfortunately, they sent the renewal notice to an old address, so I was blindsided.  I'm just happy this didn't happen before we bought our house.
* My next oldest card cut my limit, which increased my utilization.
   * I asked for the limit to be restored, but I was told that, due to the economic circumstances, the company was reducing credit limits where it thought appropriate.  This hurt my score, I think, because my utilization went up.
      * we are actively paying this debt off, but seeing very little movement credit score wise.  (of course, not having this debt is a positive, in and of itself)
* My husband got sick almost immediately after closing on the house.  In my struggle to keep my family healthy and afloat, I let my student loan payments lapse.  I put them into a short forbearance, but the SL company hit my report with 8 missed payments (I guess one each for each loan serviced) for 90-days late.
   * This was a mistake and I wish I had handled it differently.  
   * I called and wrote to the company explaining the circumstances and asking for grace, but was flatly rejected.  
   * I think the forbearance was requested before the credit reporting was done, but the credit reporting companies have not removed the remarks (even after I sent them the forbearance letter)
   * Save for this one missed student loan payment, I have all on-time payments.  I've never missed a mortgage or installment loan payment. 

I have played around with the credit score simulators and they predict that, even if I pay off all my outstanding installment/credit debt, my score would not break 700.  That was shocking.  Is there anything that I can do to get my credit score back into shape, or do I have to wait a while for these late payments to fall off?  The refi would save us a bunch of money every month (never planning on moving, bought the house as a forever home, the refi costs would be worth it given our plans).

personalfinance,Build-your-own total U.S. stock market fund?

personalfinance,Federal Student Loans question,"What better place to as this question than this sub!

How do I make a decision on whether to take on the federal student loan I was offered (both subsidized and unsubsidized) ?

I don't have income that can extend to tuition and I am barely covering my living expense atm. I have like a year and half plus change to graduate and never took out student loans before. 

I am way beyond regular college age and have about 150k in mortgage loans already. 

The degree would be first BS (STEM) and as you can see I dragged it out over so many years having even started college in my 30s. 

Thoughts running in my mind: I should take on loans and just sacrifice to just finish the damn thing as the $ earning advantage of the degree is is fleeting with time, as I would have to start at the bottom in the field. On the flip side, I am tired of feeling insecure job security wise because of lack of the paper. 

I also wonder how much the value of a college degree has changed over the years, especially now with the pandemic.

Please offer any thoughts or advice in how to approach this decision and how to organize this scenario. 

Thank you all in advance!",finance
personalfinance,Should I refinance even though I'm making extra principal payments?,"I had dinner with my uncle and parents last night and he mentioned refinancing his home from 4.6% to 2.65% with $7k of closing costs.  He said he could have gotten it down to 2.25% with $10k of closing costs but opted for the $7k/2.65%.

My current loan:

* Originated 9/5/17
* Amount: $204,000
* Rate: 3.875%
* P&amp;I: $959.28
* Escrow: $257.86
* Extra Principal: $282.86 (to make $1500 even payment) 
   * Began 3/5/19
* Currently owe: $187,xxx

I know cutting the interest rate over a full point would still be a huge savings, and from various calculators I've used, the extra principal payments will knock about $50k of interest and 10 years off my 30 year loan.

My question is, even if I'm paying it down quicker (and would still plan on making the $1500 payment, meaning if I drop my P&amp;I $150/mo with the reduced refi'd rate I'd bump my extra principal payment up $150 too) would it still make sense refinancing if I can get a mid 2% rate?  I'm not sure if there is a calculator that does both refinance rate change and extra payments.

I'm just not sure if it's doubly good both refinancing to drop 1+% AND making higher extra principal payments, or if by making the extra principal payments and thus reducing the interest I'd be paying anyways, if that would make the refi less beneficial.  So if my break-even point was say 30-50 months, now with the reduced interest paid and in turn the lower interest saved my BEP would be like 40-60 or 50-70 months...

Thanks in advance.  I'm normally pretty good at this stuff but I think with so many variables and not being in the field, I'm confusing myself.",finance

Forex,Moving from EST to Asia... anyone done it?,"Was wondering how many other traders are annoyed AF as I am when it comes to trading FX on the EST timezone.  Primarily due to missing most the Asian, entirety of the London, and possibly even some of the US session.  I feel even worse for people on PST!  By the time my brain has waken up, the morning US is pretty much over unless there's some afternoon FOMC activity which I avoid anyway.  Kudos to people who can wake up at 7-8AM and be mentally ready to go!

Seems living in EST+11 or 12 hours is the perfect timezone to trade from.  Assuming you wake up around 8AM Asia time, you could even completely skip the Asian altogether and just enjoy your day before bracing for the London + US which IMO are the best times to trade.

You also gain the benefit of WAY lower cost of living, likely better culture, and for most people in the US, much better weather.

I've been considering places like Thailand (Koh Samui, Phuket, Bangkok) or even Philippines.

personalfinance,Advice: How to maximize my retirement funds?,"Hi! A few months ago, I (29m) started a new job with a local government agency. Since I’ll be getting into my 30s, I’d like to manage my retirement much better, while continuing to save for a home with my fiancé. This new job offers a 457b retirement fund (4% matching) and a pension plan (9.11% removed from each check). I also have a 401k from my previous job that I plan to rollover to a traditional IRA. 

Now, a breakdown of my income: 

$4800 per month after 6% contribution to 457b (total of 10% going in), 9.11% for pension, 2.81% for life insurance, and federal/state taxes.

MY monthly expenses are $1383 total for rent, groceries, gas, car insurance, electric/phone bill, and two streaming services. Please note, I live with my fiancé, so we split rent and bills. I also set aside $800 per month ($200 per week) to spend on fun things or dinners (with the pandemic, I haven’t been going over this, and put it into my savings).

This leaves me with ~$2400 of free income. Since I started working after grad school (5 years ago), I’ve taken my free income and divided it into a long term (32% of free income for a house down payment) and short term (10% of free income for vacations) saving pot. I now have $40k in my long term saving pot and $4k in my short term saving pot. My goal has been to hit $50k...my fiancé and I live in an expensive area where homes average at $500k, so I wanted to have a 10% down payment ($25k between both of us) plus extra cushion for other costs that come with a home (closing costs, repairs, etc). Through some preliminary research, I’ve calculated that a home would run us about $3000 a month (mortage, taxes, assuming HOA, no PMI since my fiancé is a teacher and qualifies for a special program), so $1500 for myself. Based on the rent I pay now, I would pay an additional $800 with a home, so I would have $1600 left of free income. 

So how do I plan better for the future? How much of this $1600 should I use to maximize my 457b ($19k max per year = 24% of my annual salary)? Should I just contribute the 6% like I’m already doing? Let the traditional IRA sit with no contributions? Do I make too little ($80k) now to think I can continue to save for other long term expenses with a home? Should I give up on saving for vacations as well? Should I continue to live in an apartment and continue adding to my long term pot? 

Thank you and sorry for the long post :)",finance

personalfinance,Is 401k loan really that bad?,"Edit below...

I know everyone preaches that 401k loans are bad… mainly because of lost potential growth. My thoughts are that if a 401k is balanced based on risk and a portion is invested in a bond or fixed income fund then treating the loan like a bond would essentially be the same thing.  You would be paying yourself the 3-5% interest on the loan amount. Is there a flaw in this thinking?

Example:

401k balance of 250k (80%stock/20% fixed income/bonds)

Take loan of 50k leaving balance of 200k in 100% stock.

At the end of loan term, you would have 50k+your interest rate in your account.

Thoughts?

economy,Discussion: Should the GDP Per Capita be Close to the Average Worker's Salary?,"So let me put some numbers down.

GDP Per Capita in the USA in 2019: $65,281 ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28PPP%29_per_capita))

Workforce participation in the USA in 2019:  63% ([source](https://www.bls.gov/charts/employment-situation/civilian-labor-force-participation-rate.htm))

Mean wage May 2019: $53,490 ([source](https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm#00-0000)) (corresponds to around $22/hr for full-time employment)

So if you take these numbers, and divide the per capita GDP by the workers, you should get the average production value of every employee. So, lets do that.

$65,281/0.63=$103,620

With that, it seems that the average US worker produces around $51 dollars in value per hour of work, assuming all workforce participants work 2000 hours a year, on average. They are being paid about $22/hr. The remaining $29/hr is going to investors or to non-final goods.

#August 2020 Updates

President Trump recently signed several executive orders and memorandum related to the Coronavirus pandemic. **There are still many unknowns** about the specific details of these actions, but here is a summary of what we think we know so far:

## Payroll Taxes Deferred (Updated September 2nd)

### Summary

TL;DR - Starting September 1st, some people might not have to pay Social Security taxes. It is possible or even likely that you will have to pay taxes later. It is complicated. If you get the benefit of this deferral, please set the money aside for now.

* Payroll taxes consist of two related taxes: Social Security (6.2% of wages) and Medicare (1.45% of wages). Both employees and employers pay these taxes (i.e., for every $1 of social security taxes you pay, your employer also pays $1). Only the Social Security portion of payroll taxes may be deferred right now, not Medicare. 

* The Secretary of the Treasury has been [directed](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/memorandum-deferring-payroll-tax-obligations-light-ongoing-covid-19-disaster/) to **defer** the collection of Social Security taxes on those making a gross income of less than $104,000 / year ($4,000 or less per bi-weekly paycheck) starting September 1.

* Implementing seems to be optional by employers and many employers have decided to not implement this.

* While there is some possibility that this **deferral** of payroll taxes may become **forgiveness**, this has not yet occurred and the general consensus is that forgiveness would require Congress to pass new legislation which does not seem likely right now.

* The IRS has issued [Notice 2020-65](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-20-65.pdf) indicating that taxes deferred must be withheld and paid between January 1, 2021 and April 30, 2021, or interest and penalties will start accruing on May 1, 2021.

* Finally, it is possible that we will see this action challenged through the court system and it is possible that injunctions or other court actions may impact this order.

### FAQ

* **Q** How much should I save from my check so that I can pay back the money if/when the deferral expires?

* **A** You should save approximately 6.2% of your **gross** income. Look at your paycheck; it should tell you what your gross income is (before taxes, etc...). If you really can't figure out your gross income for some reason, try setting aside 10-15% of your take home pay. We had to make a lot of simplifying assumptions to get to this number, and basing it on your gross income is absolutely more accurate, but 10-15% of take home should be reasonably close for many people.

* **Q** Can I opt out of this and continue to pay social security taxes as normal?

* **A** No. There is no provision for individuals to opt in or out of this action. You may want to ask your employer about whether they plan to implement this.

* **Q** I make close to the $104,000 limit. Can I increase 401(k) contributions, etc. to make myself qualify?

* **A** Yes. The limit is based on gross taxable income. 

* **Q** So if I make $104,001 am I out of luck?

* **A** As currently written, yes. The literal text does not include a ""phase out"" range. We would certainly suggest waiting for more clarification before voluntarily taking a pay cut.

* **Q** I was laid off for part of the year. My bi-weekly paycheck is over $4,000 but I will make under $104,000 for the full year. Do I qualify?

* **A** No. If you have over $4,000 gross income per bi-weekly paycheck, you are not eligible for the tax deferral, regardless of what your other bi-weekly paycheck amounts are. Eligibility is determined on a bi-weekly pay period basis.

* **Q** I'm not paid bi-weekly. What is the equivalent limit for me?

* **A** For someone paid bi-monthly (twice a month, 24 checks a year), the equivalent limit is $4,333.33 / check. For someone paid weekly, the equivalent limit is $2,000 / check. For someone paid monthly, the equivalent limit is $8,666.67.

* **Q** When will I have to pay the deferred taxes back?

* **A** Your employer must withhold the deferred amount between January 1, 2021 and April 31, 2021. 

* **Q** I'm self-employed/own a small business. Are both halves of payroll taxes deferred or only the employee half?

* **A** It appears that only the employee half may be deferred. If you are self-employed and pay your payroll taxes on your individual income tax return, this deferral doesn't impact you although possible forgiveness might.

* **Q** I work multiple jobs. Collectively, I would be above the $4,000/bi-weekly cap but on an individual job basis I am below it. Do I qualify?

* **A** Probably so. As written, the memorandum appears to be based on your paycheck per employer.

## Student Loan Interest Waiver

### Summary

TL;DR - federal student loan payments are now suspended until December 31.

The previously announced suspension on student loan payments has been [extended](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/memorandum-continued-student-loan-payment-relief-covid-19-pandemic/) from September 30th until December 31. Of the four actions announced, this appears to be the most straightforward. Basically, the benefits for student loans currently in place now end December 31, not September 30.

### FAQ

* **Q** Does this apply to private loans?

* **A** No, this only applies to public loans. However, private student loan companies may have their own relief programs. If you need or want relief, contact them and ask them about what they offer.""

## Relief for Homeowners and Renters

### Summary

Tl;DR - This one doesn't include specific policies so not much is known about where this will head until federal agencies respond.

The [Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-fighting-spread-covid-19-providing-assistance-renters-homeowners/) requires certain federal agencies to take steps to limit foreclosures or evictions. It does not include a list of specific actions or policies.

### FAQ

* **Q** So what does this mean? Can I be kicked out of my house/evicted from my apartment if I don't pay my mortgage/rent?

* **A** We don't know yet. If you are facing financial hardship, you should contact your landlord or mortgage servicer to discuss your options. Unfortunately there are no details available for us to analyze.

## Unemployment Benefit Extension (Updated September 2nd)

### Summary

TL;DR - Some people can get an extra $300/week from unemployment. But expect this to take time. The details on this one are beyond complicated.

To start, here is a [link](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/memorandum-authorizing-needs-assistance-program-major-disaster-declarations-related-coronavirus-disease-2019/) to the text of the executive order. It establishes a $400/week benefit ($300/week from the federal government with $100/week match from the states, which can include existing payment) for unemployed individuals. Unlike the previous program, which had a fixed end date, this program is designed to run until its funding is exhausted or December 6, 2020, whichever occurs first. While this program could provide a maximum of $400/week in additional benefits, given that states can ""offset"" their $100/week with existing benefits, the practical answer for many people is that this will be an extra $300/week.

### FAQ

* **Q** When will I start receiving these payments?

* **A** We don't know yet, but we would anticipate that it will be at least several more weeks. This program is different from the previous program and requires a high level of coordination with states.

* **Q** What if my state doesn't contribute an extra $100/week for its share of the payment?

* **A** You should be fine as long as you get at least $100/week currently. States are encourage to contribute an extra $100/week; however, they are allowed to use existing benefits.

* **Q** So is the benefit amount $400/week or $300/week?

* **A** This will vary by state. The executive order basically encourages states to add an additional $100/week to the federal $300/week, but they don't have to do this. This is new, but anecdotal reports from states seem to indicate that this will be $300/week for most people.

* **Q** Do I automatically qualify if I received the $600/week additional payment?

* **A** No. You must get at least $100/week from unemployment compensation, and be unemployed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.",finance

business,question about investing in small business,"my motivation for investing is more personal than financial-- i am trying to help a small business where i work and that has been devastated by the covid crisis.  but i would like to avoid losing money as much as possible.

what is the best way to structure the agreement?  loan vs equity?  specific details of either?

one possibility i thought of is a loan with an interest rate that depends on the business's performance each quarter-- if the business is running in the red, the interest that quarter is 0%.   if breaking even, interest is (say) 5%, and if turning a profit &gt; $2k for the quarter, the interest is 10%.  something like that.  what are some problems with such an arrangement?  what are some other ideas?",finance

personalfinance,"Exploring housing market now thinking of buying first home, seems there is a battle between low interest rates and potential impending doom. Who wins?","Full context: I (30M) and my girlfriend (28F) are thinking of buying our first home together. We’re committed to each other long term, just don’t want to spend a fortune getting married. I make a solid salary and am comfortable in my position for the next few years and my gf is starting down a new career path so some uncertainty in her future. Together, we make 180k base salaries, have saved enough for 20% down, have low recurring debt (maybe $500/mo), live in Bay Area (so high current COL). Exploring houses in other, more affordable parts of CA and aiming for something 300-400k. 

We go back and forth on the market right now and whether that type of investment makes sense. There are two strong competing forces at play:
1) The traditional rent vs buy math looks good, assuming rent of $3000/mo, and the rates are super favorable (3% or less with excellent credit)
2) the questionable current and seemingly future economic situation in the US and the (strong?) potential of recession, which I expect drives the average home price down.

How do you know if it’s better to buy now or wait? Is it more likely that rates will rise or home prices will drop? Maybe both/neither?",finance
personalfinance,23 years old and not sure how to allocate my assets,"Hi there! To give some context, I am a 23 year old software engineer based in NYC. I have been saving a lot of my money and putting it into a high-yield savings account. However, with the interest rates for these saving accounts being dropped to such a low number because of the cutting of the fed rates, I'm not sure where if I should even leave my money in there anymore.

These are my assets right now:

* High-yield savings: $100k
* 401k: $10k
* Brokerage Account: $10k
* Roth IRA: $3k (I just created it recently)

The reason that the majority of my net worth is sitting in my savings account is because I was originally intending to make a large purchase in the next 2-3 years and put a down payment for a house as an investment (\~$800k home and 25% down payment so would be $200k).

I anticipate being able to save another $100k this coming year due to lower spendings from COVID.

The reason that I didn't max out my 401K last year and Roth IRA is because I put it all into my savings to help pay for down payment in the near future but I'm not sure if that's a good idea anymore. However, I'm also hesitant to enter the stock market right now because it doesn't feel like a good time..

Anyways, what is the recommended allocation for my money especially when I intend on making a home purchase in the next 2-3 years? Should I still just buy ETFs and put the majority of my money towards that?

Any advice is good advice!",finance
personalfinance,Lord Abbett Roth IRA transfer help,"Hi everyone,

Background: I am a long time lurker but a first time poster on this sub. Eight years ago I (30M) opened a Roth IRA account with a local Edward Jones branch. Due to mainly my own negligence and personal distractions, I completely stopped paying it any attention even though I was contributing about $500 a year to it. Now that my life is semi stable, I have started paying attention to all my invest/retirement accounts again. I found out that now my Edward Jones account is now under Lord Abbett which really means its being managed by a random bank I don't recognize. I think i received a lot of paperwork from them over the years which my parents proceeded to throw out assuming it was spam.

Main problem:  Currently, I still occasional get emails regarding trade confirmations from Lord Abbett. I decided to finally transfer my Roth IRA from them to maybe a more user friendly company like Sofi but this is where my problem comes in. I have tried calling Lord Abbett multiple times without being able to get hold of anybody. I also emailed client services without any response. I need to figure out how to transfer my account electronically let alone change my investment strategy. Does anybody have experience with Lord Abbett to help me?

Thank you for taking the time to read this far and responding if you do

Update:

So I wanted to provide  an update to everyone who helped me with this problem. After numerous phone calls, I found out that EJ closed my account with them without ever notifying me 4 years ago but for some reason my account with Lord Abbett was kept open and continued to take my money which explained why I could access my Lord Abbett account and not my EJ account. EJ had no idea why it was closed and could not help me. Unfortunately, I had to make the decision to just pull my money out of it since the Cares act allows the Federal 10% tax  to be waved currently. I will be reinvesting it in a new account from a better company. Thanks again for the help.",finance

Any excess income would be placed into savings at the end of the month as well. Is there any advice, anything I am doing that is glaringly wrong, or any other help that you could provide.

I got a significant tax return this year ($15K) after moving states to start a new job and need help deciding the smartest way to use my return within my current financial goals. 

My primary goal is to get myself out of credit card debt (\~$18K). I'm mapping out a plan to be debt free in 3 years, but I'd like to use a large chunk of my return to make a big payment on cards with the highest interest and utilization ratios. My other plan is to buy a car soon since I don't have one atm. I'm planning to buy within the next month or so while interest rates are low (at least my local Honda dealership has a deal right now, and I desperately need a car soon) and want to finance for no more than 3 years.

Main thing I'm trying to decide is, how much of my return should I use towards large credit card payments vs towards a downpayment on a car? I'm planning to put $2K into savings, so that leaves me $13K to divide among credit cards and a downpayment. I'm not sure if it's smarter to focus more on my debt and put less towards the car, but then  have larger car payments every month. Or if I should pay more on the car now &amp; budget larger monthly card payments, or split the return evenly across both. I also wonder if large credit card payments now will raise my credit score (it's 'good' right now) and help me get a better interest rate for a car loan? Truly at a loss for what to do. Appreciate any help.",finance
personalfinance,I'm 34 and I have 4 Mortgages. Feeling Overwhelmed.,"On a throwaway because I generally like to keep my finances private.

As the post suggests I'm 34 and I now have 4 houses each with their own mortgage and I'm feeling very overwhelmed.  We bought our first house in 2011 using a VA loan.  We lived in the house until I changed duty stations and since then we've had no issues finding renters.  In November 2018 my dad passed away very suddenly.  This left my mom in her house all alone 8 hours away from me.  My mom had cancer as well as some other health issues so we started looking for a house with a casita so my mom could move in with us while still retaining some of her independence.  In March 2020 we went all-in on a house with a Casita and moved my mom down.  Her prognosis at the time was very good.  Doctors were using years and decades to describe her life expectancy rather than weeks or months.  However, her condition worsened very quickly and in July 2020 my mom passed away from her cancer.  My parents owned two houses at the time of their deaths and with me as the only child I've now inherited those houses bringing the total to 4.

Every house, except the one we're living is, has tenants that are paying rent that roughly covers the mortgage and taxes.  All combined, the value of the homes are approximately $4 million and there is roughly $2.5 million in debt between the 4 mortgages.  On paper, this seems great.  I've got 1.5 million in equity and as long as I can keep the homes rented I feel like I'm in a great position to build long term wealth.

Where my fears come in is we literally just went all-in to purchase our new home.  We have barely $10,000 left in our savings.  That's not even enough to cover all 4 mortgages for one month.  If something bad happened at one of the houses it would pretty much wipe us out and put us in danger of losing everything.  Both my wife and I have very stable careers but we're still relatively young and inexperienced and the 2020 chaos definitely has us rattled.  I know my parents had some money scattered across several different accounts at several different banks but I have no idea when I will have access to that money or how much it is (my parents had a will so I'm going through their lawyer and I have no idea how long the process will take.)

The logical side of my brain is telling me to hold onto all 4 houses at all costs because that will allow us to build more wealth and will set us up to have a permanent source of income in 30 years once the mortgages are paid off (allowing us to retire early if we want.)  Because the homes have a decent amount of equity in them and interest rates are extremely low right now my plan is to try and refinance all four houses (transferring my VA benefits to my current home), pull out at least $100K in equity, eliminate as much of my student loan and credit card debt as possible, and keep at least $25K set aside in a savings account for emergencies.

However, the emotional side of my brain is freaking out.  I am definitely still going through the grieving process and I haven't been eating or sleeping very well so I have no idea if I'm thinking clearly.  The stress of having over $14,000 in mortgage payments every month is just terrifying.  I could understand dealing with this when I was older and more established but right now it feels like too much.  The emotional side of me just wants to cash out the 3 houses we are not living in, pay down the mortgage in the house we are living in, and invest the rest.  While this seems much easier in the short term, I don't know if its the right long term decision.  

I don't want fear to cause me to make a decision that I'm later going to regret.  My wife and I want to start a family soon so we want to make the best decision not only for us but our children.  I feel like an asshole even asking for help because I know how rough some people have it and I know we are extremely fortunate but I'm just terrified that I'm going to mess this up and ruin not only everything I've worked for but also everything my parents worked for.

I'm looking for help on which option I should pursue.  Are there any other possibilities I've missed?  Are there any pros or cons for each option that I'm not aware of?  What would you do if you were in my situation?  Has anyone else had a similar experience and how did you deal with it?",finance

personalfinance,Ally Bank vs. Varo,"So I've been using Chase as my primary bank for a while now, due to the fact that there is no monthly maintenance fee for students, and also the fact that its a physical bank so there's no problem depositing/withdrawing cash at any time of the day. But it pays almost no interest and when I get older its going to incur a monthly maintenance fee if I don't follow the requirements. I want to move to an online bank for the interest, but I don't want to lose the ability do bank with cash.

I'm having a tough time deciding between Ally and Varo. Ally is a more well known bank from what I have found and everyone that uses it recommends it highly. But Varo pays more interest and pays significantly more (1.80% more) if you follow their requirements. Both use the same Allpoint ATM's so that isn't a factor. I also noticed that Ally pays interest on their checking account while Varo does not which is a pretty big deal because I tend to keep a lot of money in my checking account compared to my savings account.

Some questions I have:

* Do both work with Robinhood?
* If I have cash that I want to deposit what are the easiest ways of doing that?
* If Varo is a worse experience do you think it would be worth it to use just for the higher interest rate?
* Ally's interest rate used to be significantly higher before the pandemic, after the interest rates are back to normal do you think that it would be higher than Varo?
* If you exceed $10,000 in your Varo savings account and you are in the higher tier of interest how does that work? Do you earn 2.80% interest on the first $10,000 and 1.21% on everything over that or no interest on anything over $10,000?

gaming,Poor little guy just wanted to play Mario Kart,"TL;DR at bottom

Hi all, I Just wanted to offload a dad gaming story: My 6yo son came home from school crying this afternoon because some bigger kids wouldn't let him play with them. I had a chat with him and then asked if he wanted to play some old school Mario Kart. I have Double Dash on PC via Dolphin but also own the original GameCube disc. It's just easier to run on the PC with wireless controllers etc. You don't want to give an excitable kid a wired controller!

Little guy gets all excited! He still doesn't get how steering the kart works so is just happy to throw the items as I pick them up (Nintendo really need to make another Double Dash). Thing is, I couldn't get both controllers to work... I'm troubleshooting for a couple of hours telling him every now and again ""I'm sorry mate, it's still broken, I'm trying to fix it"". The wife is getting annoyed that I haven't put him to bed but I just had in my head ""I made a promise, I gotta keep it"". Eventually I stopped, put him to bed, and said ""I'm really sorry mate, we can't play it tonight but I'll keep working on it and we'll play a quick game in the morning before you go to school"". He was a bit flat about that but went to bed without hassle.

I continue to troubleshoot and finally work out at 11pm that the USB wireless transmitter for one of the controllers is faulty. It took me so long to find out due to so much online information on issues about these controllers, plus it got confusing there for a while as both controllers were acting as one controller through the one working transmitter.

Rummaging through boxes in the garage, I find an old USB wired controller. Plugged it in as well as the  wireless one and did a test - All working again! So tomorrow he'll have the wireless controller and I'll have the wired one. Hopefully I can make his day better tomorrow. Worst case scenario I was either going to have to learn to play using the keyboard or rummage further into the garage to find the GameCube etc and be very careful with the wired controllers.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: My son had a bad day at school - Said we'd play Mario Kart but then couldn't due to technical difficulties - Got a solution after he went to bed - Hopefully will brighten his day tomorrow.

Cheers

personalfinance,Extra cash living with parents. How can I save more effectively?,"#tl;dr
Looking for general advice. I used to invest money in taxable accounts but now I'd like to be more tax-savvy. I have a proposal below (scroll all the way down) and would love to get a sanity check in case I've made any logical errors or omissions.

# My situation
## Me:

* 27M single
* Living with parents (Colorado) but usually based in California. Will probably move back to California when things calm down but that will be 6-12 months from now
* 2019 tax rate: 24% federal, 9.3% California state

## Income:

* Work in tech, currently making $117,000 annually (before taxes)
* Income increases about 5% annually with raises

## Assets:

* Taxable
  * $15,000 savings account emergency fund, covers about 6 months of expenses when I'm living on my own
  * $25,000 checking account
  * $325,000 in stocks/ETFs/mutual funds
      * 18% in VTI (US stocks)
      * 05% in BND (US bonds)
      * 05% in VXUS (international stocks)
      * 02% in BNDX (international bonds)
      * The other 70% are individual domestic stocks (Apple, Disney, AT&amp;T, etc.) that were gifted to me by family during my childhood and have grown significantly. I've moved some of the money into index funds (30% of this account) as an adult but most of the value has come from growth of those initial stocks over the last 25 years or so.
  * $5,000 of my employer's stock from stock grants (I usually sell these immediately because I feel that I'm over-invested in tech between my career and my investments)
* Tax-advantaged
  * $80,000 in Fidelity 401k, contributing maximum each year, employer matches 50% of the first 7% of my pay

      * 25% in international stock fund (0.04%)
      * 15% in US bond fund (0.02%)

## Debts:

* $525/month car payment (new car, paid 50% in cash and financed the rest at a local credit union at 2.49% interest for 60 months, mainly doing it to build credit and because I think I can at least break even/make a little money in the market)
* No student loans, credit card debt, etc.

## Expenses:

* ~~$2000 apartment, parking, utilities~~ --&gt; living with parents so I'm not paying this anymore
* $100 car insurance
* $300 food and entertainment

# My proposal
* **Start contributing to a Roth 401(k) instead of traditional 401(k)** while I still can. I am doing this because I am under the AGI limit for Roths and my tax bracket now is as low as it'll ever be. Also, if I want to retire early and access that money soon, a Roth 401(k) allows me to do that without penalty while a traditional 401(k) does not.
* **I won't convert my existing 401(k) into a Roth** because I'd have to pay taxes on it without necessarily providing more value (I can just use that money when I have zero income during retirement).
* **I'll open a Roth IRA** and contribute the max amount before the end of this year. Kicking myself for not doing this sooner...
* In the future, I'll be able to **continue contributions to the Roth 401(k)** since that has no income limits, and I'll be able to **continue contributions to the Roth IRA using a backdoor Roth IRA conversion** if my income exceeds the limit.
* **$20,000-$30,000 is more than enough for me to have in cash** so I should put the rest in index funds or to fund the IRAs mentioned above
* I should **wait longer to sell my stock grants** (at least 1 year) to avoid short-term gains taxes

# My questions

* I feel like the **majority of my assets should be in tax-advantaged accounts since I don't have any concrete plans to use them now**.
  * Would it make sense for me to start using the **mega backdoor Roth conversions now** (since I have very low expenses right now and I could put a bunch of cash into it and withdraw my contributions [but not the profits] if I wanted to buy a house or something)?
  *  Is it worth doing a **total Roth conversion of my 401(k)** since I could afford to pay the taxes on it right now?
* I anticipate that **my tax rate will increase over the next 5 years** as my career progresses. How should that affect my decision-making?
* I would like to shift more towards index fund investments as opposed to individual stocks in my taxable accounts, but am **afraid of selling what I have and incurring massive capital gains taxes**. Any suggestions for what I could do here (i.e. spread it out over several tax years)?

personalfinance,First-time investor in Fidelity mutual funds. Help!,"Hi all,

I lurk quite a bit on this sub and am always blown away at the helpful nuggets of wisdom that are passed along in here, so I'm hoping some of you can chime in on my situation.

I'm in my low 30's and am just now wanting to invest in mutual funds. By way of background, I have a normal checking account, a Marcus Goldman Sachs account (with an ever-decreasing interest rate, currently 0.80%), and a 401(k).  Since my Marcus money is not earning a lot, I'd like to take $15-$25K of it and invest in some Fidelity mutual funds.

However, I don't even know where to start. I don't have much of an appetite for risk (so an all-stock fund with high-risk stocks wouldn't be a good fit for me) but would like to somewhat conservatively grow my money. What are some good mutual funds to invest in right now, and how much money would you put in them if you were me? I was thinking of splitting up the $15-25K three ways into FXAIX, FZROX and perhaps one other, but since investing is by no means in my wheelhouse, I'd love to hear your thoughts. 

Again, this wouldn't be a retirement account like my 401(k), but rather, an extra savings account. Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,Should i Refi my house to a lower term or make extra payments on my existing mortgage?,"Hello,  


I bought my house in Dec of 2015, in May of 2018 I took out a home equity loan to put my wife through college. I'm now in a position where my income is 30% higher than when i first bought my home.  


These are the hard numbers  
Property Value $300,000 - newly built 2015  
Mortgage 171,000  - 25 years remain on the loan (30 year fixed) Interest rate 3.875%  
Current Payment without taxes and Insurance - $876.23 (Principal + Interest)  


This would be a Refi

Mortgage $181,000 - 15 year fixed Interest rate 2.1%

I have a few thoughts around this process.

1.  I'm in a position to pay off the home equity loan before November (I feel like fixed interest rates should stay low before November)  
2. I can make bi-monthly payments to my bank where they deduct half the payment every 2 weeks saving me on interest.  
3. I can spend roughly $10,000 in taxes and fees to lower my term in a Refi and lower my interest rate to 2.1% on a 15 year fixed. This will not raise my original payment because if the home equity loan is paid off I absorb that extra payment into the higher house payment.  


My big question is should I rather stay in the 30 year fixed and make extra payments on the existing loan or spend the $10,000 bringing my mortgage to $181,000 at 2.1% and lower my term 10 years on the existing loan. I'm not sure in which situation I would come out ahead.",finance

Before I talk to any kind of mortgage advisor I'd like to get a general idea on how to work. I've been looking on the internet but there is one bit I can't figure out, and that's how they get all their numbers..

As an example I looked at what Nationwide has to offer. I'm just playing around with numbers to see what the consequences are, but unfortunately they don't make this easy to see.  [This example](https://imgur.com/a/bEsm9lK) is an offer for a £150,000 mortgage amound with a property value of £200.000 over a duration of 25 years. It is not clear how much the cost is of the loan, they give a number of £38,984.40 paid after 5 years, but how much of that is me paying of the loan and how much is interest?

For the same offer they have a [""Representative example""](https://imgur.com/a/V5Ypvo0) and I'm trying to get the numbers back from my input and I get kind of close but not exactly. The only number they mention that I managed to calculate from the loan amount, interest rate and number of payments is the monthly payment for the duration of the fixed term. After the fixed term (such as the total amount) I can't get any numbers that a close enough. 

I just want to compare different mortgages and how much interest I pay.

I would  like advice and people's ideas on how to best use and take advantage of having approximately $8000 in ""free money"" that I am receiving from my workplace. The only stipulation is that I will need to be able to pull the money back out and repay it quickly if  I leave my job.

Details: My workplace gave me $3000 as a ""moving stipend"" and $5000 as a ""sign-on bonus"", but also made me sign a contract stating that I will need to repay the full amount if I leave my job in less than a year. I will have to repay a pro-rated amount if I leave my job in less than 2 years.

(There is no way for me to get out of these stipulations unless my position becomes eliminated by the company, which I don't foresee happening ever.)

What is the best way for me to take advantage of this amount of money being in my account, but still keep it liquid enough to pay back if I get sick of my position and leave before the 2 years are up? Of course I may decide to stay at my job for the full 2 years, and keep the money permanently, but I don't want to count on that.

Thanks for any advice.

I have my Citi credit card on auto-pay, set to pay off the full balance each month. Have for years. I get several notifications about it, and it's just on lock. I don't even think about it except for a comforting nod when I get the text messages about it. It's been totally reliable.

The only thing I can think of is that I accepted an offer some weeks ago for a lower interest rate -- seemed like a pretty random thing: a superlow interest rate on new purchases for no reason till something like next April. Being in my first month of that offer, most of the current balance would not have qualified for the low interest, and I would have incurred a significant finance charge.

Anyway, my spidey sense was right on -- it was one day before my statement closed and I was able to make another payment to clear out the balance and avoid carrying it to next month... But what the heck?

How do I file her separate state tax?,"Apologies if this has already been asked. I couldn’t find anything during my search. But I would really appreciate the help since I'm still very green in navigating taxes. 

As I mentioned, my wife and I got married in June 2019. Prior to that, she was living and working in DC, while I was in WA for work. Her 2018 state tax was filed in DC (obviously as single). She left DC permanently shortly before our marriage.

I reported both our incomes from before our marriage (her in DC and mine in WA) for the federal tax, and since June we have been living and working in the same state together. We filed on tax slayer, and while it gave us the option of adding a DC tax return, for some reason, it kept combining both of our incomes for that tax return even though I have never lived and worked in DC. It was also pulling in income from our new state of residence even though it shouldn't be relevant for DC state tax alone (at least from my understanding?)

About me: I'm 26 yrs old, currently living + working in Seattle, and have about $400,000 in non-retirement mutual index funds. I plan to live + work in Seattle for at least the next 5 years.

Right now housing prices in Seattle are insane. A single family home is around $1 mil and townhouses are $800k-1 mil. However, 1) given that I plan to be in Seattle for the next 5-10 years if not longer, 2) interest rates are currently low, 3) I have enough for a downpayment, I think the smartest thing to do right now is to buy a place. If I wait a few more years, prices will rise even higher.

I found a few places I like but they are $1mil - 1.1mil. I could realistically afford this by putting a downpayment of $220k, and making a mortgage payment of $4.5k a month. I take home roughly $13k post-taxes each month, so this would follow the 1/3 rule.

However, I'm a single person who would be happy renting an apartment for $2500. I don't need a backyard or 3 rooms.

Of course, we have no crystal ball and nobody can tell for sure what's going to happen. Are you doing anything to prefer for the near-term uncertainty? (at least until the election/pandemics is over?). What would you do between the followings:

1. Riding it out. Keep your portfolio the same -- perhaps mostly stocks. (is there a reason to hold bonds these days?). The market will recover -- just ride it out and don’t fight the Fed!

2. Rebalance and allocate your portfolio to weather the storm. Perhaps something like Ray Dalio's all-weather portfolio (7.5% Gold, 7.5% commodities, 15% intermediate bonds, 40% long-term bonds, and 30% stocks). Another interesting portfolio is the Golden butterfly (20% total stocks, 20% Small Cap Value, 20% Long term bonds, 20% Short term bonds, and 20% Gold). These portfolios are designed to provide less volatility while still offer some growths (Golden Butterfly seems to offer the same growth as all stocks but less volatile)

3. Get out of the market now and sit on cash. This is somewhat an extreme measure but some people have gained a lot from tech and other assets seem to think that everything is now overvalued and it's time to get out. The reasoning behind this approach is that all assets tend to move together in the same direction. (Does gold still go up when stocks go down?)

The issues we're struggling with are a) if it makes sense to refinance at all, since this is more of a starter home for us, and one we're planning to live in maybe only 3-4 years total, including the year we've already spent in it and b) if it did make sense, if the better bet would be to focus on reducing the monthly payment (restarting a 30 year loan) or reducing the loan term (from 30 year, our current, to 20 year, which seems on the table now).

Another caveat is that we paid PMI upfront, and I believe we'd lose this if we refinance. 

We're financially comfortable month to month, so I suppose the goal of any of these conversations are for us to feel as financially secure as possible 2-3 years from now to move into a new house -- whether that be through building home equity or having more cash in bank.

I have an auto loan with 3600 still on in, a personal loan with 1300 on it, one credit card with 1700, and then another credit card for 2400. My monthly payments come out to be like $350 for all of it added up with about 120 of it going to interest from what I've seen. Should I go for a consolidation loan to get it all in one place and if so, where would be a good place to go online? My current personal loan is through Prosper with like a 18% interest rate which is pretty lame (all the interest rate I have are from 12-18%). I don't intend to pay the full loan term if I took one as I would likely throw a couple hundred more at it a month along with bonuses from work, tax returns, etc. I also have roughly 15000 in my checking / savings accounts but really don't want to drop the whole amount from those because I have a wedding coming up and a few other things that I'll need some reserves for- I also make 1300 biweekly. After that whole jumbled mess of information, what would be my best route? pls help",finance

personalfinance,My mom opened a credit card under my name and now cannot pay off the balance.,"My mother had opened up a credit card when I was either 18 or 19. I was aware of the credit card, but I never consented to the credit card or signed anything. I am now in my late 20s and asked her to take me off the credit card. We found out she had added me, some how accidentally, as co joint instead of an authorized user. She has trashed my credit by 100 points and has done nothing over the last 6 years to correct it because she over utilizes the credit card. She also thinks because she pays slightly more than the minimum balance that it helps. However, it doesn't because she has a super high interest rate on the card and can't pay off the $10,000 that she owes.

I asked her to please sign up for a new credit card so that I could pay off the $10,000 that she owes and close the credit card. My mother has crippling anxiety and this is the only credit card she has had. She has a 20 year credit history on this card. She lost her job due to COVID and has no income beyond what comes from my father.

I don't want to be on this card anymore.

I called the credit card company, and basically, I have no other option but to close the account. I mean, I know the obvious solution is to close the credit card, but I am not sure if something else could be done? I also am not really looking to get police or anything involved. However, I have thought about talking to an attorney because of how bad it has gotten.

I've tried talking to my Mom multiple times and have given her lots of time to do something, and she won't. I told her I could pay off some of the balance and she can do a credit card transfer. I also said she could get a new credit card before I close the card. Once she has gotten the new card, I could then pay off the balance and close the credit card.

I am not really sure what to do because I have my own family to worry about now, and it's not like I want to put my own mother in bad financial situation. I am at my wits end with most of my family members and her not trying to work with me. They seem to think that all I care about is my credit score. Yes, I am worried about it and I know I am going to take a serious hit in closing the card, but I can't be on my parent's credit card any longer, it just not right IMO and she hasn't done this to anyone else in my family.

My family feels that I should just pay off the whole debit and leave the card open. To me this is completely absurd because my mother has clearly demonstrated that she doesn't know how to use a credit card. I've also brought up the fact to them that this is not the first time she has not been able to pay off the balance. She has had a credit card in the past where she racked up close to $40,000 in debt.

I feel like I have every right be scared and that I should not have to be on this card any longer. Thoughts?

personalfinance,How much can I afford to spend on housing?,"I’m the most indecisive person when it comes to personal finance decisions, so here I am, again, asking strangers what to do. 

Just graduated college, 22 years old, making $53K in MCOL area with high job security. After taxes and 401(k) contributions I clear about $2,800/month. My only regular expense is my car at $350/month at a super low interest rate and will hold its value relatively well compared to other cars. I have about $21K in liquid assets, only debt being $17.5 left on the car. I’d rather not drain the savings on paying off the car. 

After college I moved back in with my parents. Admittedly, I’m a cheapskate and hate spending money. I was planning on staying here for a while rent free but now I’ve got the itch to move out. I figure I have a really healthy emergency fund and I’ll grow more as a person out from under my parents roof, despite the great relationship we have. 

The way I see it, I have 3 options:

1. Continue to stay at home rent free. I’ll save money, and it’s not like I’m missing much by not going out with the pandemic right now. I expect to be adding ~$2K/month to my emergency fund/savings/house fund if I do this.  If I stick with this option though, I need a plan of when to move out and what I’m doing next (renting, buying, getting roommate, living alone, etc.) for my own sanity. 
2. Move into an apartment alone. In my area, I figure that rent would be ~$1,100 +\- 200 for utilities. I could save a few hundred by renting a cheaper place, but if I’m paying for something I don’t love I figure I should stay at home for free. 
3. Somehow find a roommate to move into an apartment with. I estimate this would be about $600 +/- $100 per month. I’m hesitant on this option because I’d rather not have to get a roommate - I’ve got roommates at home now who don’t charge me rent! Plus right this moment, I don’t know if any people looking for a roommate. 

Further complicating it, am I anywhere close to buying a house? (Probably not for a year or two, but personally I think I’m in a really good position to at least be thinking about it)

Tl;dr - should I spend $0, $700, or $1,300 on rent when I make $2,800 per month and have a good emergency fund.",finance

Portfolio,Investing Advice for inexperienced 24 yr old,"Hello all,

I'm looking for some advice on how to tackle a situation in going through right now, to give you some background.

I'm a 24 yrs old from Latam living alone and with a stable job, I am lucky enough to be able to save 50% of my earnings without compromising my lifestyle, and as of today I have an emergency fund with enough money to cover 6 months of unemployment.

A couple of months ago I decided to start investing in ETFs (I want to focus on passive investing, I don't have the knowledge nor the time to get into stock trading, I've been reading a lot about the subject tho), but I also want to buy a house in my early 30's, so out of the 50% I'm saving: 70% is allocated in my portfolio and 30% in my savings account (really low interest rate), this last 30% is aimed to finance the down payment for my house.

The 70% of my savings are allocated as follows in my portfolio:

VTI -&gt; 70%  
VXUS -&gt; 20%  
BND -&gt; 10%

My questions are:

1. Would it be better to put the 30% i have on my savings account for the down payment into my bonds ETF or should i keep my current approach? Keep in mind that I don't NEED to buy my house in 10 years but Its something that I would like to do.

personalfinance,23 Years Old Best Roth IRA and how should I invest?,"I am currently 23 years old, and have been delaying opening a Roth IRA even though my cousin told me almost a year ago when I had started working at my first real job.

I was thinking of a Roth IRA with Fidelity since you can't really go wrong between Fidelity, Charles Schwab, Vanguard, robo-advisors, etc. 

I have a comfortable savings worth 6 months of my expenses, invest enough into my company's 401(k) to get the full employer match, have refinanced my federal student loans from about 6.5% down to currently pay $1000 a month(variable rate of 2.9%...I am aiming to pay it off in the next 5.5(age 28) years seeing that the LIBOR Rates are low and hopefully will stay low for that time being), but soon will have to put money into a car which I might finance under my dad's name and just pay him back since if I had to register the car I would have to insure under my name as well which is double the cost of my dad's. I believe that even with these costs, I would still be able to comfortably invest about $400 into a Roth IRA.

I am looking a bit(maybe a bit too far) ahead in the future, but I am trying to maintain a well kept savings that will help me in the distant, yet near future with buying a house, wedding, hopefully child by the time I'm about 30. I would ideally like to save 40k for a down payment in the next 7 years(or I might even rent), spend nothing more than 20k on a wedding, and have a decent cushion for a baby in that time frame; it looks like I'm trying to save about 70k-90k in which I believe if achievable with a 7% rate return; if I pay off my student loans, hopefully I will then be able to contribute about 24k a year for the following two years.

Any recommendations on how to invest a bit more wisely? Or please correct me if I'm wrong with my calculations(I also do understand that I would more than likely receive a 3% raise per year, but would like to negate that since life happens). Also when I do take that much money out (probably will be nearly all my contributions) I will basically be starting my Roth IRA from nothing(besides the accrued interest). Please advise.",finance
personalfinance,Can I get these insufficient funds charges reversed?,"I just got a new personal loan for $5k to consolidate the last little bit of my CC debt and an existing personal loan into a lower interest rate loan. The funds were disbursed into Bank 1 savings account and were listed as available; the minimum savings account balance is $5 and I never use this account so the total in the account was $5005. This was on Tuesday. I scheduled an external funds transfer through Bank 1 to transfer the $5k to Bank 2 checking, my primary bill-paying account. It said the funds wouldn’t be delivered for 3 days so I figured even if the $5k hadn’t settled yet, that would be plenty of time.

Wrong. I got a $25 charge in Bank 1 savings on Wednesday (yesterday) titled “Bank 2 Insufficient Funds Fee”. I found it after Bank 1 closed so decided to call about it this morning. However, I got too busy at work today and didn’t get my lunch break off to call, so they closed again before I could call today. Today I received an email from Bank 1 that the funds transfer had failed a second time, and it claimed that an email had been sent yesterday to inform me of the first failed funds transfer and the incoming second attempt, which is not true – no email in junk, trash, inbox... So I check the account again to find another $25 was charged, this time resulting from the total account balance being $4980 after the first $25 charge.

Do you think I have a good chance of getting these charges reversed? Should I call Bank 1 (a down-home local credit union across the country from me) to try to reverse these charges, or should I call Bank 2 (megacorporation bank) since they seemingly assessed the charges?

solar,Would Tesla solar and powerwall make sense in my situation?,"Would Tesla solar and powerwall make sense in my situation?

I have a mountain home in Southern California. It's not a full-time home but we're up there quite a bit especially due to the pandemic right now. We also moved in with my in-laws down in Orange County to help them out with medical issues so this is our get away when we need some time alone. We let friends and family use it when we aren't there. We do not plan on ever using it as a vacation rental.

 The biggest issue we have is there is occasional outages of power due to being turned off for fire reasons or potential snow-laden branches hitting a power line and taking out power for a few days. We were looking for a way to have some kind of power back up in those cases. Initially we were looking at whole house generators but installed those are about $8,000 and they really don't save you any money they just cost you money when you need to run them. Then I found out because we're in a fire zone 3 and my mother-in-law who lives with us uses a CPAP machine, we qualify for up to two free Tesla powerwalls using the California SGIP program. That got us thinking down that route as a potential option. We contacted a solar company called infinity and they gave us a quote for a 4.32kw system for $15,500 before federal tax credit (not including Powerwalls). That seemed fairly high so I decide to go look at Tesla directly and see if they can help me get the free power walls using the same program. They said they could and their price is a little over $8,000 before incentive for a 4.08kw system. Our monthly bills average anywhere between $120 to $200 in the summer. Since it's not a full-time house they are a little low. While the house is 2100 square feet, it is a 3 story house so it doesn't have a whole lot of roof line. And one side of the roof is completely covered in trees and shade. The other side gets blazing hot southern California sun for most of the day.

Would two powerwalls with a small solar system be able to provide enough electricity to keep the lights and fridge on and potential one mini split air conditioner for a couple days? Does getting solar make sense for such a small electric bill for a place that we don't live at full-time?

If getting solar in the power walls make sense, I am now trying to decide between Tesla directly or a different company. I read horror stories about Tesla online but then read good stories here. I'm not sure what to believe...",energy
personalfinance,Game plan for my student loan debt?,"Hello,

I need some help devising a game plan for my student loan debt. I'm 28 years old and live in Massachusetts. I have a stable job making $80,000/yr with some (small) annual/holiday bonuses. My goals are to:

&amp;#x200B;

* Be making $100,000/yr by age 30 (I just turned 28 last month)
* Be debt free by age 30

My only debt are student loans - here they are broken down:

Loan #1 with Sallie Mae - $14,697.96 @ 10.375% interest. Monthly payment is $267.04

Loan #2 with Sallie Mae - $6,381.75 @ 6.250% interest. Monthly payment is $81.84

Loan #3 with Sallie Mae - $3,145.12 @ 8.750% interest. Monthly payment is $50.00

Loan #? with Federal Government - roughly $36,000 total (I'm not exactly sure) @ \~4.5% interest. These went to collections because I was stupid. I'm almost finished with a 9 month program to get me out of collections - that monthly payment is $303.

I take home roughly $4,600 a month after taxes. I should add that I currently have about $6,000 in savings.

My monthly expenses are:

Rent - $1300/month (starting September 1)

Utilities - \~$200/month

Car insurance - $67/month

Food/drinks - $600-700/month (this can be even higher, I know this is bad)

Haircut - $25/month

Gas - $40/month

Uber - $80/month

Aside from the above, I spend random money on entertainment through the month, but I'm sure I can cut that out if I really make a game plan to kill these student loans. My credit isn't good (maybe around  610?) - I've never had a credit card and I don't want one (my family has a bad history with credit cards and I don't want to follow suit). I own an old car that is fully paid off and I plan on driving it until it falls apart.

I know I should refinance my loans, but I have NO clue where to start and the thought stresses me out (especially since my credit score is bad). The big Sallie Mae loan matures in 6 months as well - I guess I have to refinance it then?

With all of that said, is it feasible to try and be debt free by age 30?

The goal of the program is to enhance the Fed’s understanding of digital currencies, said Fed Governor Lael Brainard, in a speech to a conference on innovation sponsored by the Fed’s San Francisco regional bank.

Brainard went to great pains to stress that the central bank is not poised to issue digital dollars.

A “separate policy process” involving thorny legal questions would be needed if the Fed ever wanted to use a digital currency. The central bank has not made a decision to even start such a process, Brainard said.

***I'm such an idiot noob: I've read/heard this several times this year from several well regarded sources, but I don't know what it means.***

I think it means that I, as an individual, should invest where the Federal Reserve is investing, but how do I know what and where that is?

Buying any securities and assets eligible for the central bank’s asset purchasing and emergency lending programs set up to combat the coronavirus pandemic is supposed to be sound advice, but can someone expand on that please?

Another adage is: ‘don’t fight the Fed’.  It's one of the most commonly deployed refrains in financial markets. How can I take advantage of the Fed pumping trillions worth of liquidity into markets?  And what does that mean?

Here's some other stuff that's not part of my questions, but I have to enter in more than twohundredandfifty words?

“People got a little bit carried away, were probably a little bit too positioned, and we forget that bonds often are kind of boring and we’re getting to that stage. If you want quick returns, it’s hard to see how you get them with some of these yields where they are,” said Peter Tchir, head of macro strategy at Academy Securities. “With investment grade and high-yield, you’re back to hoping you can clip a coupon rather than any big price appreciation.”

The slimming-down of the balance sheet also helps explain why the equity market -- outside of the megatech stocks -- have hit a wall as well, according to Samana. While the S&amp;P 500 has rebounded about 45% since March’s low to erase this year’s losses, the bulk of those gains came before early June, and are largely thanks to tech heavyweights pushing the index higher. In contrast, the small-cap Russell 2000 Index is still 12% lower year-to-date.

“Equities haven’t really gone anywhere since early June, that dovetails nicely with the slowdown in the balance sheet,” Samana said. “It’s a very small sliver of the equity market that’s making all-time highs and its the part that not only benefits from what the Fed’s done, but also benefits from all the Covid-related things.”",finance
personalfinance,"Is it a good idea for my parents to pay my student loans off, then I repay the full amount with 2% interest?","I’m 31 years old, living in NYC with $45k of student loan debt. I make $57k a year, and have about $30k in savings. My fiancé makes about $120k a year and our finances are combined and have been for the past 7 years. 

I took out student loans when I was 18, unaware of what the consequences were. I never graduated (due to being an idiot and prioritizing bullshit over my future) and had to pay back about $70k. 

After years of forbearance, paying bills sporadically, owning a home we couldn’t afford and running my credit, I finally got into a better routine and got my life back on track and hightailed it to the city where I’m making much more than I did my LI job.

Between my fiancé and I, we’ve paid off 4 of our student loans and now have EXCELLENT credit. I used to have poor credit in the 500s and I’m over 750 now—so I’m proud of myself!

My fiancé and I are now looking to buy a home on Long Island and plan a small wedding within 2021. With that in mind I figured I would refinance my student loans and get a better interest rates. My current interests rates range of 6.25-7.25%  between all my loans. 

For the purposes of saving enough for the down payment I am now only paying the minimums which frees me with enough to save to meet my down payment goal, monthly payment would be $465 (I was paying $1,300k previously between all loans trying to get the balance down).

Because I didn’t graduate, some financing options aren’t available to me and the ones that are, have insane interest rates—that’s where my parents come in.

They offered to front my pay off amount of $45k in student loans, and I’ll agree to make monthly installments for 10 years with a 2% interest to them. Is this too good to be true? Is it messy getting this involved with your retired parents (who are the co-signers to my student loans) with this?

For context my parents invested in the right stocks and just sold their (paid off) house, so they’re in a good spot.

My big question is, is there any way for me to withdraw the extra $3,000 at the same time I withdraw the $11,718 I need for my closing? There's only a couple of reasons I can do a hardship withdraw on my account and a home down payment is one of them. I'm not interested in doing a loan. 



I'm not sure of the ins and outs of mortgages. Can I just put the extra on my loan and get it back at the time of signing? My loan documents aren't drawn up yet so I can do whatever without having to change anything. Is this something that's possible to do? I know when I do the documents to withdraw from my retirement account I have to give them the info from my closing estimate document from my bank so do they only go by that?",finance

personalfinance,Earning good money but feeling the most unproductive ever,"Hey guys, so I am 27 and never had an actual hands on job in my life. I just graduated 3 months ago with a bachelors in marketing and I've been making videos on YouTube since 16 accumulating such views that I am doing very well financially. (Earned 250k last year, 113K thus far). Biggest revenue was from 2014-2016.
My concern is the polar opposite of what many people have. I actually feel like I need to be working instead of spending 10-15 hours a week uploading YouTube videos. I know I've been doing this 1/3 of my life but it's got to the point where I am losing the passion and my creativity in the videos is dying and I don't know what the next 5-10 years hold for me.

personalfinance,Home Refinance questions,"I closed on my home in February 2020 for 199,900, mortgage is currently 178,800 at 3.625%, monthly payment is 1,218. This is a 30 year fixed mortgage.

I received a decent windfall and am getting advice from a CPA in the family to pay off around 30k of the loan and refinance to a lower interest rate. Their rationale is that my wife and I have a baby on the way and getting a lower monthly payment will help once my wife drops to part time employment.

I've only received a quote from Quicken so far, they said with 30k down I could get a rate of 2.875% by paying 1.375 points. The overall costs included in this quote were over 9k. So the loan would end up around 157,500, dropping the monthly payment to 1,045. This does not seem worth it to me.

After speaking with the CPA they said to shop for the best rate no points down. Quicken came back at 3.25%. This doesn't seem low enough to make it worth it. Is it worth seeking out other quotes? I was expecting a better offer, both my wife and I have credit scores over 760.

Is there any benefit to paying down my current mortgage with the 30k (down to 148,800) and THEN shopping for a refinance? Are the loan officers tacking on crazy fees just to grab as much of that 30k as they can? Or will I find about the same offers either way?

I would appreciate any feedback. Thanks",finance

personalfinance,Should I lower my 401k contributions to get more $ in my paycheck to throw to student loans while there is no interest?,"Maybe this is dumb... but I’m going to ask for opinions anyway. I have 40k in student loans left to pay down. I currently contribute 10% to my 401k. 

If I lowered my contribution to 3%, between now and the end of the year I would get an additional 2k to my paycheck, which I would put towards my loans while no interest is still a thing. 

The specific loan I would apply this to would be the 14k loan with a 6.55% interest rate.  To be clear, I plan to pay more than 2k towards my loan between now and the end of the year, but an additional 2k sure would help. Just don’t know if it’s worth “stealing” it from my 401k? 

I happened to take a look at the last loan statement I got (March) and when I saw my starting balance was 68k, I had paid 40k overall and my remaining balance was 48k it made me even more determined to pay as much as I could while interest was still at 0% haha.

financialindependence,ACA Healthcare Costs and Strategies,"In a response to yesterday's [alarming thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/i8r8ay/how_much_would_heath_insurance_cost_in_the_us_in/ ) regarding potential healthcare costs in early retirement, I thought I'd try to make a few points that might help alleviate some concerns.  Don't get me wrong, healthcare is broken in this country, but until new policies are deployed (whatever they may be), we have to play by the current set of rules.  I hope to outline some information and strategies for health insurance for those of us attempting to bridge the gap between the termination of full time employment and Medicare.  So of course the following is all subject to change with new legislation.

&amp;nbsp; 

**Federal Poverty Level, Subsidy Range, Caps and Cost for 2nd Lowest Tier Silver Plan, 2020**

&amp;nbsp; 

Here is a table depicting expected subsidies and costs for a family of four (two adults &lt;65, two children &lt;21, non-smoking) using 2020 numbers.  I'll try to point a few things out.  Generally speaking, under an income of less than &lt;100% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) will qualify you and your family for Medicaid.  **EDIT: For states that expanded Medicaid, you may qualify until 138% FPL.  In non-expansion states there is a coverage-gap between 100-138%, where you would not qualify  for either Medicaid or ACA.**  Between 100-200% of the FPL, I would generally consider these monthly premiums to be 'affordable'.  
&amp;nbsp; 

From 201-400%, you can see the costs rise dramatically, until at which point you cease to qualify for a subsidy.  For example, a family of four, parents aged 40, children age 8 and 10, will pay $839 per month ($10,073/yr) if their income is $103,000.  If their income is $103,001, they will pay **$1,473 per month ($17,676), an increase of 75.5%.** Due to this fact, the rest of the discussion will be aimed at families with incomes between 100-400% FPL.

&amp;nbsp; 

**The major point of this post I want to make is, for our purposes in early retirement, income does not equal spending/withdrawal rates**.  Generally speaking, you will have a higher, in some cases, much higher spending limit while still keeping your “income” within these ranges.  For the calculations here, the federal government uses Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI).  Going through the details of what is included in your MAGI is beyond the scope of this post.  Generally speaking, its pretty close to your Adjusted Gross Income (AGI), with most deductions added back in.  Your AGI is your gross income minus “above the line” deductions (401k/tIRA, HSA, student loan interest, alimony, etc).

&amp;nbsp; 

So for most working people (W-2 Income, few deductions) the above ranges are fairly good approximates of what they would be spending on healthcare if they were to purchase ACA coverage on the exchange.  Since we will no longer have a work income, the vast majority of our income will be from **dividends, interest and long-term capital gains**.  

&amp;nbsp; 

However, these numbers change dramatically when we're talking about FIRE.  The biggest thing to keep in mind is **return of principle is not taxable**.  Most of us here will not only have tax-deferred accounts (401k, IRA, HSA, etc), but a large brokerage account.  In many cases this brokerage account will be larger than the tax-deferred accounts combined, especially in cases of early high income, RSU's, IPO's, inheritance, sale of business, sale of appreciated property, etc.  Many of us will use this taxable money to fund our early retirement until we reach 59 ½, at which point we will be able to tap retirement accounts, and in 2.5-11 years after that, collect Social Security.

&amp;nbsp; 

Due to the generally short accrual period for FIRE'ies, the brokerage/taxable account will be largely made up of principle and not capital gains.  Totally back-of-the envelope, out-of-my-ass calculations would put the breakdown for a large portion of people at 40-70% principle (thereby 30-60% being capital gains). 

&amp;nbsp; 

To illustrate this point, here is an example:

&amp;nbsp; 

**Jack and Jill, Bobby and Sue**

	- Ages 45, 45, 15 and 13
	- Retired, net worth $3million, paid off home
	- 67% stocks in taxable accounts, 33% bonds/cash in retirement accounts
	- $2million in taxable accounts, $1million across various retirement accounts
	- The $2million taxable is 60% principle, 40% long-term capital gains (LTCG)
	- Desired withdrawal rate 3.5%, or $105,000/yr ($8,750/mo)
&amp;nbsp; 

At face value, it looks like they will be $2,000 over the 400% FPL limit, and will be paying out the nose for health insurance, but not so fast.  Let's see where their $105,000 “income” comes from.  They elect to fund their first 15 years of retirement solely from their taxable account of $2million.  This will hopefully last them until age 59 ½  when they can begin withdrawing from other accounts. 

&amp;nbsp; 

The $2m in stocks will throw off $50,000 in dividends at a 2.5% yield (vast majority qualified if holding US stock)
They then choose to sell $55,000 using average cost basis (not optimal) to make up the remaining of their spending requirement.  That $55,000 is made up of $33,000 principle and $22,000 LTCG.  So their final spend of $105,000 is actually only $72,000 taxable income.  
&amp;nbsp; 

So instead of being 408% of FPL, they are actually at 280%, meaning their monthly costs would be $550 ($6,602/yr).  To quote Anatoly Dyatlov... “not great, not terrible”.  However, if they in fact had a MAGI of $105,000, they would be paying $1,618 per month ($19,412/yr), missing out on their $1,067/mo subsidy ($12,631/yr).  This is a comparative savings of 66%.  
&amp;nbsp; 

As an aside, they are also under the $80,250 cutoff for the 12% federal income tax bracket (MFJ), without even accounting for the hefty $24,800 standard deduction (2020). This means their dividends and capital gains will be taxed at 0%, under current tax law (state taxes not withstanding).  Most of us will be paying very little if any in federal income tax, and of course, no more pay roll taxes.  This couple will be able to spend very close to the $105,000 they wish to withdraw. 

&amp;nbsp; 

**Further Strategies**

	- Utilizing either Specific Identification (SpecID) or Highest in, first out (HIFO) when selling appreciated shares to further decrease capital gains owed (increases proportion of principle utilized for spend)

	- Save a cash buffer of 1-3 years expenses in the few years before retirement to draw from as tax free “income”

	- Invest in growth oriented funds (e.g. VIGAX) to decrease dividends and give more control over tax events

	- Not investing in interest producing investments in tax-able accounts.  Using i-Bonds if you need to use taxable space for fixed income

	- Tax-gain harvesting (selling when funds are high) during years of low income while working to increase their cost-basis

	- Tapping Roth IRA and 401k accounts after 59 ½ to supplement taxable accounts as a source of tax free income

&amp;nbsp; 

**Other Healthcare Strategies**

	- Stay as healthy as you can.  Maintain a healthy weight, do cardio and resistance training regularly, eat well.  If you have a preexisting condition, work with your providers to best manage your condition, do your own research

	- Seeking part time private employment that provides healthcare

	- As mentioned in the other thread, working part time as a government employee (e.g. National Guard)

	- Taking advantage of dual citizenship if you have it

	- Retiring abroad to a country with more favorable healthcare systems (some options in EU, albeit expensive)

	- If no other options, continue full time employment until you are more easily able to bridge the gap to Medicare


&amp;nbsp; 

**TL;DR: Healthcare in the US sucks, but there are tactics you can employ to make it more affordable**

personalfinance,I just started a consulting job and am ineligible to join the company's 401k plan until after my first full year. Should I begin investing in a Roth IRA in the intervening time?,"For context, this is my (27M) first professional job. For the past three years, I managed a bar and waited tables/bartended while working through graduate school and applying for jobs. I have no current savings (outside of a savings account through my bank with a negligible interest rate) and still about $38k in student debt.

The salary for the position is just south of $70k, pre-tax and without considering what type of bonuses I may receive from the company. I expect to be in a considerably higher tax bracket by the time I retire, which is why a Roth IRA sounds better than a traditional IRA.

I am unsure, however, of whether I should focus on paying down my current debts or start investing in an IRA to begin planning for retirement before I have access to a 401k. I really don't know much about this, so I have a few related questions:

If I created my own 401k right now, and instead of an IRA, but obviously without company matching, etc. for the first year, would my company 401k with matching ultimately funnel into the same funds? How complex would having two 401k's or a 401k + IRA be?

Would starting an IRA be silly, as I may stop contributing once I get my 401k, thereby rendering the principal and savings meaningless?

Is there anything I'm missing?

She suddenly took very ill and I feel helpless knowing I don’t have a explanation as to what happened. It started 2-3 days before it happened. Day 1 she was still her usual self playing etc but I noticed she hadnt ate as much ( she normally goes through around 2 packets a day and that day she didn’t finish her first packet. I didn’t think about it too much but the next day she wasn’t playing and was just sleeping a lot, drinking lots of water and still barely eating. The next day is where I was very worried as I woke up to see she had pooper on the carpet and my bed, very out of the ordinary as she has always used her litter tray, so I cleaned her tray putting it down to maybe it was just not clean enough for her liking ( even though there was only pee in it) As the day went on I could tell something was really wrong with her. She was lethargic and barely moving, I then noticed her gums and paws had went very pale. I started to panic and realised her vets and no others locally were open as it was a Sunday she then started to screech in pain and I stupidly thought giving her some of her worming medication would help as I thought it could be worms causing her distress. After giving her the liquid 5 minutes later she lay on the couch flailing around and screaming, in the process she pooped herself. She then rolled over and stopped breathing. I am so heartbroken thinking I could of possible saved her had I of just taken her to the vet. When I noticed her being odd.  Does anyone have any sort of explanation as to what happened.

She was only 990 grams which was pretty underweight but the vet explained she could just be a small kitten as she seemed very healthy. Could worms of killed her? We couldn’t see any in her feces? Could it of been her kidneys? Her heart? Was it the edge of the raw burger I fed her? I wish I had an explanation of some sort as I keep tormenting myself with questions. Can anyone help?

personalfinance,How to get over losing $30 000 in the stock market,"I’m 19 and I decided to try investing so one day I could earn enough to have a down payment for a house, buying a car without needing to lease it and other passive incomes.

From May until August I have earned $10 000 (which was my original goal) from the initial $1500 I put in the account, but I wanted more because I felt that I would miss out if I just stopped here.

Here is my mistake: I buy 5000 shares of Silver at $29 and set a take profit at $35 with not stop loss since I was feeling invincible. I was also hearing the federal reserve was going to announce the news regarding the stimulus package. I get off the stock market for a few days and then when I log back on I realized my whole capital was gone. I took some deep breaths and told myself “I am going to make this money back, I have to”. Fast forward two days I make two I’ll advised buys and I lose another $1000 now I’m just taking a break to get my mind right before I go back to try again.

I keep telling myself to get over it but the thought of losing $30000 bothers me so much I can’t shake the thought out of my head because I thought I was doing everything right. The only way I can get over it is if I make the money back but I don’t want to keep thinking about it because it could affect every decision I make onwards.

I didn’t think about it too much but the next day she wasn’t playing and was just sleeping a lot, drinking lots of water and still barely eating. The next day is where I was very worried as I woke up to see she had pooper on the carpet and my bed, very out of the ordinary as she has always used her litter tray, so I cleaned her tray putting it down to maybe it was just not clean enough for her liking ( even though there was only pee in it) As the day went on I could tell something was really wrong with her. She was lethargic and barely moving, I then noticed her gums and paws had went very pale. I started to panic and realised her vets and no others locally were open as it was a Sunday she then started to screech in pain and I stupidly thought giving her some of her worming medication would help as I thought it could be worms causing her distress. After giving her the liquid 5 minutes later she lay on the couch flailing around and screaming, in the process she pooped herself. She then rolled over and stopped breathing. I am so heartbroken thinking I could of possible saved her had I of just taken her to the vet. When I noticed her being odd.  Does anyone have any sort of explanation as to what happened.
She was 3 months when I got her and was 4 months when she passed. When we got her she hadn’t been wormed or had any vaccinations but we got her the vaccinations around a week and a few days after having her. She was only 990 grams which was pretty underweight but the vet explained she could just be a small kitten as she seemed very healthy. Could worms of killed her? We couldn’t see any in her feces? Could it of been her kidneys? Her heart? Was it the edge of the raw burger I fed her? I wish I had an explanation of some sort as I keep tormenting myself with questions. Can anyone help?

( think I should also add that she was 1 in a litter of 2 and the other kitten died in the first week of being born)",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,"26 years old, debt and retirement investing plan, critiques?","Income: ~$4500-5000/mo after taxes (variance based on some contracting work on the side)

Total living expenses (not including any loan payments): ~$2000/mo

Savings (cash): $9000

Investing/retirement: 

•$8000 401K from previous job, no 401K available for me currently

•$7900 Roth IRA ($5500 left to contribute for 2020)

•$12,000 non tax-advantaged investing (mostly dividend ETFs, and one big tech stock)

Loans: 

•$17,900 @ ~3.5% federal subsidized student loans

•$6100 Car @2.9%

•$5800 Motorcycle @0% while I pay it off in next 5 months

Context:
I’ve been out of school working for 3 years now, and only in the last few months started to get serious about tackling debt and saving/investing for my future.  I changed jobs with a good pay raise a year ago, started taking on a little contracting work from my previous employer, and around the same time reduced my cost of living by moving from my own apartment into a  house with one other person (fixed rent, no commitment, and no utility bills for me, yay!).  I also recently got out of a relationship that I was allowing to be financially draining for me.  So basically, while I may be a little behind on things based on my current income, I’m a lot more set up now to tackle these debts, then start putting a lot more money into my future.  My career field is really stable and options abound in my area, so I’m thankful for that.

Investing vs paying loans:
Some might question why I started a non tax advantaged investing portfolio while still having loans to pay off.  The simple answer is, I’m getting a higher return on that investing compared to paying off the loans earlier, since my interest rates are pretty low.  I also really wanted to get into the market with some relatively safe investments during the downturn in March.

Motorcycle: I fully acknowledge it wasn’t the most financially prudent move to get a toy when I wasn’t even finished paying off the car.  No regrets though, it’s been such a blast and was something I really wanted after a hard breakup.

Plan:

1) Pay off both vehicles within the next ~6 months.  Motorcycle needs to be otherwise higher interest will kick in.  While I might be a slightly better off if I keep investing and make normal payments on the car (due to the point I just made a couple paragraphs above), I just really want to be done with vehicle payments and I can make that happen relatively soon.

2) Max out Roth IRA 2020 or get as close as possible while meeting step 1.

3) Fatten up cash savings a bit.

4) Start making more significant payments towards my student loans while ramping up my investing again.

4) (?) Save up for a house (?)

Thoughts and goals:

My engineering career field will likely get me to a six-figure salary in the next 5-10 years.  Right now I want to stay in my area, but I’m young and early enough in my career that I don’t know what opportunities I might take, and where, in the next few years.  That’s my hesitation with saving for and getting into a house in the near future.  So I figure once my debts are paid off, I’ll focus on investing my extra money - then when the time comes I know I want a house, I could pull some out of there if anything.  

Right now I’m romancing the idea of working to retire early (say by 45-50), or at least having the option to semi-retire and get by with limited contract work on my own schedule.  If I were to not have kids, I think that would be very realistic with some discipline.  I’m most likely to marry and have kids, though (something I definitely want and am just putting on pause, being newly single).  So more than anything, my goal is to be comfortable financially for me and my likely future family, and not ever have to stress about retirement.  

Given these loose goals, how does it look like I’m doing?  Any critiques to my current approach?  Thank you much, wise people of PF!",finance

personalfinance,Balancing retirement &amp; down payment savings,"Hi there PF - long time lurker here and really have learned so much from this community! Wanting to know what you think about my savings plan and any insight you might have. I'm a 30 year old living in an extremely HCOL area, however I've lucked out with my rent being so cheap. 

Here are the important numbers:
- Salary: $79,000

- 401(k): $27,000 (I contribute 8% employer match 3%)

- Traditional IRA: $6,500 (not currently contributing to this account as this was a rollover from previous 401(k). 

- Roth IRA: $100. I just opened this account today with Vanguard. With a plan to contribute $200/month.

- HSA: $1,000. Contributing 150$/month.

- Emergency fund: $10,000

- Monthly expenses: $895 (rent), $150 (various bills), $500 (student loans), $500 (food/entertainment).

- My take home pay each month is $4,550.

My student loans are also an important factor here. I'm 5 years away from Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF). Typically my monthly payment is around $500 however, with the administrative forebalanace on federal student loans I'm currently not making payments. Luckily these months of no payments are still counting towards qualifying payments for PSLF. Since I'm on an income based repayment plan it's important to me to keep my AGI as low as possible. 

My biggest question is around saving for a down payment for a home. I'm needing to save at least 100K for a down payment as homes in my area are extremeley expensive (Seattle). If I keep contributing the same rate towards my retirement accounts and put the rest of my monthly savings (~2,000) into a HYSA for a down payment will I still be contributing enough to my retirement account to retire ~65? 

Over the last 3 months, I've been saving $2,000/month to bulk up my emergency fund. Now, I'm ready to start putting $2,000/month to a downpayment fund as long as I don't need to be contributing more to my retirement accounts.

**Financial background:** 

* 24 y/o, \~2 years of work experience 
* First job (1.5 years): base, $60k; bonus, 5% (basically lived paycheck to paycheck bc NYC is so fucking expensive) 
* Second job (8 months): base, $120k; bonus 10% 
* Location: NYC 
* Expenses pre-covid: \~$3000 ($1300/mo rent, $600/mo food, $150/mo utilities, $250/mo fun money, $700/mo credit cards which are all payed off) 
* Expenses post-covid: $500-$800/mo on food (moved back home with parents in March) 
* Cash: $35k 
* 401k: $9k (4% allocation, no company match) 
* Student loans: $60k (parents are paying them until they reach $50k) 
* Savings rate: $5k-$5.5k/month 

**Things I value:**

* Liquidity - my parents grew up poor and are very frugal when it comes to money. Despite their income growing past the $200k mark they still have a scarcity mindset that has (unfortunately) been imparted onto me. I also never want to live paycheck to paycheck like I did my first year in NYC, it was awful.  
* Optionality - I plan on moving abroad sometime in the future to work, this may come at a significant salary reduction. I’d want to have a good amount of cash on hand during this time. 
* Property - a long term goal of mine is to buy a house in LA, somewhere around the $600-$750k mark. I want to have enough cash for a down payment as well as extra to carry me for at least 2 years should I loose my job. 
* Life expectancy - living until old age is not guaranteed and I'd like to be able to take big risks while I'm young - whether that be moving across the world or investing in property.

Re: student loans - my average interest rate is around \~3%. The obvious response would be to pay these down as soon as possible but I’d rather keep a high cash flow, for now at least. $28k of these loans aren’t accruing interest. I recently got a promotion and can expect my EOY bonus to be around $15k-$20k, I hope to throw 80% of this to my student loans.    


Given the above, is it still necessary that I max out my 401k? Does anyone here not max out their 401k when they possible could be? What is your rational? Having so much money tied up until I’m 60 really freaks me out, especially with how volatile corporate america is.

Have something gone wrong?,"In the past 4 years of my career, I have never paid attention to Tax Withholding on my paycheck. It is whatever my company decides to withhold, and I always plan my budget with the net income. The Tax Return is like a bonus to me, which never participates in my budgeting. Before my marriage, my tax return has always been around $2-3k. It jumped up to $10k+ after my marriage (filling jointly and my wife is not working). I am aware that Tax Return is not a bonus.

I got my initial closing disclosure today and was shocked to see my property taxes go from my current $111/mo to $235/mo. I asked them why the jump, and they said since the property tax rates have not been set for the 2021 tax year (will happen in September) they are estimating the value based on my appraisal and applying a multiplier of 1.25 to ensure they're collecting enough.

What I don't understand is why they would use the *appraisal* value to base my taxes. The FCV for the 2021 tax year on my home is listed on the county website at just under $50k less than the *appraised value*, and (as far as I can tell) that's what they use to calculate my taxes. Based on my FCV, I estimate my taxes to go somewhere between $130 and $150 per month.

Since [Better.com](https://Better.com) will be selling my mortgage to an investor, I do not yet know who will own my mortgage. Would it be possible once the mortgage is transferred to the new servicer to ask for an immediate escrow re-analysis?

I have a question for you all. My spouse(30) and I(31) are residing in Washington state and covid is starting to negatively affect our financials and I need to stop this before our debt snowballs out of control...

I am a current full time college student and unemployed. My spouse is in healthcare and currently our only financial provider (our pre-covid income is normally 82k/year pretax). My SO's hours at work are being cut 3-4 shifts a month and making payments on our debts is impossible with my SO's hours being cut.

We had to sell our home a few years ago and use the equity gained to pay for hospital bills for an injury I sustained. I had to seek employment in a new sector (hence going back to college) because I was unable to work in the same position post surgery.

We have already signed up for limited time 0% interest cards and transferred debts from one credit lender to another to save money by paying less in interest. I would like to avoid opening other credit lines if possible.

I have considered a 401-k withdrawal to pay off an outlandish amount of debt that we both have so that we can finally put money in our savings again... I know early withdrawal penalties can accrue on a withdrawal, but the IRS cares act doesn't specifically state what qualifies as ""adverse financial consequences"" and I do not want to pay 35% tax fees on a early withdrawal from my retirement to get out of debt... Here is the link to the IRS page i quoted earlier.

Is a consolidated loan or a withdrawal from my 401-k the better option to getting out of debt? Or are there better options that I haven't mentioned? What should we do?

Here is a list of our debts and their interest rates.

credit card #1 $1,100 @ 17% apr

credit card #2 $740 @ 16.75% apr

credit card #3 $10,900 @ 0% apr

credit card #4 $9,690 @ 0% apr

credit card #5 $4,500 @ 0% apr

car loan $19,650 @ 4.74 apr

student loans $21,780 @ 5.05 apr

Total debt is about $70,350. Making minimum payments our debt suck $1,105/month out of our pockets... Our car/student loans have relatively low interest rates and those two payments add up to $530 of our monthly bills.

Monthly bills include

rent $900

water/sewer/garbage/electricity/internet/cell =$800'ish- some months we use more or less.

groceries/food $450

We have $4,200 in savings, and I have $72,000 in a 401-k. Other than our belongings and one car (valued $3,200) that I own we do not have any other assets.

personalfinance,I'm 24 and have $16K saved up. I'm wondering what's the best approach I should take for paying off debt vs saving for retirement.,"Here's a rundown of my current situation.  
  
I'm 24, living at home with essentially no expenses outside my student loans. I make $3,200 a month after taxes. My student loans are currently $12K @ 5.88% for private and $30K @ 4.33% on average for federal. I currently have about $16K cash that I have saved up that's just sitting in my checking account. I haven't started any retirement savings yet; I haven't been too educated on the best ways, and I wasn't eligible for my companies' 401K until last month (also no employer match). I've also been taking a very aggressive approach to pay off my loans and figured rates I would earn from a 401K or IRA wouldn't be that much greater than my loan interest rates. I probably spend $300-500 a month on subscriptions, leisure, hobbies, going out, etc. and I don't have to worry about rent, car payment or anything like that yet.     
  
At the start of the year I started putting $3,325 a month (yes, more than my income) plus any other income (i.e. tax return, stimulus) towards my loans. At this rate my private would be paid off in October (I plan on dropping an additional ~$2K the last month to get it over with), and federal in June 2021. I've been living off the money I've had saved since the beginning of the year. Now that the money I have in my checking is more than my private loan I'm wondering if maybe I should have been or should start taking a different approach regarding paying off loans vs saving for retirement? These were a few routes I was considering.  
  
1. Continue my normal plan. Live off $16K for the next 11 months, pay off student loans in June 2021, start saving for retirement in July.  
2. Just pay off the private now with my savings. This leaves me with $4K, but I would take home my whole paycheck for the rest of the year. With bonuses, I anticipate making $20K after taxes through the end of the year, $10K of which I would allocate to federal loans when 0% interest ends. The other $10K I could either put towards my cash savings to live off, or split between an IRA and savings. Paying now vs over the next 2.5 months would save me about $100 in interest, but I'm not sure if that's worth losing the security of having the money now vs later.   
3. Drop $6K into an IRA now to have contributions in 2020, continue my payment plan and live off $10K for the next 11 months.  
  
I'm not sure if one of these options is better than the others, or if there's an even better route that I'm not considering. I feel like it really comes down to how I should handle the $16K I currently have. I'm starting to think that I should try to squeeze in the $6K towards an IRA this year instead of pushing it off another year. Especially considering next year I should have July-December with no expenses, I'll have no problem maxing an IRA out. I think investing in our 401K doesn't make the most sense for me until my loans are paid off since we don't get any match (but please someone correct me if I'm wrong).",finance
stocks,Trump announced a collaboration with McKesson Corp to aid in vaccine distribution -- Strong buy,"Drug wholesaler **McKesson** is set to play a key role distributing Covid-19 vaccines to clinics, hospitals and pharmacies around the U.S.

Following press release on behalf of Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Defense:

Under the leadership of President Trump, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Department of Defense (DOD), in support of Operation Warp Speed (OWS) announced today that McKesson Corporation will be a central distributor of future COVID-19 vaccines and related supplies needed to administer the pandemic vaccinations.

“Today’s announcement puts another building block in place as the Nation moves toward a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine,” said CDC Director Robert Redfield, M.D.. “America’s march toward one or more safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines is a combined effort between American industry and the federal government. McKesson is a leader in their field, and we welcome their expertise and dedication to public health.”

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is executing an existing contract option with McKesson to support vaccine distribution. The company also distributed the H1N1 vaccine during the H1N1 pandemic in 2009-2010. The current contract with McKesson, awarded as part of a competitive bidding process in 2016, includes an option for the distribution of vaccines in the event of a pandemic.

Detailed planning is underway to ensure rapid distribution as soon as the FDA authorizes one or more vaccines.  Once these decisions are made, McKesson will work under CDC’s guidance to ship COVID-19 vaccines to administration sites.

EDIT: Many analysts say it's a strong buy opportunity and I do tend to agree. I never really got swept up in the vaccine development investments themselves, but it was the distribution news that I was waiting to hear. This is it, for me.

personalfinance,Tax refund I wasn't expecting?,"I just received a large check in the mail for $4,500 or so from the US Treasury, listed as a ""Refund"" on my federal taxes.  I filed my federal taxes in July and owed a substantial amount of money -- $13,000 or so -- and I paid it at that time via direct deposit.  There was no explanation in the envelope for the check.

personalfinance,Refinancing Question with Down Payment Assistance,"Hello,
Sorry if this doesn’t belong here and/or for my formatting bc I’m on mobile. I bought my house in 2015 using an FHA loan. My lender at the time told me closing costs would be very inexpensive and that a downpayment wasn’t needed. I should have looked into it further but I was 25 and wanted a house. Now (2020) we are looking to refinance to save some money long term. However, when I signed the million papers to buy the house, I agreed to down payment assistance, the DPA program is TDHCA. Is there anyway to still refinance without having to fork over the $8500 that was originally part of the down payment assistance? Is it a good idea to basically use all our savings to do this? Or just keep our current loan. (loan is currently at ~$154,000 original loan at ~$169,000 interest rate of 4.375%)",finance
personalfinance,Refinance with Regions Bank,"I am in the process of trying to figure out how to lower my interest rate from my current rate of 4.75 when I purchased my house in 2014. My current balance on my loan is 120k. I contacted the loan officer and asked her what my costs would be to refinance and this is what she wrote back. Does any of this sound legit or anyone have any suggestions for me?  


——— FROM LOAN OFFICER ——
“The only fee you have to pay out of pocket is the $475 appraisal fee. All other closing cost are rolled into the loan amount.
 
This estimate shows a fixed rate of 3.00% for a 30 year biweekly. Paying half the note every 2 weeks will shave years off the 30 year term. You’ll save approximately $255 per month with this estimate (even increasing the loan balance to cover closing cost and new escrow account).
 
We took the $3200 that was in your current escrow account and will use it to pay down your current mortgage. But then we need to collect funds to start a new escrow account- so those funds are rolled into the loan amount.
 
Total closing cost are approx. $3982 and funds to set up new escrow account are $3911 (we need to collect almost a full year of insurance and taxes because they are all due in December).”",finance
personalfinance,Unsure About Making Extra Payments on Car Due to Risk of Getting Totaled,"Hey all,

This might be a silly (or legit) concern but I am unsure about making extra payments on my car loan despite having the extra income to do so. I bought the car brand new (don't throw stones at me) - it's a 2019 Toyota RAV4 - and I love it. My goal from the get-go was to pay it off and keep driving it for 15-20+ years. Total amount financed was $30k but I'm down to $23k now. I wanted to buy it used but I fell in love with the new body style and have never been a fan of the old body style. Also, RAV4's hold their resale value really well so I'm not sure if I'm buying a one year used model would have made a huge difference.

I have the ability to make extra payments to the car loan every week (side hustle) but I'm paranoid to do so because I will not have equity in the car for the first year. I'd prefer the GAP insurance to pay for the difference in case the car was to get totaled instead of me footing the bill in the forms of extra payments. Is this a silly or valid concern? Ultimately, should I keep making extra payments and try to pay it off ASAP? The interest rate is 3.9%.

Thanks in advance!",finance

personalfinance,Rolling over closing costs into my mortgage loan?,"Hi,

Current:

-	My property is worth 365k 
-	Principal loan : 331k
-	Principal remainder: 327k
-	Interest rate : 4.250% with PMI
-	Monthly payment: $2139

New:

-	interest: 3.25%
-	Monthly payment: $1993
-	closing: 6k
-	my loan officer will roll it into my mortgage (is this a good or bad thing)


Questions:

-	should I refinance? (I’m leaning to yes since &gt; 1% reduction)
-	if I roll closing costs now and pay off the closing costs like a month later, does it make a difference?
-	what is the significance of rolling my closing costs into mortgage? I have the cash to pay it up front but it seems better to just let it roll into my mortgage. If I change my mind, I can just throw my cash I planned to use for refinance into my principal. 
-	there is a option to refinance to 3.125 percent but costs $229 more in points. (At 3.25 percent, I get a CREDIT of $613 towards my closing costs). This is why I chose 3.25. Is that a good idea?

vet,Putting 4 cats on a diet but one only nibbles and then begs for more food?,"We've got 4 cats. Two of them are major chonks that could stand to lose a pound or so, one is normal size, the other is pretty small but eats fine. 

The normal sized girl has not taken well to being fed a specific times of the day. She's about 4 years old, never had any medical issues. We realized that she pukes when she has an empty stomach so we increased the times we feed them but portioned out the food appropriately so we could mitigate her puking. Definitely made a difference and she's rarely sick now.  

But now she just nibbles at her food and then within 30 minutes to an hour is begging for more food. She's not lethargic, she's still very active and cuddly. I occasionally give her snacks between meals because she eats so little. Today she had a snack a few hours before dinner and then puked right before dinner time on my husband. The puking does not seem to bother her at all either. 

I'm just not sure what we should be doing with her? She does not appear to be losing weight. And she seems perfectly ok (although I know cats are great at hiding problems). I'm just curious if it's just the feeding schedule or if we should be watching for other signs that something might be wrong with her.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,I'm convinced I need student loans to get ahead,"I've thought about it for years. Years and years. I've looked into it and messed around. I'm 30 now. When am I going to be independent from my money? Or at least my bills. The answer is never. 

For context, I have 36kish in debt. 15k in credit cards (10.9k @ 19%, 4kish 0% balance transfer comes true next year) and 31k in a car loan I'm upside down on and can't get rid of no matter how much I'd want to (and I do. Anyone want to take over my 500+ a month payment?). I'm paying extra on my cc debt (except covid made me take a paycut GO FIGURE) and I'll likely owe money to my state's pandemic unemployment assistance since they think my unemployment wasn't directly related to the pandemic (it technically is but also because my job is refusing to hire me back after leaving to fulfill a military obligation -- pretty sure that's a federal offense). 

For context, I left early this year to join a branch, they sent me home right when the pandemic was kicking off. Called and called and am supposed to be rehired but nothing. I now have a temp job with a decent company. Pays enough to cover the bare minimums on all my bills. I won't be thrown out on my ass, for now. 

So with the emergency predicament sorted, in comes the old frustrations. Why do I barely have enough money at the end of the month? (Former shortsightedness aside) It's because of my lack of wages. Like many people, I wanted to stay on unemployment to collect that sweet $600 extra a week. I even managed a 2 month emergency savings, which is how I'll pay this month's bills (and how I paid last month's). 

So, I'm convinced I need student loans, or some such thing. 6 years in the military and I can cash in on that sweet GI Bill and get a bachelor's. I even have most of my general ed stuff out of the way from actually going to college after graduating high school. Can I do 6 years? I want to. And I could work on the bachelor's while I'm in. 

And I'd get paid a bit, too. I made about $6k in the few months I was in. The debt will take about 4 years to clear up, and that's paying slightly over the minimum. So... I guess I'm still convinced. I either need student loans, ones to cover living expenses , or I work real hard to get back into the military, assuming they'd even want me. 

What do you think? I don't mind downvotes but I'm looking for some thoughtful answers. I can't really talk to anyone else about this. Don't really have anyone else to talk to. That sounds like a pity party, but it's not meant to be. So tell me what you think.

# **Stocks are ignoring the lack of a stimulus package from Congress, but that could change  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/14/stocks-are-ignoring-the-lack-of-a-stimulus-package-from-congress-but-that-could-change.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks could hang at record levels but gains may be capped until Congress agrees to a new stimulus package to help the economy and the millions of unemployed Americans.
*****
&gt; Stocks were higher in the past week, and the S&amp;P 500 flirted with record levels it set in February.
*****
&gt; In the coming week, there are some major retailers reporting earnings, including Walmart, Home Depot and Target, but the season is mostly over and the market is entering a quiet period. There are minutes from the Fed’s last meeting, released Wednesday, and housing data, including starts Tuesday and existing sales Friday.
*****
&gt; Investors had been watching efforts by Congress to agree to a new stimulus package, but talks have failed and the Senate has gone on recess. There is a concern that Congress will not be convinced to provide a big enough package when it does get to work again on the next stimulus round because recent economic reports look stronger. July’s retail sales, for example, climbed to a record level and recovered to pre-pandemic levels.
*****
&gt; “The juxtaposition of getting more fiscal stimulus and better data has paralyzed us in our tracks … we’ve seen this sideways [market] action,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Alliance. “It feels like we need more action from Congress, and the concern is the longer we wait, the better the data gets and the less impactful the next round of stimulus will be.”
*****
&gt; Some technical analysts say the market may pull back around the high, to allow it to consolidate gains before moving higher into the end of the year. The S&amp;P 500 reached an all-time high of 3,393 on Feb. 19.
*****
&gt; Hogan said he expects stocks to tread sideways during the dog days of August, but they could begin to react negatively to the election in September. He also said it is important that progress continue against the spread of Covid-19, as the economy continues to reopen.
*****
&gt; Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group, said the market could have a wakeup call at some point that the stimulus package has not been approved.
*****
&gt; “I think it will cross over a line where they care,” he said. “I think the market is in suspended animation of believing there will be a magical deal.” Boockvar said he expects a deal ultimately, but the impact is not likely to be as big as the last round of funding.
*****
&gt; “What they’re not grasping is any deal, any extension of unemployment benefits, is going to be smaller than it was, and the rate of change should be the most important thing investors focus on,” he said. “Not the binary outcome of whether there’s a deal or no deal. There’s going to be less air going into the balloon.”
*****
&gt; # It’s the economy
&gt; Still, economists expect to see a strong rebound in the third quarter, and are anticipating about about a 20% jump in third-quarter growth. But they also say that could be threatened if Congress does not help with another stimulus package.
*****
&gt; Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, described the July retail sales as a perfect V-shaped recovery, but cautioned it would not last unless more aid gets to individuals and cities and states. Democrats have sought a $3 trillion spending package, and Republicans in the Senate offered a $1 trillion package. They could not reach a compromise, including on a $600 weekly payment to individuals on unemployment which expired July 31.
*****
&gt; President Donald Trump has tried to fill the gap with executive orders to provide extra benefits to those on unemployment, but the $300 federal payment and $100 from states may take some time to reach individuals, as the processing varies by state. He has also issued an order instructing the Treasury to temporarily defer collection of payroll taxes from individuals making up to $104,000.
*****
&gt; “I think in August and September, there will be a lot of Ws, if there’s not more help here,” said Zandi, referring to an economic recovery that retrenches from a V shape before heading higher again. “It’s clearly perplexing. It may take the stock market to say we’re not going to get what we expect, and sell off and light a fire.”
*****
&gt; Zandi said it could come to a situation like 2008, where the stock market sold off sharply before Congress would agree to a program that helped financial companies.
*****
&gt; “We need a TARP moment to get these guys to help. Maybe if the claims tick higher and the August employment numbers are soft, given the president is focused on the stock market, that might be what it takes to get them back to the table in earnest,” he said, referring to the Troubled Asset Relief Program that helped rescue banks during the financial crisis.
*****
&gt; He ultimately expects a package of about $1.5 trillion to be approved in September.
*****
&gt; The lack of funding for state and local governments could result in more layoffs, as they struggle with their current 2021 budgets, Zandi said. Already 1.3 million public sector jobs have been lost since February, and there will be more layoffs and more programs and projects cancelled. The impact will hit contractors and other businesses that provide services to local governments.
*****
&gt; “The multipliers on state and local government are among the highest of any form of support, so if you don’t provide it, it’s going to ripple through the economy pretty fast,” he said.
*****
&gt; Economists expect to see a softening in consumer spending in August with the more than 28 million Americans on unemployment benefits as of mid-July no longer receiving any supplemental pay.
*****
&gt; “The real irony is things are shaping up that September is going to be a bad month, and that’s going to show up in all the data in October,” Zandi said. “They are really taking a chance on this election by not acting.”

&gt; # 4 Charts That Will Amaze You

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Index is a few points away from a new all-time high, completing one of the fastest recoveries from a bear market ever. But this will also seal the deal on the shortest bear market ever. Remember, the S&amp;P 500 Index lost 20% from an all-time high in only 16 trading days back in February and March, so it makes sense that this recovery could be one of the fastest ever.

&gt; From the lows on March 23, the S&amp;P 500 has now added more than 50%. Many have been calling this a bear market rally for months, while we have been in the camp this is something more. It’s easy to see why this rally is different based on where it stands versus other bear market rallies:

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.12.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; They say the stock market is the only place where things go on sale, yet everyone runs out of the store screaming. We absolutely saw that back in March and now with stocks near new highs, many have missed this record run. Here we show how stocks have been usually higher a year or two after corrections.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.12.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; After a historic drop in March, the S&amp;P 500 has closed higher in April, May, June, and July. This rare event has happened only 11 other times, with stocks gaining the final five months of the year a very impressive 10 times. Only 2018 and the nearly 20% collapse in December saw a loss those final five months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GS-Blog-Chart.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, this bear market will go down as the fastest ever, at just over one month. The recovery back to new highs will be five months if we get there by August 23, making this one of the fastest recoveries ever. Not surprisingly, it usually takes longer for bear markets in a recession to recover; only adding to the impressiveness of this rally.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.12.20-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “It normally takes 30 months for bear markets during a recession to recover their losses, which makes this recovery all the more amazing,” said LPL Financial Chief Market Strateigst Ryan Detrick.. “Then again, there has been nothing normal about this recession, so maybe we shouldn’t be shocked about yet another record going down in 2020.”

&gt; # When a Few Basis Points Packs a Punch

&gt; US Treasury yields have been on the rise this week with the 10-year yield rising 13 basis points (bps) from 0.56% up to 0.69% after getting as high as 0.72% on Thursday. A 13 bps move higher in interest rates may not seem like a whole lot, but with rates already at such low levels, a small move can have a pretty big impact on the prices of longer-term maturities.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/081420-10-Year-Yield.png))**

&gt; Starting with longer-term US Treasuries, TLT, which measures the performance of maturities greater than 20 years, has declined 3.5% this week. Now, for a growth stock, 3.5% is par for the course, but that kind of move in the Treasury market is no small thing. The latest pullback for TLT also coincides with another failed attempt by the ETF to trade and stay above $170 for more than a day.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/081420-TLT.png))**

&gt; The further out the maturity window you go in the fixed income market, the bigger the impact of the move higher in interest rates. The Republic of Austria issued a 100-year bond in 2017, and its movements exemplify the wild moves that small changes in interest rates (from a low base) can have on prices. Just this week, the Austrian 100-year was down over 5%, which is a painful move no matter what type of asset class you are talking about. This week's move, though, was nothing compared to the stomach-churning swings from earlier this year. When Covid was first hitting the fan, the 100-year rallied 57% in the span of less than two months. That kind of move usually occurs over years rather than days, but in less than a third of that time, all those gains disintegrated in a two-and-a-half week span from early to late March. Easy come, easy go. Ironically enough, despite all the big up and down moves in this bond over the last year, as we type this, the bond's price is the same now as it was on this same day last year.

&gt; # Retail Sales Rock to New Highs

&gt; At the headline level, July’s Retail Sales report disappointed as the reading missed expectations by nearly a full percentage point. Just as soon as the report was released, we saw a number of stories pounce on the disappointment as a sign that the economy was losing steam. Looked at in more detail, though, the July report wasn’t all that bad. While the headline reading rose less than expected (1.2% vs 2.1%), Ex Autos and Ex Autos and Gas, the results were much better than expected. Not only that, but June’s original readings were all revised higher by around a full percentage point.

&gt; Besides the fact that this month’s report was better underneath the surface and June’s reading was revised higher, it was also notable as the seasonally-adjusted annualized rate of sales in July hit a new record high. After the last record high back in January, only five months passed until American consumers were back to their pre-Covid spending ways. For the sake of comparison, back during the Financial Crisis, 40 months passed between the original high in Retail Sales in November 2007 and the next record high in April 2011. 5 months versus 40? Never underestimate the power of the US consumer!

&gt; # B.I.G. Tips - New Highs In Sight

&gt; Whether you want to look at it from the perspective of closing prices or intraday levels, the S&amp;P 500 is doing what just about everybody thought would be impossible less than five months ago - approaching record highs. Relative to its closing high of 3,386.15, the S&amp;P 500 is just 0.27% lower, while it's within half of a percent from its record intraday high of 3,393.52. Through today, the S&amp;P 500 has gone 120 trading days without a record high, and as shown in the chart below, the current streak is barely even visible when viewed in the perspective of all streaks since 1928. Even if we zoom in on just the last five years, the current streak of 120 trading days only ranks as the fourth-longest streak without a new high.

&gt; While the S&amp;P 500's 120-trading day streak without a new high isn't extreme by historical standards, the turnaround off the lows has been extraordinary. In the S&amp;P 500's history, there have been ten prior declines of at least 20% from a record closing high. Of those ten prior periods, the shortest gap between the original record high and the next one was 309 trading days, and the shortest gap between highs that had a pullback of at least 30% was 484 tradings days (or more than four times the current gap of 120 trading days). For all ten streaks without a record high, the median drought was 680 trading days.

&gt; Whenever the S&amp;P 500 does take out its 2/19 high, the question is whether the new high represents a breakout where the S&amp;P 500 keeps rallying into evergreen territory, or does it run out of gas after finally reaching a new milestone? To shed some light on this question, we looked at the S&amp;P 500's performance following each prior streak of similar duration without a new high.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks.",finance
personalfinance,Should my mom refinance? (LONG),"Quick quip. My mom's mother tongue is not English. So ever since i was young, i was the one to resolve alot of personal matters. Which is why I have a (almost full) understanding of my moms situations.

This also includes finances. And now I am trying to figure out if refinancing will be beneficial to my mom. (I grew up not having anyone to learn these kind of things from. And all learned from just researching. So apologies if i miss something obvious)

long story short, 

1. my mom bought her current home at height of the housing boom in late 2007/early 2008. 
2. i believe downpayment was either 1%, or none at all. im pretty sure it was no downpayment made. Also, i believe there was no such thing a PMI? and I dont think there is PMI as well for her current mortgage. is that possible? (idk much about PMI. other than its just insurance usually paid if home equity is less than 20%)
3. She had hard time making payments. Ending up getting couple refinancing i believe through gov assitance, which also led to defaulting from 2010 to 2012 while the government modification was going through.
4. Her new mortgage plan through the gov modification started April 2012, with first payment due May 1st 2012.
5. been making monthly payments up today without being late or defaulting.

she lives paycheck to paycheck. I help pay monthly bills.

this is her mortgage. (mom is 59 years old). due to the ""special"" mortgaging modifaction plan given by the government, its a little unique.

* ""Unpaid principal balance"" 345,518.99
* Deferred Principal Balance 59,903.84
* Interest Bearing Principal Balance 285,615.15
* Interest Rate 4.625%
* **40 year term**
* Currently, looks like home is valued at ~$500k according to zillow.

The interesting part is the first 2 lines.

Lets assume downsizing is NOT an option. (although that would be ideal i think. but for now, i want to focus on my questions asked below first)

currently the interest bearing principal balance is $262,303.67 after almost 8 years of payment. (knocked down $23k after 8 years.)

From the mortgage plan, the $59,903.84 gets deferred and does not accrue interest. HOWEVER, this amount is due in full at time of maturity (other conditions exist as well. i.e. I think if she refinances, this amount will also be due)

She does not have any downpayment. So her monthly payment currently is $1,307.06 + like 360 for escrow stuff. this changes yearly it seems. 

with this current plan, and using an Amortization calculator, it seems like she will pay (on payoff date of April 2052) a total of $285,615.15 + $341,773.03 (total interest paid) + $59,903.94 = for a total of $687,292.12

if she refinances, and we assume she gets a 30 year mortgage plan and interest rate of 3.5% (or 100 basis points decrease) looking at the amortization schedule, her monthly payment will be 1,448.18 + 360 (im guessing the same 360 for escrow stuff).

she will pay a total of (with estimated payoff date of feb 2050) $322,502.28 + 198,842.29 (total interest paid) = $521,344.57

So long term, obviously its better to refinance. but ( And lets assume downsizing is not an option. although that would be ideal i think. but for now, i want to focus on my questions below first))

1. are my numbers correct here? 
2. is my the mortgage calculation/comparison done correctly as well?
3. Long term, the refinance is worth it. but how long is the ""long term"" do we have to consider? (I mean my mom is 59 years old right now)
4. what factors do i have to consider? I know closing fees are one (how much will that be?)
5. should the fact that the deferred principal balance isnt getting any interest accrued be something good overall regarding payments made?
6. what about the fact that at the end of the 40 year term, the full $59,903.84 value of the deferred principal balance is due in full be considered whether or not to refinance?

my biggest concern is that since this isnt your typical mortgage loan, and its gov assistance due to the 2008 market crash, if my mom refinances are there any (or possibly?) benefits she may lose?

thank you. any help is greatly appreciated.

EDIT: added more info here https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/ia7xz0/should_my_mom_refinance_long/g1mz1zt/ as it seems i may have been missing something, as its a common question being asked. I initially wanted to avoid it because i find it very personal.",finance

stocks,Why the stock market is doing so well despite current world conditions,"Im new to investing. A couple of years worth. Started out in a major bull run. Sold out. Got back in as soon as the market had just bottomed earlier this year. My portfolio looks like I have a clue but its mostly because of my timing of deciding to trade stocks. As I learn more about everything. I try to question or find supporting evidence elsewhere. One video I just came across was from that millenial graham guy on youtube. Ive seen so many posts on here and mostly everywhere else of everyone, wether serious or not. Talking about how the stock market is detached from reality. The FEDs ruined all my puts on the S&amp;P. Look at the horrific news headlines yet stonks go up! I understand everyone is doing alot to prop the economies up and businesses but this video gave me a fresh perspective. The majority of the businesses affected by the world conditions are just a sliver of the S&amp;P where as if Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, and a few other major players were to have issues. Things would dramatically be affected vs airlines, hotels, and restaurants that only make up a very small portion of the S&amp;P. From what Ive seen. Those major companies have actually thrived during the lockdowns and pandemic. The nasdaq 100 which is mostly tech and bio tech is crushing it. Is that pretty accurate as to why the stock market can be so separate looking from the economies and news? Again im new to this. All ive read up to this point sounded like un computable chaos. Then that info brought some logic to it on top of what is being done to prop things up artificially. Please bring yourself down to my level and spread some knowledge. Im in CARR, BAC, RTX, DIS, SPYD, and XLK.",finance

stocks,ELI5: The Telsa/AAPL split (as well as some other questions).,"I understand that it costs 1600 for a single share of TSLA and if it splits, more people can afford shares. However, aren't fractional shares already a thing? What's the difference?

Also, and this is probably going to be a dumb question, are we basically never going to have recession anymore? I feel like we should've had one but the stock market rebounded pretty quick and what it seemed like to me was that the feds just printed more money and propped it back up. If that's the case, should we just never expect something like 2008 to happen again? 

I'm definitely a greenhorn when it comes to stocks and investment so I appreciate your input.",finance
personalfinance,Student loan strategy: loan forgiveness or suck it up and pay big now?,"Hi all, first time posting in this sub, and looking forward to becoming a more regular participant. Here goes my first post:

So, I have federal student loans currently totaling $89K (doh). The principal is $68K and interest $21K. The breakdown for these federal loans are: 3 subsidized loans at $10K and 3 unsubsidized loans at $79K. I am on a 20 year PAYE plan, that started in June 2015.

I just got a 501(c)(3) job 4 months ago (first 501(c)(3) status employment since the PAYE plan kicked in).

I am trying to figure out what my best strategy is to tackle this student debt. These are the options I have been pondering:

1. I have been considering trying to stay full-time employment at a 501(c)(3) to qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness after 10 years. I have generally heard horror stories about people getting screwed for this despite lots of documentation, etc. If I can get more assurance that this is something that is not too difficult to prove/get after 10 years of employment, I'm tempted to try to make this path happen. How can I ensure this happens?
2. If the above doesn't happen, I am thinking about biting the bullet when it comes to the eventual loan forgiveness in 2035 (!) re: the tax bill. Crunching the numbers, the taxable amount would still be less than $89K now. And in the meantime, I make the 10% monthly payments for the next 15 years.

Is there another option/angle that I may be missing here? And/or welcoming folks to weigh in with thoughts in general on this situation. 

I'm fortunate that I didn't take out any private loans, but no doubt the interest on these federal loans are definitely enough to keep me up at night. Thanks all for reading.",finance

personalfinance,401k Rebalance: Bond Fund vs 401k Loan to Payoff Debt,"With the recent recovery of stock funds, my portfolio is very equity heavy at the moment and I am planning to rebalance some of this into funds that would likely weather a downturn in the economy better.  However, safer investments (treasuries, high rated corporate bonds, etc) yield next to nothing at the moment.  I do however have a car loan of roughly the amount I am planning to shift out of equities with an interest rate of just over 4%.

I am wondering if it would make sense to take out a 401k loan to payoff this debt and essentially earn a guaranteed 4% on this money rather than less in a safe bond fund (or similar).  The repayment money would be reinvested into stock funds over the next 5 years to hopefully dollar cost average back into equities at a discount (if a downturn presents).  The payment on the 401k loan would be less than the current car payment which would free up some cash flow as well.  

It looks like the risk here would be losing my job and having to pay off the debt immediately or pay taxes (including a 10% penalty - I am not retirement age) on the outstanding 401k loan balance.  My job is likely secure (albeit that may mean nothing if things take a very bad turn) and I have enough in savings to cover the taxes in this worst case scenario.  I don't believe the typical opportunity cost risk of a 401k loan applies to this exact scenario since the money would otherwise be invested in a low yielding safe fund anyway.

What are your thoughts?  Are there any additional risks I am overlooking/misunderstand or better alternative safe investments I have missed?

Additional information that may be relevant:  I am planning to work another 20-30 years before retirement and have no debt outside a small mortgage and the mentioned car loan.  After the rebalance I would still be most heavily weighted in equities since my investment horizon is long - I just think with everything happening at the moment in the world we are likely to have a bear market in the near future and would like to preserve a little extra capital in this event.",finance
personalfinance,Current plan and budget,"Hi I'm doing a check just to make sure that my current financial goals and budget are making sense. Especially since I made them I don't want to fall into a pit where I neglect one area of my life.

Currently:

3K in checking that I use to pay all my bills, I don't spend 3k a month but I like the buffer to make sure I never overdraft my account

$500 in savings because they offered me a higher interest rate for that savings account but only up to $500.

4k in a HYSA

Budget: Not broken down but I have an excel sheet, I net $1986 per month (might get a raise soon), and I spend roughly $1651 a month for an excess of $335 per month.

&amp;#x200B;

Goals: 

Fill my HYSA to 5k for my emergency savings and then ignore it until 2021 when I'll relook at how much I'm making and see if I need to contribute more to it.

I have a 7.6k car loan at a high 8% interest rate (I got it right out of college 1 day before I started my job so I didn't have proof of income). So begin paying that down ASAP and throwing all excess funds at the principal of that. With my job, bonuses, as well as if I get a second job because I'm bored, I hope to have it paid off by 2021.

19k in Student loans, but they're all fed loans that aren't incurring interest so honestly I'm just ignoring those right now as long as I have my car loan. Once they do begin gaining interest I want to refinance those and my car at the same time to have my hard-pulls for my Credit be together.

Once all my loans are done, start a RIRA and start fully funding it every year because off my age next year until im 65 with a I/Y of 6% I have myself retiring with 1million in that account alone so that'll be a nice amount to have saved when the time finally comes.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any recommendations? Also I got my car 1 month and 1 day ago so if you're a bit more familiar than I am with refinancing auto loans and you think I should initiate the process now to decrease that rate, I would love to hear it.",finance
personalfinance,Mortgage consolidation - shorter term or invest monthly savings?,"I am planning to consolidate two home mortgages, my main residence ($185k owed/$550k value/132 months remaining) and one vacation property/rental ($189k owed/$215k value/347 months remaining) to take advantage of equity in my main home and favorable interest rates. In the process I would own my vacation home outright. That part is a no brainer. Although I would increase my term on my main house, I have 29 years left on the vacation home. the math says its a roughly $115k savings on the total loan if I go with a 15 year new mortgage, and still a $5k savings if I went with a 30 year, with a 20 in between. 

I also did a bit of math on investing the savings from my current mortgages and found it to be rather interesting. 

A new 15 year note would net a $199 per month savings on P/I (I'm including eliminating PMI costs on the vaca house). (20 yr = $665/mo, 30 yr = $1165/mo) I have the discipline and ability to set a monthly deposit to my investment account, where I'd buy something reasonable like VFIAX or whatever, which I already do. 

If we assume even a 5% annual return over the next 30 years (comparing apples to apples, and this includes investing all monthly mortgage payment after the term of the loan is up), the return is roughly similar regardless of the loan term (when deducting the full cost of the loan). Somewhere around $400k net. 

But if we assume a higher return 6, 7, 8% (which isn't unreasonable), getting that 30 year mortgage becomes very lucrative (at 8% return, roughly $1m to $600k if I took a 15 year loan). A 4% return instead loses me a potential $150k, but still significantly in the black. 

Thats a lot of scratch. 

I realize there is risk involved in this strategy. But I think long term the risk is mitigated quite a bit, and if we really go into the crapper and an S&amp;P index isn't averaging 5% or even 4% per year, I think we have bigger problems than my mortgage situation. 

I'm 39. 30 years is a reasonable retirement target, and I don't think we're ever going to see rates go significantly below what they are now.

personalfinance,Social security not withheld from certain paychecks,"Throwaway so I can share more details.  I'm a tenured professor at a campus of the California State University system (a state government, W-2 employee).  In addition to my regular salary, I've taught summer and winter courses since 2017, earning tens of thousands of dollars in extra income.  Direct deposits of my summer and winter income paychecks look the same as my regular salary (""PAYROLL ST OF CA""), federal and state taxes are withheld from the paychecks, and each year, I get just one W-2, with the extra summer and winter income and my regular salary all combined in box 1.

Since summer and winter teaching is optional, some withholdings don't apply, such as pension contributions.  However, I've recently realized that social security has never been withheld from these summer and winter paychecks (going all the way back to 2017).  Medicare withholding is there (both employee and employer portions), but no employee or employer social security withholding, unlike my regular salary paychecks, and the extra income is not included in the ""Social Security Income"" figure (box 3) on my W-2, though it is in box 1.

I'm definitely not over the social security tax limit, even with the extra income.  Is there any other reason this income wouldn't be subject to social security withholding?  Am I going to owe thousands of dollars someday when this gets figured out?",finance

The strangeness comes from a weird disconnect, calling spectrum and being told there is no outage in my area shown, so I double check and see that weirdly I can connect again some couple seconds later, but my pinging still brings back a timeout.

My spouse has just started working. We have very modest savings, less than 100k in total. We also have little to no debt. We currently rent however will like to buy a house in next 5 years. 

My spouse is eligible for 401(k) from her employer. The goal of our savings is to plan for retirement and kids higher education. We would prefer an investment option which locks-in our investment and the prime concern is safety of investment. We are both 40 years old today. Here are our questions.


1. Can my spouse start 401(k) account and contribute to her limit of 19.5k fully or is it pro-rated as per number of months you work in a year? I have a 401k account through my employer which I opened 3 years ago,  but I am never able to reach 19.5k in a year. The value of my 401(k) account is roughly 24k. 

2. In today’s environment, with US debt deficit rising, is 401(k) safe investment avenue over next 20-30 years?

3. Should she invest in 401(k) or child’s education investment fund under 529? 

4. If we invest under 529, then what plan or program is recommended? I did some research and found NJBEST offers investment plan for kids higher education but it’s tied to franklin templeton MF. However there are caveats. Here is what it states on their website : NJBEST is offered and administered by the New Jersey Higher Education Student Assistance Authority (HESAA); managed and distributed by Franklin Templeton Distributors, Inc., an affiliate of Franklin Resources, Inc., which operates as Franklin Templeton Investments. No federal or state guarantee. Each plan account is subject to an annual program management fee of 0.10% of assets and underlying fund expenses, currently up to 0.76% of assets, which may vary.

2.)student loans- so currently I have 0 debt (didn’t take any loans out for undergrad), and I have about 75k in cash (was planning on buying some real estate but have since been discouraged by the current market climate) which I could use for grad school...but I really don’t want to. And I also read that student loan payments are deferred until next year, and interest rates are at 0% for some student loans. Would it be a better idea to take out a loan to pay for grad school and stick the cash somewhere where it can make a return while I’m in school?

Stay on current day shift and funds that were going towards down payment now go towards daycare around 1200-1700 monthly based on how many days  (work also has dependent care FSA of 6000. Pros: life/sleep cycle maintained. Cons: lower DP, but if interest rates stay low may not be as big of deal. 

Option 2: switch to wknd night shift to avoid daycare costs and save for full 20% DP. Pros: maintain currents savings rate for DP achieve 20% in 3ish years. Cons: no available wknds, life/sleep cycle goes out the door, may get priced out. 

Option 3: buy house next year no matter savings and still switch to wknd nights to avoid daycare costs and increase discretionary/savings income. Cons: see above. Pros: money I guess

financialindependence,"Our Story (33M/31F): Going from $250k in Student Loans to $250k in Net Worth With Type I Diabetes, Two Kids, and a Saga Across Three States.","## In the Beginning (Post Undergrad Years) (23M/21F)

Our  story begins pretty much the same time as our relationship. I met who would eventually be my wife during our last year in undergrad where we  were both majoring in Molecular Biology. I had switched majors from  Aerospace Engineering but that's a story for another time.

My  wife graduated and began studying for the MCAT a semester before I  finished. She spent some time shadowing doctors and didn't find the ones  she shadowed to be that happy, lessening the appeal of going through  med school. She also feared the debt necessary to fund that education  and so decided she'd be more interested in a medical profession that  provided more opportunity to change specialties so she decided not to  take the exam. Long story short we both entered the labor market in Fall  of 2010.

My first job after  college was as a research embryologist for a small research lab I found  on Craigslist of all places. I had about $23k of debt from undergrad and  started at $15/hr but opted to stay on my parent's medical insurance  which added the equivalent of $1/hr extra. We had access to a 401k with  no matching to which I did **not** contribute. I was able to work up to 1.5 hours of overtime per week and did so as often as I could. **My net worth was -$23k**.

My  wife started as a research assistant with a State University lab making  $31k which included what I know now is a very rare automatic  contribution to a pension to be paid starting at age 65 with a benefit  based on years of service. Fortunately she had taken enough college  level coursework in high school to only need 3 years to obtain her  bachelor's degree and was able to work enough in college to avoid taking  student loans. I wasn't privy to her finances at the time but now know **she had a net worth of about $8k** from savings throughout her life.

We  moved in together shortly after starting these jobs but didn't combine  finances and split all our bills 50/50. I used my remainder after  monthly expenses to attempt to slowly pay down my student loan debt.  Foolishly I would calculate down to the last $50 of my checking account  and kept no emergency fund, a decision which my wife would argue with me  about until I finally decided to keep $500 as my maximum depletion  amount.

We both performed well at  our jobs and after 2 years I had increased my pay to $17/hr and was  still getting $1/hr extra by opting out of health insurance and staying  on my parent's plan. I had managed to get my student loan balance down  to about $10k but was still not contributing to retirement or saving  much of anything.

My wife was  feeling the itch to pursue a career in medicine and had decided that she  would apply for Physician Assistant school due to its greater specialty  flexibility over medical school. However, a prerequisite was direct  patient hours which she was not getting in her job as a research  assistant. She was able to find another opportunity with the University  as a Clinical Research Coordinator which gave not only patient contact  but came with a pay increase to $41k and continued contributions to the  pension plan.

We got engaged  shortly before my wife was accepted into PA school in another state and I  decided I would leave my job in order to move across the country with  her. We decided it might be a good time for me to pursue additional  education as well. I had been taking some courses online in my evenings  on statistics and programming and happened across the field of  bioinformatics. Having always been passionate about computers as a hobby  I saw bioinformatics as a way to combine biology and computer science  and hopefully advance my career outlook. Fortunately I found a master's  degree program that was available 100% remotely and I was accepted to  begin the same semester as my wife started PA school.

When we left our jobs our **combined net worth was about $0** with my $10k in outstanding undergrad loans and my wife's now $10k of savings.

## Back to School and Loading Up on Debt (26M/24F)

My  masters program took 24 months to complete and my wife's took 27. My  wife's program required students not take outside employment to not  interfere with rotations and coursework and I felt overwhelmed enough by  attempting to transition into more computer science heavy coursework  coming from a biology background that neither of us ended up working  during grad school.

I am a Type I  Diabetic (insulin dependent) and we started grad school shortly after  the ACA was passed, meaning I could no longer be denied coverage for my  preexisting condition. I purchased an insurance plan from the market  that covered the diabetes care I would need but had to pay for the  premium and co-insurance from our student loans.

By  the time we were finished we had accumulated $250k in student loans,  interest included. I had one paid internship in the middle of my program  where I earned $6k but otherwise we lived our entire lives on loans.  Most went to tuition, medicine, and rent but we did allow ourselves  occasional eating out, alcohol, and entertainment. We also got married,  and managed to keep the cost under $5k!

## Finishing Grad School, Starting Careers, a Family, and Medical Problems (28M/26F)

Fortunately  my internship finished with a job offer to return after graduation that  I accepted in yet another different state. I started while my wife was  finishing up PA school which caused us to live in different states for 3  months. I started at $72k with a generous benefits package including a  9% 401K match, an HSA with a $2,000 automatic employer contribution, and  health and dental insurance.

My  wife followed a few months later and was able to find a job after about a  month as a PA in a rheumatology practice. It was a contract-to-hire  position where she would either be hired or released after  six months.  Her six month contract was for $40/hr with no retirement benefits but  included medical which she declined as we were both on my work's plan.

We started our new careers with a **combined net worth of about -$240k**.

Happily,  we both found success in our new careers and enjoyed rapid advancement  and raises and as a unit averaged an 8% increase in pay per year over  the next five years. My wife was hired from her contract and got a bump  to $100k and began to receive a 4% retirement match if she contributed  6% of her base salary.

We both  began to take more of an interest in personal finance, but still hadn't  discovered the concept of financial independence. We were very motivated  to pay off our mountain of debt so began to track our expenses  diligently (first with Mint, now with YNAB). We contributed enough to  get our retirement match and everything else left at the end of each  month went towards loans.

Our jobs  are located in a HCOL area so we chose to live in an older apartment  complex our first two years and then transitioned to a town house 3  years ago where we still live. We have been paying $2,000/mo for a 3/2.5  1600sqft unit (not rennovated) which is very close to work so we don't  need to have much of a commute. We could definitely find lower rent  farther from work but it would add 45+ minutes each way.

As  we began to see serious progress on our student loans our interest in  personal finance grew and we discovered the idea of financial  independence. That concept still had to sit on the back burner for a  while since we decided paying off our loans would be a priority until  the remaining loans were at an interest rate &lt; 4.5% which  unfortunately was only about $30k of our total balance.

After  6 months of working our net worth climbed to -$200k. Then -$150k after  12 months. We managed a pace of increasing our net worth through paying  off student loans to the tune of $100k/yr for almost exactly 5 years.

We hit **net worth $0 in August of 2018**  just as our first child was born. 3 weeks before he was born I had to  have a kidney removed due to a genetic condition which caused it to fill  with fluid and swell like a water balloon which destroys its ability to  filter. Fortunately we were already used to having maximum medical  expenses due to my diabetes so the pregnancy and the kidney removal  weren't really much of a factor financially due to hitting our out of  pocket max.

## Present Day (33M/31F)

We finally **paid off our student loans and hit $150k net worth in January of this year (2020)**.  We gave birth to our second child in March of this year just in time to  get home before the pandemic started to really spread. We are both  incredibly fortunate in that we have been able to continue working at  the same jobs and at the same pay as before the pandemic and that  allowed us to reach **$250k net worth**  this month. My Dad retired a few years ago and my Mom was forced into  retirement by the pandemic so we are also incredibly fortunate that they  are willing to watch the kids while we work. We pretty much just  flipped the switch of paying off student loans to contributing for  retirement so have really been enjoying actually getting to keep most of  our money this year instead of shoveling it into loans.

We  certainly experienced a lot of luck in our journey but also a lot of  hard work and made a pretty radical change in our lives that benefited  us immensely. This is now the longest thing I've ever written on Reddit so I should stop rambling here. Thanks for  reading!",finance

personalfinance,$75k Annual Profit From AirBNB - What next?,"My parents build short term rental properties in a very lucrative area (Gatlinburg, TN). They built and kept a few, and have several more to build but they no longer want to keep them. I wanted to keep it within the family moving forward as opposed to selling them, so I worked out a deal with them:

The annual PROFIT from the short term rental is roughly $75k (no need to question my numbers, they have 4 other properties that this math is based on in addition to what has been brought in on the subject property so far). I found a lender willing to do a cash out refi of 75% LTV on a short term rental which is almost impossible to find. Covid screwed everything up and delayed funding for months, but now we’re back on track and I just had this  deal get funded this week. 

I had my parents deed the property to me, then I cashed out on it. After Covid the lender dropped the amount they were willing to lend to $350k which is only about 52% LTV. It appraised for $670k. 

The plan the whole time was whatever the difference between the amount they are selling it to me for ($518k) and the amount I received for the cash out, my parents would carry a 2nd balance for the difference until they were paid in full. After closing costs I wired $332k to them from the cash out. They are selling to me for $518k leaving a $186k balance they are carrying. I am paying them 50% of the monthly profits until they are paid back. The annual profits are roughly $75k, so I am paying them $37,500 for the next 5 years. Coincidentally my pre-payment penalty on the cash out expires after 5 years so I plan to refinance at that point anyways to get out of the 6.6% interest rate on the cash out loan. 

Here’s the kicker. As a “thank you” for one, selling the property to me at a very discounted price and two, carrying a no interest second loan for me, I agreed to pay them an additional year’s worth of 50% profit after the balance is paid in full. So that’s an extra $37,500+$186,000 = $223,500 in total paid. 

My question is, is it smarter for me to take a HELOC against it for another 20% ish of the LTV, pay off my parents then I keep 100% of the profits moving forward? I look at it as I’m paying my parents on average $3,125 each month but if I took out a HELOC then my monthly payment would be $1,750. The loan option I’m looking at now is 10 years $175k at 3.75% with a total amount paid of $210. That’s $13,500 less than what I would pay my parents over the full term. 

Another positive of paying my parents off now is that my parents would have a larger lump sum of cash on hand and they can build the next few properties even faster, and we are going to go with this same plan for 5-6 more properties so I would increase my passive income quicker. By the end of next year this should bring my passive income to roughly $500k. This is passive and I don’t need to touch any of these monthly profits, so I’m sure I need to leave a percentage each month in reserves then transfer the rest to higher interest accounts. 

Am I looking at this correctly? Is it a smart move to borrow more against the property, get them paid off and have my short term cash increase? And also save $13k over the life of the loan? Or just stick with the plan and keep paying them 50% of the profits? Or, is there another option I am not thinking of? TIA",finance

investing,Any views on investing in art through MasterWorks.io,"I came across [Masterworks.io](https://masterworks.io/) recently and delved into it a bit and found their story compelling but I am not sure about a lot of things. All information available online is all their marketing narration. I hope someone here will be able to help me get a better idea about this.

1. What federal regulation does this come under? [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1816604/000149315220015164/form253g2.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1816604/000149315220015164/form253g2.htm). The link is a circular for a painting as a sample. Looks like, they set up an LLC for each painting and issue shares for the appraised value. Is it legal to collect money from the public and not be traded on a stock exchange? What are safeguards?
2. How can I verify their appraisal process? How reliable and conflict-free is it? Any idea is welcomed. They said that they get the majority of their appraisals from the Winston art group. I read a lot online that appraisals can sometimes be sketchy.
3. Their charges are a bomb. 20% cut in profits after 1.5% charge every year... take a look at a sheet I put up together for calculation of returns. I am not sure if I got everything included in it. Could you take a look? They take a big chunk obviously. But historical data shows **some** extraordinary returns on the art.

They have about 180.000,00 in Euro, in a bank account in Turkey. They are living in Turkey, and don't know where and how to invest. They will never spend the money themselves, since they are just not that kinda people. We managed to convince my parents to buy a house on the coast of Turkey, so that they can enjoy their remaining years on this planet. The money is currently sitting in one of the Turkish banks, don't know which one, at annual interest rate of 2%.

We(6) want them to spend their money to make their life as easy as possible. Sadly they are trying to spend as little as possible, all the time, they want to give us the money after their death. Where can they invest the money, so we as the children can get the most out of the money? We are 6 siblings, so we will all split it equally according to my parents.

But I don't think I could invest my part in Germany and get the same amount as if my parents invest it with the full amount.

Bitcoin,Hmmm🤔🤔,"Bitcoin ‘Whale Clusters’ Show $14K as Pivotal for BTC Price Bull Run
 
David Puell, an on-chain analyst, laid out several key data points on Aug. 16 based on the past 4-year cycle of #Bitcoin (BTC). Data show that the $14,000 level is a crucial price point for Bitcoin due to whale clusters.
 
According to Puell, whale clusters show many large buyers bought in the $9,000 to $12,000 range. Whales that bought at $9,000 are seeing relatively high profits, and those that bought the top are at a breakeven point.
 
The clusters could result in a volatile price action where buyers and sellers aggressively try to break out from the $12,000 to $14,000 price range.
 
So is a correction more likely or continuation of the Bitcoin rally?
The data support arguments for both a pullback and a continuation. If whales bought at $9,000 and $12,000, they have a compelling reason to take profit in the $12,000 to $14,000 range. They have seen some profits and/or are at breakeven after months of stagnation.
 
On the flip side, if the whales are in profit and are at breakeven, they might want to see the rally continue. Puell said that he expects an accumulation phase to occur in the $10,000 region following #BTC’s move to $12,000 or $14,000. He said:
 
“Finally, unspent whale clusters confirm a great battle taking place. Two actors at play: top buyers at 12k-14k reaching their breakeven price, and current buyers active after the first higher high in over a year. If we get a correction, it will most likely result in another major cluster of re-accumulation at the 10k area (as expected from the volume profile before); if we breakout, well... enjoy the ride.”
 
The current landscape of the Bitcoin market is unique when compared with previous cycles. Puell said that due to macro factors, including the pandemic, Bitcoin saw unprecedented price movements.
 
For instance, on March 13, the price of Bitcoin dropped to as low as $3,596 on BitMEX in a 50% drop overnight. The unusual price movements Bitcoin saw throughout 2020 as a result of unexpected external variables increase the chances of an uncommon price cycle. Puell explained:
 
“Looking only a year and a half back, we had some of the most interesting market structures in any Bitcoin cycle. During several attempts at a ‘typical’ bullish trend with a strong halving narrative, two swans hit price discovery one after the other: PlusToken and COVID-19.”
 
Some variables to consider
In the short to medium-term, there are several variables that could have an impact on the price trend of Bitcoin.
 
In recent months, Bitcoin saw some correlation with gold, possibly due to the uncertainty in global markets causing investors to consider alternative stores of value. The low-interest rate policies by central banks across the world and the rapidly growing money supply will likely have a positive effect on Bitcoin price as well, many analysts believe.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,I owe $725 in state taxes for 2019 and I have no idea why.,"I live in Wisconsin.

personalfinance,"Capital Gains, Estimated Taxes, and Penalties","Hi all,

I had a question I was hoping somebody could clarify for me with regard to underpayment penalties.  I generally receive a refund each year as my withholdings exceed my tax owed, but this year I have sold a large amount of stock that I've held for quite some time, and my total capital gains are significant.

My question is around whether or not I need to pay quarterly estimated tax on these or whether I can just wait until April.  I know that ""technically"" I need to pay the tax now as it is due, but as I understand it, if my federal income tax withholding plus any estimated taxes paid on time equal at least 110% of my total tax from the previous year, I'm covered.

So if I understand correctly, even if I made something ridiculous like $100 million in capital gains, as long as my withholdings are sufficient (and maybe send a little extra in an estimated payment to be sure I'm over that 110% of last year's tax burden) I can hold onto the capital between now and next April and not be penalized or owe any extra?

vet,What happened to my kitten?,"I got my kitten 3 weeks ago. She was healthy and thriving so well, such an active little kitty. She suddenly took very ill and I feel helpless knowing I don’t have a explanation as to what happened. It started 2-3 days before it happened. Day 1 she was still her usual self playing etc but I noticed she hadnt ate as much ( she normally goes through around 2 packets a day and that day she didn’t finish her first packet. I didn’t think about it too much but the next day she wasn’t playing and was just sleeping a lot, drinking lots of water and still barely eating. The next day is where I was very worried as I woke up to see she had pooper on the carpet and my bed, very out of the ordinary as she has always used her litter tray, so I cleaned her tray putting it down to maybe it was just not clean enough for her liking ( even though there was only pee in it) As the day went on I could tell something was really wrong with her. She was lethargic and barely moving, I then noticed her gums and paws had went very pale. I started to panic and realised her vets and no others locally were open as it was a Sunday she then started to screech in pain and I stupidly thought giving her some of her worming medication would help as I thought it could be worms causing her distress. After giving her the liquid 5 minutes later she lay on the couch flailing around and screaming, in the process she pooped herself. She then rolled over and stopped breathing. I am so heartbroken thinking I could of possible saved her had I of just taken her to the vet. When I noticed her being odd.  Does anyone have any sort of explanation as to what happened.
She was 3 months when I got her and was 4 months when she passed. When we got her she hadn’t been wormed or had any vaccinations but we got her the vaccinations around a week and a few days after having her. She was only 990 grams which was pretty underweight but the vet explained she could just be a small kitten as she seemed very healthy. Could worms of killed her? We couldn’t see any in her feces? Could it of been her kidneys? Her heart? Was it the edge of the raw burger I fed her? I wish I had an explanation of some sort as I keep tormenting myself with questions. Can anyone help?

personalfinance,Post Grad School Loan Strategy,"Hi there!

I'm at 25 year old grad student that will be wrapping up my full-time master's program this December with $46k (at an interest rate of 6.08%) in debt, in addition to $11.5k remaining on my car loan at an interest rate of 1.99%. I don't have any credit card debt as I pretty much pay that off immediately. I pretty much depleted my existing savings to move to school and pay for various things throughout the year since I was not making a salary (rent, school supplies, and other living expenses).

I'm very thankful that I started working as a full time remote project manager a few weeks ago (after taxes, taking home around $6k per month), and given that I have this opportunity to get a head start on aggressively paying off some loans while they are in deferment (and not accruing interest due to COVID), I was thinking that might be the way to go, although I was hoping to get some advice from this community on it.

My plan was to pay around $2-3k per month on my student loans and double my car payments (which are usually $424/month), and once I'm done paying off my car, begin to put the money that would've been spent on car payments per month into savings.

**To summarize:**

*Loans*

1. Student Loans - $46k (at 6.08% interest)
2. Car loan - $11.5k (at 1.99% interest)

*Income* \- $6k per month (after taxes)

*Savings* \- Virtually zero (besides \~7k in my 401k)

They also said we couldn't get a better rate unless we borrow over $100k. An equity loan for $20,000/ 5 years would be at 6%.  Our current payment is $735.00 ($120 principal, $184 interest, and $431 escrow)  We are also paying $450 extra on principal on top of that each month.  

Which would make the most sense- Refi at $72k/3.5-3.75% for 15 years or take out the equity loan?  What about borrowing $100k to get a better interest rate and then pay back $30k immediately?

personalfinance,Should my mother file for bankruptcy or let the debt go unpaid?,"I am trying to help my mom get back on her feet. She has been in a bad place for the last 15 years (drug addiction). Over the past three years she finally got clean and has a decent paying job of 60k. She’s made some horrible decisions. 


Her debt:
1. various medical debt from 2018 - $45-50k
2. Federal Student loans - $45k 
3. Auto loan - $25k
4. Treasury debt - 12k
5. Private mortgage - 15k


Assets:
1. House I sold her- worth roughly 70k
2. Car - upside down. It’s worth like 15-19k


Additional info: 
1. House- I gave her the house but she wanted to borrow money to fix it. I set it as a mortgage and went through the proper channels. I have no problem foreclosing to protect the asset and giving it back later.
2. The home is a manufactured home that’s old so no mortgages can be taken out on it to get money to pay the debt. Ideally she would be selling it next year to try and pay off the students loans and give her enough cash for a down payment on something a little less shitty (this thing is just getting old and maintenance is hard. 
3. She has a lot of bills that eat her salary up. Such as $700 a month to treasury, $600 for the car. $450 for the mortgage. The bills on the home are crazy high like $500 electric due to window unit AC in florida. And she’s aggressively putting money away since she is 50 and has bad health issues so she absolutely will need money to get her through. She also has a lot of prior court debt- this cannot be missed since she would lose her license and job. She pays roughly $800 and will be for three more years.
4. I don’t mind giving her 10k and wiping the debt she owes me out. But frankly I’ve spent tens of thousands on her over the last 6 years and I just can’t keep pumping money into it. 
5. She cannot live with me. While she is changing we are toxic and I cannot put myself through that again. 
6. If we go bankruptcy I will pay her legal fees. 


Things I am considering: 
1. She won’t get rid of the student loans in bankruptcy. 
2. The car debt she would need to reaffirm. It was stupid to buy the vehicle - I agree but she needed reliable transportation and it was the only place to give her a loan that wasn’t a sketchy buy here pay here. 
3. The medical debt is two years old. I believe the statute of limitations is 5 years in Florida. I am thinking it would be best to wait until it hits the statute of limitations and never pay it. 



Plan 1 (my fav idea):
1. Sells the home for 80k. 
2. Pay off the student loans leaving 30k (minus the mortgage). 
3. I return the mortgage balance to her. 
4. Pays off the car and keeps remainder in savings. 
5. Allows medical debt to sit. She has no assets so at most they sue for wage garnishment. 
6. Gets an apartment which would be less than her current bills + mortgage. 
7. Saves money and in like 3 years she can buy a house. 
8. credit would be bad because of the medical debt but not horrible. At most it’ll be 5 more years. 


Plan 2: 
1. I foreclose on the house. 
2. Files bankruptcy and loses the medical debt. 
3. Gets on a payment plan for the student loans with the thought that she won’t pay them off in 20 years and they get discharged. 
4. I sell the home for 80k and hold onto the money for her (she trusts me because I have a significant amount of money so 80k is not a whole lot for me)
5. She reaffirms the car loan debt or hopefully gets a better loan term in the bankruptcy.

5. A joint checking account we use for mystery shopping. All mystery shopping payments are moved here.  When we finish a mystery shopping route for profit and loss we take 20% of that and put it aside for taxes.  We then take 33% of the profit and divide between gf's personal account, my personal account, and a savings account that is set up for saving this money.
6. A business account with Huntington to receive all of our online sales related payments.   When we make inventory purchases we will use the best credit card for the job, and then transfer the funds from Huntington to pay the bill off immediately.

For income we have Airbnb's that we run and have been doing for 8 years.  
We both do mystery shop routes together.  Ive been making a spreadsheet for each of these and tracking everything we spend and what the payments are and as of two last month we are now paying ourselves immediately out of the mystery shopping fund, and when the payments actually come through in 45 to 60 days it all goes into the mystery shopping bucket.    


We sell online via Amazon, Ebay, Etsy, and direct sales.    


  
We have paid off all of our credit cards and have zero personal debt at present time.  


  
How would some of you savvy people set things up?  


The problems we were having before is we were actually funding these mystery shopping trips on credit cards and paying them off when we got our shopper payments 1-2 months later.  This added extra interest + having to try and figure out how much we paid for interest for the shops made it clunky, confusing, and simply put we weren't tracking or recording shit.    


We saved up enough and created a ""mystery shopping bucket"" where we dumped 2500 in and when we do a route we spend out of their for our expenses, but then we also pay ourselves immediately for completed work.  When the payment actually comes in, then we take out the taxes and savings portion and the rest stays in the bucket for our next route we do.    


  
Airbnb i currently have all going into Paypal and we get paid $20 an hour for any airbnb related work that we do, but the rest sits in paypal.  This amount grows as we take in more than we are spending, but i haven't paid it out to anyone yet.   I'm not sure if I should do it like once a year as a percent of what''s left in there, or just leave it, or maybe pay us more.  I just dont know.  Open to ideas.  


Most our online business is done via Paypal or sent to our Huntington business account.  I also use some credit cards to buy inventory if I know we'll flip it in under a month.  If I have the funds in there at the time we buy inventory, i pay the card off right away, if not I pay it off as things sell and amazon pays us (every 2 weeks).  


  
THoughts?  Questions?  Ideas?  I'm tired of not having things organized.  I want to be able to prove our income and qualify for a house in the next 1-2 years, and more is I want to make sure we're paying what we need for taxes and social security.    


We're also currently sending 10-15% of every booking on Airbnb automatically to a Schwab investment account.    


Is there anything we're doing right?  Anything thats totally wrong?  This is big gaping hole in my education and I just feel like a fish out of water ;(

I am getting a home for 552k from DR horton in Phoenix, doing a down payment of 10% and going for mortgage loan. both me and my wife will be loan applicants, my credit score is 810 and hers 780. Questions are 

1)Should I go for 15 year or 30 year mortgage tenure. We will be putting down 60k back to principle each year and close it faster.

2) DR horton mortage team was offering 2.35 interest rate and 6k incentive towards down payment for 500k loan. Would it be better to go with them or makes sense to shop around.

3) First time home buyer here, should I go with renters insurance with mortgage agency itself or get it outside, right now I have statefarm for my apartment that I am currently renting.

4) Home will be handed to me in another 9 weeks, right now dry walls are up..should I do and take any precautions.

personalfinance,Can someone ELI5 why such a small number (mortgage interest rate) ends up contributing to a huge total cost for the loan?,"I feel like when a lot of my friends talk about buying a house, their main argument is pretty much always this idea that renting is just ""throwing money away"".

I was first very put off by this statement initially because it seemed like such an oversimplification and it seemed silly just to throw the idea of renting out the window and that buying a house was ALWAYS the smartest move, but I understand where they are coming from.

&amp;#x200B;

I looked more into this argument and one counterargument that comes up a lot is that when you purchase a house with a mortgage you are still ""renting the money"" and you end up spending a lot of money on interest payments, property taxes, insurance, maintenance, etc..

&amp;#x200B;

I dove a little deeper into this and found an amortization table:  [https://www.unison.com/article/how-much-interest-to-pay-on-mortgage#:\~:text=For%20example%2C%20if%20you%20borrow,%24350.68%20going%20to%20the%20principle.](https://www.unison.com/article/how-much-interest-to-pay-on-mortgage#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20if%20you%20borrow,%24350.68%20going%20to%20the%20principle.)

(Here's the link in case the formatting is weird)

&amp;#x200B;

What I am confused about with is how does such a small number like 3 or 4% end up contributing to you paying almost 50% extra of what you initially borrowed? Does the interest accrue yearly and it constantly builds on it self the same way an expense ratio or returns on a stocks do through compound interest?

I get that you pay a lot of interest up front early on in the term of the mortgage, but I'm just having trouble wrapping my head around the fact that a small number like 4% can make you pay so much in interest over the life of the loan.

And isn't this just as an egregious example of throwing money away as ""throwing money away on rent""??

By this logic, If you bought a house for 200k, you are betting that the house will appreciate to at least 343k to even break even on what you have paid!

personalfinance,Credit score dropped 50 pts! Did I screw us over for a refinance?,"We are planning to refinance our house this month to take advantage of low interest rates.  We can go from 4.25 to 2.8 by taking advantage of a special program at the credit union, which will save us some serious money over the life of the loan, but we need excellent credit.  My score has always been high (\~815) and in the past 6 months by spending less due to working from home, I saved up enough to pay off my student loans in early June. These were small (\~$2k) and they weren't my oldest account, so my score dropped a bit in July from 820 to 815 according to Transunion. 

I had a large medical expense ($7k) in July, which I had to put on a credit card, as that was the only method of payment accepted. I knew this was coming and had saved my portion of the expense as insurance will reimburse 80% of this, thankfully.  I pulled the $7k out of my savings and paid it off, though in the time from when my card was charged and when I paid, the month rolled. I realize this isn't an excuse for bad financial management, but I was recovering and more concerned about biopsy results so I lost track of time. (Once insurance sends me a check, I'm reimbursing my savings account. Biopsy was good too!)  I'm assuming this is what dropped my score, as I was suddenly utilizing 70% of my credit on that card and \~10% overall as compared to \~1-2% monthly. 

My score is now \~770, which really freaked me out.  We need excellent credit scores (which google says is over 800) to qualify for the 2.8 APR.  How long do I need to wait for my score to go back up?   Would the credit union understand that this was a one time expense?",finance

This year, 2020, my federal checks from 4/15 and 6/15 have not been cashed yet. I sent them in on about 4/10 and 6/10. State checks that went in a different envelope to a different address have been cashed.

So, I called my accountant in July. They said it was happening to other people too, and they thought the checks were all piling up in a mail room because the Feds were understaffed. (Like, What?!?) And that if I had the cash available, to go online and pre-pay my September and January taxes so they would count for my April / June payments. Yeah, I hear you - Feds have a funny definition of the 3 months it takes to make a quarter. Because otherwise I might be blamed for being late.

So I went online and paid. So now I am also having to sit here with the full value of two quarters checks in my bank account, just in case they buy a new sorting machine and find my checks (I hear USPS are selling them on).

personalfinance,Thoughts investing for retirement @ 28years old vs paying off student loans?,"Just finished grad school and started with a company paying 135k/year. I am almost 28 years old, single and living with my parents still. I have about 151k loans at \~6.5% interest.

Also, after a year of working, I was planning to only contribute up to the match % for the 401k until I paid off 100% of my loans. 

Due to the pandemic, my federal loan interest is set to 0% until Dec 31 2020. I've been using a good amount of my paychecks to invest in Robinhood to gain as much money as I can before the 0% ends. Then at the last second, pull everything out and hit my loans hard to reduce the principal as much as possible.

Bitcoin,Famed Jim Rogers warns that money-printing and exorbitant debt will make the next market meltdown 'the worst in my lifetime',"Paywall : [https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-crash-jim-rogers-warns-exorbitant-debt-central-banks-2020-8](https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-crash-jim-rogers-warns-exorbitant-debt-central-banks-2020-8)

**'We are going to pay the price': Famed investor Jim Rogers sounds the alarm on central bank money-printing and exorbitant debt — and warns the next market meltdown will be 'the worst in my lifetime'**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vz4k1wrixhh51.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=581799c91aefe0440481984f7c13586fe3639a20

&amp;#x200B;

Jim Rogers, the chairman of Rogers Holdings, thinks unprecedented amounts of debt will exacerbate the next economic downturn. 

Rogers points the finger at global central bank policy as the cause for his concern.

Rogers is joined in his view by David Hunter, the chief macro strategist at Contrarian Macro Advisors, who expects an 80% decline in stocks.

When the market started to unwind back in late February, the Federal Reserve battened down the hatches and threw just about everything they possibly could at the problem in response. 

As a refresher, here's some of what the Federal Reserve has been up to since the crisis shuttered huge swaths of the US economy:

&amp;#x200B;

Cut interest rates to zero

Announced unlimited quantitative easing

Started purchasing corporate bonds 

Announced an initiative to buy state and local bonds

The market response? A violent rally.

&amp;#x200B;

Since bottoming out on March 23, the S&amp;P 500 is now trading about 50% higher.

&amp;#x200B;

And the US central bank — and others around the world, for that matter — are showing no signs of slowing down anytime soon. 

&amp;#x200B;

But Jim Rogers, the chairman of Rogers Holdings, thinks the repercussions stemming from these actions will be severe. 

&amp;#x200B;

""The next time we have a problem and we are having it now, it is going to be the worst in my lifetime,"" he said in an Economic Times interview.

&amp;#x200B;

""It is a simple statement. The debt is much, much, much higher now. It has to be worse.""

&amp;#x200B;

To Rogers, the US — as well as countries around the world — are enacting short-term solutions in response to the pandemic that will result in long-term pain. Although central bank policies have been successful in propping up financial markets thus far, Roger's sees a bleak future.

&amp;#x200B;

""Nearly every country in the world is printing and spending lots of money now and that money has to go somewhere. It is going into the markets and that is what has happened,"" he said. ""However, the debt is going through the roof everywhere, the money printing is everywhere and eventually, we are going to pay the price.""

&amp;#x200B;

Roger's assessment of the current landscape is similar to that of David Hunter, the chief macro strategist at Contrarian Macro Advisors, who expects an 80% decline in stocks when investor exuberance from central bank stimulus finally wears off. Hunter cites ""debt beyond anything we can ever manage,"" aiding and culminating in a subsequent ""bear market of historic proportions."" 

&amp;#x200B;

""There's a lot of things you can't reach with money, and a lot of things you can't fix,"" Hunter added.

&amp;#x200B;

Rogers agrees.

&amp;#x200B;

""The US market has been going up for over 10 years, the longest in American history and it was sort of a bubble there, waiting to end,"" Rogers said. ""Everything was going straight up for a while because of all the money printing and the market was due for a correction or for something to happen and along came the virus, but something always comes along.""

&amp;#x200B;

gaming,The COD 2020 reveal is a terribly executed ARG.,"Got auto removed form the actual COD 2020 sub so I'll drop this here instead.

I have no problems with ARGs (ARG stands for augmented reality game, just to avoid confusion).

I loved Treyarch's cold war conspiracy theory approach to the original Black Ops and have always enjoyed the mysteries they hid within their games.

The problem with this is for me that there is no tangible reward at the end of each day, no real reveals in the bunkers, the hints to the setting in the videos are interesting but that's about it. It's just a bunch of ciphers and and pieces of paper in a shack in warzone that is solved in a few hours then a wait. There are no hints towards gameplay, returning characters, deviations from real history, or really anything interesting outside of old TV clips.

I'm glad some people can enjoy this and are getting excited but it just seems like a relatively lazy ARG that was put together primarily for content creators to attempt to drive hype. The content creators were sent the boxes and the projectors, it all started with them and has been disconnected from the community from the start. The average person does not want to solve ciphers and drop into warzone where half the lobby is in the tiny shack trying to do the same thing. Doing it for yourself does not change the experience from watching someone else do it because it is so disconnected. This feels like Astroturfed marketing campaign trying to be sold as some mysterious cool ARG when it isnt. The leaks for sure don't help but this isn't annoying because of the leaks, it is annoying because we realistically are learning jack shit each day and the cold war era setting would have been easy to nail down from the first day of video clips and hints in warzone prior.

agree or disagree I want to hear it all, always like healthy debate, but actually read the post first and don't come in here saying ""ur impatient"" or ""ur immature"" because there is a reason people have problems with this.

TL:DR

The leaks didn't ruin it, it is a lazy ARG that tells us everything we need to know without solving it and is really only relevant for content creators and their dedicated fanbases to participate in the ""hunt"" for nothing each day.",technology

economy,Inflation can't go up in the US,"There is no way inflation can go up. People are poor.They have no money, so there is no way demand is going to cause inflation. There are also no market forces causing raw material prices to go up for the most part. And wages certainly aren't going up. So costs aren't going to push inflation. 

Sure the Fed is pumping money into the economy, but none of that money is going to poor/average people. It is going to rich people, who have nothing real to invest it in, because people are poor, so investing money in making anything new is silly because there is no more money to get from people. So the rich just invest their money in stocks. And so stocks keep going up, because rich people have nothing else to do with their money. And so we are stuck in a cycle. The government feeds money into the economy. The rich siphon off just enough to actually put into the economy to keep poor/average people treading water. And they put the rest in the stock market to make their existing money worth even more. 

So their won't be inflation. Material costs aren't rising, wages aren't going up, and the average person has no money to spend.",finance

stocks,If you think the stock market is overvalued,"Many people here on the forums are probably scratching their head on why the market keeps going up. Let me clue you in. It's not really a matter of fundamentals so much at this point in the cycle as it is fear. There is massive risk of inflation right now, hence gold prices and other asset prices. Back in 1980 inflation was at pretty insane levels and they ended up having to raise interest rates to around 20% to reduce inflation. We are nowhere near those levels of inflation currently but could head there, so keep an open mind.

With all of that being said, I would look for companies to buy that would be a hedge against inflation. Not necessarily companies that have already skyrocketed, but maybe companies with a more sound business model that have stood the test of time like Intel, Cisco, JPM,  WMT, BRK.B,  or even gold and silver companies with good balance sheets, lower price to earnings ratios, and other nice metrics. 

The Federal reserve printed around 3 trillion dollars and their balance sheet is at all time highs. This money will eventually circulate among us and continue devaluing the dollar and boosting asset prices until the federal reserve reverses interest rates and puts the rates on an uptrend.

Newmont Corporation is still undervalued within the gold mining space. It is the biggest gold mining company in the world with a market cap of close to $54 B and a PE ratio of 13.91.

My partner has a house which we live in and an apartment which we have as an investment. Both properties have offset accounts For several years now we have lived in the house and have put money into the investment property offset because the interest rate is higher. This is as we lacked experience and knowledge in this area. We now know that interest incurred from an investment property can be used to lower your taxable income.

Now that it has come to our time to do our taxes she wants to claim the interest for the investment property as tax deductible although the money has been in the wrong offset account at the primary place of residence. It is our understanding that although we did not pay interest, we would have been entitled to offset the apartment had we placed our savings in the right offset account. During taxes this year, we would be seeking to deduct from my partner's income the amount that we have paid in interest on our house which is at a lower rate than if the money was offset against the apartment. If we can't do this we will make a big loss approximately $4,500 :(

My property appears to be valued somewhere between $178,000 and $188,000 ($10,000 to $20,000 in appreciation), which will be confirmed if I go through with the appraisal. 

Assuming the worst case appreciation of $10,000 to $178,000, here’s what my new numbers would look like:

New Duration: 30 years    
New Interest rate: 3.375%    
New Principal and Interest: $721    
New PMI: $55    
New Taxes and Insurance: $421    
New total monthly payment: $1,197    

I would plan to pay the same amount I am paying now ($1,400/month - I’m rounding up currently for payments). 

I have ~$16k in savings and thinking about options to get rid of PMI. However I’m not keen on depleting my savings in the current economic climate. I am also considering the upfront single premium on the PMI so when I hit 20% early, I don’t have to worry about fighting with the lender to get PMI removed. 

Costs associated with refinancing:    
Underwriters fee: $895    
Appraisal fee: $495    
Escrow: $0 (doing a escrow holdback as i would be refinancing with the same company)    
Title work: TBD    
PMI single premium: TBD    

Please let me know your thoughts if this is a reasonable option to consider.

investing,"FRBNY: US Economy in a Snapshot, August 2020","* **Consumer spending continued to rebound in June**. Spending on goods is back to its February level, but services expenditures are still significantly below their February level. Nominal personal income fell as the economic impact payments authorized under the CARES Act of 2020 declined in the month. Consumer confidence fell in July.


* **Real business equipment spending plunged in 2020Q2**, reflecting the disruption linked to the COVID-19 pandemic. New orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods ex-aircraft rebounded further in June.


* **Housing activity continued to recover in June**. Single-family housing starts as well as new and existing home sales rose, but uncertainty about the future outlook is high amid significant COVID-19 outbreaks in many states.


* **Payroll employment increased at a slower pace in July**. The unemployment rate fell, mainly due to a decline in temporary layoffs. The labor force participation rate was essentially unchanged and the employment-to-population ratio increased moderately; both were still low. The recent rise in permanent job losers came to a halt.


* **Core PCE inflation remained well below the FOMC’s longer-run objective**.


* **U.S. equity indices rose over the last month**. Implied volatility decreased. The nominal 10-year Treasury yield remained low. The market-implied expected policy rate path was little changed. The broad trade-weighted dollar index declined. Oil prices rose modestly.

personalfinance,Payoff Reconsolidation Loan,"I've read up a lot on this and have been tempted for years to do a reconsolidation type loan to get some pretty gnarly card balances to a lower interest rate.  I recently got a decent raise at work and have been able to stop using my credit cards altogether for over 4 months now.  Unfortunately the interest rates are 18% and 22% APR respectively on about 17k in debt.  I finally received an offer from Payoff that looked attractive.  Full repayment of the card debt, 12% APR, and no early repayment fees.  I've read great reviews about the company and working with them thus far has been a breeze.  


However I have read some pretty discouraging stories on reddit about using this type of loan.  I combed through the stories and paperwork with the loan and don't see any red flags for my personal situation.  I have been paying my cards down and not adding to the balance, I just want to increase my score and decrease interest payments as my wife and I are hoping to buy a house in the next few years.  An additional credit line along with 0% card utilization sounds like the best route for us to fix this situation.  I also don't want to close the accounts altogether because like it or not, sometimes life events come up where a decent chunk of money is needed and my savings just hasn't been what it should be due to making large card payments every month.  


My plan is to make the same payments I was making on my cards towards the Payoff loan so we can pay it down faster than needed, start saving the difference in my salary from the raise, and keep my cards in a drawer for emergencies.  I didn't apply for any of these reconsolidations before because the rates were as bad or worse than my card interest rates until recently.  


Are there any holes in my plan I'm missing?  I understand I could've done a payoff plan with my card companies but like I said, I have no intention of closing the accounts.  I'm in a much much better financial situation now than when I racked up this debt.  (9 month vacation, totally worth it, moved 5 times in 4 years o.0)",finance
personalfinance,Investing with Roth IRA,"Hello everyone,

I have been a long-time lurker here, really learned a lot about personal finance by constantly reading various threads here.

So anyways, I have quite a bit saved up currently (I am quite lucky to still be employed during coronavirus and costs are down), and I am ready to put this money into a Roth IRA where it can grow (currently sitting in CIT online savings bank so not losing money).

My main question is: Should I wait until the market goes down a bit to invest the 6k (max contribution) in a Roth IRA? The market has been doing really well lately, so not sure if I should wait until it dips to buy in. Would you guys recommend putting it in as soon as possible so it can begin growing? I plan to use Vanguard due to their low fees.

Base Salary: $120,000

RSU (Stock): $21,000 per/year

Sign On : $40,000

Along with this package, I am currently contributing 6% to my 401k with a 3% match as well as contributing (maxed out) \~10% of my income to purchasing stock with my company at a discount (benefit given to employees). Outside of work, I have about $18,000 saved in various ETFs, and an LLC that I get payouts of about \~$1,000-2,000 per month. Also, my credit score is 756 (I have had a custodial CC since 15, highly recommend it to parents with young kids to build credit).

With all this being said, as I look at my long term investments I feel very stable, mostly due to the stock purchasing and the 401k matching. With the capital coming in from the sign on, and my saved money, I was thinking about potentially investing in real-estate. Is this a wise choice? I feel that at 21 years old, it might be a lot to take on, but with a solid investment portfolio from work, it seems like a great option for me and my future family to build wealth. All of this, along with my credit score, falling prices, and low interest rates.

personalfinance,Should I use the PSLF program? Pros &amp; Cons,"Hello all,

Debating on whether not I should use the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program or not. For context, I am a single 28 yo and a recent physician assistant graduate with undergrad and grad loans totaling \~$174k. Recently accepted a new job at a nonprofit hospital paying \~$100k/year. My discretionary income after taxes, insurance, health &amp; dental, 401k, rent, groceries, etc. is about $3500, but will likely increase over the years. I'm trying to weigh the pros and cons of both scenarios.

Scenario 1: PSLF  
According  to the federal aid website, I would pay about $648-$767/month over the course of 10 years with a total of $84,700 paid and $91,300 forgiven.

* Pro: Over half of loans forgiven, lowest amount paid to loans overall. Can save for home, retirement, car, vacations, etc.
* Con: A chunk of my income is unavailable for 10 years.

Scenario 2: Pay off loans myself  
I  have a credit score of \~750 and can get a good interest rate on  refinancing. I recently got a quote with these details: 5-year term with 3.70% interest paying \~$3150/month or 7-year  term with 3.73% interest paying \~$2350/month (I feel like in this case, only the 5-year would be worth it)

* Pro: I could be student loan-free in 5 or 7 years as opposed to 10 years with PSLF.
* Con: I pay the full \~$174k in loans myself. Nearly all of my discretionary income is unavailable for 5-7 years and can't really do adult life things like save for home, retirement, care, vacations, etc.

I've mulled over both options trying to weigh the pros and cons. I'm still relatively young and believe I can handle putting off saving for a home, contributing more to retirement, buying a new car, etc. until I'm in my  early-mid 30s, but not sure if I have to if I can get PSLF and do that  stuff now.

stocks,Why traditional P/E ratio doesn't make sense any more and what it means for you.,"1. **Investing has never been easier**: With IOT, RH, Reddit etc, information is on everyone's fingerprints. It's  never been easier to pick growth stocks. Compare this to the past (15-20yrs) back when probably you needed to walk into an office to invest. Getting access to fundamentals of a company was tough and it felt intimidating to ask noobish questions about investing/stocks. Whether its investing or seeing help, things have never been more easier making it more accessible for first time investors.
2. **International investors**: Everyone ones part of the American Pie. Thanks to IOT. folks from every corner of the planet are investing in the US market for the first time in droves. And we are just getting started.
3. **Fed print money like crazy**: US is printing money like no tomorrow. The only hedge against inflation is real estate, stocks in growth companies which you know will not go bankrupt and Gold/Silver. SO its not surprising that even with record unemployment all 3 are going up.

What this means is there is new money entering the market every day. Even if a correction/crash were to occur, its bound to be a V shaped crash since there is literally nowhere else to park money other than  - Real Estate (need huge capital and difficult), Stocks (needs less capital and easy) and precious metals (which is why Gold/Silver stocks are going up). So in short, **you cannot use a traditional P/E to determine if a company is undervalued or overvalued**.

So there is literally only one thing which you can do .... stop worrying about the crash and invest/continue to invest. If you wait for a crash you will just end up paying a lot more, for the stock you are eyeing, down the road.

investing,"Why gold is still cheap, and why $4k is entirely reasonable.","[https://imgur.com/a/vMG87lu](https://imgur.com/a/vMG87lu)

Money represents a claim to, among other things, gold. Therefore, if we are to analyse if gold is expensive/cheap, is must be done in the context of how much money is out there, as this represents the capacity for people to acquire it. This “capacity”, can be judged by the money stock, in this case, M2 money.

By doing this, we can begin to understand a “fair” value of gold. This is especially important in an environment of Fed money-printing. So, for example, although gold has risen in $-terms, it has actually not risen relative to the money supply, as Fed printing has expended the money supply in proportion. Therefore, gold has actually failed to have a meaningful rally and remains at a similar valuation, in real terms, to the last three years. **Gold remains cheap!**

Therefore, I have used historical precedents, such as that in 2011, to determine that a ratio of 0.2 is entirely possible. This would lead to a $-price of \~$4,000.

**Tldr: gold is still cheap because the fed has printed so much cash.**",finance

solar,Tesla Solar Layout Question/Opinion,"Hi All,

So I've gone down the path for Tesla Solar, and had them put together a 4.7kW, 14 panel system with an estimated annual production of 5274kWh. They went outside of the cookie-cutter options to meet my production needs so I was happy to see that flexibility. The project output seems reasonable PVWatts project 6316 kWh annually so I'm thinking they may be low-balling it to be safe but thats okay with me, it still meets my needs.

My question is in regards to the layout. It's symmetrical which looks good, but is there any issue yoy foresee with the panel placement? I don't know much about it but figured I would ask the smartest solar people around for some advice. I am in South Jersey with no trees to worry about.

Everything else looks pretty good, I just need to get them to remove the TREC purchase agreement and I'd be ready to move forward if all looks good.

Thank you in advance!

Additional Info: Everyone gives the Tesla Energy Credit Buyout a bed-rap but am I missing something? It seems like a pretty fair offer actually considering the time value of money but I feel like I might be missing something. 

My System Cost is $9,566.67 (26% tax credit is $2487.33)

Tesla's TREC purchase price is $3427.20 (reduces the federal tax credit to $1596)

My system is projected to product 5.2 TRECs/year at $91.20 each which is  $474.24 annually for 15 years. 

So Tesla's offer is about half the value of the TRECs over the 15 year period, upfront. 

So is $3427.20 now better than $8000 ($7100 in TRECs and $900 difference in fed tax credit) in 15 years?

personalfinance,Anyone have experience with Discover personal loans? (for debt consolidation),"I have been trying to snowball my debt and have whittled down my credit cards from $30k to $16k in about a year and a half (I know, it's embarrassing, but I was very dumb and naive and maybe a little self destructive after college and got in so deep I stopped caring for a while - it's been a humbling path to pay it all down, haha).

Anyway, my remaining balance is spread across three cards, one of which is a promotional zero balance APR but it's set to expire in November and my other two already expired. I believe the interest rates are 10.99 and 20.99.

I was going to open another zero balance card and transfer them but they typically hit you with fees for doing so. Instead, I was thinking of getting a personal loan to pay off the majority of the remaining balance.

Discover offered me a 60mos loan for $15k @ 10.99 apr and I was considering taking it. I know on paper it's moving one debt to another form of debt but I do think mentally it will help having everything consolidated. Right now I feel spread thin having to apply payments to so many different companies and having the credit card debt all under one umbrella might feel relieving, if nothing else.

That said I was wondering if anyone here has dealt with Discover and/or would recommend any other services. I've never missed a payment and my credit is fairly strong (almost 800 last I checked).

I make about $60k (give or take - I'm in sales and was going to make closer to 70 but covid messed that up!) and my other monthly payments are the normal stuff - mortgage ($900), car ($260) and utilities (varies). My student loan payments are thankfully on hold atm but typically they are 400/mo and I have $42k left to pay off. Once my cards are paid off, that's what I plan to tackle next.

Bitcoin,"People, stop saying bitcoins is going to destroy ""the financial system as we know it"" (STORY)","The last month I actually worked, I was earnings $2,165  per week. After taxes, I got to take home... $965. I don't even pay child support.

Federal tax, provincial tax, employment insurance, parental insurance, mandatory retirement plan (taken ""from source"" as they say it), medical insurance (mandatory), union fee, professsional order fee....

... all taken right from my pay and I couldn't say a word about it. 

Of course, in addition to all that, I still needed to pay sales taxes (15%), property taxes (5k a year), gas taxes, school taxes................................................... Likewise, I had to pay parking at work every day, gas to go to work, dinner lunches, etc etc etc.

I did the math once, and from $2,165, after you count everything, I got to take home $500 IF I was lucky. 

Less than 25% of what I earned was actually mine. 

So, why am I telling you this? 

Because at some point, I just... gave up. I didn't see it as ""being worth it"" anymore.

This is when I quit my job to pursue other passions. I ended up, amongst other things, on poker and cryptocurrencies. 

Today, I earn way less than back when I was working, but I actually take a lot more home. I don't have to spend 2+ hours per day in traffic, find parking, obey bullshit orders from idiots that don't know anything but got higher positions because they are better at licking boots, and I don't have the frustration that I get from work. I have a lot more free time and am generally WAY happier.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

So, again, why am I telling you this? **Because as long as people are willing to pull up with this bullshit, nothing will change**. I have a friend who STILL partake in that ""rat race"" ... except that he also has to pay child support. He takes even less home, yet he never even THINK about bitching about it.

To be clear, I am not anti-taxes, but can we fucking agree than if I earn $110,000 a year, I should take home more than $25,000? 

Can we AT LEAST agree on that? That it's not worth it? My boss' daily BONUS (not even his wages) is more than $25,000 AND that is not taxable (it's a capital gains). 

Do you think that's even remotely close to fair? 

I see people here being VERY optimistic about bitcoins and to be honest, so am I. I made a promise to myself I wouldn't sell bitcoins until they reach 100k. I took cash advances on my credit card to buy bitcoins. That's how much I fucking love bitcoins. I really believe in it (And ether).

But even if bitcoins hits $1M, which I hope, **it's not going to cause a dent in the financial system until people decice they have enough**.

**At $100,000 per bitcoins, the entire bitcoin market cap would be less than $2T, which is less than Apple, ONE company.**

Add in the lost bitcoins (4M?) and we can see that even if bitcoin reaches $1,000,000, the entire market cap will be around $20T which, while huge, is insignificant in the grand scheme of things.

**In the last four months alone, the FED has printed $6T. They basically created that money out of thin air and trust me, they are nowhere near done yet. That's 30x the current market cap of bitcoins, printed, invented, made up, you pick your own word.**

**Trump sent $1200 to every working american (and then some). Do the math.**

To say that bitcoins can disrupt the financial system is simply fake. I'm not saying it's impossible, but it's insanely unlikely. It will not unseat banks, big corporations and other entities trying (and suceeding) to enslave us. **Simply because these people can invent as much money as they want.**

**THIS is why I paid 75% in taxes by the way.** Because my province keeps printing more and more money to give to their buddies. I could go on about how horrible this province is mismanaged (most corrupt in the country) or how they waste trillions year after year, how they give themselves huge bonuses and billions (see: Trudeau WE, commandites scandal, etc etc etc). **That's money that they rob from YOU AND I.** 

They take your 75% income tax and fuck you in the ass with it. Trust me, you get far fewer services that you think you do. Again I'm not against taxation but 75% while those people steal billions is ludicrous.

**And as long as people are willing to put up with it, nothing will change. Bitcoins cannot change the mentality of ""I slave every day to enrich billionaires who don't give a shit about me.""** I quit working because it just wasn't worth it, but the vast majority show up day after day to enrich CEOs, corporations, shareholders, and the government. 

The dollar is not backed on gold. It's backed by good will. Meaning, the faith that the printed money  is backed by the economy. **If people refuse to take part in the economy, or even use loopholes to partake  in it as little as possible, THEN the financial system will crash.** But as long as people obey orders and allow themselves to get ripped off (that $6T printed money will lead to either of two things: higher taxes, or higher inflation, or both), the system will survive, bitcoins or not.

Yes, bitcoin can help that financial system crash, but by themselves, no matter the price, they cannot ""start"" or ""achieve"" anything, even if they reach $1,000,000. Bitcoin entire market cap is peanuts compared to how much those people rob, year after year.

I'll conclude by saying the bitcoin's most important attribute is that there is a fixed number. Obviously you cannot print unlimited bitcoins like the FED is doing with money right now and in 5-10 years I would bet new bitcoins will be very, very rare. Bitcoin isn't going anywhere but up and I'm holding until it hits 100k MINIMUM. But to conclude, don't think it's anything but a blimp for the world's economy.

personalfinance,IRS Treas 310 - Tax Ref deposit into bank account,"I currently have a pending deposit on my bank account for $12 with a description of ""IRS TREAS 310 - TAX REF"". Not sure what it could be from.

I don't believe it is connected to the $1200 stimulus check.

personalfinance,Help me understand federal withholding: My wife started a new job and her first paycheck was reduced by 89% because of taxes.,"My wife is working part time at a new job. It's 30 hours a week. Her first week was just 18 hours because she started on Wednesday. She makes **$18** an hour. She gets paid weekly and so her first paycheck was for **$328.86**. After statutory deductions totaling **$293.69** she only made **$35.17**. Taxes account for 89% of what she earned.

If it helps to explain what's going on to me, we live in Washington state, I have my own full time job and we do our taxes as Married Filing Jointly. When she started her new job she had to fill out an incredibly long W4 that asked her how much I made every year.

I need some help understanding why so much was taken out. At this rate it's not worth it for her to continue working this job or potentially any job. Her $35 paycheck barely pays for the gas she spent to get to her job.

Here's the full breakdown of the deductions:

**Statutory Deductions**

- Fed Withholding – 267.69
- Fed MED/EE – 4.77
- Fed OASDI/EE – 20.39
- WA FLI/EE – 0.44
- WA FLI/EE – 0.4
- Total – 293.69

---

###EDIT

After reviewing the W-4 she had to fill out, we came back to these series of questions.

* Select the highest annual wage from the ranges below.
* **Select the next highest annual wage from the ranges below.**
* Select the annual wage range that represents the total of the top two highest paying jobs annual wages from the ranges below.
* Select the lowest annual wage from the ranges below.
* Please enter the number of pay periods per year for the highest paying job.

The highlighted question above, ""Select the next highest annual wage from the ranges below"" is what I think is messing us up. My wife's annual wage is the one that would be represented here. If she was starting this job on January 1st, she would be make enough in 2020 to qualify for the ""$20,000-$29,9999"" answer.

So even though she's only just starting this job in August, this is what we selected because it asked for annual wage. At $18 an hour, 30 hours a week, her annual wage would be within that range.

Is this where we're messing up? Should we instead be answering based only on how much she'll make for the remainder of the year? In which case she'd be making in he ""$0-$9,999"" range.

Even if this is the issue, I still don't understand something. Regardless of how we fill out these questions, her employers W-4 web form automatically fills in a value for her under the field titled **""Extra Withholding: The amount below has been calculated by the Multiple Jobs worksheet questions.""** And we *can't* edit it. It just is what it is. And the number in there right now is the same number that was withheld on her first paycheck.

My paychecks have tax withheld that fluctuates with how much I made that week. I looked back and I noticed that it would go up and down based on how much I made that pay period. So *my* taxes are clearly based on some kind of percentage. But my wife's taxes are apparently calculated entirely as a FIXED amount that is based on a combination of my annual wage and her annual wage.

**I really don't understand.**

**It feels like we're being punished for having three jobs between the two of us. I currently have no reason to believe that we will actually earn more money this year if my wife stays employed. It feels like she should just quit. She's earning practically nothing at $18 an hour.**",finance

personalfinance,Debt and preparing to buy a home,"I'm just wondering what steps I should take to be best prepared to buy a home in the future. I was told to ask in this subreddit.

Not looking to buy until coronavirus subsides but as far as where I am now. I make about 30k net base pay, and a little over 40k gross with bonuses a year. I have about $120k in savings. I have no credit card, medical or student loan debt. I have a car that I owe about $8k on. I have two credit cards that have about a 7-8 year history each, which I make most of my purchases with and pay in full every month. My credit was around 720 last year right before I bought the car.

When I bought the car about 18 months ago, I paid $19k and put half down. My reasoning for this was I'd have a third trade line in addition to the two cards and a different form of revolving credit, which would build more history.

Someone suggested I just pay it off, but won't that negate any positive impact on my credit when I go to buy the house? Though I realize by paying off the car, I'll have no debt at all which would probably help as far as the numbers go and risk wise, and might get me a better interest rate.

Also any ideas on saving more? I'm going to go with a prepaid phone soon and save around $40-50 a month. My biggest thing right now is health insurance which is costing me over $300 a month, but I have an eye condition so I really need it. I don't eat out or spend on that kind of stuff very often, especially now.

When I do buy, what should I put down? I'm thinking at least 20% to avoid PMI, but I'd likely do more, since I want about a $150-160k house. I know Dave Ramsey suggests 1/4 of monthly net income toward housing, but playing with a mortgage calculator on hypothetical numbers, that wouldn't really get me anything like I want these days if I put only 20% down. Just the thing is they keep going up so who knows what it could be when things are more stable, I might get priced out anyway.

But I really think I should wait until things stabilize before I try to buy. Is it worth talking to a bank or credit union this early on? I'm thinking about two years out is when it might be stable to buy.

Stocks might be a good way to make some extra money, but I'm not really the kind of person that's ever messed with those. I feel like I don't make enough money to take those kinds of risks. Plus I've never owned any land or real estate, but I want to.",finance
investing,Analysis of Scion Asset Management 13-F Filing,"I am not one to typically follow or pay attention to the investing of those that consider themselves ""professionals"", but when it comes to the man, the myth, the legend, Dr. Michael Burry, I do. Recently, his fund, Scion Asset Management, filed it's 13-F Filing and there was some interesting information in it. (Bear in mind, some of these positions could be a few months old, however since I am focusing on the call options in his portfolio many of these positions would most likely be long-term and therefore would still be valid investments). Of note, Burry had 16 call positions which represented 71.19% of his portfolio. I would suspect that these are LEAP options (at least one year options) and not short-term call options, which clearly shows that he believes the economy has seen the worst of the coronavirus and is poised for a recovery. The reason I suspect Burry is invested in LEAP options is due to their tendency to be mispriced and cheaper than holding a higher priced stock like GOOG or BKNG long-term. They would offer far more upside than just holding the stock itself. We also know from history that Michael Burry is not a short-term investor and his ""Big Short"" positions, which were also derivatives, took over one year to profit. With that in mind here are the companies that made up the biggest positions in his call options:

GOOG (36% of his portfolio)

FB (7%)

BKNG (6%)

GS (5%)

WDC (4%)

Various other companies made up his other positions which primarily consisted of energy, retail, gaming (casino) and financial companies. All these companies are in sectors which are market laggards currently, but would increase dramatically with a market recovery, hence his use of call options. From looking at his portfolio, it is evident Michael Burry is bullish on the market and believes that it is set to recover. He is clearly betting on higher interest rates in the future (financial stocks), higher energy prices (energy stocks), higher consumer spending (retail stocks), increased discretionary spending (casino/gaming/travel stocks), and overall increase in the dominant tech stocks (FB/GOOG). I think this is a solid portfolio and thesis. I am not one to argue with the legend and I will be following his lead into some of the stocks he has bought. Specifically GOOG, WYNN, LVS, JPM, BAC, GS calls.

stocks,ETFs that stand to gain no matter who wins the election in November (An article from Barron's),"**Trump or Biden? These ETFs Should Climb Either Way**

The 2020 presidential election is only three months away, and the policy leanings of both candidates have started to come clear. A victory for Democratic challenger Joe Biden or the re-election of President Donald Trump could have implications for a variety of sectors and stocks. Investors should start positioning themselves for either outcome -- or even better, both.

Climate change and energy policy is one of Biden's priority issues. He has announced plans to invest heavily in research and innovation, and aims for a 100% clean energy U.S. economy by 2050. If the Democrats win the White House and Congress, Wolfe Research strategist Chris Senyek expects aggressive environmental legislation to pass, including strong emissions standards across several industries, new fuel-economy standards, mandated future levels of clean-energy production, and a ""cap and trade"" program.

That's great for clean-energy stocks, but the group should be positioned to deliver strong returns even without a Biden win. ""Clean-energy stock prices used to ebb and flow with political winds based on whether they'll be subsidized and supported or not. That has pretty much evaporated"" as the industry has matured, says Jason Bloom, director of global exchange-traded fund strategy and research at Invesco.

Many companies have finally turned profitable over the past two to three years, Bloom says, and their stock performance is now more about fundamentals than the macro backdrop. Public support for sustainable investing has also picked up, pushing much of the private sector to roll out decarbonization plans even absent government regulation. Friendly policies, of course, would offer additional tailwinds, but won't be as determinative on the clean-energy industry as they were 10 years ago.

The $344 million First Trust Nasdaq Clean Edge Green Energy ETF (QCLN), and the $484 million Invesco WilderHill Clean Energy ETF (PBW) offer diversified exposure to stocks in areas like renewable energy, electric cars, battery technology, and biofuels. Both funds have track records of more than 10 years, have returned an annualized 18% over the past five years, and gained 50% and 48%, respectively, in 2020 alone. They are quite concentrated, owning just about 40 stocks. The Invesco WilderHill ETF is equal weighted, and hence tilts more toward smaller, cheaper stocks. The First Trust ETF, on the other hand, assigns heavier weights to larger stocks like Tesla (TSLA) and NIO (NIO), which have soared 544% and 352%, respectively, over the past year.

Investors who want a more targeted focus can also look into the $975 million Invesco Solar (TAN), the $144 million First Trust Global Wind Energy (FAN), and the $694 million Global X Lithium &amp; Battery Tech (LIT). All three own international stocks and investors should be aware of currency risks.

Another relatively safe bet, regardless of who wins the White House, is infrastructure companies. The Biden campaign has promised to revitalize U.S. infrastructure, spending $1.3 trillion over a 10-year period on highways, bridges, and airports. Trump is reportedly considering proposing $1 trillion in infrastructure spending.

While there are a dozen ETFs in infrastructure-related stocks, only two are solely dedicated to U.S. companies -- the $213 million Global X US Infrastructure Development ETF (PAVE) and the $16 million iShares U.S. Infrastructure ETF (IFRA). The Global X fund is purely focused on industrial and materials stocks, while the iShares ETF also owns a slew of utility companies.

Still, while infrastructure appears to be something that both candidates want, Senyek warns that it has been talked about for several years without result. ""In our view, neither party wants to allow the other to receive credit for finally passing a package that majorities in both parties favor,"" he says. Senate Republicans, particularly, have been reluctant to get on board, concerned about the mounting federal debt amid coronavirus stimuli. A Democratic sweep would make a large-scale infrastructure bill more likely to pass.

Biden wants to build the American health-care system on the Obama administration's Affordable Care Act. This could benefit the established managed-care giants as more Americans obtain health insurance. There's one catch, though: Biden also wants to create a public option on the ACA exchange, a move that would bring some headwinds for the private sector.

Additionally, both candidates are pushing to cut prescription-drug prices and promote the development of generic drugs. That would be bad news for Big Pharma and biotech, but could reduce expenses for hospitals and health insurers. Investors can own these stocks through the $989 million iShares U.S. Healthcare Providers (IHF) and $95 million SPDR S&amp;P Health Care Services (XHS).

Trump has championed the idea of bringing offshore businesses back to the U.S. from countries like China. A Biden presidency might be more moderate on Beijing, but the decoupling of the countries' economies seems unavoidable. The Biden campaign has promised a future that is ""made in all of America"" by all-U.S. workers, and that would bring back the supply chains across a range of critical products ""on which the U.S. is dangerously dependent on foreign suppliers."" The trend could lift some domestic firms that have been losing business to outsourcing, says Invesco senior equity strategist Nick Kalivas. The $39 million Invesco S&amp;P SmallCap Industrials (PSCI) -- which owns nearly 100 small industrial companies -- could be a good play on the theme.

politics,"Discussion Thread: Voter Registration, Early Voting Resources and Commemorating the Centennial of the 19th Amendment","#Introduction

On this day 100 years ago, the Tennessee House of Representatives voted 50-49 to approve a women's suffrage amendment to the US Constitution, becoming the 36th state to do so and rendering operative what is now known as the 19th Amendment (the tie-breaking representative in that vote, [Harry Burn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_T._Burn), was initially an opponent to suffrage, but was persuaded by his mother to cast a vote for the amendment). This was a critical goal of a broader movement that had begun over a half century prior with the [Seneca Falls Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seneca_Falls_Convention) to define women's rights in the United States. 

In honor of the important milestone that's being commemorated today, we are bringing back this discussion thread on resources for voting in the upcoming presidential election in November. With signs that voter turnout may be the [highest in living memory](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/08/13/election-2020-voters-are-highly-engaged-but-nearly-half-expect-to-have-difficulties-voting/), if not in the entire history of the United States, it is imperative for folks regardless of their political persuasion to make sure that they are eligible to vote, and that they _will_ vote if at all possible. 

Please take the opportunity to share voter resources and discuss the state of voting in this thread, as well as to use the resources below to register, check if you're registered, or request a mail ballot if applicable. Regardless of whether you want to Keep America Great or Restore the Soul of America, democracy is not a spectator sport, and the efforts made a century ago by suffragettes and by civil rights activists in the decades since speaks to how important the right to vote is to American democracy. 

#Early and Mail Voting

Aside from registering to vote, with the coronavirus pandemic, a number of voters are now also planning to vote by mail. Absentee voting has been a part of American elections since the [Civil War](https://www.military.com/military-life/how-absentee-voting-us-troops-won-civil-war-and-ended-slavery.html), when election officials followed Union armies and tallied votes from soldiers which may have impacted the outcome of the 1864 Presidential Election. In modern times, alternatives to voting on election day at home typically come in the form of vote by mail (VBM) or absentee ballots, and early in-person voting. 

**Vote by Mail** is mandated in at least some form (overseas ballot) by federal law, and thus is available in all states in at least some form, typically for military and overseas voters as well as voters with bona fide impairments. [29 states](https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/vopp-table-1-states-with-no-excuse-absentee-voting.aspx) offer no-excuse absentee voting, meaning any eligible voter may cast an absentee ballot, but with the pandemic this year, an additional 12 states are permitting concerns over contracting the coronavirus as a valid excuse for a mail ballot.  

When considering whether to vote by mail, check [how well your state does](https://www.brookings.edu/research/voting-by-mail-in-a-pandemic-a-state-by-state-scorecard/) when it comes to managing these ballots, as some states, such as Utah and Colorado, have extensive experience with vote by mail (by virtue of being all-mail states), while others, such as Michigan, have only recently adopted this form of voting. Additionally, there are often additional safeguards when voting by mail to verify your identity, such as requiring a witness signature on your ballot in a number of states, so it is imperative that you check these requirements to give yourself enough time before casting a ballot.

Mail voting is not without its issues. Only [14 states](https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/vopp-table-11-receipt-and-postmark-deadlines-for-absentee-ballots.aspx) (only 5 of which, Florida, Iowa, Ohio, Texas and Virginia, are remotely considered swing states) count ballots that were received after election day, even if they were postmarked the day of or the day before the election. Recent events with the US Postal Service call into question whether ballots can be delivered in a timely fashion to meet these deadlines, so if you do opt to vote by absentee ballot, it is important that you cast your ballot early to minimize the chance of it not counting. In some states, you may also be able to correct possible deficiencies in your ballot, so **the earlier you cast your vote, the better chance you'll have the time to do this if something goes wrong**.

Additionally, the primaries this year with coronavirus have seen a [relatively high rejection rate](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/states-reject-tens-thousands-mail-ballots-year-s-primaries-setting-n1233833) for mail ballots. In the crucial swing state of Florida, over [18,000 ballots](https://www.tampabay.com/news/health/2020/06/29/more-than-18000-mail-ballots-not-counted-in-floridas-march-presidential-preference-primary/) were rejected during the presidential primary, a number larger than the difference in votes in Florida's contested 2018 Senate election, as well as Florida's infamous 2000 presidential election. In Wisconsin's April presidential primary, which stands a good chance of being the [tipping point state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipping-point_state) this year, over [23,000 absentee ballots](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/states-reject-tens-thousands-mail-ballots-year-s-primaries-setting-n1233833) were rejected, slightly more than the margin of victory President Trump secured in the state in 2016. Wisconsin was previously decided in 2004 by about 12,000 votes and in 2000 by a little over 5,000. [About a quarter of rejected ballots](https://www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/eac_assets/1/6/2016_EAVS_Comprehensive_Report.pdf) (p17) in 2016 were for missing the ballot deadline, and nearly half were rejected for either failure to sign, or for having a non-matching signature.

**Early In-Person Voting** is an alternative form of early voting which involves a voter casting a ballot or dropping off a ballot at a physical polling place, typically a county registrar's office as opposed to their typical physical polling precinct. This is not offered in as many states (though, of the swing states, only Colorado (which is all-mail), New Hampshire and Pennsylvania do not offer this option), but for the ones where it is, it's a [great alternative](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/early-person-voting-strong-option-concerned-voters/story?id=72248475) to VBM or risking the crowds on election day. States offer early in-person voting anywhere from 4 to 45 days before the election, which gives you flexibility to decide when to cast a ballot in a safe way. **[Check to see if your state offers early in-person voting here](https://www.vote.org/early-voting-calendar/)**.

* [National Association of Secretaries of State](https://www.nass.org/can-I-vote)

* [Business Insider Guide to Voter Registration Deadlines](https://www.businessinsider.com/voter-registration-deadlines-by-state-2020-8)

 

Keep in mind the following when voting this November:

1. Check your registration. It doesn't matter if you registered this year or years before, check your registration to make sure that you're still on the voter rolls, both now, and about when you plan to cast your ballot. Mistakes happen to voter rolls that have the unfortunate effect of disenfranchising voters - you can help avoid this by checking early so you have time to re-register or correct deficiencies.

2. Make sure your voter registration information is current. If you've moved or even if you use a new email, make sure that your information is up-to-date, as it will affect your eligibility as a voter, as well as who you're able to vote for. If you're in college in a different state or jurisdiction, check to make sure you fulfill appropriate residency requirements where you choose to cast a ballot.

3. Register early. Voter registration is already open if you haven't done so yet, and in many states, you are able to register even if you aren't 18 yet, as long as you will turn 18 by election day (this is also the standard in some states for primary votes too), but you want to give yourself some time to make sure this is processed. In states where voter registration or absentee voting applications need to be mailed, any disruption or delay in receiving or sending the application will run the risk of failing to meet the registration deadline, and in others, you may need to have some proof of residency or other identification that is not necessarily easy to obtain last minute. 

4. Check local resources. The vast majority of people will not have a problem registering or casting a ballot, but mistakes happen (or pollworkers may be misinformed), and you want to be apprised of what resources you have at your disposal to ensure you can cast a vote. Both major parties will have voter hotlines as votes begin to be cast, and each state should have a resource available as well.",finance

devops,Multiple Grafanas for multiple environments?,"# Preface

We've installed prometheus-operator using helm on a Kubernetes cluster and it came with a Grafana instance with it. Which is great. it comes preloaded with multiple dashboards about the Kubernetes cluster and its all nice and good.

# The problem

We have multiple environments. And they are dynamically created and destroyed on demand. We have 3 static ones, being: development, staging and production, and the rest are ephemeral.

That in turn creates multiple prometheus-operators, which create multiple Grafana instances (that can be removed if wanted). At first I thought this was ideal - complete separation between environments. But the main problem here is that all dashboards and all alerts have to be set manually on each and every Grafana.

One major thing to note here is that Grafana has several ways to maintain its data: either by files, and in a state database. But once you choose one, Grafana doesn't have an inherent ability to partially use one and not the other. that means that if we use a state database, we can't inject datasource in any way, because they will, in turn, be injected to the state datasource.

Moreover, as mentioned previously, Grafana doesn't **just** do dashboards. It has an alerting mechanism, and we're using it. We're using it differently for each environment. Enter- Prometheus' [Alertmanager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager/). This is great and all, but this has to be taken into consideration: not all alerts are metrics based (some rely on different datasources), it'll take time to migrate all (or, rather, most) alerts to use Alertmanager - this is not just tech and done, this is also cultural. Albeit, it's the better solution for alerting.

Another thing to note is the ability to [federate prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/federation/) which is **awesome** \- but not all metrics come from prometheus, which renders this solution useless for this use-case. (this could've helped out with the shared resources concern that you'll see next, but since it's not the only datasource, it doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things)

# The current situation

Right now, we have a Grafana instance for each environment. which is fine right now for the time being, but the problem is that every update has to be duplicated and copied between the environments (either manually or programatically) and it's the developer's responsibility to do so.

**This is sub-optimal.**

I've done some (a lot) of research and came up with the best solution I could think of - have a source of information that holds the state of Grafana for everything **EXCEPT** alert channels and datasources - and these will be injected dynamically when creating an environment. This way we'll have a Grafana for each environment, but it comes preconfigured to this specific environment. But unfortunately this is currently impossible, because it's either Grafana uses a state datasource or it doesn't - there's not in between.

So I set out to find a different solution.

# Possible solutions

as I see it, there are two types of solutions:

1. One Grafana to rule them all
2. Multiple Grafanas for multiple environments

In the following section I'm going to propose various solutions that I thought of. This is in no shape of form the **ONLY** solutions there are, and I'll be more than glad to hear any other solutions.

Keep in mind that in these solutions, not all bullets ""weigh"" the same. There might be 1 pro that outweighs 3 cons, and visa-versa. This is a problem because the ""weight"" is partially subjective, and depends on a whole bunch of variables (be it existing, or unknown). That's why I decided to keep it simple, as a list, instead of trying to weight each individual bullet. (for now)

Another thing that needs to be **STRONGLY** kept in mind is the ease of use - I don't want to make things more complicated than they need to be.

## Possible Solution A: connect to all datasources dynamically

**Type:** **One Grafana to rule them all**

Since we have Prometheus for everything, We can dynamically create the datasources on Grafana when an environment is created, and remove it when an environment is killed

## Pros:

* Single source of information. Just one Grafana for all the data we need. No confusion.
* Ability to compare between environments
* One place to control all users and groups within Grafana
* All environments get all the dashboards without the need to update each individual one for every change

## Cons:

* Cross environment updates are more prone to breakages
* Shared resources - if someone queries the staging environment and Grafana gets stuck - nobody gets any alerts (or everybody gets all the alerts)
* Will need to open ports for incoming requests from outside the environment (currently all traffic is internal EXCEPT for our api gateway)
* Will need to add and maintain the state of multiple datasources. Prometheus is not the only datasource. We've got Elasticsearch, RDS (which is closed off to everything outside the VPC - and will need proxies put up for them)
* Will have to create multiple alert channels that act differently according the named environment - a lot of this will need to be maintained manually
* All Grafana alerts will me jumbled together (Grafana doesn't allow variables in alert dedicated graphs, which will result in specific graphs for specific environments with specific rules)
* When creating a new dashboard that's only for development/staging, you need to go through extra hoops to make sure it doesn't alert on production data
* Harder to maintain Grafana (""down for maintenance"" and/or version updates will be needed to be performed with extra care)
* Prone to lots of accumulating unmaintained ""garbage"" dashboards
* Maintaining Grafana (deleting and changing dashboards) is dangerous, because you might affect production

## Possible Solution B: updated Grafana state databases simultaneously

**Type:** Multiple Grafanas for multiple environments

Have an external database outside of the environment that serves as the ""source of truth"" for all Grafanas, and a *controller* service alongside it. Inside the environment, have 2 sidecars alongside Grafana - *the probe* which constantly polls *the controller* for any changes in the external Grafana, and updates if there are any; and *the synchroniser* that constantly looks for changes in the local Grafana state database, and updates the external one via *the controller*.

**Note:** need to search for a HA solution for relational database (PostgreSQL probably), but it won't be enough because the alert channels are not the same, and the datasources too, and will have to be excluded out of the synchronisation process

## Pros:

* Complete separation of resources between each environment - a breakage in one will in no way affect another environment
* Updating a dashboard keep all environments up to date
* All alert channels are standalone to their respective environment
* All datasources are standalone to their respective environment
* No need to expose datasources to the ""outside world"" and/or create proxies

## Cons:

* Can't compare between environments
* Multiple domains
* VERY prone to breakages (race conditions, network errors, downtime for any one of the nodes, and I can name a million more. The gist is that the more moving parts you got, the more prone to breakages you are)
* Prone to accumulating unmaintained ""garbage"" dashboards, but contained to a specific environment

## Possible Solution C: one Grafana for all public environments, and multiple Grafanas for each ephemeral environment

**Type:** Multiple Grafanas for multiple environments

One Grafana state database, that will host all public environments (development, staging, production) and one for each ephemeral environment, copied from the state of the public one)

This is sort of a mix between the two. Having one Grafana is great, but has its flaws (as described above), and the opposite suffers the same thing. This is a thought experiment to see if the combination yield more pros than cons.

## Pros:

* Easy access to public environment data (one domain)
* No overload of lots of different environments which can be confusing
* Ability to compare between environments
* Updating a dashboard keep all public environments up to date

## Cons:

* Need to expose datasources on ephemeral environments
* Dashboards and alerts from ephemeral environments are destroyed when the environment is destroyed
* The rest is just an accumulation of all the cons from solutions A and B

*In retrospect, I think this is an awful solution. We get some of the pros, and almost all of the cons. I'd love to be proven otherwise.*

## Possible Solution D: singular state database, with ONLY service discovered/aliased datasource references

**Type:** Multiple Grafanas for multiple environments

Multiple Grafanas for multiple environments **BUT** removing the part about alerting from the equation, leaving **ONLY** dashboards and datasources to be loaded. that way we can have all the datasources be linked via service discovery (http://elasticsearch-logs:9200, http://prometheus:9137, etc)

This is another idea that is not FULLY formed yet, and I still need to figure out some stuff for it. I'm hoping I will, while writing these pros and cons (and maybe some of you guys will as well)

## Pros:

* Dashboards are updated simultaneously
* No overload of lots of different environments which can be confusing
* One place to control all users and groups within Grafana
* Separation of concern (dashboards and alerts are separate)
* All alerts are committed to our GitOps repository, and are managed as code (kubernetes custom resource Alertmanager rule) - IaaC continues
* Easy upgrades

## Cons:

* Shared resources (the shared state database)
* Different domains
* Can't compare between environments
* Will need to move all alerts from Grafana to Alertmanager (and/or any other tool for alerts that are not based on metrics)
* Can't create a ""quick"" alert using dashboards anymore - need to add an Alertmanager resource in our GitOps repository (cultural change)
* Ephemeral environments can affect the state database of dashboards (unless we have a job that migrates all the data from the public ones to a specific one)
* Creating an alert in grafana will result in possible mess (probably need to figure out how to disable this feature if we're gonna use it)

## Possible Solution E: Grafana as code

**Type:** Multiple Grafanas for multiple environments

This suggestion is somewhat similar to Possible Solution B. Multiple Grafanas that are being generated each time an environment is created via Grafana's Terraform provider and/or custom Kubernetes resources for Grafana. This way we can create custom notification channels for each environment based on rules inside our GitOps repository for different branch names.

**This solution is divided into two parts:**

1. **Infrastructure** \- datasources, alert channels, folders, users, groups, etc.. will be in our GitOps repository
2. **Usage** \- dashboards, alerts will be in a different *our-grafana* git repository. It utilises something like a [pusher/puller mechanism](https://brendan.abolivier.bzh/grafana-dashboards-manager/) for the resources, which in turn is then shared between all environments, and updated simultaneously.

## Pros:

* Ability to rollout changes to Grafana between environments
* Source control for everything (dashboards, datasources, alerts, etc)
* One place to control all users and groups within Grafana (IaaC)
* Separation of concern between environment specific resources and general resources
* Easy upgrades
* No overload of lots of different environments which can be confusing
* Updating a dashboard/alert keep all environments up to date

## Cons:

* Different domains
* Having a tool that constantly pulls and pushes to git can lead to breakages (as I mentioned earlier - more moving parts, more breakage potential)
* Notification channels, folders and datasources will have to manually
* I think this specific tool that I linked only syncs dashboards and not alerts as well - so might need to develop that feature - until then, they will be needed to be managed manually in Git instead of Grafana itself (they could be managed in Grafana, but this will create a drift)
* Drift can occur for resources that are not part of the usage - which might in turn lead to breakages - this will probably mean that permissions to do different actions will have to be applied
* Minor shared resource (git repo; albeit - not nearly as dramatic as other shared resources mentioned in different possible solutions above)

# Final thoughts

I think that out of all possible solutions, I like Possible Solution E: Grafana as code the most, but it's far from perfect.

My main things that I'd like to keep in mind when we're thinking about this thing are:

1. Make this easy and simple as it can possibly be
2. Make this as future proof as it can possibly be

I'd be glad to hear any and all other suggestions, and have as many comments on existing ones.

personalfinance,Please educate me on the best option for a savings account.,"Ok, so I'm new to this whole savings account world (despite the fact that I'm almost 25, but kept pushing it off due to idleness). How does a savings account generate you money? I know it's through the interest it yields, but I'm not sure if this is done yearly, or over which period of time.

Another thing, I've come to learn lately is the fact that there is a thing called ""online savings accounts"" which seem to offer stellar high interest accounts with the only downside that there is no brick and mortar option (which I don't see as a negative to be honest, I just want to make my money from my debit to grow on a savings account). These online banking options seem to offer more than 5x the APY compared to regular banks, for instance I'm with Chase with my debit card and their *premium savings account* has an interest rate of just 0.02% compared to 1% of some of these other online banking accounts. Why is there such a big gap in those percentages? is it really just the fact that you are missing the physical aspect of it that is giving you those high interest rates? or is this too good to be true?

Another thing I learned is that there is no minimum and no monthly fees on some of these online savings accounts compared to the one from chase which apparently charges you a fee every time you withdraw money and also requires you to have a minimum of $500 USD at all times in the account. To top it all off, they \[online accounts\] offer to insure your money which really gives me peace of mind.

Lastly, If I were to open an online savings account, can I just transfer the money from my debit card, no hassles, whatsoever? or am I missing something here too?

These are some of those so-called high interest rate online savings accounts I found:

* [https://www.affirm.com/savings](https://www.affirm.com/savings) \- they seem to offer the best APY at 1.30% and are relatively new
* [https://www.ally.com/bank/online-savings-account/](https://www.ally.com/bank/online-savings-account/) \- They have a .80% interest rate which is still better than the laughable .002% from Chase
* [https://www.varomoney.com/savings-account/](https://www.varomoney.com/savings-account/) \- This one is really good too based on pure numbers 1.21%. they also have a higher 2.80% APY if you meet certain criteria, but I already know I won't be able to so I'm not even considering that percentage.

They seem unwilling to go down this route, possibly because the US government would have to default on its treasury bonds and other obligations (SS, Medicare, pensions, etc). So the fed keeps printing, and eventually inflation spirals out of control.

There's losts of questions around when to pay off debt and wen to let it ride and why.   The way to read this image is that the % of beating the interest rate as it approaches 50 is  where you pay the debt off, because in finances rather than flip a coin you take the guaranteed return. 

The other nifty trick here in looking at this image is looking at the % and simply ignoring the associated reason.  basically below 4% you can consider to hold the loan, above 5% you can consider it being very reasonable to pay it off...   still..  it's nice to have the data laid out in a visual grid for some.

personalfinance,Should I pay off my car now or just pay it down faster?,"I feel like maybe the answer to this is obvious, but here goes:

My SO and I are planning a cross-country move for about a year from now, and would ideally like to buy a house at that time. This month, I paid off my higher-interest student loan, leaving me with $7,800 in federal student loans (\~3.8% average interest), and $6,800 car loan (8% interest). I pay $150/month toward the student loan and my car loan payment is $272/month. I paid off my credit card debt at the end of last year, allowing me to start saving some money. We had some unexpected expenses come up in the spring, so I didn't save as much as I wanted, but I've got a start, currently at $6,100 in my savings account. 

I completed my second degree at the beginning of July (paid for by my employer), and now that I am done with that, can begin working overtime again. If I work two overtime shifts a month (what I was doing prior to starting my degree last year), I will have \~$2400 per month left after paying all of my bills. This would come out to \~$29,000 in savings over 12 months.

**The question is**, do I use my entire current savings and then some to pay off my car loan entirely, then put its payment amount toward savings each month, OR keep what I have in savings, and simply pay a little extra each month, without completely paying the car off prior to the move?

&amp;#x200B;

I realize the fewer debts the better when looking to buy a house, but given that my car and student loan payments are relatively low, I don't know if it's wiser to maximize my savings as much as possible for a large move and first home purchase. In case it matters, Credit Karma currently estimates my credit between 780-800, and Vantage puts me at 780.

I should also mention that the goal is to have $8,000 left as an emergency fund, $5,000 for moving expenses, and $15,000 (minimum) for a down payment. Where we are planning to move, it is very possible to get a started home &lt;$200k.",finance

personalfinance,Paying mortgage with student loans,"Hi there! I'm looking to attend college half time, and seem to be eligible for student loans with a very low interest rate (around 1.5%). I was wondering if it's feasible (and legal) to pay my mortgage with the money I get from student loans.

personalfinance,Insurance is trying to collect an overpayment 3 and a half years later,"Location: CT, USA

My insurance just sent me a later claiming that there was an overpayment made on February 28th 2017, for a dental visit made on February 18th 2017.

Im fairly certain this has to do with the fact that me and my wife where not married at the time, and due to working for the government, apparently domestic partners is/was not covered under the insurance.

i point that part out because when i worked in the private sector, the job i was leaving for my federal position, they informed me that my now wife, then domestic partner, was absolutely covered as it was a requirement in the state of connecticut for them to cover her even if we weren't married. So i did not make nearly as much of a big fuss finding out if she would be when i got my federal position, because it just didn't occur to me that the private sector would be held to tighter rules than federal, if anything, i figured it would be the reverse.

However i did not say that my wife was my wife at the time and explained to my HR team that we were simply partners at the time - Living together for years at that point and having had 2 children together. We just didn't get married yet at this point.

When i did get married, i called my insurance to update her name in the system and let them know about the changes. At the time (still over 3 years ago from todays letter) they informed me she should not have been covered at all for the time we were not married. I argued with them that this was on them because no where did i tell them i was married, and if my company did that is also not on me. 

They did not pursue anything then. So i figured they cut there losses, i think the total they paid out for my wife was like $500 before we got married, so it made sense to me that if they they might just drop it for a mistake on their end.

Well like the title says, its now been 3.5 years, and they are asking for an over payment from this period to be paid.

the exact words are 

**we have received information concerning termination of coverage, therefore the patient did not have active coverage at the time the services were performed in the claims listed below. This has resulted in an overpayment**

are they legally allowed to ask me for money back this long after the fact for something they messed up on?",finance

personalfinance,Asking for advice in terms of paying high student loan balance while starting to invest,"I have read all the wiki's multiple times and am looking for a little bit of help with direction.

Currently mid 20s working as a Physician Assistant making $90,000/yr. Single, but will be married in about 2 years. No kids currently.

$107,000 in Federal Student loans at roughly 5.8%

No other debts.

Typical total monthly expenses including rent and essentials is around $2200-$2400

Prior to the student loan payment pause, I was paying $1800-$2000 a month to pay down my loans 

Currently have $50,000 in a HYSA at 0.95%

I recently started 401k with about $1,500 in it with a 3% employer safe harbor match

I have estimated my 6 month emergency fund to be around $12,000 - $14,000

I plan on throwing $20,000 at my student loan principal right before repayment begins at the end of September which will leave me with about $30,000 in the HYSA account.

At this rate, I should be able to pay off my student loans in just under 5 years.

&amp;#x200B;

I am struggling with what to do with my the rest of my money after I pay the $20,000. I know the 0.95% APY in the HYSA is not much, but is risk free.  I just feel like I am not putting my money to work like I should.  The looming high student loan balance is stressful, but I cannot believe the right answer is to forget retirement/investing for 5 years until I pay off my loans.

Some ideas I am considering:

1. Starting and maxing a Roth IRA, where if needed I can take out the money I put in without penalty for emergency situations.
2. Purchasing some I bonds or other federal treasuries with cash outside of my emergency fund to be used for a house down payment in 3-4 years.

personalfinance,Home Refinance Math,"Hey finance geniuses, trying to figure out the math on refinances and see if it's something I am interested in. Here are my thoughts so far:

The benefit is you can reduce your monthly payment, which means you have more money to invest in something else. However if you extended the term, you are making payments beyond what you would have been without the refi and this is a cost to you. If you pick an interest rate that is likely what you can get with other investments (say 5%) you can compare apples to apples by converting both of these to present value sums and see if the benefit is larger than the cost.

The refi fees must be accounted for, and I think it's logical to add them to the new loan principle in your calculations.

Example

Original Loan: $200,000, 360 months, 4%

Payment = $955/month

Refi option after 10 years of payments: new 360 month term at 3% and fee of $5,000

Remaining principle at 10 years is $157,138

Add refi fee: $162,138

New payment: $684

There is a savings of $271/month for the first 240 months and a cost of $684 for the last 120 months, when comparing to the original loan.

Use 5% as an alternative rate. The savings of the first 240 months can be invested in something with this return, but the last 120 months have an opportunity cost.

Savings of $271 for 240 months at 5% converted to present value: $41,101

Cost of $684 for the last 120 months at 5% converted to present value: $23,759

The last part requires two step, convert to present value at month 240 and then treat that as a future sum and convert to present value today.

The analysis shows doing the refi is worth it at a present sum value of $41,101 - $23,759 = $17,343. Alternatively you could leave the refi fee out of the loan and see if the present sum value is greater than the refi fee.

Any thoughts? Is this a sound way to think about refinancing? Is there a better way?",finance

investing,Should I Sell All My Bond ETFs now?,"I am generally following a risk parity portfolio and have 40% in bond ETFs (10% in intermediate 30% in long term), 7.5% in a gold ETF, 7.5% in commodities ETFs and the remaining 45% in a variety of broad stock indexes (emerging, mid cap, small cap, large cap and international).  I've got about $100k in the bond funds.  

Bond interest rates are inversely coordinated with the share price of my ETF: I.e. 10 year note rate falls, the share value of my bonds goes up; 10 year note rate rises, the share value of my bond ETFs falls.  Rates are right now seem to be as low as they can go, meaning that I can only lose money on the share price of my ETFs (though I can still continue to make money through their coupon/dividends, but it's not a lot - I'm at \~$350 for the year).  

My question of the hive mind is: Should I sell all my bond ETFs right now because the share value is as high as it is going to go?  Am I neglecting the possibility of negative rates pushing the share value higher?  Is the real question where else would I put $100k if not in bond funds?

investing,Can tech keep its quarantine gains?,"We all know that tech gains during quarantine have been MASSIVE.  My question is, can tech keep these gains if/when the world returns to normal?

I don't think so. Here's my simple analysis (from a USA POV):

__What happened when the world went into quarantine?__

* Personal savings rates went to at all-time highs starting in March.  
   * For example, May was almost 3x times larger than any other time in recorded history.  [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PSAVERT](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PSAVERT)
* All this extra money needed a home and tech was the best option. 
   * At zero rates, Bonds, High Yield Saving and Money Market have little appeal
   * Beaten down sectors are risky, and we're already in risky times.  
   * Market Cap ETFs where attractive (VTI, SPY, etc) too, but that fueled tech.  Tech comprises a lot of these ETFs.
   * Tech has a story.  People at home, tech is all they have.
* QE all day every day helps all equities.

__What happens when/if the world returns to normal?__

* Personal savings rates plummet back to the norm.
* Beaten down sectors start to come back and look more attractive as they rebound, especially compared with high valued tech
* Rates increase; Bonds, High Yield Saving and Money Market make equities less attractive (Financial sector look better too)
* Tech losses it's story a bit.  People are out and about!  
* Consumer spend comes back and QE is stopped (we don't want hyperinflation after all).  Also, if tech dips but other sectors improve, the Fed will not intervene.  Fed cares about credit markets, not equities markets.

Would love to hear your thoughts.  Do you agree?  What am I missing?

To be clear, I'm not saying this is going to be a dot-com bubble.  Personally, I feel like it will be a modest pullback and tech will look a lot like it did pre-COVID, i.e. it loses its COVID gains.  However, I'm long tech.

Goldman made more or less the same points a week ago: [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-stocks-goldman/covid-19-vaccine-approval-could-stall-tech-stocks-boom-goldman-idUSKCN2520YB](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-stocks-goldman/covid-19-vaccine-approval-could-stall-tech-stocks-boom-goldman-idUSKCN2520YB)

personalfinance,liquidity for downpayment - 401k or stock,"Hello,

Buying my first home. My wife and I weren't planning on buying for another 6 months but an ideal home in a great location popped up near where we are renting. We know the previous occupants and they agreed to sell to us.

So, we aren't as liquid as we'd like to be at this point. We have 50k in savings, 250k in combined 401k, 50k in stock. We are both 30 years old and together make a little more than 300k/yr.

The house is $350k, and we have a 3.0% apr mortgage if we can pony up 20% ($70k) down. We can also put down $5k with no penalty at closing but the rate jumps up to 3.750%.

So my predicament is an optimization problem. My impulse is to take out a primary residence loan against my 401k of $40k for 15 years which would be $150 out of each paycheck. I can make principle payments against this and have it paid off comfortably in 2 or 3 years.

Another option would be to sell what I have in stock and be done with it. But a lot of this is company stock so it would be disqualifying and I would pay taxes on a lot of gains.

Lastly, we could just put 5% down and suck it up about the interest which still provides a comfortable monthly payment for us. PMI is not required on this, the difference is built into the interest rate.

Our goal is to keep this as an investment property, which really has me thinking I need to front load this bad boy with the loan against myself. That said, it would impact a glorious retirement trajectory we are on being 29 years old.

Alright so, like many I had been furloughed because of the pandemic situation.

I understand that this is taxed by the federal government. In fact, every time I certified my weeks, I had ticked the box to withhold the taxes from my income. I don't feel like doing the math later on. Just let the fed do it for me.

Reason I ask is because I usually get most forms from various sources same time as they cut the check. Then I print my W4(?) from work and knock out my taxes as early as doggone possible. I don't go through the hassle of waiting for my forms thus wait for my money, but I also don't want to have to redo taxes because I got impatient with the system.

stocks,"My Opinion on Technical Analysis, AMA!","TL-DR:

I'm a former retail Day Trader with 15 years experience. I've also worked as a Professional Stockbroker. I believe that technical analysis is a scam promoted by brokers in order to generate trading revenue from retail traders who are unable to afford access to the real news and data that moves stocks. I'll be online for the next 8 hours - AMA. 

Edit 24 hours later:

I've literally been inundated with messages asking for my website and I just don't see why I shouldn't provide it. I've made the whole thing free - there are no paywalls. It's at news.broker 

Post:


This opinion is unpopular amongst those who are somehow convinced that technical analysis does work. These individuals either rely on the scam in order to generate their income off the fees generated by retail traders OR have invested so much time and effort into learning technical analysis and the ability to quickly identify chart patterns that they unable to admit they might be wrong. I present this opinion after more than 15 years of trading experience both as a self-employed Day Trader and as a Professional Stockbroker. I am now a Financial Journalist and offer this insight in the hope that it convinces some people to wake up and see technical analysis for the fraud it is. 

Now before I go on I want to first state that charts, by their definition, offer a visual depiction of historical stock price movement and are therefore very useful when it comes to analysing and researching stocks. Determining an entry and exit point using a stock chart and a few lines here and there is an excellent way of assessing previous levels of support and resistance when done properly and according to the timeframe upon which you wish to hold the stock.

Technical analysis is a good tool when used properly to determine the entry and exit price points of a stock that has already been selected to invest or trade using other forms of analysis. 

In my first 2 or 3 years of being a Day Trader, I was convinced technical analysis was some kind of secret mystery that if mastered would lead to generating consistent profits. I figured that the short term trading of stocks was different to longer term investing and that a different approach was required to be successful. This false and incorrect belief was supported in the official literature provided by my broker in the guise of educational resources and I found plenty of guru's online and in person with very compelling arguments as to why I should pay them money to buy their books, courses, home study kits or overseas seminars.

I viewed technical analysis as being a new way of trading stocks. A secret that only a few people 'in the know' knew about and definitely something that could be learned and mastered on its own in order to become a successful trader. Who wouldn't want what I have just written? It sucks people in like a cult - people who just want to learn how to trade which I believe wholeheartedly is a noble and smart endeavour that strikes at the heart of entrepreneurship. 

I attended seminars, purchased books, downloaded charting software and even stood up in front of a University presentation being conducted by a well known fund manager in an attempt to argue that his proven value investing philosophy was second to technical analysis. I thought it was the most purest form of generating insight into a stock price because it took it 'already took in all of the factors' - whatever the hell that means. 

I would spend hours each night going through the stock chart of every single listed equity trading in the ASX/S&amp;P 200 index (I live in Australia) and would apply various studies in order to determine what to trade the next day. I'd search for elusive breakouts, stocks that were about to hit previous support or resistance levels. The fundamentals didn't bother me because as far as I was concerned, technical analysis already included that and by the time a retail trader gets word of the news about a stock, it has already moved (there is unfortunately an element of truth in that - read on). I didn't really consider the fact that for a chart pattern to develop, the price must have also already moved somewhat. 

My false belief as I touched on earlier was supported by my broker and again at the seminars my broker sent me to. In my opinion this was solid information/education because the people telling me were market professionals and much more experienced and educated than I was. I didn't consider that my broker only generates money when I generate fees from executing trades - it never entered my mind that this information could be a load of BS.

Thankfully, I had (and still have) a genuine and almost obsessive passion for business and the financial markets. I love reading company annual reports and conducting research and so in between looking at chart patterns and colouring in lines I would also look at the fundamentals of the business out of pure curiosity. As part of this process, I would pick up on certain things that would get me bullish or bearish about a stock - a product launch, a law suit or an industry forecast for example. As I gained experience trading I would slowly place more and more emphasis on the fundamentals until one day I saw the light. 

A stock moves either up, down or sideways. Generally up or down - therefore, any type of analysis is going to be correct roughly 50% of the time. I would view all my profitable trades as solid examples of correctly applying technical analysis and I would view all loosing trades as being mistakes. For me, tefhncial analysis was perfect and when it didn't work it was because I hadn't properly applied it. 

After about 2 or 3 years of trading using technical analysis exclusively, I began incorporating more and more fundamental analysis and kind of broke even most of the time. I worked as a Security Guard part-time to fund my life, but my full-time job and career was trading. I say this because for the first few years I really didn't make any serious profits, though I didn't lose much either so I kept persisting. 

In my 4th or 5th year of trading I did well as I incorporated more fundamental analysis and less technical analysis but during the GFC in 2008 lost a fair bit of money. I returned to doing security work but still kept trading. Then I came into quite a bit of cash, quit my job and became a 'full-time trader' where I subsequently lost around $80,000 in one year. 

I was devastated and about to quit everything and go back to being a security guard when I received a telephone call from Bloomberg one day offering me a free trial of their Professional terminal. I had no idea the cost and didn't ask. The operator figured I was loaded since I had spent $80k on the market in a short period of time and had set-up a Pty Ltd / LLC company for taxation reasons. 

Within a few hours a courier arrived at the door with a colourful keyboard and a fingerprint authentication device that looked like something out of a 007 movie. I downloaded Bloomberg and switched on the terminal. My life pretty much changed that moment. 

I now had access to the exact same financial news, economic data and research enjoyed by Wall Street brokers. As I said before I didnt quite understand what I had, but as I was about to quit everything anyway I genuinely didn't care. I still remember receiving a breaking news alert on the terminal within the first few moments regarding the very first Takarta airbag recall. I decided to short the stock as a test trade and within the next few months that position alone paid for the next 2 years of terminal access. 

I couldn't believe the power I now had and I lived it up big time. I travelled to China, Hong Kong and stayed at luxury hotels. I flew business class and everyone who told me to get a real job and stop gambling on the market now looked at me differently. I had made it as a Day Trader and was now in the class of a 'sophisticated investor ' permitting me to various benefits and investment opportunities. 

Truth be told, Day Trading even when successful gets a little lonely and boring. I saw a job advertisement for a boutique Stockbroking firm in Sydney and applied using a few years of broker statements and sent my email via Bloomberg's IM directly to the CEO. I had 3x gruelling interviews and got the job. I didnt do too well at being a broker and actually got put in charge of creating a morning news briefing and research reports for clients. It was at this point I realised my real passion in life was writing about financial news and the stockmarket. To cut a long story short I quit my job as Broker and started my own financial news website- which I have never disclosed on Reddit and will never do so in the future - there is no underlying motive for posting this. I just want to say my point if view. 

As a Professional Broker, we did not use technical analysis unless the client requested it OR when determining support and resistance. It just doesn't work for anything else and the level of research, news, analytics and data made available to institutions is considerably better than what is made available to retail traders. 

So why is technical analysis promoted so heavily? For a few reasons. 

Firstly, your broker only makes profit when you trade. It is therefore in their best interest to get you trading and generating fees as much as possible. In order to get you to do this, they must provide you with some kind of motivation or explanation as to why to buy or sell a stock. The financial news industry is quite different to other news and whilst insider trading is illegal- it is far more common than you would think and comes in various shapes and forms. 

I consider insider trading to be acting on information not made available to the general public right now. For me, that includes a news story that has only been published to a select few people who can afford a subscription that costs the same as the price or a new car. The law has a different definition that favours the elite. 

I believe that retail traders should have access to the very same information, at the same time, as institutional traders. Organisations such as Bloomberg or Reuters should NOT be allowed to withhold their news stories to subscribers for a period of time like they do. $24k per year for a subscription is ridiculous for most people and places this valuable information well out of reach. This is the kind of information that moves the financial markets - NOT chart patterns resembling a human torso (head &amp; shoulders) or the stars in the night sky (gann). 

To put it simply: Fundamental Analysis such as news, financial statements, broker recommendations, industry forecasts, product releases, trademark/copyright registrations, dividend announcements, research reports, law suits, fiscal policy, management changes, new regulations, COVID-19, opinion polls, regulatory action, fines and penalties, patent grants, consumer sentiment, predictions for interest rate changes and other economic calendar events - the list is endless. It is these that moves the financial markets - NOT chart patterns!

Anybody who has worked in a professional level finance job knows what I'm saying is 100% true and correct. It is only uneducated, uninformed, inexperienced retail traders who buy into the technical analysis BS. Unfortunately, many of these traders either get a few wins and genuinely believe their own hype OR are just excellent liars and choose to promote their BS strategy using very professional looking and convincing arguments. I'm certain many will respond to this post calling me an idiot. 

I've quit trading and I'm not a broker. I'm an independent financial journalist and have ZERO investment holdings in any listed or non-listed company. I invest my money in AUD because it is my local currency and I own Gold - that's it. I'm 100% independent and I charge $1.00 for 12 months of access to my website which as I said is NOT given out on this reddit account. I've written this very lengthy post to provide some insight into the scam that is technical analysis.

personalfinance,Credit union loan question,"Basically I want to buy a car and it’s perfect.

personalfinance,If I move abroad and pay off my student loans through IBR will I technically not pay anything?,"This just seems too good to be true and yet I am reading it everywhere. 

I am a senior right now in a college in New York. After I graduate I plan on doing my masters in Poland and then staying there forever. I have Polish citizenship through my parents and a close family member offered to buy me an apartment when I move there. Basically, I don't have to go through the paperwork and practical hustle involved with emigrating since I'm not technically moving to a ""foreign"" country. 

My biggest concern up to this point has been my student loans. I only took out federal loans so I don't have to worry about private loans. Paying them off seemed like a hustle especially since in Poland the average salary is about the equivalent of $8,000.

personalfinance,Big change in salary and estimated taxes,"I took a new job this July and my income changed from a W-2 to a 1099.

I got an accountant to help me with this year because it's so new to me (hopefully I can do my own in the future) - but I feel like I'm missing something in my conversations with him.

My family moved states in July, and as part of the whole moving + COVID thing, I am working fewer hours in July and August than I will the rest of this year. In addition, my salary from July onward is a large increase (\~3x) of what I was making before. Thus my tax burden this year will be much higher than last year. But here is was I don't understand - my accountant calculated my September quarterly payment, and tells me I need to pay my entire July + half of August paycheck in tax (fed + state). Here are my thoughts:

1. This might be correct if you take into account my estimated income from July to December, calculate the tax on that sum, and divide it into two payments. Because I'm working fewer hours for July and August, it just comes out to a much larger percentage of my earnings?
2. Is there a way to pay a percentage of your income each month in smaller sums rather than lump sums four times a year?
3. Can my September payment be much smaller than December, or does each quarter have to be the same?

personalfinance,What to do about T-Bonds/Notes? Reaching par vs Roth IRA,"So I think like most kids in the 90s-00s our parents and grandparents bought us Treasury Bonds/Notes to mature around the time we hit the age of majority, graduated college, or hit some other age where its expected we hit some major life milestone. In my case I have between $3600 and $4000 in Treasury Bonds issued from 1997-2003, with varying interest rates on the individual bonds from 3.5-5.5%. In effect only some of them have hit par and I'm well aware that were I to try and cash in on every one of them I'm not going to get anywhere close to face value (I don't think?), but at the same time I feel wrong/bad keeping them earning no real money whatsoever. 

Sure the current interest rate is low, but I know nothing about the secondhand market and would prefer to not get fucked over by a bond with a high face value, when I can just turn it in(?) to the Treasury and get 75%-80% of par. 

Currently I am working and have some money saved up, but I only work part time for $11/hr and don't bring in a lot of money. With COVID showing no signs of stopping and student loan payments coming due in January I also am seriously worried about my repayment timeline. My loans individually stand at 28k principle but over 2 years have wracked up almost 4k in interest, the highest interest rate being 5% and the lowest being 3.2%. About 10k of the 28k principal is unsubsidized, if memory serves me correctly.

I keep telling myself it's only $300/month, but my plans to teach English (or otherwise work) abroad in China and pay down the loans isn't really coming to pass, and where I'm currently living doesn't have a whole lot in the way of job opportunities. I feel as though cashing these out in whatever way possible and rolling them into some Roth IRA or other interest-growing account would be advisable than having them sit and earn interest up to par over the next decade. My family has always seen them as being utilized for a big purchase (like an apartment or going abroad, healthcare emergency, etc), but I'd like to make this money work for me and grow in the event of things not panning out with my current job.",finance

investing,"Stock market at record forcing everyone to become believer, forcing strategists to raise S&amp;P 500's price targets","https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-18/rallying-stock-market-is-forcing-everyone-to-become-a-believer


From professional investors to market handicappers, it’s becoming next to impossible to stay bearish in the face of the rally in equities.

Fund managers who went to cash when the pandemic broke out have been forced back in to stocks, pushing measures of positioning toward historical highs. Wall Street forecasters, some of whom threw up their hands in surrender four months ago, are pushing up targets each day. Even Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which once warned that bad loans and falling dividends could drive a second leg of the bear market, now sees another 6% of upside in the S&amp;P 500.


While testament to the career pressure missing a $12 trillion rally creates, the unanimity has become one of the biggest risk factors in markets right now, with positions getting crowded as everyone is forced to buy. A custom gauge of sentiment compiled by Citigroup Inc. showed “euphoria” just hit the highest level since the dot-com era.

“While a new all-time closing high would certainly be encouraging, it’s not always the pedal to the metal trade that it would seem,” said Jonathan Krinsky, chief market technician at Bay Crest Partners. “There is lot of optimism out there, which often makes breakouts harder to sustain.”

Fear of missing out gave birth to the rally and now it’s downright rampant after stocks staged a powerful rebound from the fastest bear market ever. Up more than 50% in less six months, the S&amp;P 500 is poised for the quickest recovery on record. The index rose to as high as 3,395.06 Tuesday, surpassing its prior intraday record reached in February, before trading little changed on the day.


Money managers are embracing the equity rally after cutting their exposure to historically low levels during the downdraft, according to a survey by the National Association of Active Investment Managers. The group’s exposure index, tracking investment advisers from 200 firms overseeing more than $30 billion, has risen to a two-year high. Even the most bearish respondents are 50% long equities, something not seen since late 2017.


“Takeaways from discussions with institutional investors indicate significant comfort with central banks’ willingness to keep rates low for an extended period,” Tobias Levkovich, chief U.S. equity strategist at Citigroup, wrote in a note last week. “This is a marked shift from commentary heard a month or two ago and reflects both complacent/ebullient investor sentiment and a sense of rationalization for the relentless bull run.”

Wall Street strategists, who rushed to cut price targets for the S&amp;P 500 during the March selloff, are now trying to catch up with a rally that has defied most of their predictions. More than half of the strategists tracked by Bloomberg have raised their projections since June, when their projections were way below the market.


The latest skeptic giving in is Goldman’s David Kostin, who boosted his 2020 target by 20% to 3,600, the most bullish among peers. The call ended his months of skepticism over the market’s resilience, including a warning in May that the S&amp;P 500 would probably drop to 2,400 over the next three months. Like the others, Kostin’s bullish case is centered around near record-low interest rates.

“Share prices reflect not just the expected future stream of earnings but also the rate at which the profits are discounted to present value,” Kostin wrote in a note. “A plunging risk-free rate partially explains why equities have performed so well despite downward revisions to expected earnings.”


As stocks keep rising and turbulence subsides, demand from computer-driven investors who buy and sell stocks on momentum or volatility signals, is also returning. At Deutsche Bank AG, strategists including Binky Chadha aggregated positioning among stock pickers and quant funds, and found their overall exposure has increased to a one-year high.


Fund positioning tends to show an inverse relationship with future market returns, Deutsche Bank study shows. That is, the more bullish fund managers are, the poorer the market performs in coming coming months. While the current reading still signals positive market returns, with gains averaging 1% over the next month, it also points to one third of chances to go negative.

So much faith is put in the Federal Reserve that investors are willing to pay up for earnings that’s estimated to drop 20% this year. At 26 times forecast profits, the S&amp;P 500 was traded at the most expensive level in two decades. To Peter Cecchini, founder of AlphaOmega Advisors LLC, all the index’s gains above 3,000 are unjustified.

“The equity markets are now like an old elevator way over capacity,” said Cecchini. “It’s just a matter of time before the cable snaps and its passengers end up in the basement. That’s where the Fed will be waiting.”",finance
personalfinance,"Considering a refinance/HELOC, but what pitfalls?","I’m looking at interest rates, letters I’m getting with offers, and weighing my options. The impetus behind this consideration is my driveway needs to be replaced (quote: $9,000), one A/C is rusting out but still running (quote: $7,000), we have a sinkhole from builder debris that’s 5 feet deep in our backyard (I did confirm it’s not water/natural, but quotes for this range on what we’d want to do, minimum $5,000) and while I’d like to put ALL of this off another 10 years, it seems money is “cheap” right now. And of course, the wife wants a new kitchen (quote: infinity...ignore this portion).

I’m looking for feedback about what things to look out for when asking around, what tricks I should avoid if I consider a refi or second mortgage or HELOC.

Some info: 
- My mortgage rate is currently 3.5%. I have 26 years remaining, though I had been paying it as a 15 year.
- We plan to live here forever, though that’s dependent upon work.
- My credit is 806-849 depending on the agency.
- My mortgage owed is about $300,000 on a $409,000 mortgage and the home value average estimate is around $460,000.
- No debt other than the mortgage and my car payment of $360 which ends in two weeks!
- Liquid capital: $70,000 (7 month safety net).

I could just as easily leave all of these repairs and improvements until the wheels fall off, I’m not itching. I just don’t want to miss an opportunity to make these repairs when my credit is high and rates are low, when it could cost me a lot more at a later date.

Ideally, I’d like to get the magical scenario where my payment is the same or close to what it is now, due to a lower rate, but also put equity to use to fix and update the home.

What should I be cautious about? What can I do to leverage my situation best? Is there something else I should consider?

personalfinance,I need advice on using a credit card vs student loans to pay for school and help make ends meet until I start school in 5-ish months...,"To start, I have 0 debt. Also, I was told by multiple people that paying my car off would raise my credit score. Well I paid it off and tanked my credit score (from 710+ to 640). I would have opened a lower interest CC before the car payment went through and tanked my credit score, but now I'm worried about high interest rates and if its even a good idea now.

So basically, would it be wise for me to open a credit card to help me live off of and pay for school or should I just try to scrape by until I start school in Jan/  Feb, then try to live solely off financial aide, student loans, ect..? I don't have a source of income and likely won't for some time, but I don't mind going into some reasonable amount of debt to build my credit score back up and also make ends meet until school starts.

If I chose to take out a mortgage for the full 400k (with a 10% downpayment of 40k) How could I work out an amoritization rate with a bank in order to drop my liquid savings onto the mortgage loan immediately in order to drastically cut the principle before much interest can accrue?

\- Start a 401k, max out contributions (not the company one) (all stocks?) (Vanguard??)EDIT: can't start my own 401k so plan is to contribute max amount to company one!)

\- Pick the company HDHP so I can use the HSA and reduce family income so pops can get the most out of medicare/medicaid. Max out the HSA

\- Pay half the student debt now and the other half before interest in December (if I can and don't need the $$ for new apartment, etc).

personalfinance,Looking for advice on how to pay off debt and what to do with settlement money. Budget attached.,"Hello all,

[Budget](https://imgur.com/a/ePf9Me1)

My wife and I are expecting our first child in February/March 2021. After finding out that we are expecting I have had an overwhelming urge to get serious about paying off debt and securing our financial future in the interest of our child. I have a few questions on how to do that since we are expecting an insurance settlement within the next year.

My wife was in a car accident in august of 2019 and both insurance companies have screwed us over. We are suing both companies with a personal injury lawyer working on contingency. We are likely looking at a settlement of anywhere between $16,000 and $50,000 conservatively.

Questions:

1.) what should we do with our settlement? should we put it all towards debt, invest it, or a mix of both?

2.) is there anywhere in our budget that we could trim some fat?

3.) would it be a good idea to get a large loan at a lower interest rate to consolidate or is a $60k loan unreasonable? my credit score 730. Wife's is 750ish.

4.) most of our excess money at the end of the month gets used up for my medications/doctor visits and my wife's physical therapy/doctor visits from the accident

Obviously, the Discover card debt is what needs to be paid down the fastest since it is the highest percentage. Welcome to any feedback, advice, or recommendations.

personalfinance,Credit Card debt consolidation help please!,"Disclaimer: this is for my parents as they asked for my help in finding out how to get out of their credit card debt.

So my parents have 2 credit cards open, one with about $20,000 in debt and the other I believe about $15,000. They are paying very high interest on both these cards and were forced to put these high amounts on their cards due to medical costs of my sick brother. 

My father has a steady job where he makes roughly $115,000 per year while my mother was laid off due to covid-19.
They're credit score is decent, somewhere around 700. Although due to continued medical costs and the very high interest rates on the card they are barely chipping away at the cards each month as 90+% of what they pay just goes to cover interest.

stocks,The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) July video/notes were just released. showing what the Fed is doing and planning,"Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee: From July 28-29, 2020 were just released to the public at 2pm EST.

&gt; A joint meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee and the Board of Governors was held by videoconference on Tuesday, July 28, 2020, at 10:00 a.m. and continued on Wednesday, July 29, 2020, at 9:00 a.m.

It's important that people trading stocks read up on the Feds outlook and current plans since much of this market recovery seems to be highly tied to their actions.

&gt; ""On balance, broad equity price indexes were roughly unchanged, Treasury yields declined and the yield curve flattened, corporate and municipal bond spreads narrowed, and the dollar weakened somewhat. Liquidity conditions continued to normalize but had not returned to their pre-pandemic levels in several markets.

&gt; yields on nominal Treasury securities fell and the yield curve flattened on net.

personalfinance,First mortgage via Black-owned bank?,"Hello Reddit,

We’re hoping to purchase our first home soon-ish, and are exploring mortgage lenders and rates. It recently occurred to me that getting a mortgage through a Black-owned bank could be a meaningful way to invest in and support an important community resource for 30 years to come. Assuming I can get a competitive rate from OneUnited or Broadway Federal Bank, for example (I’m in Los Angeles), are there risks associated with getting a mortgage through a much smaller institution that I should be aware of?

Is this ‘investment’ a less meaningful form of ‘activism’ than I assume?

Fwiw, I’m white latinx and do most of my banking through Wells Fargo (who doesn’t exactly have a sterling track record on race 😬).

personalfinance,Student loan advice needed,"I have been using the forbearance as an opportunity to pay down on my student loans. I come from a family that is not very financially responsible and they are unable to give me any advice on how I should apply the extra payments I am making. I have 6 groups of student loans, pretty much all different interest rates. I have heard of the snowball and avalanche methods to paying off student loans. I’m just unsure if it is smarter to pay off my smaller loans first, my higher interest loans first, or pay of my capitalized interest first. Can someone please help me figure out the smartest way to apply my money?? I have $2,000 that I plan on paying on my loans. I’m trying to see if it would be smarter to pay off all of my capitalized interest or if it would be smarter to pay off my smallest loan. I will lay out my loans below: 

Group A: loan total-$6,595.32 interest rate-4.66% capitalized interest-$1,095.32

Group B: loan total-$3,271.63 interest rate-4.29% capitalized interest-$371.63

personalfinance,Just realized my student loans are broken up into 5 separate groups,"Hey everyone, 

So I was looking at my student loan portal and  when I was going through the details I noticed something I hadn't before, and that is that what I thought was one big lump sum loan is actually broken down into 5 groups with 5 (slightly) different interest rates. In addition to the interest rates being different, some of the totals also very, so they are not broken up evenly. 

Would it be better to pay off the least expensive ones all at once first? The breakdown of my loans is as follows: 

&amp;#x200B;

My current overall total balance is around  $27,000. I have been making the minimum payments which comes out to around $300 a month.

Broken up, the loans are as follows:

Group A: $3,400 with 4.29% interest

Group B: $2,300 with 4.29% interest

Group C: $7,000 with 3.76% interest

Group D: $6,900 with 4.45% interest

Group E: $7,600 with 5.05% interest

&amp;#x200B;

My loan company gives me the option to make payments on each of these individually if I want to. I know I should pay off the high interest ones first, but, given that I already have a pretty decent amount in my savings account, I think if I saved up for another month or two, I could just knock out the group B loan of $2,300 all at once and be done with it so I can focus on the others. Maybe save up for another year or two after that, and pay off the group A loan as well, all while still making the standard payments on the other three. 

&amp;#x200B;

Would it be smart to pay off the lower sum loan groups all at once if I am able?

&amp;#x200B;

personalfinance,Does refinancing make sense after purchasing only one year ago?,"We purchased a new home one year ago and the original mortgage was $500k and interest rate is 3.875%.

Broker who setup our original mortgage reached out recently and said rates are at historic low and that he could save us about $350 per month if we refinance.

I asked for more info on all the costs I’d have to pay and he replied with info below. It sounds like a no brainer but the skeptic in me thinks it might be too good to be true and I might be missing something:

“Thank you for your patience, I got your title quote today.  Here are the “hard” costs associated with your refinance:

$999 Commitment Fee
$425 appraisal fee
$2500 title/recording to title company for closing the loan

As I mentioned, I will pay the Commitment and appraisal fee and I will also contribute $500 to title costs because you are my previous client. So you’re basically down to $2k in hard costs. Your monthly savings on P&amp;I is approximately $378 per month, so you would recoup your hard costs in 5 months. The real savings is in interest over the life of the loan, it is over $145,000.00.

There will be new escrows taken at closing, and your old escrows get returned to you.  I can set this up so no funds come out of your pocket at closing if you wish.  This ends up being a wash basically; taxes and insurance will be what they will be.”

Any thoughts on things I might be missing or follow up questions I should ask would be greatly appreciated.

personalfinance,Strategy for Repaying Wife's Student Loans,"My wife has $24,298 in student loans that we are looking to pay off immediately. The total principal for all four loans is in the ballpark of $20,500.

The loans are broken down as follows (four accounts):

1. $6295 at 6.8% interest
2. $7921 at 6.8% interest
3. $4743 at 0% interest
4. $5339 at 0% interest

By the end of September we intend to sell her car (moving to Japan) which will bring in $15,000. We can directly apply this to her total loan amount. We intend to get a debt consolidation loan through our credit union, even if at a higher interest rate, and pay it off over a three-year period to help build her credit.

My main question is if we contact Navient and offer to pay off the full amount in a lump sum, how willing will they be to provide a reduced payoff amount? Additionally, for general financial advice, is it a smart decision to close all four of these accounts and open the debt consolidation account? Current personal loan rates for 36-months is 7.49-18.00%. Would it be worthwhile to instead do the loan consolidation through the Student Aid site and accept the averaged interest rate?

Edit: Thanks for the feedback guys. Going to put the $15,000 towards the two higher interest loans, then work on paying off the 0% ones.

I’ve never personally needed student loans, but it’s very easy to see how people can get trapped in them.",finance

personalfinance,Paying extra on your home loan really does pay off!,"Refinanced my loan last month (went from 4.875 to 2.875% interest).  Got all my paperwork and was setting up my online account with my lender so I don't have to mail in a payment.

Noticed my lender has a nice Amortization Calculator on their site. 20 year and 30 year notes had the same interest rate, so I went with the 30 year and planned to make extra payments.   I plugged some extra additional principle payments into the calculator and wow!  I knew they helped shorted the time on your mortgage, and lower your interested paid, but not by how much.  On a $160k note, with 2.875% interest:

* If I run the note is full 30 years (360 months) I will pay about $79k in interest.
* If I pay an extra $100/mo towards principle I shave 68 months (5.7 years!) and $16.5K off my interest
* Extra $200/mo -  114 months off (9.5 years) and $27k less interest
* Extra $300/mo?  Almost cuts the loan time in half - 147mo (12.15 years) and $34.5K less interest!

Again, knew it helped, but seeing HOW much it shortens the loan, and reduces the interest I pay was eye opening.  Defiantly paying and extra every month.

Edit: I get it.  I most likely could get better returns on my money with other investments.  I would rather reduce my only source of personal debt faster.  And I know my spelling sucks.",finance

personalfinance,"18K in CC debt, earning ~$39K a year, big car and rent notes. Question about loans","OK, here we go. 

I bring home roughly $39K a year after taxes and such. I have a smidge over $18K in credit card and small loan debt. $340 car note. $950 rent. Those two alone is one of my paychecks, leaving me my other check that month for all credit card,utility payment, and other living payments (groceries, gas, etc.). 

I added up all my credit card/loan payments per month, and just the minimum payments come out to almost $800.

I can get a personal loan for $18K that would wipe it all out pretty much. The monthly payment for the loan would be $550 with a 5 year term. The interest rate is high...like 30%. Yes, I know this is stupid high. My credit score is low 6's. Imagine that. 

Here's the thing: the way things are going, and probably will go for awhile, I wouldn't have my debt paid off in 5 years doing it the normal way. I can't get another job. I have no other source of income. I can't move in with friends or family to save on rent.  

I was actually making double payments when I had the extra Federal Economic $600 payments coming in while I was underemployed, but that's no more.

I can't see a downside to taking that loan offer. Tell me why taking this loan would be a bad idea that I have haven't already mentioned, e.g % rate.

cybersecurity,Both accounts hacked?,"My Amazon and GMail accounts were hacked. Hacker bought two laptop computers from Amazon using a stored credit card. I happened to notice as a result of a related email from Amazon (which wasn't in my Trash folder- more on that later) concerning one of the purchases and began investigating. I called Amazon and they were able to stop one of the orders. I called my credit card company and reported the fraudulent transactions and am getting a new credit card from them. I noticed on my compromised Gmail account the hacker had created a filter which sent emails from Amazon, Chase, Paypal, etc. to my Trash.

I changed my passwords at both Gmail and Amazon and turned on 2FA. The next day- today- the hacker again compromised both accounts (Gmail and Amazon) and attempted to make a purchase from Amazon. I happened to see the related email from Amazon indicating they (Amazon) had suspected unauthorized activity and disabled my password, reversed modifications made by this party, canceled any orders, etc. I again noticed a Gmail filter had been added to my Gmail account causing certain emails to be routed to my Trash folder. As a result of the recent breach I had been monitoring my Trash folder and saw the aforementioned email from Amazon.

I also checked recent activity on my Gmail account and found a login from a remote IP address- and believe this is associated with the hacker.  What is particularly confusing is the remote IP address was associated with my main PC (""Your Devices"" in the Google Security section). 

As an aside, the fraudulent purchase of the laptop was scheduled to be delivered to my address and I was advised by FedEx these criminals will often hang around one's house awaiting the FedEx truck and steal the merchandise they have ordered under another person's account information.

I have again changed my Gmail and Amazon passwords and re-enabled 2FA on the Amazon account (it was disabled as part of their password reset process). I performed these changes from a different computer thinking it might be a keylogger at work on my primary machine?

personalfinance,2.625% FHA vs. 3.25% Conventional - What to do?,"I'm looking to refinance my house, and these are the two options that I'm looking at.  I've been in the house for 15 years with 15 years left to go on the FHA loan, and I'm looking to refinance into a 15 year loan so that I don't add more years.

It looks like I can get 2.625% if it's an FHA loan, or 3.25% for a conventional.  

Isn't the only difference that I'd have to keep mortgage insurance for the FHA loan?  My current mortgage insurance premium is $264/year (or $22/month).  

The remaining loan balance is only $45,000.  Zillow estimates the value is $110k, but I think that a more realistic number would be $70-75k.  I originally paid $82k, but I think that the neighborhood is worse than it was when I moved in 15 years ago.  The current interest rate is 4.25%

Plugging those numbers into a payment calculator, it looks like the conventional payment (not counting escrow) would be $316/month and FHA would be $306.  Since the difference is only $10, and the MIP is $22, doesn't that mean that I'd be out ahead by $12/month if I went conventional even though the interest rate is higher?",finance
personalfinance,Financing an Online Bootcamp (The Data Incubator Fellowship),"Good evening,

I hope that everybody is staying safe amid the COVID-19 pandemic. I have a question regarding a financial decision and would appreciate any feedback. As a background, I am living with my parents while working remotely.

This is my financial status. I make about $1500 - $1700 per month. I currently have a little over $10,000 in my checking account. Here are my investments totaling $8,640: $4,300 with Betterment, $2,000 with Marcus, $630 with Acorns, and $1700 in IBM stock. I pay about $500 in rent each month and $50 in student loans.

I was recently accepted to an online bootcamp called The Data Incubator (TDI) Fellowship as an Online Scholar. I was surprised to learn told that the Fellowship accepts approximately 1-2% into each cohort. While I am an academic by training, I have been working autodidactically for about a year towards becoming a data scientist (via MOOCs, Coursera, EdX, etc.) but have not been content with my progress. I sincerely feel that TDI would help academics like myself change career directions from academia to applying those research skills into commercial sectors.

TDI costs $9000, of which a $1,000 deposit is required soon. The bootcamp requires attendance from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM, Monday to Friday, from September 21st to November 20th. The Fellowship works hard to connect participants to employers through partnerships, and I read that there was a high job securement rate. (However, since I will be participating online, I am a little worried about whether my job searching success rate would be equivalent to that of those attending the Fellowship's career fairs locally. If at all possible, I plan to attend career fairs locally to increase my chances of securing employment.) There are several financing options.

Scenario 1: If the $9,000 tuition is paid in full, there is a $1,000 discount, so I would be paying a total of $8,000 for tuition.

Scenario 2: Through a service partnering with TDI called Credit Climb, I just applied for a $8,000 loan. My loan was pre-approved with an interest rate of 7.25%. Over a course of 36 months, I would be making monthly payments of about $250, with about $925 in interest being paid, as well as $400 as a one-time payment to Credit Climb. Adding the numbers together, I would be paying $1,000 (deposit) + $8925 (loan repayment) + $400 (fee) = $10,325.

Scenario 3: I read about an income share option but am still looking into the exact details, so this scenario may not be correct. As soon as I secure a job with an income of at least $40,000, I would be paying 12% of my income towards tuition for one year, with a $16,000 cap. (For example, if my first job as a data scientist immediately after the bootcamp is $65,000 per year, I would be paying back $650 per month for a year, adding up to $7,800.)

Here are my honest sentiments. Paying the entire tuition up front would be the most affordable option ($8,000) but I would be left with little money left in my checking account. While I am living my family, I am concerned about the prospects of not having a safety net if something unexpected happened.

Taking out a loan would allow me to retain my checking and pay back slowly, albeit about $1,400 more ($10,325). At the moment I am feeling like this might be the most reasonable, less risky option.

I am not certain about how to evaluate the income sharing plan. While a goal is to find employment as a data scientist or a data analyst, there is uncertainty in economic and occupational outlook. If I secure employment that is less than $40,000, I will not have to pay until I do, but if I secure a very lucrative position, I will have to pay a lot (e.g., $1,000 a month, or $12,000 per year, if the role is $100,000). 

I do not consider myself financially savvy, and would appreciate any suggestions. Thank you.",finance
personalfinance,Refinancing worth it to remove PMI on FHA loan?,"Due to a situation where I basically was either going to be purchasing a home or renting for more money then monthly mortgage payments and because my in-laws were generous enough to give us the down payment of 20% plus closing costs I purchased a home with my wife in January. Mortgage is in my name because frankly my wife's credit is in a bad spot. Because my credit wasn't in a super great spot we ended up having to get an FHA loan. 


Flash forward to now and we've paid off all the credit cards with my name attached to them. My score is very likely to be in a good spot as this was the only hindering factor on my credit. My question is should I refinance? I can't find any calculators that take into account me no longer having to pay PMI.

personalfinance,Unloaded some stock - need advice.,"Hey, [r/personalfinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/)

I run a startup with my best friend. Both of us recently unloaded stocks worth $2M ($1M each). I'm really bad with money, so i figured why not make a post about it.

I'm planning to buy a house in a few weeks so I've been scouting for a decent family house all over the city and liked a few which fall in the $350K - $500K range. I feel $500K is too much for a house, so me and my parents decided to go for the $350K house which sits inside a gated community with all the amenities you can imagine. I'm going to pay cash instead of taking a loan, but i feel this is not a wise decision?

Also, planning on getting a car for me and my parents. I worked so hard to get my business off of the ground so i'm thinking of gifting myself a car in the $100K-$120K range and a another car in the range of $30K for my parents, so all around $150K for both the cars. Again, planning on buying both of them with cash since the interest rates are high (8-10%).

I'm going to invest rest of $500K - Me and my best friend are looking to purchase a commercial property. The property is costing us around $300K combined so $150K each. The property already has tenants (a consumer electronics store), so we will get rent ($3000/mo) right off the bat.

Then, i'm going to put $200K ($100K each in my parents accounts as fixed deposits which will earn a interest of around 6-7%).

Rest of $150K - $75K is going into emergency funds. Then the remaining money is going to sit idle in my account for expenses which considering i live in a third world country is more than enough for a few years.

Other details :-

I'm 24

have no debt

I take home $50K before taxes

I'm single and not planning on getting married for the next 6-10 years.

**BtcTurk Supports Women's and Men's National Teams: #SonuKupaOlsun (#LetThisBeTheRoadToCup)!**

**BtcTurk's CEO, Özgür Güneri** commented: ""As BtcTurk, we continue to move forward on our path with the mission of being a pioneer brand in the world. We take great pride in being one of the ""Main"" supporters of our National Teams at the UEFA European Championship, which will be held in 2021 — the first time the games will be held in an odd-numbered year. Last year, we supported Yeni Malatyaspor, one of the successful clubs in TFF's Super League, as their name and jersey sponsor. This year, we continue to contribute to the Turkish sports and football community, and we are very pleased to support our Women's and Men's National Teams. I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to Mr. Nihat Özdemir, President of TFF and to all members of the board.

I express my sincere thanks to them for the support they provide to our Women's and Men's National Teams. With this agreement, I hope that our National Teams will write stories of success that lead to trophies. Thanks to the support of BtcTurk, I believe that both our Men's and Women's National Teams will gain many achievements to put a smile on the faces of Turkish people. Our National Team jumped from 41st place to 29th in the FIFA ranking and hopefully will take firm steps to rank among the top 10 countries in the world. Our Women's National Teams will also make their mark in Europe in the future period.""

**Necla Güngör Kıragası, Head Coach of Women's National Team noted**; ""For me, it is very valuable to be here as the guest of our federation and our new sponsor BtcTurk in a manner that appreciates the presence of women in football and demonstrates the value attached to our Women's National Teams. For that matter, I would like to express my gratitude to our President Mr. Nihat Özdemir, to all members of the board, and to our sponsor BtcTurk on behalf of all women in the football community. Recently, women's involvement in football is highlighted more with the support of new organizational changes within women's football. We work very hard to be worthy of this trust and take responsibility in infrastructure projects to help women's football find a wider audience. Our target is to make Turkey one of the leading countries in women football in the near future. With the support of our new sponsor BtcTurk, I believe that we can achieve our target and I would like to convey my best wishes on the agreement both for our football community and our country.""",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Paying off a car in full or should I build credit,"Hey guys 

So I recently bought a used 2017 Honda Accord, for 16.5k, after taxes it was about $19k. I put down a $10k down payment on the car, and it has 17k miles on it so it’s basically new, really reliable vehicle trying to make it last 10-15 years. However, since I’m a first time car buyer, I don’t have any credit. And after a lot of dealerships and negations, The lowest i could get was 8% which still blows. I’ve currently got enough to pay it off in full today, but I was reading it would actually hurt my credit. Should I just keep making monthly payments for a few months then pay it in full? Because the whole reason the interest rate is so high is because I have no hard credit even though my score is 758.",finance

That does not help me decide how to allocate my earnings, so any solid recommendations are much appreciated!

Here's my situation: I am 30 years from retirement and expect to be in the 32-35% tax brackets for nearly all of my career. I am able to max out both a 403b and a 457 through work. I was thinking about making these both Roth accounts, which would be about 50% of my total retirement account allocations (there are other accounts through work which are all tax-deferred). The question is, is 1:1 Roth:Traditional too much for someone in the 32% or 35% federal bracket? Should I reduce my Roth proportion to more like 25-33%? I am not comfortable making all of my retirement tax-deferred because I strongly believe that tax laws will be harsh 30 years from now.

personalfinance,"WA- Unemployment, can I apply or is it too late?","Hello all,

My husband and I used to live in Florida last year.  He lost his job in August 2019 (he was a contract worker- 1099).  Around the same time, I was offered a position in Washington state to start in January 2020.  Two weeks before my start date, I got a call from HR telling me they were going into a hiring freeze (federal agency) and they didn't know when it would end.  I wasn't working at the time and hadn't been since late 2018 and was using this job to return to the workforce.  

Since, it was only two weeks before I was set to start, my husband and I already spent money for the move so decided to just move to WA.  Of course, since then, Covid hit and we are struggling to find work (been living off savings).  

We were on the assumption that we couldn't apply for unemployment because:

1. I cannot since I did not officially begin the job, thus was not laid off.
2. My husband was an 1099 contract employee at the company he was laid off at and does not qualify for unemployment.
3. We moved from Florida to Washington and cannot apply for WA unemployment as we have not worked here.

Was I right?  Are we out of luck?

personalfinance,Was refinancing my auto loan worth it?,So I just bought my first adult car this past January with no co-signer. My credit wasn’t the best of the best. So I was approved for an interest rate of 17.5% for 60 months with one of the banks my dealership uses. I figured I could always refinance later. So today I refinanced through capital one and I chose 11.25% for 47 months and it’s the same price I was paying per month as before. There was options for lower monthly payments but I figured the sooner it’s payed off the better. Was it worth it?,finance

If the highest interest rate on the debt is 6.25% and the stock market return has averaged higher than that, doesn’t it make more sense to continue paying the minimum due on the loans each month and invest? Of course the stock market isn’t a 100% sure thing, but we’ve been making enough that we’re able to pay the minimum and save each month. I don’t know how the math checks out and would really appreciate any guidance.

personalfinance,What approach do you guys recommend towards paying debt?,"Hi everyone, I've been making a lot of changes to my finances over the years. I've recently started investing into my Roth 401K since my employer match started to kick in at my job. 

This is my first full time job out of college. I'm making $28K a year before taxes. After taxes, I usually take home close to $1700/mo. I split expenses with my boyfriend and my savings account is really good. 

I do have some student loan debt but thankfully it's not much since my parents paid for most of my school. I have $10K saved and I currently save about $400/mo. I try to invest about an additional $50/mo along with my $100/mo I put into my Roth 401K. 

My student loan debt is $9K and my interest rate is under 5% last time I checked. Thankfully the loans won't start acruing interest for awhile because of COVID. 

One thing I'm wondering is if I should aggressively pay them off? One is for $5500 and the other is $3500. My main goal is to pay off the $5500 right before interest starts to kick in (whenever that's going to be) and pay the $3500 one off the following year. 

I feel like I can do it but I do need to spend some money on getting a new car (luckily not a lot since my bf knows a mechanic). That's really the only expense I have. I can't afford a car payment on my salary so I'm just kind of stuck with what I can do realistically.

What do you think I should do to go about paying off my student debt? I know everyone feels so differently about it which is why I'm unsure of what to do besides just saving everything I can.",finance

personalfinance,Looking for financial advice on paying off student loans/investing,"Hey all, I'm looking for advice on how best to pay off these student loans Vs using that money to invest. I'm very new to this all and just need some help and don't know what my best options are with the current COVID situation going on. I am *24* years old, turning 25 in November.

Here's a breakdown of all of my student loans:

Private Loans:

* Loan 1: $19,019.86 at 7.60% interest
* Loan 2: $16,319.66 at 7.00% interest
* Loan 3: $16,926.80 at 6.31% interest

Federal Loans:

* Loan 4: 4.66%
* Loan 5: 4.29%
* Loan 6: 3.76%
* Loan 7: 4.45%
* Loan 8: 5.05%

With total federal loans at: $32,881. Not sure exactly how each loan breaks-down.


So all in all, my total loans are **$85,147.32** with varying interest rates.
**My student loans are currently set to 0.00% interest and I am not required to make payments until 12/31/20 because of the CARES act** 

I make 60k/yr at my current job. I contribute to my 401k up to my employer's match. I've opened up a ROTH IRA that I plan on contributing 6k to. I currently live at home with my parents, but was planning to find an apartment in the near future.

I have about 11k saved up, which I consider my emergency fund. I don't have much bills at the moment, only $200/month to help out at home. Most of my 'fun' money spent is on going out to eat.

I haven't set this up myself, but I have ~$42k in various investment accounts. Here's a breakdown of those investments:

* SPY at $19,220.50
* SDY at $13,338.91
* VFIAX at $3,496.20
* F at $5,736

Now here are my questions:

1. With student loans deferred until Dec 31st, it seems like an opportune time to payoff my student loan principle balance. Would it be wise to dump a sum of money before that date? Or should I save it to pay it off over time after that date?

2. Should I sell some investments I have to payoff the higher student loan interest rates (i.e. Ford stocks)? Or should I hold onto those investments so they can grow over time?

I've just started learning about all of this and am trying to figure out my financial situation so I can be prepared for the future. Ideally my goal is financial independence.

personalfinance,Refinance runaround and now I want to jump ship. Talk me off the ledge!!,"I took some advice from a friend who recommended a broker. I went to said broker for a refinance, mainly to lower interest and remove the PMI. No cash out. The house appreciated to a 80% LTV, loan amount is $424,950, Central CA, current credit score is 815 but was lower when the process started, was offered a 3.25 rate. This happened last week of June, locked in the rate. We are now looking at a closing date of maybe the first week or two of September. Aside from the joke that has been the length of time it’s taken to refinance, the mortgage interest rates went down. I decided to check my docs to see if there was a float down option. Lo and behold, my rate expired on 8/8. Didn’t hear anything about that so I sent an email to ask about the expiration and maybe looking into a lower rate. I got an email saying that the locked rate had been extended at no cost to me (thanksssssss) and nothing about lowering the rate. I responded with a pointed question about lowering the rate and I’m waiting to hear back. At this point, between how long it’s taken (because of the amount of volume they have due to the great low rates!) and what I am taking as evasive behavior surrounding lowering the rate, I’m growing more suspicious and feel like this is shady AF and I’m not sure if these are red flags that tell me to find a new broker. Am I being ridiculous?",finance
personalfinance,What should I do? Mortgage/IRA,"What should I do? I have a house for 425,000 I only put down 5% when I bought it recently, so I have about 400,000 left.I want to get rid of PMI, which is like an additional $200 a month, as soon as possible but is that the best financial decision?

I understand that instead of putting money to pay off the mortgage I could put more money into the IRA and it would be better in the long run, however, I don't know what would be better though:

1. (I am doing this now) Pay $300 principal and $100 to IRA - Refinance at 20% then max out IRA and $100 to the principal. Some months I make a good commission check and can pay a little bit more towards the principal each month. 
2. $400 - Principal and $0 IRA - Refinance at 20% and then max out IRA and $100 to the principal.
3. $400 - IRA and just wait to get to 20% - Refinance and then max out IRA and $100 to the principal.

Because If I can pay off the 20% within 4-5 years then I could put the PMI payment into the IRA rather than waiting 10 or so years to get to 20% equity and wasting the money in the PMI. Right now the interest rate is 3.49 for the mortgage. I know that the IRA on average makes about 7% every year which would be nice.

I feel like whatever decision I make won't make too much of a difference in the long road. But hopefully, you guys know something I don't that could save me a bunch of money.

Note: I don't think I would be comfortable maxing out the IRA without paying off the PMI because of finances.",finance
cybersecurity,Some questions before throwing myself in an expensive 1-year technical training in cybersecurity,"Hi there,

I am currently unemployed mostly due to the current crisis and I thought that was a good time to think again my career. As I am about to pay for an expensive 1-year expertise training in CS, I wanted to ask you some questions to clear some doubts about it and know what you think to go back in school. So if you guys could give me some of your impressions, I would be grateful.

So I start here. I am an embedded systems engineer who finished school about 5 years ago. Since then, I went only into software engineers jobs. I tried some big companies and a startup, did some Python, C++ and JS. The problem is that I start to struggle to see myself finding another job in coding, not only because today's market context is special but also because I start to have some doubts. I really enjoy coding but I found it kind of depressing in my former jobs (Went in 4 different companies). It's either too repetitive and you start doing every days the same thing and never really do ""engineering"" in itself, or you need to throw a lot of code under pressure in a really short amount of time and you find yourself committing some ugly code that you know you will be ashame of (without doing any ""engineering"" actually).

Well, anyway. I recently started to be aware that I always was attracted to cybersecurity. I tried some basic pentesting back then when I was in highschool. I tried kid stuff like SQL injections, messing around with BackTrack and dreaming about Kevin Mitnick stories. So, I wasn't a genius at that time but still, CS was fascinating me.

Yesterday, I learned that I was accepted for a 1-year training. It has 4 months of learning with researchers and experts and 4-5 months of internship. This is great ! I am very happy to receive this opportunity. However, that training being 100% technical (mostly forensics, pentesting, malware analysis... ), they don't seem to have courses in networks or protocols. More than that, the list of skills needed to prepare the training looks kind of light to me (binary and IP addresses, IP submasks, Hex to Bin conversions, Python for beginners, SQL for beginners, ...). Is this course really useful for someone who already did most of it early in studies ?

I am aware that you can't actually learn everything in cybersecurity and that 4 months is very short to be technically good. But do you agree that being very good in networks, databases, protocols are necessary to be a GOOD pentester or malware analyst ? Also, do you think taking this training is relevant for an embedded engineer or should I just take some books and find an entry level job in the field without going back to school ?

I would be happy to have suggestions, thank you for reading !

tl;dr

fed up with software engineer jobs, want to take a 4-month class + 5 month internship training in CS but not sure about it being relevant for my background. Are networks, protocols and databases skills needed to be good at being a pentester, a malware analyst or a forensics ?",technology

personalfinance,Mental block with refinancing a mortgage,"Currently in year 5 of 30-year mortgage with $415k remaining at 3.8% interest.

I get that it makes total financial sense to pull the trigger on this. But I'm having three mental blocks. First, I just don't understand why the closing costs are so high. What is it that loan officers actually do? Why is this not all automated? Why do their services cost so much? Second,I don't understand why I can't get a quote for below the 'average' mortgage rate listed on Google with an 800+ credit score and approx 60% LTV. Third, I don't understand why I can't get a lender to allow me to continue paying tax/insurance directly rather than escrowing without a large penalty to the rate or closing costs.

|My Debt|Student Loans|95000|1.75%|15 years (14 left)|$632|
||Student Loans|8500|3.6|10|$0 (I paid a giant chunk off, and plan to nuke this this year to 0. No payments as it took my years off, but didn't shorten the timeline, dumb but I got it)|

||Vehicle|15600|3.7|5 years (4 left)|$338 (We are going to pay this off this year after credit cards)|

So current this is our setup and layout. Our combined income is about 105K. I typed above the current plan per debt but the priority is as follows:

1. both Credit Cards **(Within next month or 2) ((We will keep these, but use them for monthly bills like food, gas, etc and then pay them off in full))**
2. Vehicle **(this year or early into 2021)**
3. My smaller student loan **(Late Spring)**
4. wife's student loans 
5. house?
6. my loans?

With my wife's loans, once the car payment is removed I will put that monthly payment into her loans as we build bigger chunks of cash to larger payments down the road. Should we shorten her payment timeline once the vehicle is gone to make her payment higher, or have more liquidity and make bigger payment dents in it? Number 5 and 6 are the real brain scratchers for me. My student loans are an amazing deal for the big one at that interest rate, should I remove them first, after wife's, and then throw that at the house, or go interest rate focused?  Should I restructure our current debt removal plan? Anything else we should consider?",finance
personalfinance,Auto Loan Refinance Problem,"Hi y'all. Long time lurker, first time poster. My husband is dealing with a terrible refinance situation and I'm curious if anyone else has had similar problems.

My husband (M) refinanced his truck through our local credit union (CU). The original loan was through Fifth Third. He signed paperwork with CU on July 29th, and they sent a check through the regular first class mail to Fifth Third. Fast forward to August 18th, M starts getting phone calls from Fifth Third. Apparently, the loan had never been paid off and he had missed a payment with Fifth Third. Meanwhile, he already had made his first payment to CU.

It seems the check got lost in the mail, which isn't overly surprising considering we got all these issues with the postal service and COVID. M called CU to see what the deal was, and all they had to say was they'd issue another check--but this one is dated for today, August 20th. This leaves a three week gap that interest has still accrued between July 29th and today. Not to mention, after Saturday there will be late fees accrued with Fifth Third, and potential for a ding on M's credit.

When M expressed this concern with CU, they said they are not responsible for the additional accrued interest, only the original amount agreed to on July 29th. The way we see it, this would not have happened if the CU had sent the check through a more secure system such as wire transfer, UPS, or FedEx, or any other trackable system that would indicate where a $33k check is. CU didn't even realize their check hadn't cleared until M started calling about the problem.

Do we have any recourse here? Dealing with the CU has been mind-numbing, and we have difficulty getting them to return phone calls or emails about simple questions. To make this worse, we're currently out of town so we can't just walk in and handle it face to face like I'd prefer. I'm interested to hear any other people's experiences with refinance problems, and how you handled it. Thanks in advance.",finance

personalfinance,"Where exactly is the ""cash value"" in cash value life insurance?","So, trying to decide on what life insurance to get, and from browsing /r/pf, I get the impression that permanent life insurance is not well-loved in general. However, I'm struggling to see why *anyone* would *ever* want the ""cash value"" component of those policies. All my reading so far has consistently yielded the same basic answer:

* Cash value policies are supposed to combine the death benefit paid out to the beneficiaries with a savings account (aka. the ""cash value"") that's accessible to the policyholder whilst they're still alive. That's why they're significantly more expensive than term policies. So far, so good. However,
* The only way you can access the ""cash value"" is either by:
  1. Taking out a loan against the policy, which still needs to be paid back with interest, or it *reduces the death benefit*
  2. Withdrawing funds up to the accumulated cash value, which again *reduces the death benefit* by at least the matching amount (although in many policies it can apparently have a multiplier greater than 1.0x, so it's reduced even further)
* If the policyholder dies, the accumulated cash value is *lost*, absorbed by the insurance company, unless:
 1. There's a rider on the policy which adds the cash value to the face value of the death benefit upon payout, which makes the premium even higher
 2. The policyholder argues with the company and convinces them to move the funds over to the face value, which, as some places nicely put it, they will ""probably agree to"" because ""they don't want to lose your business"", but which is otherwise entirely up to the insurer's discretion

So basically, all the ""cash value"" gets me is a way to donate a big wad of cash to the insurance company, which will be completely lost and taken by them in the event of my death, unless I pay even more to avoid that, or convince them to maybe give up some of that big wad of cash and increase the face value, which they might or might not do, and that's assuming I don't actually die before I successfully argue that. Both ways of ""accessing"" the supposed accumulated value aren't, because they're either withdrawals or loans (with interest!) against the *death benefit*, not any of the accumulated cash value.

Am I missing something, or is the so called ""cash value"" component literally throwing out money, and doing anything else with it, even putting it in a 0% interest rate account, is a better choice?",finance
personalfinance,Student Loans: SOS,"Reddit, I need advice. I need it bad. Like, riding a Greyhound for nine hours and holding two Gatorades captive in my bladder bad. SOS.

So, long story short, eighteen year old me took out an ungodly amount of student loans. I am now two years out from finishing school, and have about $85,000 in debt already. There are different interest rates on all the loans, but the biggest loan of about $50,000 has a 6% and another that currently sits at $15,000 has a 7 %. The rates on the rest of them are not quite so villainous. Most of the loans are in my name, but the big boy is a PLUS loan in my parent's name, which I have agreed to pay.

Herein lies the quandary: I am responsible for all of the above loans. My parent struggles financially already and can't help. I make 15/hr and have no career direction. I'm sick to death with worry that I'll be making the same or close to the same amount after I graduate, which means I'll be Fucked. The payments, even with ICR on my parent's PLUS loan, will be at least $1200/month.

What if I can't find a job that pays me substantially more than I make now?

Edit: My first year of college is responsible for the bulk of the loans. It was at an expensive out of state university and at the time I believed I would become a doctor (ha, ha); I was enrolled as a neuroscience major. After that year, I transferred to a community college and went half time, paying out of pocket. Then I took a semester off before going to the online university, which is 476/credit. 

So to everyone freaking out about a 40,000/yr hort degree, that is not the case. The program I'm in now is WAYYYY cheaper than the initial program I started in and transferred out of. Now it's just about figuring out where to go from here.

CryptoCurrency,How would a real stock market crash affect bitcoin?,"What happened back in March really was actually a liquidity crises, which is why we seen all assets crash at the same time. Gold, oil, stocks, bonds, bitcoin, etc... People (institutions) were liquidating their assets for the incoming economic changes coming during the pandemic. The federal reserve (and other reserve banks globally) quickly solved this crises by basically flooding the system with money. Everyone is under the impression that the stock market crashed bitcoin, but I'm under the impression that the gold market is actually what crashed bitcoin. Institutions actually sold off their gold days AFTER selling off their stocks, using gold money to buy back stocks at cheaper prices.

What's interesting right now is that both gold and stocks are in bull markets. Historically speaking, decades of gold bull markets happen during decades of bear markets in stocks. World wide GDP is plummeting, suggesting that stocks are significantly over valued. 

I guess my question is, can we have a scenario where bitcoin (as a speculation of gold) can be in a decade long bull market when stocks will be in a decade long bear market?",cryptocurrency
investing,Gold,"Can't post charts here, but a clear correlation (not surprisingly, I guess) resides between Personal Consumption Expenditures as a % to Currency in Circulation, and the nominal 10 year treasury note yield. This is to say, since the 1960s, they move in tandem. Correlation is not causation, I get it. None-the-less, the correlation exists to the tune of 0.87, which spans 696 months. 

There's no relenting on currency growth... yes, the physical kind; even the M2 kind. I know there's much (more) talk about M2 growth, and rightfully so, but I am just looking at the most basics of basics. In any case, we are operating in a world of negative real yields again. A near-perfect symmetry exists between the real 10 year treasury note yield and the price of gold, i.e. the more negative the yield, the higher the price of gold moves. Again, nothing new here.

As best I can tell, the excerpts I have read (can't recall the sources) of M2 growth and the concern with inflation appear unjustified, just gazing over historical charts. I don't even see a lag, i.e. M2 growth YoY leads to higher rates of inflation x-period later. Feel free to correct me if I am wrong.

All this said, I am not seeing what I once believed, in that nominal rates will rise, even in the absence of the Fed enacting curve control, etc. If I were to best assume any structural change in rates at this point, going back to paragraph 1, it's currency in circulation being retired; this is a rare ""phenomenon"".

I suspect inflation will be higher than 1% and, less any shock, less than 3% over the near to medium term as best I can read, which I am not all that literate on; again, feel free to chime in here if you believe these expectations are off the mark. Real rates likely to persist negative, and possibly extending lower, somewhere between negative 150-250bps. Only seems beneficial for gold.

personalfinance,Open new checking to use old checking as savings?,"Okay hear me out, the reason why I want to complicate this is because I've just noticed that my current checking account has an APY of 1.25% while my savings only has 0.5%.

So would it make sense to open an entirely new checking account somewhere else and then just deactivate my current debit card / remove any other connections to that checking account and just use it as a savings?

I had to borrow 3 private loans from NJCLASS: (1) $40,609 at 7.2% interest over 20 years, (2) $21,941 at 6.5% interest over 20 years, and (3) $11,217 at 6.5% interest over 20 years.

 I had to borrow federal loans: (2) subsidized federal loans totaling $9,000 and (2) Unsubsidized federal loans totaling $4,166.

I work 2 retail jobs currently and am taking in about $1500 a month. My expenses are low. I live at home (no rent) and am not paying for insurance or phone bill. I have roughly $10,000 in my savings.

I'm looking for jobs and am applying for jobs in my field, the starting salaries are generally around $35,000 to $40,000; but most jobs haven't even considered me. I have an interview with a sales team and could be making $35,500 if hired. I'm just not sure how I'll ever be able to afford living on my own or even begin to pay this down, does anyone have any advice?",finance
personalfinance,"Need a private student loan in Spring semester, no cosigner - how will I know I'm ready to apply?","Hi everybody, thank you for taking the time to help me out. 

I'm a student at a state university who only gets partial federal loans, and the rest has to be funded elsewhere. My parents have a lot of debt, and recently had to take a lower paying job, and as such don't have the money to help me with tuition anymore. Luckily, I started working on my credit about 12 months ago. I applied for student loans last month - 2 credit cards, 1 personal loan (credit builder from Self); 100% on time; $702 total debt ($202 CC + $500 loan); 40% credit utilization; 6 hard inquiries in the last 12 months (mainly looking for student loans + the 3 mentioned); 688 credit score. I was denied from multiple lenders - Discover, CollegeAve, and some others that didn't require a hard pull that I don't remember. I did not apply for Wells Fargo, who I bank with, because I didn't realize it was an option. 

Anyway, I was denied and told to get a cosigner. It's some family drama, but basically a family member left my parents on the hook for their debt and their credit is trashed. My score is probably the highest in the family. I'm unemployed at the moment and when I applied, but I start working again on Monday. 

I barely, barely managed to scrap up the leftover ~$3,500 I needed for tuition this semester. But I'm going to struggle mightily with living expenses and have no way to pay for next semester's tuition. A loan for this semester would be a big help, but a loan for next semester is absolutely necessary. 

When should I apply again? What should I get my score to, and what should be my next steps? I thought I got my credit utilization down to 0 last time, but one of my credit cards didn't report like I thought it would and hurt my score. It was at $0 at the time but it wasn't on my monthly statement like that. I'm nervous about applying too often because of the hard pulls, like I said I already have six from the last 12 months. 

I've been denied on three seperate attempts now, and I'm starting to feel like an ISA like Stride is my only option. But, I'm a junior in a CS program and I'm pretty good at it. I feel like I could get a $100k job after graduation, and even if I get a low % from their ISA, I feel like my income will be so high that I end up having to pay back the maximum which is double. So a $5,000 loan would be $10,000 over 5 years - the equivalent of a 20% interest rate. It feels like I'd be getting f*cked in that deal - I want a traditional interest rate and just pay it off early. 

Thank you for reading and I appreciate any advice. It's so discouraging working on my credit for so long only to be denied again. Do you think I should apply again this semester, or wait til the last minute for next semester so my score is as high as possible? Thank y'all for y'all's thoughts and advice.",finance
personalfinance,Better to be in debt to Federal loan or to car loan?,"12.5k in car loan with 7% interest rate $256 monthly

$10k in student loan (currently 4.5k, planning on taking out 5.5k to pay off car loan), 4% interest and won't start accumulating until I graduate which is another 2 years. 

It seems like a no-brainer to me, but maybe there are some things I don't know about either option. I should take the loan and pay off my car, which will lead to cheaper insurance as well, and then start paying off Federal loan now to reduce the interest I'll need to pay when I graduate. 

No I don't need the loan money for anything else. I have a free ride.",finance

personalfinance,I want to buy a house in the next year or so.... But where should I be focusing my attention?,"Hi! I float around reddit a lot but rarely ever post… and this’ll be my first time posting on here! Recently got introduced into FIRE and I’m a bit at a loss for what direction I should be going to achieve certain goals. I’ll try to shorten it as much as possible to get straight to the point.

23/F, graduated in Summer 2019 with a healthcare degree that I’ve at least made \~60k so far this year because of the overtime available due to the pandemic (and I’m expecting maybe by the end of this year I’ll probably be making about 70-80k). Otherwise if all things were normal and if I didn’t work overtime, I’d be starting out at around 52k a year. I’m expecting, once the pandemic is over and done with, I’ll probably average around that or a little higher.

Prior to discovering FIRE, one of my biggest goals was to pay off my student loans. I *thought* I was in 30k debt by the time I had graduated, and it’s my mistake (my family didn’t know how loans worked here in the US, I’m a first born, second generation immigrant) in not looking at the fine print with my student loans with how interest worked for unsubsidized loans (which was all I could qualify for). I *think* my actual debt was around 35k-40k including interest.

So when I started in September 2019 training at my hospital, I accepted a 10k tuition reimbursement contract with them in exchange for being committed for 2-3 years depending on how your performance is, etc. It’s almost been about a year, and I’ll qualify to receive the next part of that money soon. So here’s the thing... When I discovered this reddit, it was maybe a few weeks before COVID really hit the U.S. in ways I could have never imagined and impacted my career to the extent it’s made me realize what I’d be doing in the next 10-15 years or so, and I want to be at a point like a lot of the redditors here to where I can just easily quit from my job and live without being dependent on a place, or at least be working part time/PRN. What I do during this pandemic has really made me aware of how short staffed essential healthcare workers are, and it’s hard to get a break. I have worked from March-Now an average of 60-80 hours a week, and for a new grad, it’s scared me how I’ve even gotten this far. 6 days a week. I am, however, taking a step back, and trying to only do 5 days a week and trying to keep myself sane by hitting more towards only 60 hours.

The benefit with the pandemic is the fact that interest accrual on my loans and payments were deferred (and from my understanding, will be until September or December…?) and I had been aggressively paying those off since I started working. I did splurge at the end of 2019 by getting a lot of high end gifts for my family and friends who were really supportive of me throughout my last year of college, as I was at a competitive internship at the same hospital I’m at now.Otherwise, I’ve allocated a lot of money towards paying off my loans, and  I’ve only got around $12,000 left in debt. 4 out of the 6 loans left have an interest rate of 4.45% and the other two are 3.65%, but the lower interest rate ones are the highest balance ones ($3,000 each).

As the title reads, I’ve recently decided I’d like to buy a house, but where I live is HCOL. I’ve been looking into first time homebuyer programs, and I think I’ll potentially qualify for them and if I do, I’d potentially get a 0% interest loan at the least, maybe enough money for closing costs. I have a general idea of what area I’d like to be in and I’d like to do house hacking potentially or set up a part of the house for airbnb when everything dies down a bit. I had a soft pull done on my credit back in April, when I was looking at potentially getting an apartment (but decided to live at home instead to help out with family matters), it was about \~760. I have two credit cards, always pay them off, use one for bills, and the other for large purchases or miscellaneous things I’m trying out (that I immediately pay off after) -- specifically the Discover It card and the Chase Freedom Unlimited. On those apps and on the Mint app currently, my credit score is above 800.

After talking with a couple friends in the real estate business, they think if I get my credit score high enough, I could have a relatively low interest rate on my mortgage (I'm hoping to qualify for 150-250k if needed, but towards the lower end), which would be awesome.

With all that’s said and done however, I’m not sure how to proceed raising that credit score -- Do I pay off the rest of my loans first? Should I open a new credit card now if I want to buy a house in the next year or so? Am I not allocating enough of my paycheck to loans or to something like my house fund? Should I temporarily borrow money from my 401k for this house? Should I put money into investments to speed up the amount of money I make passively for the house down payment? Is any of this even realistic at this point? I figured this would be the best place to ask, but forgive me if my replies are delayed a bit (I'll have limited wifi access with where I'll be in the next few hours and data on my phone is slow), but I appreciate the help regardless! Here’s stats btw if those will be needed:

(According to Mint) Net worth: +$18,854

What I make on average every two weeks:

* Pre tax: 3,000-3,500 (\*because of the overtime)
* Post tax: 1,000-2,000 (\*is case dependent because I’ve been messing with the percentage I allocate to my 401k)

Loans:

1. 2,000
2. 2,000
3. 1,000
4. 1,000
5. 3,000
6. 3,000

* 1-4 are all 4.45%
* 5-6 are 3.65%

\*I’ve been putting in around 600-1,200 every two weeks if possible, case dependent on whats going on every two weeks at home

Bills (on average monthly): \~400-800

* I’ve been mainly experimenting on diets/self care stuff since my family didn’t have the kind of money to do that and I have really bad skin problems, but this amount also reflects on money I’ve been using to let my family (my parents and two siblings) relax a little and eat out every once and awhile/take out since my mom mainly did 80 hours a week for awhile, but I pay for subscriptions and a lot of miscellaneous expenses otherwise for my parents (as I like living rent free lol)

401k: \~25,500

* 17,500 was contributed this year, so I’m close to maxing out the amount and I’m not sure whether to just go ahead and max it all out now or spread it out til December
* About 5,000 is Roth, the rest is Traditional
* If I max it out now, I was going to open a Roth IRA either at Fidelity or Vanguard

Emergency Fund: \~3,000

* About 2,000 is allocated in a HSA, the other 1,000 is in a credit union for safety measures as the HSA takes a few days if you transfer money from one bank to another

House Fund: \~2,000\*

\*This is like this only because I dipped into this money when I had a trip to the ER that roughly cost me 3,000 because I fell at work and for whatever reason it didn’t get covered in my work place’s compensation policy -- so I may need to fight a legal battle… maybe? Also, when I’m ready to buy the house, my parents have also decided whatever I’m short for the down payment, they’d cover the cost of, but they promised at least $10,000. I’d like to do this purchase as much as possible without their help, only because they’ve struggled a lot as first generation immigrants just to make life as best as possible for my siblings and I here but I figured it’d be a good note to put in.

Thank you all so much! This reddit has really been informative with the HSAs and stuff!",finance

If I put down less, the interest rate is 3.375% but will leave me with around $50k in savings.

personalfinance,Should I pay off my moderate interest debt or max my Roth IRA?,"I have reviewed the Flow Chart and have been following it closely to better my financial situation; however, I am at a cross-road when it comes to the step that I am on. Why should I pay off my debt instead of maxing my Roth IRA? 

Background: 24M, $3000 take home per month - around a month's income as a retention bonus in the month of January.  I live off of less than $2,500 per month, and that includes saving/ using $600 of my monthly income to pay-off my high-interest debt, which I now have $0 of.

I make a budget every month and do a good job of sticking to it. I have an EF in an Ally HYSA equal to or slightly greater than 1 month of expenses. I invest only enough in my company's 401(k) to get the match. I will now begin working on increasing my EF to an amount that is equal to or greater than 3 months of my expenses (I am content with a 3-month EF at the time as my job is secure.), and I should be able to complete this by the end of 2020. I have \~$3,000 in my company 401(k), and I maxed out my Roth IRA for the first time last year.

I currently have 6 separate Federal Student Loans equaling around $20,000- $130/ month payment - deferred until the end of the year, apparently - interest rates range from 3.76% to 5.05%, and I have a financed vehicle that is $370/ month - the interest rate is 5.95%. 

Would it not be to my benefit to max out my Roth IRA so I don't ""lose the tax year""? I understand the immediate rate of return in using that $6,000 to pay off debt, but, if put in my Roth IRA, it will have &gt; 40 years to grow tax-free. My question is: is it a poor decision to prioritize maxing my Roth IRA ahead of paying down my debt given my current situation?",finance
personalfinance,Why put a down payment on a car?,"Most folks recommend putting a down payment on a new car, and I am failing to see the logic with current interest rates. The return I can get on keeping the down payment in other yield-oriented assets far outweighs the interest saved on a smaller loan (even at very conservative return assumptions). 

Yes I am more likely to be underwater on the loan if I get in an accident or need to sell the car in the first year...but the absolute $ I would put into the car is no different. Ie if the car is $50k and I put $10k down and wreck the car and I get $40k from my insurance...I pay the bank 40k and lose the $10k down payment. If I finance the $50k, I pay the bank 40k from insurance and 10k from my pocket.

So the question is, if my bank is offering the same rate regardless of the down payment, why would I ever put a down payment on a car?

investing,$AAL - American Airlines,"In the second quarter, American Airlines saw a huge decline in demand for air travel as people continue to avoid any kind of travel. Revenues were down by 86.44% YoY to $1.62 billion, while non-GAAP EPS was -$7.82. However, the consensus analyst estimates were already so low that the company managed to beat them even with this weak performance.

At the end of June 2020, American Airlines had a pro forma liquidity balance of $16.2 billion. Much of this is from government aid. In April, the U.S. Department of the Treasury approved financial assistance of $5.8 billion for AAL from PSP (Payroll Support Program) under the CARES (Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security) Act. This includes a $4.1 billion grant and $1.7 billion in low-interest rate loans. In exchange for the money, the company has agreed not to cut pay or fire workers at least till the end of September 2020. In July, the company signed a term sheet with the U.S. Department of the Treasury for an additional $4.75 billion. This loan is expected to be closed in the third quarter.

On July 31, Reuters also reported that airlines are pushing the U.S. government for an extension of a $32 billion payroll support program which is set to expire in September 2020. Additional government aid can enable the company to survive this crisis.

American Airlines has also been trying hard to keep itself afloat by reducing its cash burn rate from $70 million to $55.0 million in the second quarter. The company has aggressively reduced daily cash burn from $100 million in April to $56 million in May and only $30 million in June. American Airlines expects the daily cash burn rate to gradually reduce further in the third and fourth quarters.

American Airlines has managed to strike a deal with the Allied Pilots Association for voluntary options for pilots. The company saw more than 41,000 employees opt for leave or early retirement in 2020. The company has also saved almost $0.5 billion with a 30% reduction in management and support staff. All these are commendable achievements, considering that almost 85% of the company’s labor force is unionized. American Airlines had to downsize the labor, considering that it accounted for almost 30% of the company’s operating expenses.


The company is also working towards reducing operating and capex by around $15.0 billion in 2020. To that effect, the company has slashed its active fleet count by around 150 aircraft. This move implies reduced maintenance, training, and aircraft sparing costs in the coming months. The company expects the capacity reduction to also reduce its fuel and environmental-regulation related costs.

Fuel accounts for almost 22% of the company’s total expenses. The low fuel prices due to excess supply can be somewhat of a respite for the company in future months.

AAL has a dividend yield of 2.95%, which is not very high. The company is also working towards repaying its debt. Finally, the company does not have large non-aircraft debt maturities until June 2022.

American Airlines expects to become cash positive in 2021.

# Squeezes and other risks

We are going to cover three common risks that traders face: events; squeezes, asymmetric bets.

## Events

Economic releases can cause large short-term volatility. The most famous is Non Farm Payrolls, which is the most widely watched measure of US employment levels and affects the price of many instruments.On an NFP announcement currencies like EURUSD might jump (or drop) 100 pips no problem. 

This is fine and there are trading strategies that one may employ around this but the key thing is to be aware of these releases.You can find economic calendars all over the internet - including on this site - and you need only check if there are any major releases each day or week.

For example, if you are trading off some intraday chart and scalping a few pips here and there it would be highly sensible to go into a known data release flat as it is pure coin-toss and not the reason for your trading. It only takes five minutes each day to plan for the day ahead so do not get caught out by this. Many retail traders get stopped out on such events when price volatility is at its peak.

## Squeezes

Short squeezes bring a lot of danger and perhaps some opportunity.

The story of VW and Porsche is the best short squeeze ever. Throughout these articles we've used FX examples wherever possible but in this one instance the concept (which is also highly relevant in FX) is best illustrated with an historical lesson from a different asset class.

A short squeeze is when a participant ends up in a short position they are forced to cover. Especially when the rest of the market knows that this participant can be bullied into stopping out at terrible levels, provided the market can briefly drive the price into their pain zone.

&amp;#x200B;

[There's a reason for the car, don't worry](https://preview.redd.it/pm8j09czsdi51.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=88fa54fe275bbdab86d3e7103daa7709a8ca5e82)

Hedge funds had been shorting VW stock. However the amount of VW stock available to buy in the open market was actually quite limited. The local government owned a chunk and Porsche itself had bought and locked away around 30%. Neither of these would sell to the hedge-funds so a good amount of the stock was un-buyable at any price.

If you sell or short a stock you must be prepared to buy it back to go flat at some point.

To cut a long story short, Porsche bought a lot of call options on VW stock. These options gave them the right to purchase VW stock from banks at slightly above market price. 

Eventually the banks who had sold these options realised there was no VW stock to go out and buy since the German government wouldn’t sell its allocation and Porsche wouldn’t either. If Porsche called in the options the banks were in trouble.

Porsche called in the options which forced the shorts to buy stock - at whatever price they could get it.

The price squeezed higher as those that were short got massively squeezed and stopped out.  For one brief moment in 2008, VW was the world’s most valuable company. Shorts were burned hard.

&amp;#x200B;

[Incredible event](https://preview.redd.it/5b971c91tdi51.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9b9c735c39c5f6f1bd7e971e88e04341a7858fc)

Porsche apparently made $11.5 billion on the trade. The BBC described Porsche as “a hedge fund with a carmaker attached.”

If this all seems exotic then know that the same thing happens in FX all the time. If everyone in the market is talking about a key level in EURUSD being 1.2050 then you can bet the market will try to push through 1.2050 just to take out any short stops at that level. Whether it then rallies higher or fails and trades back lower is a different matter entirely.

This brings us on to the matter of crowded trades. We will look at positioning in more detail in the next section. Crowded trades are dangerous for PNL. If everyone believes EURUSD is going down and has already sold EURUSD then you run the risk of a short squeeze. 

For additional selling to take place you need a very good reason for people to add to their position whereas a move in the other direction could force mass buying to cover their shorts.

A trading mentor when I worked at the investment bank once advised me:

*Always think about which move would cause the maximum people the maximum pain. That move is precisely what you should be watching out for at all times.*

## Asymmetric losses

Also known as picking up pennies in front of a steamroller. This risk has caught out many a retail trader. Sometimes it is referred to as a ""negative skew"" strategy.

Ideally what you are looking for is asymmetric risk trade set-ups: that is where the downside is clearly defined and smaller than the upside. What you want to avoid is the opposite.

A famous example of this going wrong was the Swiss National Bank de-peg in 2012.

The Swiss National Bank had said they would defend the price of EURCHF so that it did not go below 1.2. Many people believed it could never go below 1.2 due to this. Many retail traders therefore opted for a strategy that some describe as ‘picking up pennies in front of a steam-roller’. 

They would would buy EURCHF above the peg level and hope for a tiny rally of several pips before selling them back and keep doing this repeatedly. Often they were highly leveraged at 100:1 so that they could amplify the profit of the tiny 5-10 pip rally.

Then this happened.

The SNB suddenly did the unthinkable. They stopped defending the price. CHF jumped and so EURCHF (the number of CHF per 1 EUR) dropped to new lows very fast. Clearly, this trade had horrific risk : reward asymmetry: you risked 30% to make 0.05%.

Other strategies like naively selling options have the same result. You win a small amount of money each day and [then spectacularly blow up](https://www.tampabay.com/business/how-tampas-james-cordier-went-from-high-roller-to-youtube-apology-after-losing-150-million-20190206/) at some point down the line.

# Market positioning

We have talked about short squeezes. But how do you know what the market position is? And should you care?

Let’s start with the first. You should definitely care.

Let’s imagine the entire market is exceptionally long EURUSD and positioning reaches extreme levels. This makes EURUSD very vulnerable. 

To keep the price going higher EURUSD needs to attract fresh buy orders. If everyone is *already* long and has no room to add, what can incentivise people to keep buying? The news flow might be good. They may believe EURUSD goes higher. But they have already bought and have their maximum position on.

On the flip side, if there’s an unexpected event and EURUSD gaps lower you will have the entire market trying to exit the position at the same time. Like a herd of cows running through a single doorway. Messy.

We are going to look at this in more detail in a later chapter, where we discuss ‘carry’ trades. For now this TRYJPY chart might provide some idea of what a rush to the exits of a crowded position looks like.

&amp;#x200B;

[A carry trade position clear-out in action](https://preview.redd.it/y1z1nnr4tdi51.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0460c19bb2d9e29020d6158ea8ed031ab29a1c3c)

Knowing if the market is currently at extreme levels of long or short can therefore be helpful. 

The CFTC makes available a weekly report, which details the overall positions of speculative traders “Non Commercial Traders” in some of the major futures products. This includes futures tied to deliverable FX pairs such as EURUSD as well as products such as gold. The report is called “CFTC Commitments of Traders” (""COT"").

This is a great benchmark. It is far more representative of the overall market than the proprietary ones offered by retail brokers as it covers a far larger cross-section of the institutional market. 

Generally market participants will not pay a lot of attention to commercial hedgers, which are also detailed in the report. This data is worth tracking but these folks are simply hedging real-world transactions rather than speculating so their activity is far less revealing and far more noisy. 

You can find the data online for free and [download it directly here](https://www.cftc.gov/MarketReports/CommitmentsofTraders/HistoricalViewable/index.htm). 

&amp;#x200B;

[Raw format is kinda hard to work with](https://preview.redd.it/f0qg3i56tdi51.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e9a2556e8c99e455ba7bd4838bd1775edba0325)

&amp;#x200B;

However, many websites will chart this for you free of charge and you may find it more convenient to look at it that way. Just google “CFTC positioning charts”.

&amp;#x200B;

[But you can easily get visualisations](https://preview.redd.it/q663yym7tdi51.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27966fe019384708d4fc985f71a3c41a37f9ca8f)

You can visually spot extreme positioning. It is extremely powerful. 

Bear in mind the reports come out Friday afternoon US time and the report is a snapshot up to the prior Tuesday. That means it is a lagged report - by the time it is released it is a few days out of date. For longer term trades where you hold positions for weeks this is of course still pretty helpful information.

As well as the absolute level (is the speculative market net long or short) you can also use this to pick up on changes in positioning. 

For example if bad news comes out how much does the net short increase? If good news comes out, the market may remain net short but how much did they buy back?

A lot of traders ask themselves “Does the market have this trade on?” The positioning data is a good method for answering this. It provides a good finger on the pulse of the wider market sentiment and activity. 

For example you might say: “There was lots of noise about the good employment numbers in the US. However, there wasn’t actually a lot of position change on the back of it. Maybe everyone who wants to buy already has. What would happen now if bad news came out?”

In general traders will be wary of entering a crowded position because it will be hard to attract additional buyers or sellers and there could be an aggressive exit. 

If you want to enter a trade that is showing extreme levels of positioning you must think carefully about this dynamic. 

&amp;#x200B;

# Bet correlation

Retail traders often drastically underestimate how correlated their bets are.

*Through bitter experience, I have learned that a mistake in position correlation is the root of some of the most serious problems in trading. If you have eight highly correlated positions, then you are really trading one position that is eight times as large.*

*Bruce Kovner of hedge fund, Caxton Associates*

For example, if you are trading a bunch of pairs against the USD you will end up with a simply huge USD exposure. A single USD-trigger can ruin all your bets. Your ideal scenario — and it isn’t always possible — would be to have a highly diversified portfolio of bets that do not move in tandem. 

Look at this chart. Inverted USD index (DXY) is green. AUDUSD is orange. EURUSD is blue. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Chart from TradingView](https://preview.redd.it/ksx0xii9tdi51.jpg?width=1199&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86b703a6d5ca32bb1a19799c5d957b76e094f8f2)

So the whole thing is just one big USD trade! If you are long AUDUSD, long EURUSD, and short DXY you have three anti USD bets that are all likely to work or fail together.

The more diversified your portfolio of bets are, the more risk you can take on each.

There’s a [really good video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nu4lHaSh7D4), explaining the benefits of diversification from Ray Dalio.

A systematic fund with access to an investable universe of 10,000 instruments has more opportunity to make a better risk-adjusted return than a trader who only focuses on three symbols. Diversification really is the closest thing to a free lunch in finance.

But let’s be pragmatic and realistic. Human retail traders don’t have capacity to run even one hundred bets at a time. More realistic would be an average of 2-3 trades on simultaneously. So what can be done?

For example:

* You might diversify across time horizons by having a mix of short-term and long-term trades.  
* You might diversify across asset classes - trading some FX but also crypto and equities.
* You might diversify your trade generation approach so you are not relying on the same indicators or drivers on each trade.
* You might diversify your exposure to the market regime by having some trades that assume a trend will continue (momentum) and some that assume we will be range-bound (carry).

And so on. Basically you want to scan your portfolio of trades and make sure you are not putting all your eggs in one basket. If some trades underperform others will perform - assuming the bets are not correlated - and that way you can ensure your overall portfolio takes less risk per unit of return. 

The key thing is to start thinking about a portfolio of bets and what each new trade offers to your existing portfolio of risk. Will it diversify or amplify a current exposure?

# Crap trades, timeouts and monthly limits

One common mistake is to get bored and restless and put on crap trades. This just means trades in which you have low conviction. 

It is perfectly fine not to trade. If you feel like you do not understand the market at a particular point, simply choose not to trade. 

Flat is a position.

Do not waste your bullets on rubbish trades. Only enter a trade when you have carefully considered it from all angles and feel good about the risk. This will make it far easier to hold onto the trade if it moves against you at any point. You actually believe in it.

Equally, you need to set monthly limits. A standard limit might be a 10% account balance stop per month. At that point you close all your positions immediately and stop trading till next month.

&amp;#x200B;

[Be strict with yourself and walk away](https://preview.redd.it/n9fg9s5btdi51.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27a6029f24d27d508e0356904ed3044419663dbc)

Let’s assume you started the year with $100k and made 5% in January so enter Feb with $105k balance. Your stop is therefore 10% of $105k or $10.5k . If your account balance dips to $94.5k ($105k-$10.5k) then you stop yourself out and don’t resume trading till March the first.

Having monthly calendar breaks is nice for another reason. Say you made a load of money in January. You don’t want to start February feeling you are up 5% or it is too tempting to avoid trading all month and protect the existing win. Each month and each year should feel like a clean slate and an independent period. 

Everyone has trading slumps. It is perfectly normal. It will definitely happen to you at some stage. The trick is to take a break and refocus. Conserve your capital by not trading a lot whilst you are on a losing streak. This period will be much harder for you emotionally and you’ll end up making suboptimal decisions. An enforced break will help you see the bigger picture. 

Put in place a process before you start trading and then it’ll be easy to follow and will feel much less emotional. Remember: the market doesn’t care if you win or lose, it is nothing personal.

When your head has cooled and you feel calm you return the next month and begin the task of building back your account balance.

Thanks for taking time to read this three-part chapter on risk management. I hope you enjoyed it. Do comment in the replies if you have any questions or feedback.

Remember: the most important part of trading is not making money. It is not losing money. Always start with that principle. I hope these three notes have provided some food for thought on how you might approach risk management and are of practical use to you when trading. Avoiding mistakes is not a sexy tagline but it is an effective and reliable way to improve results.

personalfinance,Using Retirement to Pay Off Debt,"I would appreciate insight on paying off some loans using my retirement. I have had a series of unfortunate circumstances and made some bad calls financially. I'm 32 and married with 3 kids. I have a good paying federal job. My retirement is in the L2040 and I contribute to get the matching 5%. We have been fortunate enough to avoid childcare costs but that's come at a price. Between our debt and monthly expenses my paycheck pretty much covers our expenses and not much extra. My wife is working part time making $11/hr, just finished taking all required college courses and covid has delayed her getting into a program until next year that will allow her to get into a decent career field making real money. Realistically she's 3 years away from getting into her career. 

I realize that moving 1 form of debt to another isn't a good idea and I realize that pulling from retirement is as well. However I am currently determined to fast track my snowball method of getting out of debt but lack any real knowledge of looking ahead and seeing if this is a bad idea. 

The details: 
I can pull a loan out against my retirement at an interest rate of 0.625% for 5 years at $417/mo payment and I'm paying myself back

With that I can pay off a loan at $350/mo (13.75%) and a credit card at $314/mo (15.75%) 

My combined monthly payments on those equal $664 and if I took the loan against my retirement I would save $247 a month that I can snowball into the rest of my debt. I'm deadly serious about the snowball because this is my retirement. By very loose calculations I can be debt free in about 5 years. This is not accounting for interest, doesn't include student loans (less than $20k between us) or mortgage, and also doesn't account for my wife's income because she'll be working full time for the next year until she gets into her program but also will go back to part time or less once she starts her program next year. 

Any insights are appreciated and please don't judge too harshly!",finance
personalfinance,Is a $34K mortgage refinance a thing?,"There is \~$34K remaining on my mortgage. It was originally 10-year fixed term at 3.5% interest. I have around 3-years left to pay on it at the current payment rate (I pay a bit extra against the principal each month). I believe interest rates have decreased a bit since I originally financed, so I was curious if it might be worth refinancing. The online refinance calculators I've found give me no results, presumably because $34K is too small an amount for a mortgage?

So I'm curious if I have any options for a remortgage or any other low-interest kind of loan. My credit rating is excellent. I understand I'm in a good position already compared to many, and I'm fine staying the course with where I'm at, just curious if I'm missing an opportunity to save a little.

personalfinance,Is now the right time to buy a house?,"Hello. I live with my girlfriend in Michigan: more specifically a town just outside of Ann Arbor called Ypsilanti.

I make 80k per year while my gf is currently unemployed. It is a seller’s market here and we would have to put an offer on something right away if we like it. Would it be smart to buy a house now while interest rates are so low? Our main goal other than owning a house would be to pay less per month for our housing costs.

personalfinance,Ineligible for financial aid for my first semester of grad school. Most private loans need me to be enrolled half-time to take out a loan.,"First time posting here, sorry if mobile formatting is wonky, all that good stuff. I’m going to cross-post to r/StudentLoans but let me know if this is the wrong place for this post!

I’m going into my first semester of my Master’s program this fall, which consists of one three-credit class I need to complete as a prerequisite before I can begin my applied coursework. Because I’ll be enrolled less than half time, I don’t qualify for financial aid and the handful of private loans I’ve looked into have the same half time requirement. I’m now on the hook for a little under 4 grand in tuition, which is about a quarter of my current annual income. The payment plan offered by my college is about $800/month over the course of the semester (in short, I can’t afford it). 

I’m trying to avoid taking out a personal loan, as those tend to have pretty high interest rates compared to student loans. I have pretty good credit and a credit card that could cover it, but I *definitely* don’t want to pay the interest on that. Would it make sense for me to put it on this credit card and then transfer the balance to something with a 0% introductory rate on balance transfers? Or would this just put me in a difficult position later down the line? I wouldn’t complete my program until August 2022 at the earliest, and the time commitment is such that I’ll only be able to work 15 hours a week at most starting in January. 

I’m also curious about whether I’m able/allowed to take out extra money when I *am* eligible for student loans to pay off the debt for this class. I figure the ~5% interest rate for student loans is at least a bit better than the 20%+ I would pay if it’s on a credit card. 

I really appreciate any input, and I’d love to hear if anyone has any ideas or resources I haven’t thought about here! TIA!",finance
personalfinance,Leaning towards Refinancing my Mortgage with my Current Credit Union vs Banks with Better Rates,"Looking to receive some feedback on my current situation. I purchased my home in 2018 with my local credit union with a 20-year fixed rate at 5.25%, no PMI. Now, the credit union is offering 3.75% with less than $2K in fees. Shopping around I've found most large banks are able to offer me rates of 20 years at 2.9% to 3.5% with fees in the $3,500 range. We plan to stay in this home probably another 5 years. 

My issue is that while the banks offer a lower rate, I really enjoy working with my credit union and their excellent customer service that I feel I can trust. They also don't require me to pay PMI (not sure of the reason) while the banks would require me to start paying PMI. Now, with the PMI, some of the banks would still be a slightly lower monthly payment due to the lower interest rates. 

Any thoughts on which direction to take? The spreadsheets say go with a different bank at a lower rate but my gut is saying stay put with who I trust and accept the 3.75% with the lowest fees and fastest cost recovery.

Zero high interest CC debt. 

I was unfortunately the victim of DOT negligence that damaged my vehicle considerably, but it’s all cosmetic. Lots of pits in the windshield and scattered paint damage on the front half of the car. I’m expecting a check from the state treasury to the tune of about $3500. 

I’ll for sure be touching up the paint myself to prevent corrosion in the future, but that leaves about $3480 left over. 

The way I see it I have three options. 

-	Pay off the car, free up the monthly $230 to widen the surplus in the budget. 
-	Hold cash, just in-case. 
-	pay to principal on the mortgage to get us closer to removing the PMI. 

The frugal side of me wants to pay the auto note off. Really badly. However, even with rates at record lows I couldnt borrow at 3.5% unsecured if we ended up needing the cash. I’m looking at rhe auto note like a 3.5% loan if I dont pay it off.

If applied to my all of my 401k withdrawal (up to 100k and minus the taxes) to my student loans, I would be able to free (by my rough guess) nearly $600 a month. I'm not hurting for money, but it would be nice to have flexibility in my savings ability, getting renovations completed, or whatever else life throws at me. 

If it went to my mortgage, I could refinance it and cut my monthly payment in half. This would mean I'd be paying around $900 in total living costs (utilities included) in a popular and growing metro area.

personalfinance,Credit Score Dropping as I Pay Off Student Loans,"Trying figure out why my credit score is dropping when the only activity is me paying off my student loans. With the 0% interest and being able to earn a lot of extra money under the table from motorcycle and bicycle repairs, I have been able to crush student loan debt. Without someone taking money off the top and 0% interest, my payments are actually having an effect on the principle (I have a VERY high interest rate).

As a result of high interstate rate, Navient claiming I don't qualify for different payment plan, me missing payments, Navient only offering me forbearance, me being desperate and excepting the forbearance, my student loan principle pretty much double from when I graduated. The balance was slightly more than double my salary. Between the loan growth and payment issues, my credit is decimated. I tried improving things by getting cards at things like Macy's or Kohlers, but they all closed my accounts as my score was plummeting. Their letters said they were closing the accounts do to my credit score being too low. So now my student loans are the only remaining line of credit.

From March to August, I've been able to bring debt from $54K to $9K. I'm still on track to be done by October. The issue is now that I'm seeing my credit score drop, 50 points. I was at 530 and now I'm at 480. My score was pretty battered from not being able to make payments and the DTI ratio, but this is none of that. I've been able to make on time payments for the last 5 years, so late payments should have already been calculated. I have not tried for any credit inquires as I know what the answer will be. I live in a cash only world, which really kinda sucks in a pandemic. Being how I don't have a credit card, my score can't be from me using more of my available credit.

2) Tesla is trading at a forward p/e of over 1,000; this stock price is only justified if they're doing 100-150Bn revenue per year (not net income). What's stopping me from selling and finding another company with better growth prospects in the medium term and then buying back into TSLA when the valuation makes a bit more sense?

&amp;#x200B;

Although, maybe the valuation on this stock will never make sense, based on present-day realities of earnings? 

3) What happens if the USD hyper inflates? 

4) What happens if the US economy seriously contracts post qe? 

5) In March we saw Tesla drop down to \~$345, and this was before qe was announced; it is within the realm of possibility that this could happen again.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr Tesla has no competition and is a great company, but the economy surrounding Tesla is shaky at best, the stock price doesn't justify current earnings and won't for another 3-7 years (depending on how long it takes them to get from 40bn - 100/150Bn annual revenue).

personalfinance,"I was trying to refinance, and my current mortage company wont refinance because I am self employed","Current rates are over 1% lower than what I have, I own about 40% of the home, and I have had consistent income even as self employed because I am still paid by the same company I always have been just no longer 1099, they pay me as a company.

Is that ridiculous to anyone else?

I understand the concern about the risk, but they already have my risk.  The only change here is the interest rate and possibly the time.  Though I was going to refinance for about the same amount of time as I have remaining.

personalfinance,Does a tax lien on my personal home [MO] affect the proceeds I am receiving from the sale of real-estate [KY] from my deceased grandmother? And a couple other questions...,"My grandmother passed away this year, and the proceeds from the sale of her house in Kentucky of almost $75k may be distributed to my father (50%), my brother (25%), and myself (25%). We haven't made this official with the title company yet, but that is what my dad was thinking was fair to split up. He and my uncler are the heirs, but he plans to share his half with my brother and I. I have a federal tax lien on my own home in Missouri. Does my lien affect this distribution in any way?

One thought my Dad (age 71, 10% bracket) had was to maybe distribute 99% to himself and gift $14k to me and my brother. For tax reasons, would this be a better route than doing 50/25/25 like stated above? I will be firmly in the 24% tax bracket for 2020, but the additional $14k may push my brother over the threshold into the 24% bracket.  
Edit: The value of the house when deeded to my father &amp; uncle was $82k and sold for $160k. Since my dad is in a low tax bracket, does it makes more sense for him to take brunt of the capital gains tax by distributing 99% of the proceeds to him?

personalfinance,Where to move student loan payments?,"Long story short, My wife and I have student loan payments, but she has substantially more than me (19K vs 62K). I only have federal loans, and about 40% of her loans are federal, so almost half of our loans are at 0% right now. Her 37K of private loans have been refinanced down to 4.49%

My questions are:

- Should I pause payments on my other 0% loans and throw all of that money at the private loan? 
- Does paying $0 on student loans during the pandemic damage your credit score? We're looking to buy a house around the end of the year, so I'm wary of damaging my credit score.

personalfinance,Moving investments over from brokerage account to Roth IRA,"Hi y'all, I'm a 21 y/o college student who recently opened up a brokerage account and invested a little over $1k in (mostly) ETFs to learn a bit more about investing long-term. I had spent a while thinking about this, and debated between going with a Roth IRA and a brokerage account. The choice to go with a brokerage account was somewhat of an impulsive one, because I had been indecisive for a while and just wanted to get started. However, given the fact that my goal is learning to build wealth in the long term, I'm starting to wonder if maybe going with a Roth IRA would have been more appropriate for my situation.

For reference, I have about $30k saved up, $17k student loan debt (majority of it is federal direct loans with about 4-5% interest), and no retirement savings. Any suggestions for where I should go from here? Should I hold on to my brokerage account, or move everything to a Roth IRA?

* I know that I cannot directly transfer my brokerage account assets to a Roth IRA. What I'm trying to figure out is: is it worthwhile for me to close down the brokerage account and open up a Roth IRA?

I immigrated to the U.S. from Canada a few months ago, and I'm trying to build up my U.S. credit score as quickly as possible in order to get the best rate possible when I apply for a mortgage in the next couple of years. My credit score in Canada was about 800 when I left, but my U.S. score is hovering between 740-760. I would ultimately like to get it to around 800 as well. I've opened 2 credit cards since moving, and I've had a card through RBC's U.S. subsidiary for a little over 2 years, which gave me a bit of a head start with my U.S credit. I realize the hard inquiries from opening the new cards have hurt my score in the short term, but I'd rather take the hit now so it can recover by the time I'm shopping for a mortgage. I always pay off my balances in full each month, so payment history isn't an issue, and I also keep my credit utilization well below 30%. Obviously I will just have to wait for my credit age to improve with time, but I'm wondering if getting an installment loan to improve my credit mix would be worthwhile. Do you guys have any recommendations for lenders that will give me a small loan at a reasonable interest rate solely for the purpose of improving my credit?

3 years from now, I'll have \~10K (Considering my current expenses, planning to finish my college debt at the earliest) in my bank that I would like to invest in Mutual and Index Funds. However, I cannot contribute to TIRA or Roth IRA, I'm currently maxing out my contributions in 401K and my AGI is around 120K already. Excluding TIRA, Roth IRA and 401K from the picture, I would like to invest my money in something similar to a Roth IRA/Roth 401K, wherein I put after-tax money and it grows tax-free. 

Few things I have explored, CD Ladder (low interest rates, still will be taxed at the end of the day), Crypto (Not ready to risk in Crypto), Stocks and ETFs (taxed again). 

Not sure if this matters, I'm a F(32). Looking for better returns (10+%) and don't mind investing it for 10+ years if needed, easy liquidity will be preferable but not mandatory. Any suggestions will be appreciated!

personalfinance,"Just found out my parents (62M, 57F) have their entire life savings in New York Life whole life insurance and annuities","**Background**

Parents are frugal, risk-averse, first-generation immigrants (with US citizenship) living in south Florida and they own a small business without any other employees. They also don’t have health insurance.

Thanks to the current virus situation in Florida, I wanted to see how they were doing in terms of retirement and if they could move back to their home country — which has great, affordable medical care and a much lower CoL — which is when I discovered what I wrote in the title and that they have no other savings. To say I was horrified is an understatement, but there’s nothing to do but move forward and control the damage. I had Parents give me the login info for their New York Life accounts so I could see what was up.

I’m hoping you kind folks can help me determine if my plan is optimal, especially with Parents being so close to retirement age. I’m ignoring their assets and liabilities in this post because we’ve gotten the ball rolling on those already and I’d like to focus on what we’re not familiar with, which is all these crazy policies.

**New York Life Policies**

In total, Parents have 13 policies: 6 life insurance, 4 annuities, and 3 “Premier II” policies

&amp;#x200B;

|\#|Type|Insured|Cash Value|Face Value|Tax Type|Start Year|Yearly Premium|Notes|

|13|Premier II|Dad|$49,500||Roth IRA|2017|Total: $45,300||

**Discussion so far**

* Difference in premium between whole life and term life = done
* The agent who sold them all of these policies (it’s been the same lady for 20+ years) is not their friend, please stop buying policies = done
* What they’ve earned from investing in whole life vs. what they could’ve earned if they’d invested in the S&amp;P 500 = done (as an informative “FYI, this is serious money” discussion)
* The tax advantages of putting money into their IRAs instead of annuities and whole life = sort of done, Brother and I are not that well-versed on SEP IRAs, nor do we know if these annuities qualify the way we think
* What happens if they invest in index funds and then the entire US economy collapses and they lose everything = Brother and I did what we could to reassure them, but as mentioned before, Parents are extremely risk averse and have no other savings

**Plan**

1. Cash out Policies # 1-6 (whole life), buy term life for Parents, put the rest in a Vanguard brokerage account, invest in index funds with a 60/40 stock/bond split (or whatever Parents are comfortable with)
2. Rollover Policies # 7, 10, 11, 13 (SEP IRAs and Roth IRAs) to Vanguard and get those investing; future salary will max out SEP IRA and Roth IRA before going to the taxable brokerage account
3. Cash out Policy #9 and move that to the taxable brokerage account
4. I’m unsure about Policies #8 and #12 (the annuities). The website won’t let me access the contracts online so I don’t know what kinds of fees or stipulations might come into play later on down the road. I asked Parents to try and find them but so far, no luck. Since Parents are so risk-averse, maybe it would be better to keep these? The payout rate doesn’t seem...terrible... But if Parents were to keep the annuities: Do the Rollover IRA and Transfer IRA classifications mean Parents should keep rolling over funds from other IRA accounts? Should Parents continue to fund the annuities at all, or would it be better to just let them sit and grow and invest extra money in the taxable brokerage account?

personalfinance,Need Help Financing a Property With 2 Manufactured Homes,"I found a great property with 6 acres, usable land for what I need, and has 2 manufactured homes. Toured the property, homes are older 1986, but in good shape, some updating and they'll be good. Permanent foundations. 2 addresses. State of Virginia.

I request my agent to make an offer and he comes back to me saying that the lender will not finance 2 manufactures homes. Not just that particular lender, but all lenders who sell to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as it is against their guidelines. ~~No idea why.~~ A Wells Fargo lender called it ""cross collateral"".

My agent said the only way would be to go to a portfolio lender as they would keep the mortgage in house, but as a result I would incur higher interest rate and will need to put 20% or more.

I will not go this route and I'm looking for other options.

Currently waiting to hear back from USDA to see what they say. I read somewhere online that they might be willing to consider 2 MF homes as its more common in rural areas. The manufactured homes are over 2800 sqft, but I'm holding out hope as the USDA site says ""**Generally** be 2,000 square feet or less"".

investing,Private Placement Program - Fake or Genuine?,"I own a real estate business in India dealing with land development and residential construction. As the RE sector has been suffering for the last 3-4 years, I was looking for funding for my company in various avenues to complete my on going projects. I got approached by a few people who said that if I have certain amount say $1 million in my company account, I could get funding through something called Private Placement Program (PPP). 

As per their explanation, The term “Private Placement” represents a category of investments that are not available in the open market. There exists a special type of PPP that is sometimes referred to as a Private Placement Investment Program, Private Placement Transaction Program, Managed Buy/Sell Program, or Bank Trade. These are private and by invitation only. 

PPP Trading takes place all over the world from the limited platform among top – tier banks. They are only available to Ultra High Net Worth Individuals or Qualified Institutional Investors. They occur at the upper echelons of the world financial system and are not available to the general public. The returns are usually contractual double-digit monthly returns and the capital is not put at risk in the trading. With properly structured programs, the Investor’s capital never even leaves their own bank account. Trade proceeds are usually disbursed weekly, over a 40-week period (international banking weeks over 12 calendar months).
These are regulated by strict guidelines established by the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, and the Bank of International Settlement (BIS). But most of the time it is looked by Federal Reserve.

So for example, if I have $1 million in my company account, after signing some documents along with bank statement and confirmation from the bank regarding balance in the account, the trader trades this deposit amount in the international market for a period of 40 weeks. I, as a investor will be getting weekly returns for the amount held in my account. Returns will be in the range of 10 to 25 percent of $1 million dollars on weekly basis (not yearly but weekly 10 to 25 percent). Please note that the amount will never leave my account in Indian bank. I will not be giving any signed cheques or anything else where I will be risking my funds being withdrawn. I will only be giving signed document with my company information in their format and signed bank statement with verification of funds. The funds will be blocked for 40 weeks in my account in India bank (that’s the only opportunity cost for me) and after which I will be free to use my amount in whatever way I want. I have googled PPP and there are some website that talk about it and explain the same thing.

I know all of this might sound fake but I also know that there are a lot of bank instruments and transaction which common man like myself will not be aware off. CDOs and MBS where very uncommon terms before 2007 and if someone told these things existed, people would probably laugh. Therefore my question is, 1) is PPP genuine or fake? Has anybody heard of such things. Does such transactions actually happen in the US or European Money Markets? 2) if it does happen there, is it something that happen in India? 3) if it happens here, how does it work? 

I am desperately looking for some genuine answers.

*****
&gt; Market pros hold out little hope that Congress will agree to a stimulus package before September, but they will look to Jerome Powell in the coming week to provide a roadmap for what else the Fed might do to help the economy.
*****
&gt; The Fed holds its annual Jackson Hole symposium starting Thursday, and it will conduct the Kansas City Fed-sponsored meeting virtually rather than against the backdrop of the Grand Tetons as it normally does at this time of year. The Fed chairman speaks Thursday morning on the implications for monetary policy and the Fed’s anticipated policy framework review.
*****
&gt; The past week was a big week for markets, with the S&amp;P 500 finally recovering its losses from the pandemic selloff and setting new all-time highs. Stocks have been big beneficiaries of the Fed’s easy policies and low interest rates, and Fed officials are widely expected to sound dovish when they meet in the coming week.
*****
&gt; “I think we know the Fed’s all in. If anything they want the mechanicals to work right,” said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. “The basic Fed policy is crystal clear. You’re going to have low rates for the foreseeable future. They will do whatever it takes.”
*****
&gt; But Fed watchers expect Powell to go further than the Fed’s already extraordinary support for the economy and financial conditions, and offer guidance on new language and policies that will help the markets understand how long it might hold those low rates and extraordinary policies in place.
*****
&gt; For instance, the Fed was expected to provide a more explicit forward guidance policy, and it could also introduce inflation averaging, meaning the Fed could specify that it could both undershoot and overshoot its 2% inflation target. Inflation has only occasionally surpassed its target over the past dozen years, since the financial crisis.
*****
&gt; Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays, said he expects the Fed will introduce forward guidance and average inflation targeting at its September meeting. He expects the Fed’s policy review to examine all of its policies to determine which work best in different circumstances.
*****
&gt; Since the markets collapsed in February and March, the Fed has cut rates to zero and helped increase liquidity with different facilities for different areas of the capital markets like commercial paper, municipal bonds and corporate bonds. It also created lending programs and continues to buy a large amount of Treasury securities and mortgages. Its balance sheet has now ballooned to $7 trillion.
*****
&gt; With average inflation targeting, the Fed would allow the economy and inflation to run hotter than target, without immediately taking steps to tighten policy, according to Jim Caron, fixed income portfolio manger with Morgan Stanley Investment Management.
*****
&gt; “What they’re saying is if the economy starts to recover, let’s say we get a vaccine, or the rate of infection goes down, and the equity market is on a tear, they’re not going to stop it,” said Caron. “They’re going to stay there for awhile. That’s what they’re trying to communicate.”
*****
&gt; # Where’s the stimulus?
&gt; As markets await clarity from the Fed, market pros are expecting less from Congress after first initially anticipating a stimulus package by early August.
*****
&gt; “At this point, the thing I’m most thinking about is are we going to get a stimulus deal or not,” said Keon. “I think the politics are shifting beneath that.” He said some Republicans in Congress may be less inclined to spend on a big package ahead of the election.
*****
&gt; Democrats and Republicans have been far apart in terms of the contents of the package. One hot button issue is the $600 supplemental weekly aid for the unemployed. It expired on July 31, and Republicans want to cut it to $200 a week while Democrats want to keep current levels. The White House meanwhile has moved to provide $300 a week in aid from FEMA funds but the states have to process those payments.

&gt; The two parties are also still far apart on the size of the package, after initially starting out with Democrats at $3 trillion and Republicans with $1 trillion.
*****
&gt; “Some folks are discovering their inner budget hawks. It looks like the positions of the two sides are moving further away rather than closer together,” said Keon. “As the election moves up on us, the possibilities of a deal are going down...the markets are slowly moving toward the idea we don’t get stimulus deal and we might get a Biden presidency. It’s not panicking about it.”
*****
&gt; The Democratic party held its convention this past week, formally nominating former vice president Joseph Biden to head the Democratic ticket. The Republican convention begins Monday. Biden leads President Donald Trump by an average 7.4 percentage points in the major polls, according to RealClearPolitics.com.
*****
&gt; Michael Schumacher, director rate strategy at Wells Fargo, said he too is becoming more skeptical a stimulus deal will get done. “As the election season gets going, it appears to be getting harder and harder, not from a timing standpoint but from a lack of goodwill standpoint,” he said.
*****
&gt; Strategists said if the economic data weakens, that could hurt stocks and get Congress back to negotiating a new package. There had been expectations a package would include a one-time payment for individuals and families, enhanced unemployment payments and aid for state and local governments.
*****
&gt; Raymond James Washington policy analyst Ed Mills said the two sides are likely to come together, but without a catalyst forcing them it may wait until they need to pass a continuing resolution on the budget Sept. 30. “Democrats are not going to allow for an appropriations bill to pass that does not include additional support for the economy,” said Mills.
*****
&gt; # It’s the economy
&gt; There is some key data in the week ahead that should show how manufacturing and the consumer are faring.
*****
&gt; Durable good is reported Wednesday, while personal income and spending data is reported Friday. Consumer confidence is Tuesday and consumer sentiment is released Friday.
*****
&gt; Energy markets will be keeping a close eye on two tropical storms that are heading into the Gulf of Mexico and could make landfall early Wednesday. One storm, Laura is tracking close to Florida, and a second storm, possibly to be named Marco looks to be heading across the Yucatan Peninsula before entering the Gulf.
*****
&gt; It would be unprecedented in the era of satellites and modern hurricane tracking technology for two storms to arrive within 24 hours. The Weather Channel reports there was such an occurrence in September, 1933.

&gt; # September Almanac: Only Modest Improvement in Election Years

&gt; Start of business year, end of summer vacations, and back to school made September a leading barometer month in first 60 years of 20th century, now portfolio managers back after Labor Day tend to clean house Since 1950, September is the worst performing month of the year for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 1000 (since 1979). Sizable gains in September 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2017 have lifted Russell 2000 to second worst (since 1979). September was creamed four years straight from 1999-2002 after four solid years from 1995-1998 during the dot.com bubble buildup.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/e4e433c87c6e4c76cefda4ccffbf5ab0/cfdd6d36ba180c35-7f/s400x600/836cc65ffaba5c46d56ea4566614d200638be344.jpg))**

&gt; Bullish election-year forces do little to improve on September’s poor overall performance over the same time frame. September’s performance does improve slightly in election years, but it is still negative nearly across the board. Only the Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 have been able to escape negative territory and post modest 0.2% and 0.8% average gains respectively in the last ten election year Septembers.

&gt; # 5 Charts To See With Stocks At New Highs

&gt; “Better late than never.”

&gt; It took a while, but the S&amp;P 500 Index finally made a new all-time high, coming all the way back from the vicious 34% bear market in less than six months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pic-8.19.20-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; It might bring back some scary memories, but back in March it took the S&amp;P 500 only 16 days to go from new highs to a bear market (down 20%), the fastest ever.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “This will go down as the fastest bear market ever, but also one of the fastest recoveries ever,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Then again, we’ve never quite seen a recession and recovery like this, so maybe it isn’t a shock to see new highs this quickly.”

&gt; The bear officially lasted one month and took five months to recover the losses. Usually when there’s a bear market during a recession, it takes 30 months to recover those loses. This was the third-fastest ever, with only 3 months to recover from a bear market recession in the early ‘80s and 4 months to recover from a bear market in the early ‘90s.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-3.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; It seems like earlier this year and new highs were a lifetime ago, but the S&amp;P 500 finally moved off unlucky 13, notching the 14th new high of 2020.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-4.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, returns after a long time without new highs actually get better. One, three, six, and 12 months after the first new high in more than five months show stronger performance than average or after any new highs. Yet another reason to think that this bull market from a long-term point of view could have some more tricks up its sleeve.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-5.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Last, we found there were four other times the S&amp;P 500 made a new high during a recession: In February ’61, July ’80, November ’82, and March ’91. Incredibly, a new expansion started the following month every single time. Could stocks at new highs be signaling an end to this recession? We think that very well could be the case again this time.

&gt; # Largest S&amp;P 500 Stocks + Tesla (TSLA)

&gt; Tesla (TSLA) is now up 50% over the last 10 calendar days dating back to August 11th. This has propelled the company way up the list of the largest US companies.

&gt; Below is a table of the largest stocks in the S&amp;P 500 with Tesla (TSLA) included. As shown, Tesla's $382.7 billion market cap would rank it as the 9th largest stock in the S&amp;P 500 were it in the index.

&gt; On August 11th, Tesla's market cap was just $256 billion, so over the last ten days it has leapfrogged companies like Walmart (WMT), Home Depot (HD), JP Morgan (JPM), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Mastercard (MA), and NVIDIA (NVDA). Next up would be Visa (V) and Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), which have market caps just under $400 billion. Click here to view Bespoke's premium membership options for our best research available.

&gt; # B.I.G. Tips - Earnings Season and Top Triple Plays

&gt; Walmart (WMT) wrapped up the Q2 2020 earnings reporting period on Tuesday with a huge beat on both the top and bottom line. It was a fitting end to what turned out to be a record-setting earnings season.

&gt; As we highlighted in our Q2 Earnings Season preview in early July, analysts were rapidly increasing earnings estimates leading up to earnings season. Normally when that happens, stocks have trouble performing well during earnings season because the expectations bar has been set higher. This season, even with analyst estimates on the rise in the four weeks leading up to the start of the reporting period, companies managed to beat bottom-line EPS estimates at the highest rate in the history of our database going back to 1999.

&gt; As shown below, 76% of companies reported stronger-than-expected EPS numbers this season, which eclipsed the prior record high of 73% seen during the Q3 2006 reporting period.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/beatratesbyquarter.png))**

&gt; Long-term Bespoke subscribers know how much we like earnings triple plays, but for those that haven’t heard of the term, we came up with it back in the mid-2000s. An earnings triple play is a company that beats EPS estimates, beats revenue estimates, and raises forward guidance all in the same quarterly earnings report. Investopedia.com is one of the best online resources for financial markets education, and they’ve actually given us credit for coining the “triple play” term on their website. We consider triple play stocks to be the cream of the crop of earnings season, and we are constantly finding new long-term buy opportunities from this basket of names each quarter.

&gt; This earnings season there were a massive number of earnings triple plays. We went through the list of this season's triple plays to find the ones that have the most attractive set-ups heading into the earnings off-season.

personalfinance,Is right now a bad time to buy a first home?,"I know interest rates are low, but is there a serious risk of a housing market collapse or a significant downturn if I buy a first home in November? My lease is ending and I have about 40k I can use for a down payment, excellent credit, and no debt. I've been hoarding cash because I feel the market is overvalued right now and we may be in for a broader economic downturn within the next couple of years, but I really want to buy a house cause I'm sick of feeling like I'm throwing money away on rent. For my current rent I've been looking around and it looks like I could own a 3-4 bedroom house for a smaller monthly payment than my current 2 bedroom apartment and actually *own* it.

My main concern is given the current fed-induced high the market is on, I feel it doesn't align well with economic reality and things might get dicey after the election which is right around the time I'd be closing. I don't want to spend 200k on my first home and see its value tank in 6 months or a year and be stuck holding the bag for ten years, unable to sell and move somewhere else if I want. I really want to own a home, but my gut is telling me right now is like the equivalent of buying in September of 2008. Am I just being paranoid? If I put it off for another year I could probably have close to 100k saved for a down payment. I know you can't time the market or predict the future but a house will be the single biggest purchase of my lifetime so far so I feel it's prudent to at least consider the timing of the decision.

Basically I'm at the point in my life where I have a lot of cash I don't know what to do with because I feel like the market is grossly overvalued. I've got a lot in the market already so it feels like the right thing to do is diversify or buy a home but I think I'm paranoid I'm gonna be stuck bagholding my first house if I buy at the end of this lease. 

Any advice from people who have recently bought or who bought around the 2008 timeframe? Thank you!",finance
investing,How to evaluate funds past performance in a state that doesn’t tax dividends?,"I just realized my state doesn’t tax dividends. I have a large chunk of money that, I’d like to invest, and then, sell in 3-5 years for a house. In other words, I know the investment will exist while I’m sill in my current state.

Looking at a REIT like [VGSLX](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/performance/vgslx), how could you roughly estimate “Returns after taxes on distributions and sales of fund shares” for a state that doesn’t tax dividends?

My guess is that that Federal and states tax at roughly the same rate (when states do tax). So, split the difference between Vanguard’s no tax and taxed ROI’s. For example, the 10 year “returns after taxes on distributions and sales of fund shares” would be 8.52 = 7.33 + (9.71 - 7.33) / 2

Previously, I’d only hold a REIT or other high dividend fund in a retirement account. But, I’m wondering if there’s an advantage of holding a high dividend fund while in a state that doesn’t tax the dividends.",finance

personalfinance,How do you payoff large debts in only a few years?,"I have seen a lot of success stories on here, and other locations, where people are paying off all their debt in a year or two. How? How do you do this while still paying your other bills? 

I have separate bank accounts set up where direct deposit goes to cover just enough  for what comes out of those accounts (one is for student loans and the other is for household expenses). For my household expense account, this covers things that have to be paid and aren't optional (utilities, insurances, property taxes, etc), so I can't trim anything there, and I obviously can't trim from my student loans account either. Between paying for school and expenses either related to school or when I was out of work I have a pretty decent chunk of debt. It has been in existence a while but I am just feeling overwhelmed by it now. I know how much money I am wasting on this and it is exhausting. I have never missed a payment nor have I gone over the limit or anything else negative, it's just a lot... 

Between credit cards and student loans I have roughly $50k, I am less worried about the loans as they have a low interest rate and if need be I can use PSLF for them in 7.5 years. 

My cards are a different story, those have high interest rates and I am throwing money away. In payments for those per month I am looking at about $930. With what I take home in pay per month, after paying my CCs I am left with about $430 (once again I am not including the student loans or household bills, this is strictly credit cards). Of that I still need money for food and fuel. How do I even tackle this? I have YNAB and aside from the bills I have to pay the only money I really spend aside from food and fuel is school expenses (going back but paying out of pocket this time). 

I started with the snowball method to knock out some of the smaller debts I originally had but am currently throwing money at my highest interest card at the moment.

personalfinance,Need a check on my plan to buy index funds instead of paying Student Loans,"Though a bit late (26M), I've realized I haven't really been putting my money into any growth. I've done some research and just getting into the groove of personal finance and investing from scratch. So wanted to double check my logic/plan before I start moving my money around.

* Current Back Account has 72k in a traditional savings account.
* Emergency Fund for me for 6 months would be 9k
* Currently going back to school for a career change and plan to graduate March of next year. Afterwards, looking to get into a masters program that will last 2-3 years(OMSCS).
* I have 18.5k in subsidized student loans from an initial attempt at college with interest rates varying being 3.4 to 4.2%.
* Future expenses: Tuition for my BS will be 3.5k and MS program 9k
* Based on what I've researched, due to the interest rate being so low and the fact that my loans will be deferred because I'll still be in school for some time, planning on dumping money to Index Funds.
* With index fund portfolio in a taxable account being: VTSAX (70%),VTIAX(20%),VBLTX(10%)
* I'll start looking into buying a very small amount of individual stocks, down the line for some risk and skin in the game, but wanted some time to do some research. Index funds for the time being is my plan.
* I max out my 401k (6% matched) and normally have 1.8k net income/month.
* I guess my uncertainty lies with would I be able to sell my index funds after I end school to pay off Student Loans.

More so for trying to move my money to the right place right now, does this plan make sense?

personalfinance,Worth it to pay a larger down payment to get a conforming (non jumbo) loan?,"We're buying a house! With 20% down, it would be a jumbo loan, or we can put 30% down so the loan is small enough to be conforming, which gives us a lower interest rate. Round numbers:

* **House price:** $1,000,000
* **20% down:** Jumbo loan would be $800,000 with 3% after buying one point ($10,000), $3373/month 
   * *buying this point helps a lot, 3.625% without it*
* **30% down:** Conforming loan would be $700,000 with 2.875% (no points), $2904/month
   * *we would invest the difference $469/month (VTSAX etc.)*
* Suppose we have exactly $300,000 to split between down payment, points, and investments (VTSAX etc.)
* 30 year fixed rate mortgage, and most likely we live there **10 years**, but who knows

Here's what we're trying to take into account. Are we missing anything? Any other suggestions on how to make this decision?

1. In the 20% down case, there's an extra $90,000 at the end we'd invest, which would hopefully make gains, but there's significant uncertainty. We **spent** $10,000 buying a better interest rate.
2. In the 30% down case, there's $100,000 more equity (locked up until we sell) and an extra $469/month to invest, which by the way is 6.25% of $90,000 each year. The total value after 10 years should have much less uncertainty--the equity just sits there, and the extra investments build up slowly.
3. We don't think there are major tax implications; we'll probably take the standard deduction either way ($24,800 married)

This is leading us to think we should put 30% down because the smaller monthly payment already gives us roughly the ""return"" we'd expect from investing the $90,000 instead, without any risk. However, that seems too simple, and it's contrary to the popular wisdom of ""you should get way better than 3% (mortgage interest rate) returns with other investments, so don't put more down.""

Any tips? Thanks!

**TL;DR:** When's it worth it to put 30% down to get a lower interest rate (conforming loan)?",finance

After sharing a bit more info (really just confirming existing info) and sharing my goals on just getting the lowest interest rate, we will be getting another call from a loan officer.

It turns out to be a loan sales guy saying he only got one approval on an 84 month term and is adding on warranty gap insurance and kept talking about that. I said, “I just want the lowest rate this rate and benefits are not what I’m looking for.”

personalfinance,Advice for building credit for Medical School Loans,"I am currently applying to medical school and have started to look at the financial side of medicine and need some advice on building credit. 

Some Background info. :

My knowledge when it comes to personal finance:

My experience with managing money is very limited. I am currently an undergraduate and have had my parents pay for my school and living costs. It is a bit embarrassing but it is what it is. As a result of this lack of practical experience, I have started an online lecture series on basic personal finance and have been reading a book on finance specifically for doctors called the White Coat Investor. 

My current situation when it comes to my credit and finances. 

Due to my parents completely financing my expenses and schooling throughout my undergraduate studies, I don't have any student loans. But I have not built any credit by having a credit card or line of credit. 

Why I think not having credit may be an issue:

From what I have read, Federal Loans for medical school do not check for credit scores but private ones do. This may be an issue for me because many of the schools I am applying to are private and have tuition rates that vary from the low 40ks. to mid 50ks. This is not including the cost of living. I will more than likely have to finance all of this cost on loans because my parents will not be able to help me past my undergraduate studies. 

Ideas to build credit for general living expenses and loans ranked by desirability:

Top Options: 

1. Obtain a Secured Credit Card
2. Pay utility bills and cell phone bills, and get these bills tied to my credit using The Experian Boost Line 

Iffy Options:

3 Become an authorized user - this option does not seem desirable because I do not want to have to rely on family members to make credit card payments on time 

4 Get a Line of Credit at a Retailer- I have no idea how this option would work because I did not find it on the sites I looked through talking about building credit as a beginner. If anyone could explain how this works and whether it is a good idea I would really appreciate it. 

In conclusion, I am looking for advice on how to build credit and maybe even general financial advice. I am a bit apprehensive in taking on these huge loans but I have read about the several options for paying these down and think if I live frugally after medical schools and aggressively pay down the loans medical school can be a viable option from a financial and personal fulfillment point of view.",finance

CryptoCurrency,"Token or stable coin that has a secondary token swap to handle interest rate, with interest rate goes up every second or minute or block?","There was a token I remember learning about a long time ago, can’t remember it’s name! 

Might have been a stable coin or a lending platform

Example:
You swap xUSD for yUSD and the exchange rate is set to go up some tiny amount like 0.0002% per second so that when you decide to convert yUSD back into xUSD you have earned exactly some specific yearly interest rate. yUSD I think only exists for this purpose.

Does this sound like any specific tokens you know of?

Are there any stable coins that do something like this that have a built in interest rate that is earned for simply swapping and holding on to the secondary token for a period of time?

personalfinance,Best Way to Pay For Infertility Treatments,"Hi there,

My partner and I have recently gone through a process by which it has been discovered that it will be very difficult if not impossible for us to have a child naturally without the assistance of in vitro fertilization therapy. While we are not particularly looking to have a child under our current circumstances, there may be a time element which would make the possibility of egg retrieval for later use increasingly difficult, and as such we are looking into beginning IVF treatments in order to obtain viable embryos for storage and potentially later use.

As some may know, these treatments can be incredibly expensive (\~$20k for a series of three rounds, not including medications which are several thousand more), are not covered by most, including our, insurance plans, and most, including our clinics require payment up front. We are in a fortunate position to be able to afford these costs in the long run but I was wondering if anyone had any particular insight on what the best way to go about an expense like this would be. 

We have the cash on hand (my partner received a life insurance benefit for a parent who passed away a few years ago, and has not invested or touched it since) though it comprises the bulk of our liquid assets. We both have credit scores over 800, and could either get a medical loan through a bank (APRs seemingly between 3-5% right now) or through services that seem to exist solely for financing IVF (interest rates seem higher and I can't find a benefit to these other than they likely have lower requirements for disbursement). 

In last month our income has risen to the mid six figures, though we live in a high tax state and I have just finished about a decade of professional training. As such my take home pay after student loan repayments is enough to continue to live a modest lifestyle and save for an emergency fund which we do not currently have, but not so much that I could afford a lump sum like this with a single or even several paychecks. 

In my mind, the best way I have come up to pay for this would be to increase the current limit on my credit card (which currently has no balance), charge the expense to that to get reward points, use the cash on hand to pay that balance off immediately, and then replenish that amount over the course of six months to a year. I do not know if there are any tax advantaged strategies like putting the money into an HSA account first and then paying for it or deducting it initially as a medical expense (part of this stems from the fact that my taxes will look significantly different this year for the first time in my life).

If you've read to the end of this, I really appreciate it, and if you have any ideas or advice I'm even more grateful. Thank you.",finance
personalfinance,Refinance my mortgage ??,"I'm in need of some finance brain power! Given the low mortgage rates I &lt;think&gt; it'd be worth refinancing and wanted to get the hives opinion just in case.

I have a $140k mortgage with 20 years left at 4.875%.  My principal and interest payment last month was $973.74 ($395.37 was toward principal). I expect to be in this house another 10yrs max.

My credit union  offered the following options.

No closing costs:
   20yr - 3.75% fixed, conventional
   30yr - 3.99% fixed, conventional

With closing costs of approximately $4k, which would be rolled into the mortgage:
  20yr - 3.125% fixed, conventional
  30yr - 3.375% fixed, conventional

I'm leaning toward the 20yr w/closing costs as that is the closest to what I'm currently paying and at a much reduced interest rate.

Private student loan 3% variable interest ($1,500 balance): $50
Student loan from my Dad 0% interest ($4,000 balance) and we pay his cellphone bill ($50 a month) as payment for my loan.

He does make $84,000 per year, but because of the amount of debt he can only make the minimum payments most months and thus he barely gets ahead. For example, his payment for card #2 had $420 go to interest and $220 go to principal. His statement estimates he will pay it off in 32 years.

Is bankruptcy the best option here? His credit score is already godawful (high 480s) and he already has a mortgage, so I don't see what more he has to lose.

personalfinance,Thoughts on refinancing my house?,"Hello,  


I wanted to get some more opinions about refinancing my house. I currently have $348,000 at a 4.6% interest rate left to pay from my 30 year fixed interest rate loan from 2012. 

I was wondering if it would be beneficial to refinance as interest rates are low now, although that would mean that I would be losing progress on the amount of years I had paid off. I'm having difficulty deciding if that is worth refinancing.   


More information:  


My credit score is near 800, six figure income (pharmasist), living in CA, born in 1966, and close to $600,000 in my retirement funds. I'm also not 100% sure that this is the house that I will retire in.   


Any thoughts and input would be appreciated!",finance
personalfinance,Should I invest in the Stock Market with money I intend to use next year?,"Hello all. I have a decent amount of money saved up for a downpayment of a rental property I plan on buying around July 2021. 80% of it is currently liquid and 20% is already in the stock market . Since I don't intend to use this money for \~12 months, I'm considering investing some of it so it grows instead of getting a meager interest rate (1%) in a Savings account since rates have dropped drastically this year. Of course, I'm also concerned that I might lose money if a recession happens and I won't have enough time to bounce back before July when I need the funds. 

So what makes more sense

1. Invest some of it so I have 50% cash and 50% stocks as a sort of hedge strategy
2. Stay on course. The 80:20 split I have is enough risk
3. Sell the other 20% because everything is already uncertain and it's not worth risking money I'll need to access soon
4. Invest some of the cash in a different place all together (not stocks/ETF/MFs)

Obviously noone knows when the recession will occur so the TLDR is ""Should you invest with money you'll need in the short term and if so, what's a smart way to do that?""",finance
personalfinance,Another messed over by the dealer story,"I stupidly agreed to a 3rd party warranty when i bough my car last month.  Luckily i found out they are cancellable, but dealers like to drag their feet or torture you along the process.  My first contact was with a different finance manager.  He said when the guy that wrote up my contract came in, he can void the contract and write a new one without the warranty.  Came back a couple hours later, he said its too late cause the bank has the contract already and it would cost a bunch of money to get it back.  I essentially told him i dont believe that and filled out a warranty cancellation form.  Its been almost a month.  I called the warranty company and there isnt even an active warranty for the car!   4000 for nothing.  The main lesson ive learned is dont ever do business with a dealer that has mandatory arbitration contracts.  I would have already taken them to small claims if that wasnt the case.  Anyways, im trying to figure the best methods for them to cancel the warranty they never activated yet im paying for.  Im going to see if there is anything the bank can do.  I have done one bad review to get their attention.  I already filed a complaint with the BBB and the department of insurance. Im considering it fraud or a breach of contract cause im paying for a warranty that doesnt exist.  There is also the federal trade commission.  Im not sure what businesses help take much action.

personalfinance,"Enough in savings to pay off most of cc debt, or should I keep balances of 30%?","Hi, just starting out after college. 

I have about 100k in student loans, the payments will start in November. I have a ~5.25% interest rate, I’m looking at about $800/month through the bank. Plus monthly loan payments of subsidized &amp; unsubsidized through the government which I don’t know the monthly totals yet for. It should be around $15,000 in all. I am interested in refinancing but do not know how to go about that. 

As of right now, I am making $1200 a month as a gig-worker. I am also making $20/hr for 15-20 per week at a corporation. So that equals out to about $2400-2800 per month. I also do side-jobs but that money is never reliable and usually goes straight into my savings. But if I am short, sometimes I pull from my savings. 

Savings is at $5,000. 


I usually pay off every month as much as I spend, so my credit cards are at ... 
Store charge #1 is at $1,100. Out of $1,500 limit 
Store charge #2 is at $250. Out of $300 limit
Credit card #1 is at $1,200. Out of $1,500 limit 
Credit card #2 is at $3,800 out of $5,000 limit

I usually pay about...
Store charge #1 $100/month
Store charge #2 $100/month
Cc #1 $200/month
Cc #2 $400/month
Electric $150/month
Phone &amp; WiFi is $160/month
Groceries are about $350/month (for me &amp; partner)
Animals equal about $150/month 

Partner makes significantly more-so he pays the mortgage. 

This is about $1600 just in bills. But if I add the $800, it equals to $2400-so I will most likely be breaking even every single month with student loans.

I cannot afford to grow my savings account if I do not refinance. Or I could pay off most of cc debt, start fresh, and be able to afford my student loans. What should I do?!?! Any advice is greatly appreciated",finance
stocks,Oil stocks - the time is now,"Hello there

I posted about [6 weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/hn9ydm/defense_stocks_what_the_heck_is_going_on/) about defense being undervalued and they’ve climbed 15-20% since then (besides HII which completely whiffed earnings). Hope you hopped on. Now I am now starting to see value in the oil sector(s). The June high and subsequent re-crash for oil industry coincided directly with the new covid case rate picking up. With covid cases declining and oil stocks generally trading in ranges for over a month now, I present my case for a break in those ranges

There are a couple of tailwinds that are happening right now for WTI:

* New covid cases in the US have dropped substantially from their peak and are on a downtrend [according to JHU’s data](https://i.imgur.com/EShb2sU.jpg). Globally, it seems to be seesawing in a confined range
* [China is buying a large amount of US crude by September](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-oil-exclusive/exclusive-china-ramps-up-u-s-oil-purchases-ahead-of-trade-deal-review-sources-idUSKCN25A2F4), potentially 37 million barrels [according to this](https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/China-Charters-Tankers-For-37-Million-Barrels-Of-US-Oil.html)
* After flooding the US market with [Saudi oil](https://www.npr.org/2020/05/04/850026351/saudi-arabias-oil-tanker-flotilla-is-reaching-the-u-s-despite-some-objections#:~:text=Live%20Sessions-,Saudi%20Arabia's%20Oil%20Tanker%20Flotilla%20Is%20Reaching%20The%20U.S.%2C%20Despite,are%20headed%20to%20the%20U.S.), they have now cut exports to a [record low ](https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Saudi-Arabias-Crude-Oil-Exports-Dip-To-Record-Low-In-June.html)
* The dual storms in the Gulf have caused a lot of [shut-ins](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-storms-energy/oil-firms-evacuate-staff-curb-offshore-production-ahead-of-twin-storms-idUSKBN25I0J3)
* After stalling in July, air traffic is starting to [pick back up](https://www.tsa.gov/coronavirus/passenger-throughput) and routes are being added again, although still way way down

Which all support WTI prices in the coming weeks. Should be noted that rig counts have continued to lows, however last week was the first week in a long time that a few rigs came back online, which will add to the inventory. How much, I am not sure. You can see from [Baker Hughes’ rig count]( https://rigcount.bakerhughes.com/rig-count-overview) that we added 10 rigs, but are still down a net of 662 rigs from last year. Next we can take a look at the [EIA data](https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/supply/weekly/) for some more insight into what current inventories are like:

* 512M barrels of crude, 15% above average. Peak was 540M barrels on June 19th
* 244M barrels of gasoline, 7% above average. Peak was before covid due to build over the winter
* 178M barrels of distillates, 24% above average. Peak was 180M barrels on July 31st
* Refinery inputs at 14.5M barrels, low was 12.4M barrels on May 13th 
* Refinery rates at 81%. At the low on April 22nd it was at 67%, normally around 95%.
* WTI is trading in the $42-43 range, with the low being negative due to the contract rollover situation back in the Spring

The last several EIA reports have been good in general – drawing down of products, with two weeks in a row of fantastic gasoline draw down. 

What’s my point here? The takeaway should be this: the worst is over and it seems we're about halfway recovered. Now is the best chance for a while to get beaten up value stocks at a discount, as the industry recovers and conditions for the crash are resolving

Right now cyclicals have been beaten down to Earth’s core as tech goes up and up. Cyclicals and value generally outperform in a market recovery and I expect a rotation at some point, strengthened by a combination of inventory drops making headlines, covid cases going down, and a general resumption of normal. Any stimulus would be big news for these beaten down stocks as well

Worried about a Democratic administration? Unlike the defense stocks I had previously looked at, I think it’s a real issue for this industry. The Democratic platform calls out removing tax breaks for oil and gas companies while adding environmental regulations. It’s weird that big tech has been climbing – companies like Amazon, Apple, Facebook etc. that are known tax avoiders and privacy usurpers seem like prime candidates to have a ‘tax bill fear’ from the Dem’s closing of tax avoidance legislation and future lawsuits. I haven’t seen any hints of this in the market, so I am going to assume this is not considered a big deal by investors. Environmental regulations should be, however

However, I still believe these low valuations are still too low, even with headwinds. Some of the majors have already been adjusting (Shell in particular) and refineries like Valero already have strong renewable fuels segments; Phillips 66 recently announced plans to build the [biggest renewable diesel refinery in the world](https://investor.phillips66.com/financial-information/news-releases/news-release-details/2020/Phillips-66-Plans-to-Transform-San-Francisco-Refinery-into-Worlds-Largest-Renewable-Fuels-Plant/default.aspx)

What am I looking at in particular?

Right now, refineries have the best value to me. PSX is **criminally** undervalued with a safe dividend. VLO is another that is set for strong performance. MPC has a strong position after its Speedway asset sale, but I would rank PSX&gt;VLO&gt;MPC at this point for value.

* PSX target price: ~$82, sitting currently at ~$61
* VLO target price: ~$71-72, sitting currently at ~$52.50

From a producer standpoint, CVX and COP are both fundamentally solid (I prefer COP at this point). RDS is the closest its been to it’s covid low and is one of the leading majors in transitioning off oil. It’s been beaten down since losing its dividend but I can only assume it will be back. I’m not a fan of XOM going forward, but right now it’s at the low of the range it’s been confined in and wouldn’t be a bad temporary pickup. FANG / EOG / PXD aren’t bad pickups either

PS – stay away from OXY. It’s very clear they’re going to continue to issue shares until they’re through their debt and the pummeling is well deserved. It was popular for a while, not sure how it’s still viewed, just stay away

TLDR; buy refineries and the producers worth buying that aren't drowning in debt or have terrible assets

personalfinance,Savings account not worth it anymore?,"I’ve been parking money in a high-yield savings account for a few years now, saving for a down payment on a house. I’m now very close to having what I need to make a 20% down payment on a nice place, and soon I’ll pass that threshold.

I'm about to start my first salaried job working as a civilian federal employee and I'm excited but also panicking a bit. 

I don't have any debt at all, but I also have never done anything that would build credit (no student loans/car payment/credit cards), as I didn't have a steady stream of income (some summer jobs, occasional gig work during school). I've also never dealt with a lease/landlord as I always lived in the dorms or at home.

I've been looking into getting a credit card to start building up *some* credit before WFH ends and I need to start apartment hunting, but I'm struggling a bit with which card(s) I should be looking into. Previously, my plan had been to look at cards with some sort of extra cashback or airline miles bonus for spending in the beginning of ownership (ie. on top of whatever normal cash back earnings offered) to use on my moving expenses, but since I'm still able to work from home my main expenses are just groceries and below-market-value rent to my parents. I don't know if I should follow my original plan, or if I should be looking into some other card as a starter while at home and then applying to a different one when it looks like I'll actually be moving.

I also have some questions about retirement savings. The government uses a Thrift Savings Plan (TSP)--is this equivalent or transferrable to a more common type of plan? Most advice here says to contribute the maximum matched value if you're able to, but is that also true if I might leave before being vested? I've also read that any matched contributions are traditional rather than Roth, so if I end up having to pay back the match contributions, would that be paying back the pre-tax amount?",finance

personalfinance,Refinancing a few months after closing,"I bought my first house back in March-April. This was amidst the initial corona panic and interest rates were fluctuating wildly. After some maneuvering, I closed on my house at 3.25%, which was, at the time, a great rate. Obviously things have changed since then; it seems like 2.875% is very achievable, and I have even heard of people getting 30 year refi's for as low as 2.5%. 

I have a pretty good handle on the mathematics side of this; lowered monthly payments and a more favorable balance of principal/interest per payment is offset by fixed refinance costs and a reduced mortgage interest tax deductions. I'm confident I can assess the breakeven time and make a good decision, once I have the numbers in front of me. But I haven't begun to talk to lenders yet, so I'm just going off of rumor and rates that I have seen published online.

My question, then, is how the refinance process may be affected by having such a ""young"" mortgage. Will lenders take a different view of a mortgage that has only seen 3 payments? Is that seen as a riskier loan to make? My initial research has suggested that this may actually work in my favor, because some lenders will waive some refinance costs (e.g., if the house appraisal was fine 4 months ago, it's a pretty good bet that it's still fine.) But before I start shopping around, I was hoping to see if anyone had experience in this area and would weigh in. 

Potentially relevant information:

* Conventional loan with 20% down
* Original loan was for approximately $600k (yeah, I know, HCOL area)
* The purchase price was comfortably under what I was approved for
* My credit has gone down a bit (~10-15pts) as a result of getting the mortgage, but still above 750; I have no other debts, and no missed payments, so my only explanation for the credit dip is my changed debt to income ratio.",finance
personalfinance,"Advice for getting out of $15,000 in CC debt? My CS is 656.","Hello all,

So I am (and have been) ready to get this financial situation under control. I will be 29 years old this October and would like to go into my 30s with these hard lessons learned and have a better relationships with my money. 

I have signed up for Mint and have a budget laid out that I have been following strictly for a month now, as I am recovering from some pretty bad spending habits. However, my self-control and willpower have grown and continue to grow every day. I count every dollar now and it honestly feels great. I feel free in a sense, but am still shackled to the debt from my past.

So the numbers:

CC1: $2498 w/ 19.24% purchase APR

min payment: $65 currently

CC2: $5228 w/ 15.99% purchase APR

min payment: $87 currently (but might be going up soon)

CC3: $8401 w/ 15.99% purchase APR

min payment: $202 currently

&amp;#x200B;

I do not have a car payment currently as I bought my car new a few years back and was really good about the payments, never missed a single one. Once upon a time not too long ago my credit score was 750 and I was on top of things. I am back to my old frugal ways and more diligent than ever. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here is my monthly budget from Mint that I worked out (I am open to suggestions for things i might neglect or have forgotten)

$800 rent+utilities

$180 grocery budget (I can probably lower this, right? Maybe to $150? I'm open for less too!)

$56 auto insurance

$80 cell phone (I am considering looking into a cheaper carrier, but I do not have the money to buy a phone if I switch, so for now I am with my sister on a plan and pay this).

$100-150 for gas and fuel (This is a tricky one because I am not sure how to calculate a budget for it, though I have been using GasBuddy app to pay the cheapest for gas in my area)

so TOTAL: $1266

&amp;#x200B;

This is the hard part as I have started a dream job of sorts that does not pay well, but definitely could once i get full time. I am not able to go above 29 hours due to health benefit reasons. That being said I am currently working two jobs, and it is tough to figure out how much I will be making each month as I have only started them recently (lost my jobs due to COVID19). 

However, if I am being fair and accounting for taxes being taken out, I should be making $2,000/month. Ideally I will be picking up extra hours as they are available and am willing to get a third job as well. I would like to be at $2,500 a month, but am not sure how realistic that is yet.

On a side note, I am hoping to take advantage of this promotion program at a blood plasma donation center near me that nets me $600 in a month after 8 donations.

Now, what scares me is I do not have any emergency fund (I am hoping for a second stimulus check so I could just put that in savings). 

I have to ask, is it unrealistic to want to make $600-$800 a month towards my debt so I can be free of it as soon as possible? Or is that not likely? I would love some realistic advice. 

I am considering personal loans, but the offers I've been given thus far have 30% + interest rate, and from my limited understanding, I should not go for that option because my credit card interest rates are much lower, right?

I have browsed this community a lot and love the support and encouragement offered by so many. I am looking forward to hearing what you all have to say. I am trying to look at this as a blessing in disguise as I am learning my lessons, changing my ways, and actually putting time and effort into a budget for the first time in my life really. I want to turn 30 years old and have begun the process for saving up for a house with the lessons I'll learn from this.

investing,Differences and similarities between 2000 and now.,"I've posted bits and pieces of this in some comments since some form of the question has come up on this subreddit. I want to list out a list of reasons why today is like the dot com times and ALSO what is different about today. I am not a financial professional, but I have been working in the tech industry for over 20 years. It is mostly tech stock focused.

I'm going to also add (fact) or (anecdotal) or (opinion) to my bullet points, so take those bullet points with the appropriate grain of salt.

Reasons we are NOT like the dot-com boom (roughly in order of importance):

* (fact) Interest rates are much lower now and long term expectations on yield is also low. In 1999, the 10 year treasury was at around 5% and rose to over 6.5% in 2000. The P/E of the S&amp;P 500 in 2000 was around 30. Which means that the 10 year treasury yielded MORE than the S&amp;P 500 earnings. This is absolutely not true today with the 10 year treasury yield being around 0.6% and P/Es being around 25-30. This single point is extremely important to understand.
* (fact) Late stage VCs are more of a thing now than they were in dot com. Thus you have fewer IPOs and the companies that do are more mature and less speculative (of course there are outliers, see below).
* (fact) The NASDAQ P/E in 2000 was really quite ridiculous (I can't find a chart for some reason, i think it was around 80). S&amp;P 500 was more comparable between 2000 and now.
* (anecdotes) You can no longer get a job at a startup / real tech firm just because you know HTML or can write ""hello world"" in Perl. A lot of firms back in the late 90's were trying to fatten up the employee count and race to IPO to cash out. This doesn't happen today.
* (fact) There was no pandemic in 2000 and it makes comparisons hard.

Reasons we are like the dot-com boom (roughly in order of importance)

* (anecdotes) Sentiment on the ground is very similar to what you hear during the dot com boom. We make fun of the people who invest in stupid shit like NKLA, HTZ, etc. But a lot of people are creaming their pants still on the big tech (FAMANG) saying they are forever-holds / they can't go down, etc. You also now are starting to see intelligent, rational people putting money in things **precisely** because other people will and assume they can get out before it all falls apart.
* (fact) In the late 90s, internet brokers were a new thing and made trading easier for people who didn't know anything -- and we see that today with COVID stay-at-homers and an influx of users into robinhood (I wish I could get hard numbers on the comparison). (opinion) Because of this, I'm fairly certain pricing is out of whack for a large number of companies.
* (fact) The P/E ratios of the big techs today are higher than a lot of the big techs during 2000. Nasdaq P/E in 2000 was off the chart, but if you just look at the big profitable companies like INTC, ORCL, AAPL, HPQ, IBM, which were the equivalent of FAMANG today, they had P/Es mostly under 30s. FAMANG are around 35 except for Netflix and Amazon which are much higher (see huge caveat on interest rates above). CSCO and MSFT in 2000 were the outliers having P/Es of well over 60.
* (anecdotes) In tech companies, a common business plan for new firms in the last ~8 years is to get market share at any cost and figure out profitability later. This is really no different from dot com when firms were valued by number of ""eyeballs"".
* (opinion) ""this time is different"". At least in terms of technology, it's not. The internet itself was a bigger ""paradigm shift"" than what we are seeing today. I used ""paradigm shift"", because was a common buzzword that turned into a joke back in the late 90s and used to justify crazy valuations. Machine Learning is amazing, but not on par with connecting everyone on the globe. And the cloud is just a fancy name for running something on someone else's computer (even though its quite nice how easy and seamless it is today vs. 20 years ago).
* (anecdotes) While it is harder to IPO today without profitability or clear path to profitability, it clearly still happens (UBER, LYFT, SNAP). And others are using backdoor IPOs (NKLA, SPCE).
* (fact) In 2000, the IT sector along with Media stocks and the Telecommunications Services sector approached 40% of the S&amp;P market cap. The categories have changed but if you combine IT and Communication Services sectors, you get a 38% of S&amp;P market cap today. If you add Amazon which is not included in IT/Communication, you get over 40%. Does this mean anything, especially since we are in a pandemic and more stuff runs on IT? Not sure.

You can definitely pick apart some of the individual points, I just wanted to lay them all out and see what people thought and if anyone has other valid comparisons. I personally think we ARE in some kind of tech bubble, but I'm not going to make a fool of myself in predictions on when and how it will burst. And fuck it, while I do have more in cash than typical, I'm still in VTI/VXUS and a bunch of individual tech names since I have the background to do some analysis on the business.

I'll end with a few random thoughts:

* In August 1999, a lot of people were looking at the craziness of the dot com boom and how people were throwing money at stupid shit. I don't care what people say, it was pretty obvious something was wrong. If you shorted the NASDAQ then, you will watch the NASDAQ more than double in 7 months time and have your face ripped off.
* Taking what I've posted as a whole, the one thing to be terrified about is if long term interest rates rise and the fed is either powerless or does not step in for whatever reason. This will completely destroy the stock and bond market. I don't see the catalyst for it, but I'm no economic genius. You might be able to make an argument that gold is a hedge for this unlikely scenario. There is also the worry of a slump in earnings due to general economic malaise, but that is a garden variety concern that everyone is watching for and usually pretty temporary. Rise in interest rates would be real bad.",finance
personalfinance,Mortgage early repayment VS investing,"hey there!

bought a condo two months ago and I was wondering what would be the best plan of action.my gf and I chose to go for a 15-year loan term w/ 2.49% interest rate and we can live confortably this way with our salaries.

my bank is allowing us to double our initial monthly payments and do an early repayment up to 15% of the mortgage every year. did some maths and we could potentially get the mortgage out of the way in approx. 3.5 years (I say potentially because saving 15% of the morgage won't be feasible imo, at least for now...)  


in your opinion, should we get the mortgage out of the way ASAP or leave it as is, paying what needs to be paid and invest what we manage to save in TFSA/RRSP?

personalfinance,In a really strange/impossible situation but I'm not giving up...,"We really want to buy a single family right now but I am coming into road block after road block. Thought this forum might be the best place to try and bounce and gather ideas.  

The Story:

When the pandemic hit, we moved out of our house-hack multi family to live with my grandmother who needs full time care. We rented out our apt for STR. Long story short - Oma needs a lot more care than we can provide, and we need to move back to our own place so a full time nurse can move in here. The kicker is we have no unit left to move to, all the units are rented out, and quite honestly we don't really want to move back there because now our 4 unit MF is cash flowing beautifully.

The Goal:  

Purchase a home that will be our primary residence and has an income-generating aspect to it.  The current home we are looking at is a single family on 11.5 pastured acres with a 5 stall heated horse barn.  Rough-boarding alone we could generate $1500 per month income.

The Situation:

I have poor credit, 614 but working on it and hoping to have it at 650 by the end of the year. I earn decent income - around $5400 net per month from [real estate](https://www.biggerpockets.com/rei/glossary/real-estate?itm_source=ibl&amp;itm_medium=autof&amp;itm_campaign=glossary) commissions. We have income from our 4 unit multi family that grosses $5,000 monthly and after regular expenses and maintenance and paying our [mortgage](https://www.biggerpockets.com/rei/glossary/mortgage?itm_source=ibl&amp;itm_medium=autof&amp;itm_campaign=glossary), we cash flow $500 per month. We have done significant cap expenditures on it this year though, which I'm sure will hurt us.

$6,000 to fill in the old pool, $5400 to repaint the garage and get our EMP up to code, $11,900 blown in-insulation. We were thinking about replacing the furnace and adding a boiler this year as well, since its at the end of its life and heating a 100 year old multi family in Vermont is not cheap nor easy.  $8,000.  All in $31,300 in cap expenditures this year....

We Airbnb our studio condo that is at the base of a ski resort and have been renting that to traveling nurses on the off season. We own this outright, no mortgage, just paying HOA and expenses which are pretty minimal. We gross $1000 per month off-season, and gross $5,000 from Dec-April. Expenses vary for those months but generally speaking we are cash flowing $600 off-season and $2500 in-season.

I have large and cumbersome student debt - $125,000 federal student loan debt.  Non in forbearance as far as I know, I recently paid off a $5000 debt to George Washington which I believe was in collections, I only paid that off in May of this year. I pay around $250 per month towards the loans.    


Husband  - Great credit, he's above 700 - No income, stay at home dad. - No debt- Has a secured credit card he keeps at 30%

Currently we are living rent free with my grandmother, taking care of her during this pandemic crisis. But this is a temporary situation for us and we are wanting to figure out how we can buy a single family home in Vermont.

Our multi family we have a 20 year mortgage on at 5% [interest](https://www.biggerpockets.com/rei/glossary/interest?itm_source=ibl&amp;itm_medium=autof&amp;itm_campaign=glossary) with seller financing. Monthly payments are $1979. The principal balance is $267,000, current market value is $430,000. I cannot qualify for a refinance or a cash out with my current credit score, even with the income from the rental. The problem is my husband has the credit score, but not the income.  


So that's our story.  The property that we want to buy is listed at $230,000.  

How do we do this?",finance
personalfinance,First mortgage affordability advice,"Hey PF, another ""mortgage affordability"" for you all...

First off, did lots of searching on here, and seems the consensus is no more than 3x income. But I don't believe this accounts for the low interest rates we current have or HCOL vs LCOL etc?

Anyways, here are my numbers:

- Gross income: 71k

- Money in bank: ~120k

- Debt: 0

- Rent: ~1500

- Monthly expenses: ~280

- Price range: 300-350k

- HOA: ~280-350

- Property tax: ~1.25%

Single and no kids.

I definitely have enough for a 20% (maybe more) down payment for the place. With the current covid situation, I've been working from home, so the gas expenses have not been added to my monthly expenses, I'm not much of a spender so it's just mostly food. I work in a field that will most likely work remote from now on so gas expenses won't be an issue. Also first job since graduating college, so I expect my salary to increase.

Factoring in the down payment, the cost of the place should be about max 3.5 my gross income. Is this doable? It'll be a 2 bedroom so I can rent the second room.",finance

personalfinance,Lowering debt with a 0% APR card,"Amex used to have a completely free balance transfer with 0% APR for 15 months (the every day card).   They did away with that while my wife was in the process of getting the card which really sucks.   I wanted to move the last of my debt (\~4500) from another high interest card.  I am thinking that I can still take advantage of this card with the following plan:

(1)  Spend all of our groceries, restaurant, and other purchases on my wife's new 0% AMEX for the next 5 months.   That is roughly $800/month or $4000 total in 5 months.

(2)  Instead of paying the $800 every month from our debit/bank account (like we normally do) toward our purchases, we put that $800 every month for the next 5 months to the high interest rate credit card.   That would essentially pay off our high interest credit card in 5 months (or at least pretty close to it).

(3)  From month 6-15 (10 months), pay $450/month at 0% to pay off the debt on the new Amex card and essentially pay off the card.   Also, its a rewards card so we will get a lot of $ rewards.

Note:  I get my bonus in April 2021 so this also lets me kick the can down the road on my debt by indirectly transferring it to a 0% APR card and paying it off in April.

Anyone have a better idea?   Am I missing anything?   Does this even make sense to do in view of monthly minimum payments?",finance

personalfinance,spectrum filed collection on a duplicate account created by mistake,"In July i found out spectrum filed a collection in April on me (from my bank app credit dashboard). I found out that it's filed on a duplicate account that was created by mistake in January (same address/service with my active account opened on the same day). 

I called spectrum twice. On the first call, the customer service told me it's a mistake and they'll take care of it. On the second call, the customer service told me i need to return the equipment (modem/cables). 

I did receive extra equipments in Jan when i started the service. I gave numerous calls to spectrum to report this. They suggested me return the extra equipments to fedex or UPS. Both Fedex and UPS rejected to accept the package, and spectrum rejected to send me a shipping label. That back-n-forth took about a month. Then covid 19 started. I didn't know what to do with the equipments but piled them in the unopened boxes behind my mirror.

Recently after the second call with customer service, I took an uber and sent the equipments to a spectrum store. The sales couldn't find any account linking to the equipments, nevertheless they took in the equipments and issued me a handwritten receipt.

I filed dispute with Transunion on the collection. The result of of the dispute came out in Aug which is ""account paid off"". I actually didn't made any payment. I filed another dispute based on the reasons that the account is not a collection account. 

I also called the collection agency to explain this is a duplicate account. They told me spectrum closed the account with an update that the account is paid off. They can't do anything. Is this true?

I feel this is very unfair, as I did nothing wrong with the duplicated account. I attempted to return the extra equipments multiple times to the nearby fedex/ups. I also made a few calls to Spectrum for help. It was just not convenient for me to return the equipments to the stores before July, as i didn't want to use public transportation. I didn't receive any notice or calls on the collection, until i found it out from my bank app credit monitoring. I think spectrum is very unreasonable and irresponsible when handling this case.

personalfinance,"Need help in selecting a bank, credit union, or similar for a trust. (US)","Hello,

I received $XX000 this past February as back pay for Supplemental Security Income.  Because of &lt;expletive&gt; laws, I must spend it within nine months, as I cannot have assets over $2000 unless an exemption applies.

I tried to buy a house, got to mortgage, ran into it being a ""high-cost mortgage"".  They kicked me over to the HELOC department, who rejected me because my student loans came back as in forbearance, instead of IBR.  While I was trying to get that sorted out the house I was looking at sold.  For half asking price.

Anyhow, my choices were to buy a house, buy a car, spend it, or put it into a trust.

I still intend to buy a house.

A car is technically possible, but besides needing a driver's license, the nearest place to park is $15 more than my rent per month.  

I have/am spending about a quarter.

The remainder I'm in the process of having a trust created to hold.  A ""Self Settled, Third Party, Irrevocable Trust""  Basically, I'm paying for it, someone else (my sister) controls it, and I can't touch it.  Oh, and technically my mother is creating it, but my lawyer &amp; I are doing the paperwork (mostly him), she'll just have to sign.

My first thought is to put it into a ""short"" term CD, with automatic rollover, possibly build a CD ladder.  However, I also intend to contribute $xxx per month, and I'm not sure if those payments can be automatically rolled in.  Simplicity is a key component of my goal here.  I'm looking into money market and high yield savings also.  My lawyer also mentioned indexed something fund, I need to ask him.

Without interest, based on the amount I intend to contribute, in five years the principle would double.  The current interest rates won't increase that much, however, I agreed to pay 1% plus costs annually from the trust.  Be nice if interest paid for that.

So, my problem is I need a financial institution that offers a safe investment and is physically accessible in Tacoma (me) and Salt Lake (sister).  Because we will want to ""avoid the appearance of evil"", I can't have a debit or atm card, even if it won't allow withdrawals.  I need to be able to physically walk into a location, say ""here's $xxx, put it in account xxxx-xx-xxx"", and walk out with the receipt.

Most of the national banks that I have looked into, and would reasonably expect min both locations, are offering 0.01% to 0-05%.  One regional bank is offering 0.4%, but I know from research I've done that 1% or better is possible.

Hopefully, that is ""enough relevant information about [my] situation or the topic so people can respond helpfully."", and I can ask my question:

investing,Dummy question on Bonds,"Hi, I have a dummy question about bonds / fixed income.

Stock / equity, I understand - if I invest $10k into Stock, it goes up or down, I gain / lose money accordingly. Got it.

Bonds on the other hand - if I invest $10k into Bonds, are the following assumptions true?

(i) It pays a certain coupon rate semi-annually which defines my yield - ie, the rate of return - let's say 4.0%

(ii) but there's also the ""mark to market"" or ""valuation"" component similar to Stocks - ie, the value of my Bonds (ie what people / the open market will pay for it) may increase or decrease as the interest rate (say the 3/5/10 year treasury yields) move down or up. Does this also get factored into my ""rate of return""? And consequently making me sensitive to interest rate risk?

Broadly, I'm just trying to figure out - if my $10k investment into a some sort of a bond index fund 5 years ago is now worth $12k, is that a combination of (i) and (ii) above? And similarly, if that investment is now worth only $9k, can I effectively assume that the yield I earned on (i) was more than offset by the losses incurred by (ii)?

investing,Confused about Futures in general and especially interest rate futures.,"So, I was introduced to Futures in a course I recently started. Now the concept of Future is straightforward, but what I am confused about is that when they have a fixed price dependent on stock , and interest rate, and expiry why are they traded in the exchange ? I mean I am confused about the two prices present, one the settlement price which has a formula and one the price at which the trader longs it or shorts it. But wherever I read about them, the articles just take the settlement price into account, nowhere is the mention of the price at which they are traded. And this becomes even more confusing when interest rate futures are allowed. Like, their price is 100 - r, where r is a specific interest rate but again they are traded and can be longed or shorted at a price different than 100 - r. So what is the significance of the value r ? I've tried to put my doubt as clearly as I could, but you can ask for further clarification if needed. Thanks.",finance

economy,Why Yields Are About To Rise,"1- US interest rates are the fulcrum of the global financial system. Almost the entirety of this fulcrum, from 3-months out to 30-years, is below 1%. How much further can this trend go? Long-term we’re headed for total yield suppression with full-on Japan-style yield curve control. But it’s not going to be a straight trend from here to there and we’re likely headed for a bump pretty soon…

2-Falling yields (bonds up, yields down) have driven the stock/bond ratio to multi-decade lows. Its z-score (red circles) is at levels that have marked major reversals in stock/bond relative performance in the past. Stocks and bonds compete for capitam flows. A rotation out of safety and into risk might soon be underway.                                                                                                                                                         

3- The bears who’ve been sitting on the sidelines of the equity rally off the March lows don’t understand the financial concept of relativity. Asset allocation is a choice of comparisons that contain a number of critical feedback loops. The rate of change in US Baa yields recently fell to its lowest level since 2003. These levels are more consistent with a major bottom in stocks, not a top.

4- But as I’ve been pointing out the last few weeks, it appears there’s a major trend change brewing. The MOVE index (a measure of bond volatility) is at all-time lows. Compression regimes lead to expansionary ones. And there are some growing signs of important divergence. Here’s a chart showing 10yr Breakevens pulling away from UST 10yr yields.

7- Morgan Stanley wrote in a recent report that “The global recovery is progressing well and is transiting from the sharp jump in monthly indicators in May-June to a natural moderation in the pace of improvement since July as we have already made up a lot of lost ground. Retail sales in both the US and EA are already close to or above their Jan-20 peaks; global manufacturing and services PMIs moved back into the expansionary territory in July and electricity consumption is now growing on a YoY basis in EMs ex-China like India and Brazil, which were lagging earlier.”

personalfinance,Paying back student loans,"I graduated in May 2020 with an amazing 75k in student loans+interest, split about 40-60 federal and private. I took a few extra years to grow up in college, which caused me to take private loans. Graciously, my parents are paying about 20k of it, I believe by the end of the year, with which I am highly appreciative. I didn't ask for them to help, they offered and didn't take no for an answer. I don't want to come off as entitled or anything like that. 

Since they were paying off a chunk of the private loans, I decided to start the federal loans, as they're in Grace and not gathering interest. With interest, it was about $30,750. I immediately paid off the interest, and have gotten the balance down to around $23,750. The federal loans are a mix of unsub and subsidized loans that were for 900$-3750$, and the interest rate on them when it isn't set at 0 ranges from 4.53 to 5.05. I just was able to get the actual interest rate info, as everything has it set to zero and didn't show the previous rate. Since there's no current payment plan, I've been putting all my extra pay from my paycheck into these loans, and have been going down the list of 12 loans, and have closed off the oldest 3. I've been putting money into individual accounts and closing them rather than doing what the borrow wants me to do, and splitting it up over all accounts. Unfortunately, these weren't the loans with the highest interest rate, which I will be focusing on now.    

Am I wrong to focus on the federal ones, and is the way I am doing it wrong? My goal is to put as much as I can into these loans to avoid paying them for the next 10 years. I do have an amended tax return that has been a struggle getting processed(It's been a back and forth mailing exchange since March), which should give me an additional 2400$ with which I will put into these federal loans. I also received unemployment benefits as I was let go of my job, however, I believe I was given too much due to Florida's great system, and I'm worried I will have to pay it all back come tax time. Otherwise, I'd dump that money into the loans too.

Posting here because obviously, I’m seeking some financial advice.

He got offered $25K for it from a guy who buys houses, renovates, and leases them for a living. My buddy is giving me a chance to buy the house since I’m both the tenant, and invested about $6K into it already. He’s not going to sell below $25K so that’s out of the question.

Work full time, making ~ $27/hr, with varying OT per week.

$2k credit card debt (This is basically non existent as I rarely use my credit card anymore; I can pay the minimum payments for a while should i buy the house)

personalfinance,How do you shake this feeling of dread as a First time home buyer?,"Ever since I got the call saying that my purchase offer was accepted, I have been having high levels of anxiety. I work in the mortgage industry, so I am not anxious about the process, but I am more worried and anxious about how I am going to make ends meet.

The mortgage payment is about 23% of our net household income if we do not count retirement savings as income. I have 0 debt. I am able to save 20% for retirement, my retirement accounts are fully funded as is + have around 400$ of extra money at the end of the month after having budgeted for everything else (maintenance of the home included). I'm able to do OT most of the year. If I max it out, I can make 1200$ per month extra to spend on what I please.

But I am still getting a feeling of dread, I can't eat or sleep properly. I can't believe I will need to repay 256k$ + interest over 25-30 years... What if the real estate market tanks next year because of Covid and I just lost a hundred thousand dollars into thin air. What if I start hating my job and I quit, or worst, I get layed off?

stocks,Investing in REITs during the pandemic - for newbies,"**tldr**; next week come the stock picks

Investing in REITs has always been very profitable. In fact according to the [charts](https://www.fool.com/millionacres/real-estate-investing/articles/real-estate-vs-stocks-which-has-better-historical-returns/) they have outperformed the SP500 by 300% during the last 20 years. Does this sound totally outrageous? Right? There are a few reasons for this. First of all, real estate as an investment is not really enticing when bought in cash but is very enticing when bought with leverage. What is leverage? It's mortgage. You basically leverage your money usually at \~4:1 and the best thing of all compared to traditional margin investing is that you don't get margin called unless you miss your payment. Even when missing your payment a ton of other measures are usually done, individual bailouts and mass forgiveness in times of hardship. When compounding leverage for 30 years the returns are much better than stocks.

#### Enter REITs

Real Estate Investment Trusts are professional managers that hand pick investments and offer the benefits of diversification and knowledge. After all either you are a professional real estate investor or you got your own apartment and maybe a vacation apartment. Hardly investment grade behavior. So with REITs one can invest in real estate with leverage. REITs also have a much better [sharpe ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sharperatio.asp) than stocks unless special conditions arise (see below). In that case it's a very prudent addition to every portfolio for that middle range of dividend producing and not very risky investments.

#### Which ones to choose?

According to each investing environment one can pick winners and losers. Unlike the massive mortgage crisis of 2008 other times are a bit more predictive.Let's talk about some categories.

**Retail and mall REITs** are being phased out for years now because of the rise of e-commerce. That has accelerated massively during the pandemic and I don't personally think it's ever coming back. Maybe some malls survive because they are cool places to hang out and host bars and restaurants but most people will only look and maybe try on and then go and shop online with reduced prices. So these are **OUT**.

**Residential REITs** can be interesting. Although a recession is predicted worldwide and heightened unemployment there are other forces that are working against them. The main one is that interest rates are at all-time lows. That not only means that it's free money to get a mortgage but also that because bonds and fixed income pay almost nothing there are not many income producing places that investors put their money to preserve purchasing power. That is also a bit of a conundrum because along with low interest rates, inflation is also predicted because of the massive money printing that took place to boost the economies. In other words, either you buy stocks or put your money in a house. Another interesting force here is that people [seem to be leaving big cities](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-08-14/people-leaving-cities-for-suburbs-still-want-city-like-features) for the suburbs because suddenly when you are working remotely you would prefer to have a garden a bigger apartment for a fraction of a price. This will probably especially be true for mega cities with lots of tech workers (San Francisco, NY, Amsterdam, London). So **YES** to residential REITs but **NO** to ones that predominantly have portfolios in risky cities.

**Healthcare REITs** are an interesting play. These include mostly nursing houses, hospitals and maybe senior housing. These seem to be good but some selection is necessary. I don't think one can know the inside outs of a REIT that owns hospitals. It's usually too political. Nursing homes will probably fair quite well in the future because of increased aging population.

**Industrial &amp; e-commerce REITs** are in the business of renting out big storage spaces to e-commerce giants such as Amazon or host car factories and freight cargos. These in my opinion are totally recession proof not only because there will be more need of them but also because the industry is back at almost pre-pandemic production levels. Especially industrial REITs in Japan have boomed even higher. We say **YES**.

**Special purpose REITs** need to be studied case-by-case:

* Public storage is a nice niche that is not going away during a recession but may even climb higher.
* Cell towers are very trending with all the 5G narrative and an interesting segment that can fair well.
* Gas stations are not my favorite ones because Electric Vehicles in the future can render them obsolete. Maybe they are converted to just stop and go cafes on the road.
* Student housing is also very interesting but one needs to think about the future. How much will e-learning change the landscape? In case of Brexit for example, where will students from the European Union go?

#### Conclusion

All in all, REITs are a good investment but given the current landscape much thought needs to be put in them. Some promiment investors I have privately discussed with are of the opinion that is even more profitable to be renting an apartment and investing in REITs rather than buying your own but usually that is more of an emotional decision because we humans want to have a safe shelter that we own.

personalfinance,Worth it to invest in HSA in CA?,"Hello all,

I just started investing in my HSA in CA, and have just now discovered that the gains/dividends made from the HSA are taxable. Also found out that because they are taxed stateside but not federally, the HSA will not provide a end of year 1099 form and you are responsible for manually keeping track of all the dividend income and capital gains and reporting them properly.

Does any one here have experience with this? I know this sounds a bit whiny, but that sounds like so much hassle and room for error. Does anyone here tips or strategies to make it easier? I think that payroll contributions to my HSA make sense, since I would save on the federal taxes and all the paperwork is automatically taken care of. But forgoing the hassle of investing it and just keeping the HSA as 'cash' and using it for medical expenses as they occur. 

Anyone else have any opinions/experiences?

personalfinance,Want to take over/refinance home I bought with my parents 2 years ago,"TLDR at the end.

I (30F) with my parents (65F and 60M) own the house that I live in Georgia, USA. They wanted to buy a house in my area as it is a good destination for snowbirds and they live in the granny suite 2-4 months in the winter.

&amp;#x200B;

The house cost was $222,000 and was paid for in full with my parent's cash/a downpayment by me. The way we have it worked out is that I own half the house and pay them a mortgage (3% interest) on that half.  I pay all utilities, bills, and smaller renovations.  They pay half of the house tax and insurance and we have split some big renovations. I have paid off about $27,000 of the principal since we bought the house in 2018.  So I owe my parents about $200,000 to $220,000, depending on what the house is valued at now (Zillow says $250,000ish).  I have about $30,000 in saved money I could use to pay out of pocket to my parents... so the refinanced mortgage could be between $150,000 and $180,000. (I know there are limits to what percentage of your home value you can refinance to.)  At the rate that I am paying it off,  I will have my half of the house paid off in 2027.

&amp;#x200B;

I recently got married, and although this house is maybe a bit more than we would have bought together we still like the house and our neighborhood.  We want to be independent (as a couple) financially and are interested in getting a mortgage (for the whole house, not the half) through the bank instead.  We understand that this would not be a traditional mortgage but a refinancing, unless we could 'sell' the house to my wife if she could get approved for the mortgage but I don't see that as a real option... unless it is?

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Our final goal is to have mine and my wife's name on the deed and a mortgage through the bank for the house.\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Financial information on us: My wife (27F) makes \~$80,000 a year and I make \~$70,000. We max out our yearly limit for each of our Roth IRA's and 401K's and all that jazz.  We have no other debts: car bought in cash, student loans long paid off (Canadian), credit cards paid off every month; we have credit scores in the mid 700's.  We are both Canadians living here on work visas's so our credit history is not long (\~4 years) which would be our biggest issue as well as not a variety of types of debt.

&amp;#x200B;

Questions:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Is it feasible for my wife to buy the house if she can get approved for the mortgage?  We would have to pay closing costs and realtor fees, so I assume no?
2. How does refinancing work? I know the interest rates are higher and you can only get up to \~%70 of the value of your home.  I am assuming the mortgage company would appraise the home now?.
3. Is this crazy? Should we try to sell and buy another house?
4. Any tips/tricks to refinancing a house?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Own a house with parents. Pay them a 'mortgage' for my half. Got married, no we want to 'own' (bank to own) full house. Need to refinance.  What is the best way to do that? Any tricks/tips or things we should avoid are appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,Paying off a car loan with a personal loan that has a higher interest rate,"I currently have a car loan out with my bank at an interest rate of 7.44%. I still owe $6593.25. I recently applied for a personal loan because I want to pay off a high interest credit card, and the personal loan is about half the interest rate of that card, at 13.24%. I originally was just going to take out the loan for the amount on the card which is $4,500 (had to use it to cover surgery costs) but decided to take out a little extra because I decided to just pay off all my credit cards. Not including the highest card, that total comes out to about $800. 

Yes, i made some irresponsible credit moves but I was younger and was not thinking long term. But now I am buckling down and am trying to get to a point of being debt free. 

Back to the car loan, I was approved for a personal loan amount of $10,900.00. The advisor I spoke to suggested after I pay off my cards, I use what's left toward the car loan and I'd owe almost $1,000 out of pocket which I could pay off in about two months. Then I would be able to lower my insurance, saving me some money there. And although the interest is a bit higher on the personal loan, once my credit improves a bit (currently have a score of 700) I would be able to refinance the loan and get a lower interest rate. 

My question is- is it worth it? I've never refinanced a loan so I'm not sure how that works. Should I keep the two loans separate?",finance
stocks,OPINION (not DD!): Reducing AAPL position this week,"Don’t get me wrong – **Apple Inc (**[**AAPL**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/)**)** has performed admirably. They’re probably one of the best run companies in the world, evidenced by being the first US company to eclipse $2 trillion in market capitalization. With that said, I’ve decided that barring anything unforeseen, this week will be the week that I exit Apple, and began selling at $507.87

Why? The simplest answer is I believe it’s run up too far, too fast. Even a zero interest rate environment doesn’t merit mature companies trading at 40 times earnings, which is where Apple appears to now be headed.

We have to remember that different companies come into and fall out of favor, and this last decade has been the “Apple Decade”. I believe with that so much of Apple’s future sales are already priced into the stock, there really isn’t much room for further growth. Even if it doesn’t fall (I’m not predicting a fall, but that could happen), the risk is a slowdown in the growth of its stock price as earnings slowly catch up.

The final nail in the coffin regarding my decision to sell is the crazy run-up its had since declaring its upcoming stock split. That day (July 30), AAPL opined at $376.85 and closed at $384.07. The stock has appreciated a full $120 per share in the days since that announcement, and while it posted solid earnings, I don’t think enough has fundamentally changed to merit the recent rise in price. 

Please note that this post doesn’t guarantee that I will exit Apple (especially if the price should fall), nor does it guarantee I won’t repurchase it again at lower prices. But at this moment in time, I think any future growth potential is dwarfed by downside risk, so I am intent on averaging out of the position during the course of the week.",finance

This lets me see live video of the cats and make the feeder dispense food. It's nice to see the cats and know for sure that they're ok and getting fed.

personalfinance,Refinance: Worth getting appraisal with rising home prices?,"Like many others, I got the call from my mortgage broker earlier this month when rates fell dramatically and we locked in 2.5% with some lender credits. My family fully intends to live in/own this home long term (10+ years), so it's a slam dunk to do the ReFi and take the free savings (moderate lifestyle, no other debt).

Property prices have jumped quite a bit here in the past 2-3 months with numerous comp properties going for 25-30k over asking (my amateur appraisal would conservatively put our house \~$600k). The lender is not requiring an appraisal, but I'm wondering if it's worth it to get one anyways to realize the increased equity and reduce how long we need to make PMI payments.

Am I thinking about this correctly as a reasonable bet to place by spending $500 on an appraisal to potentially save an expected $2700 ($2200 net from 2.5-5 years on) by hitting 78% LTV quicker? Are there downsides I need to seriously consider (eg. increased property tax payments, potential to ReFi again later)?

personalfinance,Question about refinance closing costs,"Hopefully this is where I am allowed to post this question!
I'm about to refi my mortgage with a my current lender and the closing costs seem absurd. It's very hard to get in contact with a credit union in my area to compare, I have applied to a couple and seem to get crickets. 
Going from a 4% interest rate to 3.3 with cash out to pay off some debt and have cash left over. They're charging around 2700 for the ""loan costs"" which to my understanding is money to them, they're estimating the title company to charge 2200, and total closing costs added up around 6200. They're waiving my appraisal since I have high equity in my home. 
These costs to me seem outrageous, but I've never refinanced before. Does anyone have thoughts on this? My home is in Bend, Oregon.

financialindependence,Real Estate path to FI FAQ.... and rambling stories,"META:  FIRE is quite often index fund and forget it.  But there are a number of paths to FI.  Owning a business is a common one and the most common path to FATFIRE.  

Probably once a day someone posts on here that they discovered real estate or ask why nobody mentions real estate.  Real Estate is mentioned in every longish thread.  It is brought up all the time.  I am a Real Estate investor who reached FI within 3 years by applying leverage to Real Estate as a way to build passive income beyond my annual spend.  So here are my FIRE FAQs that I see asked and answered.

&amp;#x200B;

* How do I FIRE with real estate?  1.  Buy a property that can reduce your cost of living such as a duplex that covers a chunk of your mortgage via rent.  Live in it 1-2 years.  Put the savings aside.  2.  Buy another and keep the first.  3.  Buy a few more properties whose cash flow is above their expenses after all expenses are covered.  In general a house that costs $100,000 needs to rent for $1000 a month to be positive.  3.  Use this cash flow to qualify to buy more properties.  Keep buying until your true cash flow is greater than your living expenses.  You are now leveraged like crazy.  4.   
 Hope for the best and pay down mortgages for a while before making the leap to retirement to be a little safer.  This should take about 10 years.  5.  Pray to sweet baby Jesus that the political and economic climate remains stable and your local laws don't become too tenant friendly.  You are now retired.  You are welcome.  
* Since Real Estate has a much better returns than indexes why isn't everyone doing it?  Because returns are variable.  But more importantly investing in real estate is a skill and not everyone has that skill.  Not everyone is interested in developing that skill nor does it always make sense to spend time building that skill when you could be developing your primary career.  Any dummy can set an auto buy for VTSAX and not check it for a decade.  It is the best choice for most people.
* Real estate is pretty awesome according to XXX book and XXXX website and XXXXX guru on facebook, right?  There is a ton of money to be made in real estate.  But it is a ton of work.  Real estate falls less into the ""buy passive income and forget it"" and more in the ""build a profitable business"" category.   Much of the money in real estate goes to the people in the know.  Brokers, agents, authors, gurus, coaches etc.  A beginner can get eaten alive.  I cannot tell you how many people I've dealt with who have paid a coach to sell a 'system' who have no business being in business.  I went to a seminar where the presenter had no idea what he was doing.  His answers were laughably and demonstrably wrong and he had many people ready to write him a check.  There are way more people out there who ""used to own rentals"" than who ""love owning rentals"".  Real estate is hard.  It is also rewarding.  
* A nice building in San Fran would be 10X the value over the last decade.  Why not just buy in high appreciating areas?  For the same reason you don't just buy AAPL 20 years ago.  It isn't clear where the winners are in your crystal ball.  Plus taxes.  After a huge appreciation run up you have a lot of equity and hopefully some cash flow but the taxes can absolutely erode your modest cash flow while you are crossing your fingers for appreciation.  My property taxes went up 10K+ last year.  That is not something I control and is tough to plan for.  I can't sell 3% of an apartment to cover the taxes.  For mortals cash flow is king and appreciation is a potential side benefit.   
* A nice single family home in Omaha is only 60K and kicks off 500 a month from $900 in rent.  I buy 10 at 5% down and I'm done, right?  Sure.  Assuming you have an awesome agent, inspector, manager, lender and handyman.  Assuming you know Omaha well enough to not get screwed and assuming you pay more than anyone else looking on the MLS.  And assuming you know why this house is magically worth 20K less than the one a block over.  Investing out of area is a legit way to invest, but it isn't easy to get started. I find it terrifying.  Real estate investing is a skill.  Long distance investing is a skill and an art and part mystical incantations. 
* Leverage is magical!! why doesn't everyone apply leverage?  Good property returns usually rely on leverage which multiplies returns on cash invested, but when things go bad it multiplies mistakes.  In real estate an asset can go down and you lose your entire investment plus another 100K.  Straight index fund investing limits losses to what you put in, and probably only a fraction of that.  You can apply leverage in the stock market too.  But those people are generally not on the FIRE forums until you reach FAT levels where leverage starts to make sense again because you can handle staggering losses.  Market margin buys aren't the FIRE way because they are active and potentially risky.  The only reason real estate leverage works is because it is often fixed, at low rates, for a long time and therefor fits in a spreadsheet nicely.  But that tends to mask the potential downside.  
* I can do it without leverage, right?  Yes.  But then returns are the same or worse than index funds plus you have all the work.  Leverage is not mandatory but it is the only way it makes it worth the work vs passive investing.  
* I can make it passive.  Turn it over to a property manager and forget about it right?  Sure.  If you are extremely lucky or want to get robbed.  Even with a manager you will spend some time managing the manager.  There are always decisions to be made.  There are tough ethical questions to answer.  It can be minimal time once you are up and running, but it is still time and effort.  It takes quite a while to dial in your system.  Expect to go through multiple managers before finding a decent one.  Then expect to find another in a few years when that one goes south.  It is still a business and nobody cares about your business more than you.       
* I'll just buy 1 fix it, use the profits to scale up to 2 the repeat to own enough units to retire on, right?  Sure, but do the math right.  Transaction costs eat you alive.  When you go to sell figure 10% for realtors, closing, allowances etc.  Then capital gains taxes.  Then depreciation recapture.  If you don't hold for a while you pay short term gains at your marginal rate.  It is rough.  There are massive benefits to buy and hold and exchanging but you need to be careful to stay on the right side of the tax system.  Take what you think you will spend and boost it 50%.  Then reduce profit by 20% and you are closer to reality.  And all this activity is extremely active.  For each deal I flip and make good money on I chase 10 that I make negative money on.  
* What about REITS?  To me REITS don't have a long enough track record to lean on like index funds.  They are tax inefficient and I don't fully understand the regulations around them.  So I don't touch them.  They seem extremely correlated to the stock market, so just buy VTI.

&amp;#x200B;

So how and why did I go the real estate route?

1. Income.  I make under 50K a year and have kids.  After child support, regular bills a mandatory pension contribution and maintaining a decent quality of life I was a couple decades from FIRE without significant changes in lifestyle.  Really I was better off just working until pension age.  But I am always worries my employment situation could change dramatically and I hated to have all the eggs in the government issued basket.  But I just couldn't save enough to do it fast and I'm a bit of a gambler so I'm good with leverage.   
2. Experience.  My first home was a duplex.  My second home I converted to a duplex in a massive remodel.  I have always done home improvement projects myself and my family is also well versed and supportive in the construction side.  My dad is right now fixing a sink for me in a basement apartment for a few extra bucks.  I was 15 years into dabbling with real estate before I decided to get serious.  I am a strong candidate to boost cash flow via DIY and BRRRRR (google it).  
3. Comfort with the market.  I know my town well.  I luckily live in a good place to invest for cash flow.  I understand the political and cultural climate, the economics and I know virtually every street in town.  I am extremely well connected in my town as I have only briefly lived elsewhere.  There is a good chance I already know the neighbor.  I'm not going to accidentally buy a clunker 2 blocks the wrong side of the tracks or a know meth den.  I'm also irrationally comfortable with being concentrated in 1 market.     
4. Partner.  My partner wanted to go this route.  I was already semi-supplementing my income with rentals.  When we combined households our buying power improved and it became more viable.  My partner also took on the clerical side of things and allowed me to focus on the physical side of things.  It met our core competencies well and that keeps it on track.  If I was alone I'd have nice functioning apartments that nobody bothered to pay rent in because I don't keep track.  If she went it alone she would collect rent and pay it all to plumbers that charge $500 to install a toilet even though it just needs plunged.
5. Luck and The boom.  I got extremely lucky and timed the market well.  I bought huge at a local housing low.  A bunch of landlords finally got positive after the 2008 crash and sold when they could 'feel' another bubble.  I bought those and then the market has actually gone up in term of value and rents.  Plus interest rates fell.  This took me from mediocre deals to solid deals.  A big round of refinancing pushed mortgages out a couple years but brought payments down to FI cash flow levels.   
6. Luck.  I found cheap long term fixed financing with lowish money down at a local bank by pure chance.  Between them and earning a commission I was maybe $5000 out of pocket to buy a house.  This helped pick up a lot of property quickly.     
7. Luck.  Multiple deals have come our way off market and we have found the cash to capitalize.
8. Speed.  Since 2017 I've been flipping, rehabbing and hunting houses doggedly.  Sometimes that is painting at midnight, knocking doors before work, driving by at lunch and unclogging sinks at 2am.  I've dealt with sewer backups, domestic disputes, horrible tenants, great tenants, many mistakes and not seeing my kids much.  I like the work though.  It sped up my journey by 15 years.  
9. I have a plan B/C.  I have a pension job.  I'm almost 20 years in.  At age 57 I have a full retirement plan waiting so I can afford the risk.  The risk has so far worked out and I can coast semi retired until actual retirement kicks in.  I can probably fix and flip my way to 57 working 5 months a year even if rentals somehow stop cash flowing for 2 decades.  
10. We have maintained an emergency fund.  We have enough cash to get through some pretty rough times ahead.  and we have lines of credit to cover for a very long time.  Winter is coming and I think I built a big enough castle.  But I'll admit that during peak buying I didn't have 2 nickles left and any bump would have derailed my train and left me starting over with nothing.",finance
personalfinance,Question about a familiar story-credit card debt,"I'll keep it simple and elaborate as needed in the comments.

I have 3 high interest cards that are killing me when I do the numbers.  All due to a divorce years ago and I'm still recovering financially.

So now I want to lower the interest rate.  I might not be able to get a personal loan, but I'm open to suggestions because that would be the best route in my opinion.

Are 0% introductory cards worth it?  Couldn't I (in theory) keep transferring balance from one card to another and keep a 0%. I do know that that plan is risky because if I don't get a new card then alllll the interest will be due.

What would you do with $9k of high interest debt?

Once I pay it down (this is my incentive) then I can refinance my home and save a lot due to the current low rates.

personalfinance,Sell ESPP/use emergency fund to pay off Student Loans?,"Hi everyone,

I am a 26 YO M and have been obsessive with paying off student loans as of late especially while they are in forbearance with no interest rate until January 2021. Monthly payments are on pause but I still am able to pay off the principal during this time. I have \~**$17,800 left**. From 2016-2018 I would pay the minimum monthly payments, but since then I now pay in big lump sums.

I work for a tech company (4 years in September) and have seen my holdings rise significantly since the beginning of the year. I have **\~$48,100 in ESPP** (have held **$10,000 for over 2 years**) and **\~$20,000 in vested RSUs (\~$66,100 unvested)**. The next ESPP purchase should net \~$18,000 if the stock stays at its current value even after the scheduled split.

I have no other loans or credit card debt, have **\~$15,000 in a liquid, rainy day savings account** that would cover 6 months of expenses, but have sacrificed disposable income (have \~$300/paycheck after setting aside rent, utility, subscription funds) to live in SF. Additionally, I have saved \~$3800 and am expecting a bonus of about $3000 in November.

I am considering selling a few shares now (the $10,000 ESPP held for over 2 years) so I can have \~$1000 left to pay ($17,800 student loans left - $3800 saved - $3000 bonus - $10,000 ESPP) by next January. I also would consider depleting my emergency fund, which would leave me with around 2 months of emergency expenses in November. 

I have no intention of leaving this company and I understand it's not a guarantee that the stock will remain this high. My parents have always told me to hold onto this stock no matter what; it's just so enticing to pay off these loans now while they're in forbearance. My goal is to own a home one day and I may consider graduate school, so alleviating this debt is a top priority.

personalfinance,Financing solar at 1.49% APR. Too good to be true?,"I'm looking around for quotes for solar installation on my house near Phoenix, AZ, and I've found a company (Ultra Energy) that is advertising an APR of 1.49% on a fixed-rate, $37,000, ~~30-year loan~~ edit: 20 year loan. The company gets overwhelmingly positive reviews, and I've had positive experiences with all their staff so far.

My average monthly power bill throughout the year is around $150-160, and with the cost of the system and their advertised APR I'd be looking at a fixed monthly payment of $130. They've designed a system to produce 120% of my estimated power consumption on year 1, and as an APS customer I can sell that power back at 10.6 cents on the kWh. I would also be grandfathered into this buy-back price for a decade. Accounting for the system size (16,300 kWh/year) and panel degradation (overestimating at 1% loss per year), that works out to an excess power sold back per year of (15% avg excess * system size * buyback price per unit of power) = 0.15 * 16,300 * 0.106 = $259; the average amount APS would be paying me per year for excess power over the first 10 years. This means my ""effective"" power bill would be more like $110/mo for a decade.

On top of this, the company is also offering a $2000 cash signup incentive, which would be like having free electricity for over a year and a half. This deal seems really good, almost too good to be true. What drawbacks to installing this system am I not seeing?

EDIT:

So, I've gone back over the documents and realized I made an error. The loan amount is $37,600 at the outset, but it's actually a 20 year loan. They do their math assuming that I apply my entire federal and state tax credits to the loan within the first 19 months. This means that I'd have to pay the financier about $10,600 within the next 19 months from my tax refund. (Am I understanding this right?) This reduces the principal to about $27,000. So I'd be making $130/mo payments over 20 years to pay this principal off. If I choose not to apply the tax credit to the principal of the loan, my average effective power bill per month would be $160 - no change from what I currently pay. The total interest paid over the lifetime of this loan is about $4300. The expected increase in value of my house (2-3% on $470,000) is $9-12,000.",finance

About to refinance home mortgage. We have excellent credit.

But then when I start working with brokers, the rates are always higher. What gives? What are these published rates from and why aren't they what is offered? Is it negotiable and people just don't try to negotiate? Or should I keep shopping around until I find a broker with the right rate?

For example [https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/30-year-refinance-rates/](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/30-year-refinance-rates/) \- shows 30 yr fixed refi should be 3.42% APR.

CryptoCurrency,SCAM ALERT: Centric Foundation CNR/CNS,"Reddit, this is my only post to this sub and I've been a lurker for 2+ years.

The reason for this post is to get this out into the cryptocommunity and hope the current investors of CNR/CNS see this, as sadly the Discord and Telegram are heavily moderated and immediately delete and block posts that bring up these points.

First lets start with the origins of Centric, as they claim to be from Jan 2018.

What the new roadmap on the website fails to tell you is that Centric started as UPDC, UpStake token, which is basically just CNR, an untradeable centralised token that you could only buy direct from their website and 'stake' with them. Not dissimilar to Bitconnect. 

You can guess how this ended; [https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/upstake.com](https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/upstake.com), they basically 'seized' trading and held peoples funds.

Further digging on old bitcointalk threads finds numerous scam threads: [https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5124000.0](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5124000.0)

Also take note of the CEO, Logan Schauer. More on this later.

[https://sg.linkedin.com/public-profile/in/logan-schauer?challengeId=AQFhIe2PFamsagAAAXQiTxwq4dkt-gUXHDDSjYXwJagRaz7U-kns\_iL2Gh2xZ5H59dQahylPtMpGklcckfbOCsX3WksnUIj\_VQ&amp;submissionId=347a678f-8350-2e16-7dc6-7a0034423332](https://sg.linkedin.com/public-profile/in/logan-schauer?challengeId=AQFhIe2PFamsagAAAXQiTxwq4dkt-gUXHDDSjYXwJagRaz7U-kns_iL2Gh2xZ5H59dQahylPtMpGklcckfbOCsX3WksnUIj_VQ&amp;submissionId=347a678f-8350-2e16-7dc6-7a0034423332)

After the failure (or success) of UPDC, they re-branded to Centric Foundation with a new CEO Gabriella Davis.

They then airdropped all previous UPDC holders their shiny new token CNR, but they still had the problem of how they are able to back up CNRs hourly rise and draw in new potential investors.

Somewhere along the line they managed to come up with this:

Create a second token (CNS) and peg it to $1 to the first (CNR). With CNR being untradable and only available through CNS, now they can magically claim that CNR always goes up in value.

With this little move and the rebrand, they are now able to get listed onto legitimate exchanges, and I for one am really disappointed that Bittrex listed and even shilled them on their Twitter. This is 2020 not 2017/18.

Sadly this suckered in new investors (mainly newbies, pump chasers like myself, and poor people in 3rd world countries who sadly fall for the foundation claims of guaranteed hourly interest rates, hence the Philippines SEC warning).

Even though the Centric Foundation has a bucketload of CNR to convert and sell to CNS to raise funds, they even had the nerve to create a one-off Centric Bond to take more free money from newbies or the gullible to pay for their exchange listing fees!

Going back to the UPDC CEO Logan Schauer, a little googling finds a gofundme page that claims he was in a tragic accident, when on a business trip to Thailand with his then girlfriend... Gabriella Davis! 

There are dodgy actors in the Telegram and Discords, one even has a Youtube channel that pretty much exclusively shills Centric back to even its UPDC days. She is only a mod, who knows what level of collusion there is going on behind the scenes.

TL:DR; This whole thing smells incredibly fishy. Make of it what you will, but this has all the string indicators of a scam. I implore you to DYOR and dig further and make your own decisions but I really just think this should just be put out there to help shine a light on the underhandedness of the Centric Foundation.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Looking for advice for student loan repayment,"I just graduated with a degree in Mathematics-Computer science and I've secured a full time job at a large tech company. I wanted to see if anyone has any advice about paying back my student loans (however you want to interpret that).

So here are the stats:

Income:

Base salary: $110,000 (I work in a state with no income tax)

Sign-on bonus: $15,000

Equity: $120,000 (vested over 4 years)

Other bonuses: unknown but usually 2 bonuses per year between 1%-20% of base salary.

Expenses: about $2000/month (including rent, food, utilities, subscriptions etc.)

Loans (all federal, no private): Note that all interest rates are currently set to 0% at least until January 2021.

$60,000 at 7%

$43,000 at 6.31%

$8,000 at 6.31%

$5,400 at 5%

$28,600 at 0%

Total is about $145,000.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are some questions I had:

My company matches 401k contributions (50%) up to $10,000 per year, but is it worth contributing anything right now while I have such large loan balances?

Should I just throw all my extra money per month (over $4000) towards paying down the balances as fast as possible?

Should I pay the loan with the highest interest rate first or the loan with the smallest balance?

Any other tips would be super helpful!",finance

personalfinance,Payoff.com Debt Consolidation?,"Hi all! I have a sizable amount of credit card debt—about $15K. I made a lot of mistakes and now finally have a decent, stable salary and some self-discipline to correct them. However, I’m having a hard time getting ahead due to all four of my cards have more than 20% interest rates—one even has 29% because I got it when I was 17. 

I was approved for a payoff.com debt consolidation loan to be paid directly to my cards at 13.7% interest, the best deal I could get with my 640 credit score currently. I saw payoff.com recommended highly on nerdwallet, but am generally nervous because I have made so many financial mistakes in the past that led me to this point. 

With this loan, the payments would be $545 per month for 36 months, in comparison to $600 per month I was paying toward crushing my debt and $400 per month in interest fees. It sounds like a smart thing to do, but I guess I’m looking for some feedback before I agree to the terms.

personalfinance,Looking for Help Boosting Credit Score &amp; Eliminate Debts So I Can Get a House in NOLA,"I'm not a regular Reddit contributor so pardon my newb-ness here but I thought perhaps I could get some financial advice.

Certain life events have landed me back at my mom's house where I currently live free of rent and utilities. For the record, I pull my weight by doing any housework, yard work, or anything else that needs doing.

With my 35th birthday less than a year away and the realization that I haven't done much with my life (not that I don't have dreams or ambitions, just that I've been taking life day by day for too long), I've committed myself to moving to New Orleans -- somewhere I've been wanting to move to for a few years now but haven't been able to because of financial constraints. The problem is my credit score isn't that great -- 617 FICO, 650-661 VantageScore depending on what version, 3 or 4. There are down payment assistance programs that I'm eligible for but I don't want to move there and have nothing left to live on because all my income goes toward the mortgage and debts.

For a while, I was only making minimum payments on my debts and putting all of my excess income into savings. Later, in an effort to reduce the number of monthly bills, I used part of my savings to completely pay off the smaller debts. Seeing that my biggest monthly payment was for a personal loan I took out in 2016, I began aggressively paying it down. However, once I learned that revolving debts (the credit cards) would have a greater impact on my credit score than installment loans, I shifted focus and began hitting those hard one by one. I opted for the ""snowball method"" -- paying the smaller balances first -- so that I could quickly eliminate the number of individual debts.

Below is a list of ALL of my monthly bills. This list does not include gas (about $60 a month), groceries (about $100 a month), or anything other than what I receive a monthly bill for. I'd love it if someone knowledgeable and experienced in the financial world could give me some tips and tricks and help me out a bit.

Thanks in advance! :)

====================

**THINGS TO NOTE:**

On average, I make about $1600 a month from my day job. That $1600 does not include freelance work which, thanks to COVID, has not been steady enough to factor into my income.

I'm pretty frugal. No extravagant purchases. I dine out maybe twice a month at most and never spend more than $30-35. The meals I prepare at home are always inexpensive but wholesome and I can usually stretch leftovers for a couple of days. I always bring my lunch to work. No parties or nightlife or anything like that.

Initially, I had a Netflix subscription and rented a storage unit but I eliminated those to reduce monthly expenses.

The only monthly bill I could possibly cut is my Amazon Prime membership which used to be yearly but that $129 always sneaks up on me. Paying monthly instead of yearly is simply easier for me.

I do not have any charge-offs or anything in collections. My only negative credit history marks are late payments on the PayPal Credit, Bank of America, and Chase accounts. For years prior, I was always in good standing (never late, never missed a payment) but then COVID happened, effectively shutting down my freelance work and eliminating what had been an extra $6,000 a year in income. Those 3 accounts became 60 or 90 days late. PayPal Credit and Bank of America closed the accounts. Chase was still open but I closed it as part of a payment plan (see below). I've since brought them back into good standing but they're still closed. I have sent goodwill letters to these three lenders in an effort to remove those negative marks from my credit history, however I don't expect it to happen.

The 2% interest rate on the Chase card is not a typo. Back in March, I entered a pay-off plan with them where they closed the card, put me at a fixed 2% interest rate, and set up an automatic payment of $77 for the next 5 years. I can make additional payments if I wish/am able.

I'm currently paid through September on the personal loan. Next payment is not due until October. Since I'm paid in advance, I've been putting that $160 toward other things such as the PayPal Credit balance.

personalfinance,"Debt Payoff help- already done with credit cards and car loan, need advice for next step","My debt got out of control and here I am. I can give reasons why if you need them, but important info is that a few years ago I owed 8k in credit card debt, I had a 16k car loan, and a defaulted private student loan for 14k. I paid all of those things off as of last week. My credit score is trash because of late payments and the defaulted loan, but the debt I currently owe is in good standing and has only on time payments. 

The trouble is that I'm 31 and I still owe six figures of student loan debt, which has an average 6% interest rate. Its all federal so its not gaining interest right now but that's not going to stay that way. My job is not going to ever get me to a six figure income, and I do not qualify for public service student loan forgiveness. 

I have no retirement savings at all. I want to pay off my student loan debt, but if I do that then I will never retire- and I just don't know what to do. If I keep going on the income based repayment plan then the balance grows every year, but I know it will eventually be forgiven. I could pay it off *and* make retirement contributions, but only if this no-interest period miraculously continues for another 30 years.

I want to fix the mistakes that I've made, but I can't see how to do it. Maybe I've been staring at the problem too long and I need a fresh set of eyes to look at it. Advice is appreciated, thank you.

personalfinance,Pay off Student Loans or Car first?,"Hello all,

First time poster here, (27F) looking for advice on my finances. I recently paid off all of my credit card debt which wasn't much ($2500) and am now left with the question on what to focus on paying off first:

$60,000 Student loan debt (all of it federal- I know, it's too much and I'm trying to correct this)

or

I currently have a '14 Chevy Sonic that has caused me so much trouble over this past year so I'm going to trade it in ($5300 left on the loan) for a '18-'19 Camry that I will hopefully have for the next 15+ years. That will be roughly (21,000 + anything I'm upside down with on the Chevy).

I'm waiting to get my credit score to 700+ (currently sitting at 650-670) to purchase the new Camry. I'm hoping my 0% credit utilization will help raise my score (have about 6 delinquent accounts and they should all be off my credit report in about 3 years)

I currently make 41,000 a year.

My monthly expenses are $1600 including groceries and gas ($100 to a Roth IRA/month).

This leaves me with roughly $1000 to pay down debt and/or save.

I currently don't have savings (only about $500).

I'm lost and am looking to get my finances in the best order I can. I appreciate any feedback as i need a kick in the butt to get all of this sorted out!

personalfinance,Refinancing FHA Loan that needed down payment assistance,"Original mortgage: $139k
 
Current Credit Score: 750s 

Current monthly payment: $1252

State: Texas


2 years ago at age 24 I bought a house but since I was in a hurry to move out I decided to ask for down payment assistance to not have to spend time saving as much money which resulted in a second loan of $5400. This resulted in a 30 yr FHA loan with a 5.625% interest rate. I always planned on refinancing in the future so I just accepted the rate to deal with later. The first place I went to was quicken loans (rocket mortgage) and they let me know that I don’t have enough equity in the home and that they could only refinance me through FHA the original amount of my loan and not the down payment assistance portion of the loan. They said it would put my loan to value threshold above their limit. It is true that I do not have much equity in the home as well. Originally I looked into refinancing to lower my monthly payments and lower my interest rate. 

What they offered me was a 30 yr FHA with a 3.5% interest rate which I thought was great. Only thing is there was a $9200 closing cost that would be rolled into the new loan. Also, my down payment assistance loan would be due immediately as it’s stipulated that it will not accrue interest and it wouldn’t be due until my original loan was paid (or 30 yrs later) or until a refinance. Only needed $20 to close.

My new payment on this loan would be $1109/month which I also thought was great. 

I would basically be restarting on my mortgage at $142k but at a much better interest rate and lower monthly payments if I were to accept this. Also I would have to pay the $5400 immediately which I only have $3000 to spend comfortably. It would take me about 2 months to save up for the full amount after bills and everything. 

They also offered me a 25 yr fha at 3.5% interest with a monthly payment of $1190/month which is less great but still good.  $9400 closing cost for this one wrapped into the mortgage but same issue with the secondary loan. Still only need $20 to close for this one. (I feel like this is the better option of the two)

Is this something I should do right now? Are the closing costs reasonable? Should I wait to save up enough money to pay the down payment assistance outright? Will the interest rate be much worse 2 months from now? I am still shopping around but I would just like to know if this is a good starting point. 

Extra: i was originally looking to do an FHA streamline to reduce closing costs but they said I wouldn’t be able to do that but I’m not sure why.",finance

investing,Seeking feedback from investors with substantial cryptocurrency holdings on moving into DeFi.,"&gt;!If you want to take this opportunity to argue that cryptocurrency has no intrinsic value, please ignore this post and move on. !&lt;**\***

Interested in any feedback from investors who have a decent portion of their wealth in cryptocurrency and are utilizing DeFi. If you're not familiar with the term, in the crypto money community, DeFi (Decentralized Finance) encompasses sets of protocols which fill the roles of a central bank. An entire ""crypto banking"" layer has evolved on top of assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) that allow users to:

(a) Remain in full control &amp; possession of their assets by utilizing offline storage &amp; hardware wallets.  
(b) Allow for lending, borrowing, trading, and earning interest on crypto assets.

I think it's apparent—in the US at least—that there's really no intrinsic value to the dollar, most people do not have money, simply currency. I can't help but feel that between public awareness of how markets work, COVID, extreme partisanship in government and a calculated effort by the Federal Reserve to devalue the $USD through QE that soon the bubble is going to burst, and it's time to pay the piper. The magnitude of the $USD collapse would be catastrophic for anyone left holding the bag (most people).

Is there anyone who has a large share of their wealth in cryptocurrency that has tested the waters of DeFi?

I am particularly interested in feedback from those who have placed a good portion of their net worth into crypto banking systems, actively taking part in lending, asset pools, governance, or any other ""bankless"" financial system. Understanding that this whole sector is far from mature:

* Has anything struck you as being a major flaw in the setup of crypto banking as it stands?
* Do you feel (assuming proper precautions of utilizing hardware wallets/key ownership are followed) that your assets are as secure within DeFi systems as they are just being held in your wallet?
* With maturation, do you believe DeFi will surpass traditional markets?

Just getting started looking into moving cryptocurrency holdings into DeFi systems, so any and all constructive advice would be appreciated!

personalfinance,"Top surgery, moving out, or getting my first car, which should I do first?","If this doesn't belong here or if any part of this post is breaking the rules I apologize in advance. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The situation** 

I need to move out for my mental health, but I don't have a car, I have two large dogs, and I need top surgery to physically function for more than a few hours at a time.

&amp;#x200B;

**Background**

I am a 23 female online college student living in my mother's house. She has been emotionally, verbally, and physically abusive for as long as I can remember. Though the physical abuse stopped in high school, the other two have continued. I remember at 10 yrs old praying to God(raised a Christian, now agnostic) to forgive me for whatever I had done to deserve her hate, never happened. I have been suicidal since 13, but she has refused to talk about it or allow me to get help for it. ""Other people have it worse."" Is her go-to excuse to shut me up. I am on her insurance, but she has hidden it from me for years. I was finally able to get ahold of the information recently.

I am very overweight, 250lbs at 5'7"". My large breasts have gotten in the way of exercise and allowing me to have a physical job as wearing a bra causes immense shoulder and back pain. I would get a breast reduction, but my insurance does not cover it, however, it does cover transgender top surgery which I qualify for, but there is a deductible of $5,000.

I do not have a car, but I am looking for a 7 or 8 seat SUV as I have two large dogs and in a few years' time, I am hoping to become a dog breeder for a large dog breed. An SUV is a preference, but I could manage a sedan. The only requirement would be leather seats.

&amp;#x200B;

**Finances**

I work as a customer service contractor remotely for $9/hr. They do not take taxes out directly, but once I make over 12k a year I have to pay 15% federal income tax. I live in Texas so luckily there is no state income tax. 

On average I make about $1,400 a month. Though I can increase this to $1,500. If truly desperate I can increase this to $2,160, but this would negatively affect my college classes and my performance in them. Due to undiagnosed depression and anxiety, I am literally tired all of the time. I find it hard to manage my time without having to stop and take naps.

If I were to get top surgery, I could potentially get a better job in person, but then this would affect some other things such as my online classes.

My credit score is bad, lower 600 range. There was an issue with financial aid and my father's tax return and so I wasn't given aid for one semester but the college let me take classes unknowingly. So I owe them 4k, which has gone to a collections agency. I also got two credit cards and ran them fully, on a spending bender, preparing for my end, thinking it wouldn't be my problem anymore. I haven't paid these off either and they have also gone to collection agencies. I have decided to ignore them until I finish my IT bachelor's degree and hopefully achieve a better job.

Currently, my only expenses are dog food($100/m) and my own food($200/m). I have $6,000 saved from past months. The problem with this is $5,000 of that is being held by my mother ""for me."" She makes me give her the majority of my paycheck every month. Out of spite, I have spent the majority of some of my paychecks on frivolous stuff so that I wouldn't have to give it to her. I do not think she will give me my money if I want to spend it on something she considers ""dumb and wasteful."" I have talked about getting a car and needing deposit money, and her response was to tell me that I don't need one.

I have two large dogs, 65+lbs who are loud barkers. One of them is not a fan of people but doesn't mind them, the other one loves people but looks scary as I've been told. They are mixed breeds but you can kind of tell what breeds they are made up of and they are often banned by most landlords. However, I have a slightly unethical way of getting past this and any pet rent or deposit. Since they are loud barkers and bark when neighbors pull into the driveway two houses down and across the street. An apartment or townhome isn't a good option. 

Not keeping my dogs is not an option. They are literally the only reason I'm still making any effort. I have no family willing to take them and 0 friends to even ask.

The only benefit I have is that I can move to any state, preferably one with no state income tax, as I have nothing tying me down. I have considered living in a car, but I don't know if this would be fair to my dogs.

My new monthly expenses, if I were to move out, would be

Rent: $500 - $1,000

Car: $200 - $300

Car insurance: $100+

Gas: $20, I don't travel much except for groceries or the vet

Utilities: $200, would be lower during winter as I enjoy the cold

Internet: $60, I need a good internet connection for my work

Phone: $0, Currently on my mother's phone plan and I don't think she'll cut me off as then she would have to pay more per line. If she does cut me off, I don't need it as I have no one to call anyway

Dog food: $70

My food: $200

By the end of the year if I keep saving $1,000 a month I should have $10,000.

personalfinance,Student loan consolidation,"I posted previously but I have more information now so here it is: Ive been holding off on a consolidation cuz i didn’t want to take it out of the governments hands since there was a possibility of it being forgiven, either through public service student loan forgiveness or through politics. since this consolidation is offered by the government, and i wont have to use a private bank, I will still qualify for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness want to know if i should do it.

Here’s my loan break down: 
Total amount: $30,408
Grp A: 3,567 @ 4.5% interest
Grp B: 13,420 @ 6.8%
Grp C 9,032 @ 3.4%
Grp D 4387@ 4.29 %

I’m currently in COVID forbearance, it was unintentional, my servicer is Nelnet and they’re atrocious, my payments are always late, even though I’ve set up auto debit multiple times they always bounce back. 

Currently I’m on Disability and have no taxable income, I will start a new job next month and I’ll be back to my old income of 70k year but I want to do this now while I qualify.

So a brief summary of the consolidation options:

Option 1: income based repayment: $0/mo, but it changes based off my income every year so this won’t be cheap forever. Currently my income is zero cuz of disability, I will make $25-$30k taxable income by the end of the year. 
Any remaining balance amount is forgiven after 20 year

Option 2: graduated payment program
Monthly payment: $45.96/mo with it increasing every 2 years but the rep said the most she’s seen it go up is $10/mo She said this was the best option to pay off early, I could double my payment and pay it off in 19 years or triple them and pay it off in 5 years. 
Remaining balance will be forgiven after 20 years

personalfinance,First real Salaried Job - need advice,"Hello all,

So to preface this I am 31 years old and starting my first real salaried position. Before this it was all hourly jobs with my highest paying one being $21.43/hr.  I have never been any good with money management and tend to overspend on lots of things. I have never invested a dime into retirement because well I have no good excuse other than I was never taught the value of it.

I will be starting my new job on September 7th at a salary of $57,096.00 and I will also be receiving a sign on bonus of $8,600 paid out in one lump sum on my first check after my start date.

I currently have zero savings and I am living paycheck to paycheck partially because of my terrible spending habits and partly because I just got done with a long 2 year separation and custody battle that  drained my saving and cost me just under $20k once all was said and done.

So this is kind of a restart to my life.

My job offers 401k with matching $.50 to every $1 up to 4 percent. ( I obviously want to maximize this but don't know what it even really means)

&amp;#x200B;

Current Debts are:

Car: $11,968.01 at a 3.49% interest rate which my payment is $308.02 monthly.

Car Insurance: $300 (2020 was not my year, 2 accident and a ticket bumped me from $105 to now $300)

Student Loans: $16,653 Subsidized/UnSubsidized

CC Debts:

Card 1: $3,231.40 @ 23.99%

Card 2: $1,309.07 @ 22.74%

Phone Bill: \~$110

Rent: $700

Utilities to include internet: \~ $120

&amp;#x200B;

So I guess my best question is, what's the best way to get the most out of my bonus? Do I use all to pay down my CC Debts? Do I save $X of it into a savings for emergencies and use the rest on some debts? Do I save it all and just chip away at them with my regular pay?

How much of my pay should I save?

How much of my pay should I invest into my 401k or other types of investments?

Any and all advice would be appreciated.

Thank you.

Edit #1: Edited for redundancy/spelling/grammar.

Edit #2: Thanks for the advise, it seems to be a 50/50 split between saving my bonus and using it to pay down my debt. 

I will probably do a combination of the two and at least for the first year I’ll keep my contributions at 4% while I pay everything off and get myself a 6 month savings cushion then invest the rest heavily.

personalfinance,Advice on relocating and buying a car and a house.,"I have a very specific scenario and would love to hear some outsider input.

I am currently a resident of New York. My family lives in Alabama. I want to move to the south next spring and buy a house in Georgia at some point next year (Q3 or Q4). Living and working in New York means I don't need a car, so I'd have to buy one of those too.

I have a great credit score, but I'm a little concerned that buying a car first and then immediately buying a house will hurt me when I'm looking for a good interest rate on a mortgage. I'd love to avoid buying a car in 2021 and having to wait until 2022 to buy a house because I've been planning and researching that for awhile, and the timing to move is suddenly perfect. I'm anxious to own something.

My current financial situation would allow me to buy a car, and it seems like a smart idea to buy a car now and then a house next fall. If I were to buy a car in the next 2 months and leave it in Alabama with family, how would I handle registering the car and getting insurance if my intention is to leave it in Alabama, never drive it in New York, and eventually register it next year in Georgia when I make that state my permanent residence?

Or is that idea terrible? I just think it will be difficult to be independent and also arrange to buy a house without a car if I were to get the house first.

First of all, thank you all for being involved in this subreddit. I just joined today &amp; found myself scrolling through all the posts for hours already. It already helped me, and probably thousands of others make more rational investment decisions. Thank you.

Anyhow, I would love to have some advice regarding a decision I am trying to make.

I’m a 20 year old guy from the Netherlands. In the Netherlands, you’re able to get a €950 student loan (you receive this every month against a 0.00% interest rate)

Luckily, I’ve been fortunate enough that my business grew enough and I do not need this loan.

Now, I’ve been thinking to invest this €950 every month in either an ETF or a well-established company like Amazon.

I will have to pay back this loan in ~20’years. Would you guys recommend this? And if so, what would be the most efficient way to invest this as risk-free as possible (since I do not want to end up in debt)

I’m asking since I know many of you guys have way more experience than me when it comes to this topic.

# Drug firm bets it won't be charged

In the coming days, the Justice Department will decide whether to file criminal charges against one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies suspected of colluding with rivals to inflate the prices of widely used drugs.

The company, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, is betting that in the middle of a deadly pandemic, the Trump administration won't dare to come down hard on the largest supplier of generic drugs in the United States.

It is a high-stakes gamble that could affect millions of Americans who rely on Teva's dozens of inexpensive generic drugs, as well as its brand-name products like Copaxone, for multiple sclerosis, and Ajovy, for migraines. Teva officials say criminal charges could cripple the Israeli company and potentially leave it unable to sell drugs to federal programs like Medicare.

For years, the Justice Department and state prosecutors have been investigating what they describe as a conspiracy by pharmaceutical companies to increase the prices of popular drugs. The department has already extracted guilty pleas and $224 million in penalties from four other drug companies.

Lawyers for Teva, which prosecutors believe was deeply involved in the conspiracy, until recently had been holding settlement negotiations with officials in the Justice Department's antitrust division.

personalfinance,Assistance with Mortgage Refinance,"My wife and I have been talking about taking advantage of the interest rates and refinancing our current 30 year to a 15 year.  
  
Our current mortgage holder is PennyMac. The original balance was $238,506. The annual rate is 4.25%, we have 294 months left on the term, and are carrying PMI. Our current payoff, as of today, is $212,045. Our current monthly is just over $1700.

I spoke with somebody at PennyMac today to run some numbers, and they presented two options. The wife and I discussed both offers but we're not certain why they work out the way that they do. I was wondering if somebody could offer some insight regarding which offer is better.

The first offer is a conventional 15 year with some closing assistance, would have a 3.375 interest rate, APR of 3.548, a monthly payment of around $1915. The balance of the loan would be $216,448.51, and the man I spoke with suggests that this would result in a savings of ~200K vs. our current loan.

The second offer is a conventional 15 year with no closing assistance, would have a 1.99% interest rate, APR of 2.644, a monthly of around $1820, and a balance of around $224,000. This would save us ~92K vs. our current loan.

I'm a little confused regarding how the second option, despite having a lower interest rate, is considered the more expensive of the two. Can anybody offer any insight?

personalfinance,Trying to figure out a responsible plan--six months to buying a house?,"Hi everyone! I have been scrolling on this subreddit for days and have found so much helpful info. But I still feel sort of disoriented about my own financial situation and could use a little advice. Here are the details:

My husband and I (+2 kids, ages 5 &amp; 3), are currently renting our house and our lease is up next March. We have started talking to a mortgage lender and making moves toward buying a house. We have been saving for a solid down payment, and buying could significantly lower our monthly housing costs. We've recently paid off all our credit cards and outstanding debt except for federal student loans, so along with current interest rates we feel we're in a good spot to take this step, though we certainly have room for improvement in our credit scores.

We have $1000 in an emergency fund, but since we've focused on paying off debt we don't have that 3-6 month emergency savings cushion all the experts say we should have. We're trying to figure out how to prioritize. Should we use this money we planned to use as a down payment as our savings cushion, and resolve to keep renting until we have more saved and have built up our credit a bit? Or does it make more sense to go ahead with a home purchase and use the extra money we'd have in the monthly budget to build our savings back up? OR should we be using this money to pay down (it's not enough to pay off) student loans?

It's just hard to know what's most important. Savings? Down payment on a house? Student loans? Our mortgage officer did say that we likely wouldn't need to use the whole nest egg for the down payment, but that isn't guaranteed. Maybe it's also important to note that we have a pretty healthy investment portfolio that we could potentially draw on in the case of a very expensive emergency.

Thank you for any &amp; all advice!

Edit because I left out the numbers:

Together we make \~$100k/year  
Currently have $40k saved, intended for down payment, plus $1000 in a designated emergency fund  
Roughly $80k in combined student loan debt  
Houses we're looking at are in the $200-250k range

personalfinance,Mortgage company sold my loan to a bank with incorrect interest rate.,"So back in July, I applied with a fairly well known, 0 closing cost mortgage refinance company.

Mid August, i get a notice that my mortgage was sold to a major bank, which ironically was the initial bank that I had the mortgage through and is my primary bank. 

A few days later, the new mortgage shows up on my online account, and i check the mortgage terms and notice that the interest rate is 3.25% instead of 2.875% and the mortgage is also $60 higher than what I signed up for. 

I reached out and this company looked into it, they admitted error on their side and they decided its best to refinance the loan again to the proper 2.875% rate. I won't be paying closing costs, but I have to fund the new escrow account again and pay cash. This would mean that I get the old escrow as a check at some point.

I recently got hired for my first post-grad job and just got the email that I need to choose my benefits for the remainder of the year. This led me to start trying to create a budget for the remainder of the year and for the next year as well, so that I can make the appropriate choices about how much to put towards my retirement plan, my HSA, and to my student loans.
I will provide background below.

Me:
I am a 23 year old single male making $63K pre-tax. My monthly bills (rent, internet, phone, electric) come out to around $1200. With groceries I would say it’s about $1400. I receive paychecks twice a month.


Retirement plan:
My company offers a 3% match (100% immediately vested) along with a 3% annual addition on top of the match.

I’m currently trying to decide between the Traditional 401k and the Roth 401k. Also what percentage of my paycheck should I put towards my retirement plan


HSA:
My company contributes $250 annually. This leaves me with the option to contribute up to $3,300 for the year. I’m wondering how much money should I contribute to my HSA each paycheck?


Student loans:
I have about $75k in federal student loans. I’m still in the grace and deferment periods, so I have not been billed yet. I personally want to be free of this burden as soon as possible, but given my other financial responsibilities I realize that this may not be as soon as I’d like (within 10 years). Any advice on how much should I put towards my student loans? I know I should be doing more than the minimum.


Additional considerations:
I receive 8 paychecks as a part of this annual cycle. Should I try to get the full 3% 401k match? Should I try to fill up my HSA? Which do I prioritize?",finance

personalfinance,"22, need advice on taking out my first personal loan","So! Ive been pretty financially responsible my whole life. Rent hasn't been an issue, bills where always paid. I have never had a credit card before. I've never need to take out a car loan. I've only had two debts in my life. A 60$ gas bill I forgot to finish paying after I moved from my house. Also a 82$ medical bill. I paid my 60$ bill off as soon as I found out I had one in collections. The 82$ debt collection I have just recently found out about. My credit score is currently 553 


Situation I'm in for the loan- Aside from COVID taking huge hit on everyone financially, my brother recently moved in with me. He's 20 y/o, slightly autistic, and very expensive to take care of. I myself have bpd and was not ready to take on how much strain and stress financially/ emotionally this would be. My electricity bills went from 180 to almost 300$. My food bills went from 200$ to around 500$. This is on top of my 700$ rent, 50$ cable bill, and 20$ every weekish for gas. I had found a family friend who is willing and more stable to take him in. However the moving expenses are so heavy for that. I only recently paid my rent from August 1st in full. My brother is suppose to leave sept 8th. 

I do have a steady job. I'm a manager (12/hr)  and a server. However due to all the stress I've been going through my panic attacks have kicked up again. I've had several at home and two severe ones at work. My hours have been cut to 4 days a week and it does take out a lot for me financially. 


I thought perhaps I could take out a 1000$ 12 month pay off loan from my bank. I could pay off my 82$ medical thing and spend about 600 to help my brother move. The rest I would use to perhaps finally fill my fridge again. However they only allow for simple/personal loans to be taking if you have a credit score of at least 680. I tried to go to a different agency but they said they would require me to have a co-signer. My credit score doesn't even show up through the company they use? It's weird I'm unsure. I don't have anyone I would ask to co-sign for me. My family is all terrible financially and don't have good enough credit to be a co-signer. Many of my friends don't even have a credit score. 

I absolutely refuse to take a credit card out. Credit cards are a dangerous endever and my bank has very high interest rates anyway. I'm not interested in a payday loan because that's also a dangerous game to play.  I've heard from a few Mariner is a good place to go when you have no credit. I'm just weary of their policies as well. Any advice?

personalfinance,"How to Increase Credit Score/Take Advantage of Higher Income, Debt Consolidation Loan","Hey Everyone,

Quick background, I'm married with three kids, and like most people here, have found myself in a lot more debt than I'd like. I had decent spending habits as a young adult, joined the Navy out of high school, and carried a credit card balance less than 1 month of pay for the first couple years. After I got married and we had a kid, expenses went up, and while we weren't saving money, we weren't going into debt either.

First big hit was some major car trouble when I was out of the Navy and going to school, our vehicle needed a new transmission. Some other minor things added up, I had almost no income(college on GI Bill). Then I had the idea to start a painting company. Company failed, owed taxes, things were pretty bleak. Credit cards went up a lot more.

Ever since, I've been focused on figuring out how to maximize my income and get rid of all the debt we've accrued, and I'm finally at a tipping point from a recent job that I accepted and trying to figure out how best to proceed.

My income for the last few years:

2016: $2,200(Company failure)

2017: $28,000

2018: $55,000

2019: $76,000

I'm expecting my gross income this year to be right around $95k. I just accepted an offer with a new company with a salary at $110k with a 20% annual bonus, which I start in just under 2 weeks

Current Credit Card picture:

|Card Name|Balance|Limit|Utilization|APR|Payment|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|NF Blue|$12,675|$13,700|92.5%|12.9%|$254|
|NF Plat|$10,557|$11,900|89.5%|12.99%|$212|
|NF Green|$23,862|$25,000|95.4%|9.65%|$488|
|Chase Slate|$2,187|$3,400|64.3%|15.24%|$54|
|Chase Sapphire |$4,701|$5,900|79.7%|17.99%|$118|
|USAA|$0|$2,500|0%|23.9%|$0|
|TOTAL:|$53,982|$62,300|86.6%||$1,126|

My questions are primarily around trying to get a quick bump in my credit score. We want to stop renting and get into a house within the next 6-12 months, and if I had a better credit score I'd be able to negotiate lower rates on my cards, and increase the limits which would help with my utilization issue. My FICO score is currently around 630. I only have 1 30 day late payment \~4 years ago, but otherwise have a perfect payment history on every other loan and card I've had.

Over the last year+ our debt has not gone up, and we've made some modest progress towards paying stuff down(car, some cards, etc, probably about \~$3-4k this year above minimum payments)

I'm approved through Upstart for a 5 year $8,000 loan at 14.34%.

Here are my thoughts:

If I use that loan to pay off my Chase cards, my utilization will go down to \~75%. This should cause a decent bump in my credit score nearly immediately. Once that is reflected, I can go to Navy Federal and try to get a higher limit and lower APR's, which will make my utilization even more favorable. At that point I'll also have a higher income.

My plan after that is to use my higher income to throw about $1k/month extra toward my debt and snowball, starting with the debt consolidation loan.

My hope is that within 6 months, my utilization will be down quite a bit from higher limits, the Upstart loan would be almost entirely paid off, and that we can start working on getting a mortgage.

Does this sound like a decent plan, or is there a better option that I should consider?",finance

In the coming days, the Justice Department will decide whether to file criminal charges against one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies suspected of colluding with rivals to inflate the prices of widely used drugs.

&amp;#x200B;

The company, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, is betting that in the middle of a deadly pandemic, the Trump administration won't dare to come down hard on the largest supplier of generic drugs in the United States.

&amp;#x200B;

It is a high-stakes gamble that could affect millions of Americans who rely on Teva's dozens of inexpensive generic drugs, as well as its brand-name products like Copaxone, for multiple sclerosis, and Ajovy, for migraines. Teva officials say criminal charges could cripple the Israeli company and potentially leave it unable to sell drugs to federal programs like Medicare.

&amp;#x200B;

For years, the Justice Department and state prosecutors have been investigating what they describe as a conspiracy by pharmaceutical companies to increase the prices of popular drugs. The department has already extracted guilty pleas and $224 million in penalties from four other drug companies.

&amp;#x200B;

Lawyers for Teva, which prosecutors believe was deeply involved in the conspiracy, until recently had been holding settlement negotiations with officials in the Justice Department's antitrust division. But in April, the company all but walked away from the talks, according to people on both sides of the discussions.",finance
personalfinance,I've been declined for a Direct Parent Plus Loan that I had been banking on to continue school and I'm completely lost in what steps to take.,"My family and I decided on taking a Direct Parent Plus Loan in which payment would be deferred on until I was 6 months out of school. When I went to apply for the same loan this year, my parents' credit had plummeted and we got declined for the loan. My school helped me out as much as they could, but they've told me to resort to getting a private student loan. The issue is I have no credit and all the loans I've seen are asking for cosponsors but my parents don't have the credit/can't afford crazy interest rates on those loans. I'm so lost and I don't even know what to do. I struggled to put up $750 to claim my classes today. In October I have to pay another like $3k. My mom had to shift her mortgage payment to help me claim my classes, and if I don't get this loan we may start missing payments on our house as well as school. I'm so desperate and I don't know what to do. Any and all help is appreciated, I can respond with further clarifying information in the comments. Thanks for any and all help.

personalfinance,Is it time for me to request a chargeback?,"I made a few mistakes and I know that looking back. Please help me on how I should move forward.
 
I moved to a new city and needed to find a dentist. I found a local dentist and decided to go there. Scheduled to a deep cleaning and a new retainer. Retainer was scheduled first. I get there on the day to get my impressions done. I got a few weird questions from the dentist (or assistant?). They seemed to forget that I scheduled for that day, but ended up doing it for me anyway. 
 
When I went up to pay, the guy said the internet was down and that they could only take Cash App, Venmo, but not my credit card. I don't use either of those apps and all I had was a card, so he told me that he could make a copy of my card and charge it at the end of the day. He also can't give me a receipt right now because the internet is down. This is a red flag for me, but I go ahead with it, planning on slicing up the card after I saw the charge and requesting a new one to avoid possible identity theft. Also, my retainer would be done in 4 days. 
 
A few days pass and no charge goes on my card. 4 days pass so I call. First they say that my retainer wouldn't be finished for 14-21 days. I tell them they told me 4 days. After being put on hold, they said it would be done on Friday (3 days later and last Friday). On Thursday, my card is charged. After I see the charge, I cancel my card and request a new one. 
 
I call Friday morning and ask about my retainer. They say something about it not coming out right, and that I would need to schedule another visit to do the impressions again. At this point, I'm fed up, tell them to cancel my deep cleaning and just give me a refund. They apologize and try really hard to have me come again, but I stick to a refund. However, since I just canceled my card, they say they have to write a letter to their finance department and that it can take 2-3 months. I asked to be CC'd on the email. They said I should hear back within 24-48 hours. When she was about to hang up, I asked her what my email address was, and they didn't even have it. I told them the email. Didn't get CC'd, and now it's been 24-48 hours. I
 
I plan on calling them back tomorrow to ask about the status, but I've also read about chargebacks on this subreddit. I've never done one of those. Is this a situation for a charge back? I have no receipt, no proof that they sent an email to their finance department about a refund.
 
Edit: I never said the price - it was $600. So I'm out $600 as of now.",finance
personalfinance,Which lender to consider for refinancing my student loans?,"I have about $23k left in student debt. Good credit, no missed payments, steady income. I refinanced with Earnest about 1.5 years ago to consolidate multiple loans into their most aggressive (5 year) payoff schedule at 4.96%APR. I made the full payment each month for about 1.5 years and in light of the recent economic situation I refinanced it again to another 5 year plan hoping for a lower interest rate but the lowest they'd offer me was 4.25%. The exact number is still out but it will probably save me about $150/mo up front to meet the minimum but I'll probably continue paying the old $600/mo to pay it off on the original schedule with less interest. I've confirmed I can do this.

I could pay it off even more aggressively but I'd rather save and invest the money. Are there any institutions which would offer anything lower than 4.25%? I checked with my bank and 4.49% is what they're currently offering.",finance

personalfinance,"In my last semester of ungrad, college just sent my award letter for the semester and my heart sank.","Hey everyone,

I’m in a pickle per say. I’ve maxed out two credit cards to survive during the pandemic and I’ve ran out of any disposable income. I received money from my university during the summer to “survive” on but it really wasn’t much. Just enough to get me into where I live now and for getting food, paying bills, etc.

So my award letter came. FAFSA is a b*tch, for all who know, but the ones who interpret that information, financial aid offices, are b*tchier. They offered Federal Pell Grant, Unsub, and Sub loans. Problem: they also put a 13K Parent loan on my offer instead of two previous grants I’ve had before( a state and school grant that would cover my living expenses in the past.) I obviously declined the Parent loan because it’s impossible for my parents ( the university has offered it before and I’ve declined it every time). But now, I’m lost on how to survive if I have no coverage for my living expenses. I’ve tried getting a job for the last year and companies in my field aren’t hiring. Or there’s 100+ applications according to the HR department and well I deal with it. 

Obviously I have to go to school and graduate. The university, at this point, would give me a $800 refund but I’ve got bills on top of bills so that would be wiped as soon as I get it. Do I just pray from September to December that I make it? Do I just accept going hungry? I’ve never been in this deep of a hole ever. 

One side note that angers me: I have one class, a lab, that is the only one that requires physical attendance AND STILL they pushed tuition up $800 dollars. Total Tuition is right around $6000 which is the most I’ve ever paid in a semester. I’m lucky in the sense that I only have around $25,000 in loans to pay off when I leave here but it’s terrifying with no job security and a university that is cutting my aid every year. I’m this close to finishing my undergrad but yet a mountain of money to pay back with no income or disposable cash. 

Thanks for the read and more than happy to provide clarity where I can.",finance

I'm trying to refinance to a 15-year mortgage given the lower interest rates. I know I should shop around for lenders and have a list of various closing costs to compare. The first place I contacted is my current loan servicer. However, they told me they couldn't talk details with me until I submitted an application to refi my loan. I guess I thought I could contact lenders with my information (current interest rate, balance of loan, etc.) and a list of questions; then use the answers to compare lenders and select the best one. Does this mean that I have to apply with each lender just to see what they're willing to offer me? Literally/ELI5, how do you shop for different mortgage lenders when trying to refinance? I suppose they would need to know my credit score to give more information, but it seems weird to me to apply for a bunch of loans just to get information.

I have a house which I bought a few years before meeting the boyfriend. We will call him D. We both earn a good salary in a high COL area as federal employees. We currently make similar salaries (he makes about 93% of what I do but I have to contribute an extra 3% to my pension for the same benefit so it is not much different). Previously, he was living about 30-60 minutes further from his job, so moving in with me saves him hours a week on a commute and made it easier for us to see each other. He has been studying for exams addition to his full time job for most of the past year (and Covid delayed his last exam by 8 months so far), and I have been very supportive of his studies and worked around the limited time we have together. I’m happy to do so, but I point this out because it is one-sided.

He currently pays about 1,000 a month for housing to me and we split the groceries and counseling. He buys food the rare times we go out to eat (about 100/month). 

I pay about 3k a month in mortgage/HOA/utilities. I take care of all household upkeep and furnished the place as well. The house would rent for a similar amount (3k).  

Some additional details: I think he saves about 3/4 of what he earns. The “rent” he pays me every month just goes to savings, so it is not like I need his money in order to afford my life. I just want a partner.

personalfinance,Native American Tribal Loans - Need Advice,"I'm 34, making 73k salaried in my main job, and 18k (so far) this year from a gig job (Shipt). However, I've struggled with gambling addiction for over a decade and have a poor credit score and maxed out credit limits across the board. Despite having a Ch 13 Bankruptcy in my past (discharged 3 years ago), and multiple ""fresh starts"", I have repeated the same behavior over and over, and I still continue to struggle with gambling. I realize the solution is heavily dependent on stopping my addiction from taking over, and I'm currently working with a therapist to address the issue and understand how to manage my compulsive behavior. Stopping Gambling is the answer... no need to lecture on that.

HOWEVER, I am looking for some advice on how to proceed with my current financial mess. I can't really afford an advisor at the moment so I thought I would see if Reddit might have some insight. My main concern is the tribal loan debt I have accrued over the past few months. In order to cover my recent heavy losses, I have resorted to taking out money from the only source that will give it to me - tribal lenders. At this moment I have over $19,344 owed to 7 different tribal lenders. I fully realize how insane that is, and I'm afraid my situation is a bit hopeless. I decided making just min payments on all these loans (which is all I can afford) is pretty futile, so I revoked auto pay authorization last week and for the first time today I missed my payment on all but 2 of the loans (which are due a little later next month).

I'm trying to figure out how to move forward. I've called most of the lenders already, but they don't seem to want to cut any deals except for re-arranging payments that just extend the life of the loan and don't address the issue (which is interest rates ranging from 98% to 164%). Granted, some seemed to imply that I might have better luck negotiating with their collections departments once I go past due. I plan on staying on top of this and not severing contact with them (address the issue, don't ignore it).

It's hard to find good information online about these types of loans, specifically how people have negotiated with them. Debt management companies do not work with tribal lenders, so I've had no luck finding advice or help from the traditional debt non-profits. I did find some reddit threads about people having success negotiating a lower interest rate and a realistic payment plan, but nothing too detailed. I fully intend to pay back what I borrowed, but I need the interest rates to be humane in order to do so.

My fear is they may never agree to a lower interest rate, and the internet seems to suggest they would attempt to sue me, garnish wages, and all sorts of nasty business. Does anyone know what the actual ""typical"" outcome of not paying a tribal loan is? My hunch is they just sell the debt to a collector, but I have nothing to back that up. Also, NONE of these accounts report normal payments to my credit report... so would they suddenly appear as an account on my credit report once I'm late? I assume if it goes to collections it would appear on my reports, but I am not sure if the tribal lenders will suddenly start reporting \*only\* the negative information to the credit bureaus once you go past due (before it is sent to collections). And is there any recourse to get those negative marks removed from my credit report since the loans have astronomically illegal interest rates in both the state of Michigan and USA as a whole?

There are so many questions involved in this, and I don't know if anyone is going to really have a response for me. But if you have any experience or advice, I'd love to hear it.

**More info for curious minds:**

I owe $12,354.29 to credit cards (all of which are maxed out) - Min monthly payment total is $478.99

I owe $19,344.19 to tribal loans - Min monthly payment total is $2,102.17

I owe $8,245.68 to student loans/family member (about $4100 owed to each) - Student loans are currently on covid deferment, and I'm paying $500 a month to the family member.

I have $1607.70 in overdrawn checking account balances that will be taken care of within 2 weeks from now.

Monthly take-home income from salary is $4,108 - gig income take home average is about $1,200 a month.

I also owe $2450 in 2019 federal taxes, which has an extended due date moved back to November. I also owe close to $5000 in estimated taxes for my 2020 gig income earnings that I have \*not\* paid yet. I also have $11,005 in 2020 in taxable gambling jacking winnings that I did \*not\* withhold any state or federal taxes on. I will certainly be able to claim losses against 100% of that amount, but my overall tax liability will increase due to these winnings nonetheless.

**Monthly expenses outside of credit cards/loans:**

Rent- $500 (I rent a room in a friends house)

Cell phone - $75

Pet supplies - $50

Car Insurance - $79

Food - $350

Gas - $80-$100 (I drive for the gig job so it's a little higher than normal)

Misc - $100

(no car payment, no internet or utilities (included in rent), no health insurance premium, therapy sessions are covered by health insurance and HSA money)

To do the math for you - Monthly required payments/expenses total $4235, against my monthly income of $5000-5300 on average. The surplus has historically gone to gambling as I often find myself with less than $100 in my checking account.

I have $0 in savings or emergency funds. $36,000 in 401k (employer does NOT allow loans or early withdrawals on my plan, so that is \*not\* an option expect for an emergency distribution which requires a qualifying event).

My immediate goals are to pay off the negative checking account balances (I'm currently using a separate checking account that is not overdrawn to receive direct deposit and pay bills), and to establish a basic savings. My BF has also agreed to hold on to $500 in emergency funds that I won't have access to, and hopefully I'll have that ready for him within a month or so.

Obviously my ""high yield"" savings account is hardly that at this point, but having a bigger EF is giving me a sense of relief in an uncertain time.

Would it be more advantageous for me to throw that extra payment into my savings instead of paying down my principal during this 0% interest period? Or is it ultimately worth it to continue contributing to paying down my SL?

personalfinance,Invest in Retirement Accounts or pay off loans,"Hi,

I recently finished medical school and I'm in residency and have some federal loans. I read the sidebar where they recommend that I pay off loans that are over 4%. My federal loans are 6-7% annual rate and are about $80k. I'm deciding whether it's better to invest in retirement accounts now and aggressively pay off my loans after I finish residency in 5 years or just focus on paying off my loans now and postpone investing for retirement until my loans are paid off.

These are the 3 options that I have been thinking about.

1) Put all extra savings into paying off loans

2) Max out Roth IRA and use remaining savings to pay off loans every year and aggressively pay off loans after 5 years.

3) Max out Roth IRA and use remaining savings to invest in 401k. Pay off loans aggressively after 5 years.

I don't have many expenses and I'm leaning towards option 2 to max out my Roth IRA and use any extra money towards paying off loans. I don't qualify for an employer 401k match. Does this sound like a good plan or should I be more aggressive in paying off my loans or more aggressive in investing in my 401k? I just feel that in the future, I will be limited in investing for retirement due to the roth IRA and 401k limits and investing in the roth early will be much more helpful down the line compared to paying a few more thousand in interest.",finance

stocks,Interesting stories from Tuesday,"Taser and police body camera manufacturer, **Axon Enterprise** $AAXN jumped on Tuesday after several announcements that show the company is continually developing new products;

&amp;#x200B;

\- a new artificial intelligence tool which will allow police to ""use artificial intelligence (AI) to accelerate the review and transcription of evidence, generating significant time and cost saving benefits for agencies.""

\- ""a new real-time operations platform ... to connect dispatch, patrol officers, field sergeants and tactical officers"" that it is calling ""Axon Respond.""

\- a partnership with Fotokite to provide ""live-streamed footage within Axon's digital evidence management solution, Axon Evidence.""

&amp;#x200B;

With a market cap of $5.4bn Axon has become the trusted go to provider for tasers and police evidence solutions.  Signing up Axon is the safe bet for police departments in a market that Axon has conservatively estimated at $8.4 billion (excluding opportunities in US federal law enforcement, international Axon Fleet, and prisons and corrections).  Recent results and developments suggest the actual TAM is probably a lot larger.

&amp;#x200B;

[**Salesforce.com**](https://Salesforce.com) $CRM shares were sharply higher in late trading Tuesday after the company’s fiscal second-quarter results thrashed Wall Street’s estimates with revenue of $5.15 billion, up 29% from a year ago.  Trading on a valuation of 11x revenues and almost 100x EPS I would expect as much.  For the full year, the company forecasts revenue of $20.7 billion to $20.8 billion, with non-GAAP profits of $3.72 to $3.74 a share compared to estimates projecting $20.1 billion revenues and $2.96 a share.

&amp;#x200B;

On a much more reasonable valuation (TTM PE 13.34), **Toll Brothers** $TOL also beat expectations in its Q3 with EPS of $0.90 and sales of $1.65bn versus forecasts of $0.71 and $1.5bn.  The company pointed to growing demand, driven by historically low interest rates, the undersupply of homes, and the COVID pandemic leading to consumers focusing on the importance of a home “more than ever.”  Forward looking gauges — pending sales, housing starts and building permits — suggest that, against all odds, the US housing market is holding up. However the FT Lex points to timber prices, which have more than doubled, as a headwind for the sector.  Framing timber, along with installation, accounts for nearly a fifth of the cost of a house, according to the National Association of Home Builders. Thats going to hit margins.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally **BigCommerce Holdings** $BIGC spiked 37% after the company announced that its e-commerce checkout service would be available through Facebook's Instagram app.  The app allows consumers to check out on Instagram, instead of leaving the app and going to a merchant's website to finalize an e-commerce sale and could help merchants (who sign up) more easily sell their products to Instagram’s 1 billion  users.  It could also help BigCommerce get a foot in the door with merchants before going on to cross sell other products and build their online store (similar to Shopify). 

 

Shopify shareholders don’t seem too worried just yet.  Shopify is about 15x larger by sales, cashflow positive and building out a fulfilment network that could end up challenging Amazon.  Nevertheless, it’s a huge development for $BIGC who, with a market cap of just $7bn, are still at an early stage of growth with a long runway in front of them.  

&amp;#x200B;

personalfinance,Refinancing too soon?,"I refinanced earlier this year before the pandemic was in full force. Closing date was mid-march. I went from a 4.25% interest rate to 3.625%. No closing costs were paid for the 3.625% refinance as it was higher than market rate at the time and the closing cost were reflected in the higher rate, principal balance remained the same. 

I am currently seeing approximately a 3.00% rate from my current lender and other online lenders with about 2k in total closing costs(no closing cost is no longer an option or comes with an even higher rate then I have now). Savings of about $74 a month, total payback time of \~27 months. I'm only planning on living in this house for 2-4 more years before moving, at that time the house will either be sold or used as a rental property depending on my financial circumstances and the real estate market. 

Current loan amount\~$215,000 

LTV\~67%

Credit Score 760+

My question is two fold, is there any chance that my current lender would consider waiving some of the closing costs to stay with them or are some closing costs waived automatically(lender fee, title insurance, recording fee etc.)? Is there any penalties to look out for on the current mortgage since there was a lender credit associated with it? 

Also, any recommended lenders with low/no closing cost options that may be worth checking out? Do you even think it would be worth refinancing again?",finance

but you shouldnt just see 0 interest and base price and think it's free financing, it is if you compare it to the full price.

but if you take 5% off the purchase price for your alternate option that is truly what you are paying extra for. you could either pay 950 up front or 1000 over 18 months so its worth considering that 50 saved/extra as interest.

if you do this over 18 months the effective interest rate is 6.7% annually. so now you can decide whether youd rather pay the full (discounted) amount up front or pay 6.7% effective interest.

I already have gains in AAPL and TSLA of 400% and 600%, respectively. If it weren't for taxes, I probably would've taken my earnings and called it a day.

I'm married filing joint and the gains wouldn't put us in another tax bracket. And honestly, once I sell, I'm not sure what I would do with the extra funds. Potentially reinvest them in SPY or use it to pay off some of my wife's student loans which are incurring 7% interest.

investing,Bond convexity and interest rate sensitivity,"I'm trying to figure something out but the information I've found online so far hasn't been exactly helpful to me.

I'm interested in comparing two bond issues that have different maturities and different coupons. This is useful to me but it may very well be useful to others in a similar situation.   
(sidebar: I haven't found any tools where you can compare the convexity curve of two issues, if anyone wants to build that website).

**First question**:  
One of the bonds has shorter maturity but smaller coupon payments. The other one has longer maturity but bigger coupon payments.  

Are the interest rate sensitivity benefits of a shorter maturity issue generally offset by its smaller coupon? 

(I can get into specifics in the comments but I want to keep the question broad for the benefit of future readers.)

**Second question:**  

When looking at the sensitivity and convexity of a bond you are supposed to consider an increase or a decrease in interest rates (to calculate approximate variation in bond market price), but  
it's not immediately clear to me which rate I should be looking at:

personalfinance,Defer paying off student loans to purchase a house?,"Hey all! Throwaway account here. Wanted to get all your thoughts to our philosophy about student loans and purchasing a house.

A bit of background... my spouse and I got married 1 year ago and are expecting our first child in a few months (yay!). Our careers are in performing arts and engineering. What a match! We also run a small but respectable teaching studio for performing arts, and have a few very small (for now) businesses outside of that. We also are looking into growing those very small businesses to something viable, potentially go into rental properties long term, or a few other ventures or combination of all of these. That won't be until a few years down the road though.

**Finances:**

* Combined pre-tax income is about $100K. Performing arts is obviously affected by Covid, so we expect this income to increase once everything passes.
* We've been running a tight budget with a bit more room for improvement, and have paid off all $35K of credit card debt as of a few months ago. Lots of changed habits :)
* We currently have about $100K of combined student loans, all fixed rates from 3.7% to 6.6%. Most of these are federal. Currently, these are on Covid forbearance, and private is on minimum payments (just refinanced the private).
* We currently have next month's budget fully funded (envelope method), and have \~$7k in savings outside of that.
* Next goal is to grow that $7K to $15K by year end, which should give us a good cushion.
* One car is paid off and we'll be buying another car soon in cash as we will be losing a company car I have. Probably about $5K. This will probably happen by year end also.
* The nature of our work requires us live in a house and not an apartment or townhome, so we rent for $1,500 which is average for homes in our market in the Southeast.
* Both credit scores are \~ 800.

On to the question... What are thoughts for delaying paying student loans faster and instead purchasing a house?  As we are growing our family, we both agree that we need to own a house for stability for our family. On top of that, we have more long-term thinking and hate how much money is going to rent. For a $200K house, we could get a fixed 30-year mortgage, and total cost of ownership (including taxes, insurance, PMI, and a maintenance fund) would be about equal or less of what our rent is. We have not gone through preapproval or anything except talk to a realtor about our market and asked questions.

So, our current strategy over the next few years is:

1. Keep student loan payments on the minimums
2. Purchase that second car in cash
3. Build up that savings to $15K
4. Build up a down payment outside of that $15K savings of 5% (so probably $15K to cover closing costs as well)
5. Purchase a house
6. Aggressively pay down student loans.
7. ? (depends on our careers and businesses).

We will increase our total debt to \~$300K or so by doing this, but our rent money will actually go towards building equity. It seems to be the consensus this is the riskier action to take, but with a better payoff. We see it as an opportunity cost of accruing an extra $1K in student loan interest (on top of what we would have accrued if we used the down payment to pay off student loans instead), but gaining $6K in equity for the first year and only increasing from there.

Anyways, what are all your thoughts on this strategy? Is there something major that I'm not considering?

Thanks!",finance

MachineLearning,[D] Odd Questions Regarding Transformer (NLP),"The goal of asking these questions is to try to find intuition behind certain ideas in the Transformer architecture.

1. **Regarding Decoder layers**: I understand that there can be N number of Encoder layers. This is also true for the Decoder. With the Encoder, it makes sense to have N layers because along with the Multi-Head Attention, the N layers of Encoder allow the model to refine its attention on different words. Why does the Decoder need N layers though? Is it because each Nth layer of the Encoder produces different values for the attention matrix and thus allows the Decoder to use these different attention matrices to derive an output?
2. **Regarding the specific number of Layers of Decoder and Encoder**: Can the Decoder and Encoder have a different number of layers? In the „Attention Is All You Need“ paper and other articles I have read online, they seem to use the same number of Encoder and Decoder layers. What would be the logic of using a different number of Decoder layers compared to the Encoder?

I am currently an active duty military member who has lived overseas in Japan for over 7 years and will continue to live in Japan for the foreseeable future. I am trying to buy a property near the base where I am stationed and renting it out to other service members. This allows me to have their Overseas Housing Allowance (aka OHA) come to me as I would be the homeowner. For those of you who are unaware of what OHA is or how it works, it is a monthly reoccurring stipend paid to service members to live off installation at overseas duty locations. Basically our rent is paid for by the US government at no cost to us. Here is where it gets interesting. It seems to be not based off market value in the slightest as what the government pays us for rent is 3-4x that of what a Japanese national would pay *for the same exact property.* For example, I currently collect OHA for the house I currently live in off base. The US government pays me my maximum allowed allowance for my area which is ¥180,000 a month. ($1700USD) If a Japanese national rented my place after I move out, they would be charged $400-$600USD tops. The profit margin for having American military tenets is astronomical. Not sure why this is but thank the military industrial complex for it. I just want to take advantage of it while I'm in. 

That being said the most difficult barrier for entry in this situation is obviously financing. Most standard US banks will not provide a mortgage for property overseas. No Japanese banks will provide mortgages to service members because we have no verifiable Japanese income and legally we are ""temporary residents."" As service members living in Japan we are exempt from passport and alien registration laws that other foreigners need to uphold. 

What are my loan options? Surely there are people living in the US that have vacation condos/ski lodges/beach houses ect overseas? Where do these people go for financing? Bank of America and Chase bank both have branches in Japan. Are those options? I know the interest rate would be much higher of course. And much greater down payment is required. At least 20% from what I have read. I am ok with both of these conditions. 

House in question asking price $103,000. I would make offer starting at about $95,000 and go up from there. I can afford a down payment of about 25%-30% with liquid cash I have on hand. My FICO credit score is 810. Only outstanding debt I have is $10k on my car loan. Are there any financing options that don't require me to dip into my retirement accounts? I know it's a possibility and in doing so I could afford to buy the house outright in cash, but I *really* would rather not do that.

stocks,RKT launch schedule,"RKT will be going to the moon. 
Takeoff: tomorrow @JPowell Speech

Moon: Sept 2nd earnings 

Mars: when ratings are released by the major firms for RKT

Beyond: Dan Gilbert keeps being Dan Gilbert.
Edit: my reasoning \/

TLDR at end.
Speech: long term low-interest rates will boost the housing market. 

Earnings &amp; Ratings: although RKT has given us a peek at Q2 earnings, nothing is ‘official’ yet. Having official earnings and projections will encourage investors (not traders, but long term IRA, funds, etc.). Especially after the major firms release ratings (good).

Beyond: Dan Gilbert has done very well thus far. And by just looking at one example (a very small sample size, but this gets the point across), we can see that RKT is fundamentally undervalued. RKT has 76 times more profits than TREE. When comparing their value to RKT, RKT should be 5x more valuable. And this isn’t even getting into RKT Price/earnings (8.63), Forward Price/Earnings (6.19), or even their PEG.  

This isn’t to mention that RKT isn’t considered a ‘fintech’ when they are wayyy ahead of other mortgage lenders considerably on the technological front. I know a mortgage lender at one of the “big banks,” and even says himself RKT is the future and banks consider them a threat. 

TLDR; RKT is undervalued, and it’s just waiting for people to realize/verify it.

personalfinance,What about buying a new car to get PHEV tax rebates?,"From what I understand, people in tune with personal finance are against buying new cars because they depreciate the moment you drive them off the lot, and there is a higher risk of becoming upside down on the loan.

I'm looking at buying a Rav4 Prime in 2 years, after building my 6mo emergency fund and then a 20% down payment plus registration/taxes. I am strongly considering buying new because of the $7500 federal and $1000 state tax rebates I will receive for buying new instead of used. According to caredge.com, the regular Rav4 depreciates by 11.79% after one year, and 22.82% after two years (it does not list associated average mileage). For a $40k Rav4 Prime, that would be $4,716 and $9,128 respectively (assuming the same depreciation rates). Therefore, with an $8500 tax rebate, buying new would be equivalent to buying nearly 2 years old.

With my current savings rate, I will be able to pay the car off within 14 months of the down payment and only delay early retirement by 2 months. I feel anxious to buy sooner rather than later (hence the financing) because of the reduced maintenance costs and free commute (free chargers at work). Of course my insurance premium and registration will increase though. My current car is a 2005 Corolla with 205k miles on it that is going strong but the high mileage makes me anxious. I'm tired of churning through used cars and want to settle down with one car for a while.

So what hidden fees are missing in my calculations for buying new vs used? I have never purchased from a dealer before so any knowledge you have to share is welcome. I would also like a nice big warranty because I am sick of doing all my own car repairs, but I don't know anything about what that would cost or if it's really worth it.

worldpolitics,China can get contaminated meat from Kazakhstan,"In recent years the cooperation between our countries has developed very effectively in a variety of industries. And it is unexplainable, why does Astana take such steps that can cause nothing but surprise and indignation, using the existing warm and trusting relations between Beijing and Astana. 

Now the Government of Kazakhstan deliberately hides an unfavorable epizootic situation in the country, which, according to Chinese experts, is caused by unprofessionalism of the Kazakh Ministry of Agriculture. This concerns such a dangerous sphere of its activity as ensuring biological safety. Such situation is doubly dangerous due to the ongoing pandemic of Covid-19 coronavirus, which revealed numerous vulnerabilities in the national systems of ensuring biological safety of different states. 

Already in 2016, the outbreak of nodular dermatitis had occurred in Atyrau region of Kazakhstan. In 2017-2018, the Expert Council under the Ministry of Agriculture of Kazakhstan has decided to prevent further development of cattle disease and to conduct its vaccination using vaccine “LUMPIVAX” produced by the Kenya Veterinary Vaccines Production Institute - KEVEVAPI (Nairobi, Kenya).

It is indicative that this drug is prohibited for the use in many countries of the world due to the fact that it contains the so-called “hot strain”, which causes strong post-vaccination complications and which is released into the environment and leads to long-term infection of farms, pastures, slaughterhouses and further the formation of long-term stable infection site in the future.

For these reasons, the Russian Federation doesn’t use the vaccine “LUMPIVAX” categorically, which works closely with China in the field of biosafety. 

But it is still used in Kazakhstan, which has already led to the spread of the virus from the sites of primary outbreaks at the borders of the republic to the interior of the country. And in mid-February 2019, the Ministry of Agriculture ordered for an urgent suspension of vaccination with the drug “LUMPIVAX” and the disposal of vaccine stocks in the regions where it was delivered.

Thus, non-professional actions of the Ministry of Agriculture of Kazakhstan led to an unfavorable epizootic situation in the country, which the officials of this agency hide from the International Office of Epizootics (OIE) and major trading partners and states, including China. 

Kazakhstan has an urgent need to purchase and use the latest safe vaccines, and there is no such production facility on its territory. But, instead of addressing to their partners for help, Astana continues not only to hide the situation, but also tries to buy a sadly proven Kenyan vaccine “LUMPIVAX” via indirect means and starts using it under the brand of its domestic development. 

The reason of this behavior is explained. The vaccine purchase in other states even in small batches will lead to fact publicity of circulation of nodular dermatitis virus, which will oblige Kazakhstan to notify the scale and areas of the disease distribution in the order established by international law.

Currently, the huge Chinese food market has not acute, but still shortage of products, including meat due to the strained relations between Beijing and Washington and the sanctions policy applied by the Americans. Because of this, many countries are justifiably seeking to take the U.S. place in the market for food imported by China, which is logical and understandable. But is it necessary to use such methods as misleading and even direct deception?

After all, trying to hide the epidemic of nodular dermatitis among cattle, the government of Kazakhstan is trying to find channels to obtain vaccines from the states as far away as possible from their main trading partners - the EU and EES countries. In October 2019, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Kazakhstan was instructed to establish direct contact through diplomatic channels with the representatives of the Kenya Veterinary Vaccines Production Institute, which produces the same harmful vaccine “LUMPIVAX” in order to resolve issues of cooperation and purchase of the drug.

Kazakhstan does not have its own representative office in Kenya. Therefore, on October 8, 2019, the contact was established at a personal meeting of A. Baekenov, the Embassy of Kazakhstan in Ethiopia with the First Secretary of the Embassy of Kenya in Ethiopia Margaret Solomon. Negotiations were successful, and in return, Kenya demanded from Kazakhstan to support its candidacy in the election of non-permanent members of the UN Security Council for 2021-2020, about which the Ambassador of Kazakhstan in Ethiopia B. Sadykov informed his Ministry of Foreign Affairs on October 15, 2019. 

Already on October 16, 2019, a meeting of Kazakh ambassador in Ethiopia B. Sadykov and Kenya Ambassador in Ethiopia K. Mwangi was held. The diplomatic mission to Kenya of adviser of the Embassy of Kazakhstan in Ethiopia A. Akhmetov was preparing for the organization of close cooperation with representatives of KEVEVAPI and the Kenyan body regulating the production of vaccines.

Due to the fact that the vaccine “LUMPIVAX” produced by KEVEVAPI is significantly discredited in the Republic of Kazakhstan by negative experience of its use, as well as mass rejection of the vaccine by agricultural producers, the large-scale use of this vaccine in Kazakhstan has actually become very problematic. 

Therefore, it should be assumed with a high degree of probability that in such a situation Kazakhstan has already taken the way of direct forgery and fraud.

Experts consider that supplies of Kenyan vaccine to Kazakhstan will necessarily involve the use of mechanisms to hide its real origin. It may be issued as an alleged “new” drug created and produced in Kazakhstan, which would be a gross falsification. 

In 2019, the vaccine against nodular dermatitis, which was allegedly developed by the Research Institute of Biosafety Problems of the Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Kazakhstan (Gvardeysky village, Zhambyl region), was included to the State Register of Veterinary Preparations and Additives of the Ministry of Agriculture. This vaccine uses the strain “Neethling”, similar to that used in Kenyan vaccine “LUMPIVAX”. There is no sale in Kazakhstan and foreign markets, which indicates the absence of actual production of this drug in Kazakhstan.

The combination of these data allows experts to argue that the operation of state registration of Kazakhstan's vaccine against nodular dermatitis (certificate RK-VP-1-3730-18 of October, 24, 2018) is one of the stages of concealing the supply of Kenyan vaccine “LUMPIVAX” and its subsequent use for vaccination of cattle under the guise of a national drug.

Deliveries from Kenya will be made in unmarked vials at the insistence of Kazakhstan. According to experts' estimates, the National Biotechnology Center in Stepnogorsk is the only enterprise in Kazakhstan that has the necessary production facilities for relabeling “LUMPIVAX” and legalizing the actual production of such product in large amount. 

In order to conceal the Kenyan origin of the vaccine, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Kazakhstan insisted on direct tacit contacts with the drug manufacturer, Kenya Veterinary Vaccines Production Institute, in negotiations with Kenyan diplomats in Ethiopia.

Now Kazakhstan has started to implement the National Program of Beef Livestock Breeding Development for 2018 - 2027, which provides for the increase of cattle stock from 7 to 15 million heads. It is planned to implement an ambitious plan to create an export-oriented industry of meat cattle breeding in the country by using unused pasture land, which forms a significant part of foreign exchange earnings to the budget from the agricultural sector of Kazakhstan.

Taking into account the probable food shortage predicted by the UN due to the Covid-19 coronavirus epidemic, one cannot but admit that this program of Kazakhstan is very timely. But it is a rhetorical question whether it should be achieved by such methods...

After all, the breeding stock of cattle, imported into Kazakhstan, will be subjected to a large-scale vaccination with the Kenyan drug at the initial stage of the Program. This will inevitably lead to extensive contamination with nodular dermatitis of animals and large areas in Kazakhstan.

The existence of such stable sites in the border areas of Kazakhstan poses a real threat of cross-border spread of nodular dermatitis virus into the territory of China with the subsequent occurrence of systematic sporadic outbreaks of difficult to control disease already in the territory of China itself.

In connection with the plans of the Government of Kazakhstan to annually increase of beef export, it seems likely to increase the supply of Kazakh meat products to China from areas troubled by nodular dermatitis.",finance

Here what's happening, and what is going to happen.

The stock market is not all green. Pandemic-infected stocks (cruise lines, air lines, etc.) are struggling. Pandemic-supported stocks (big tech) are thriving. Then there's la-la land, the stocks that aren't suffering but aren't booming (most banks, coca cola, etc.). So what's going on?

With so much extra stimulus and savings account deemed useless due to low interest rates, stocks have the most upside. There's gotta be a crash soon, right? Wrong. At least not for the next few months. The stock market pre-pandemic was BOOMING. If the pandemic never hit, the market would have continued to boom. Although unemployment is still high, those who have been fortunate enough to keep their jobs have gotten extra stimulus, and nothing to do but sit at home and invest. It's the take of 2 economies, some are suffering, some are profiting. 

Realistically, if the pandemic never hit, the stock market would have continued to boom right up until the election, would have had a small pull back, then continued upward. So what will happen? Come the election, depending on the result, the market may ""pause"" for a second. The real kicker will be the economy post-vaccine. Currently, the market is being held by the Fed, as well as future hopes. Investors believe once a vaccine is available, the economy will pick up where it left off and boom. But what if it doesn't? With so many businesses closing, even with a vaccine, the unemployment rate will stay relatively high. With a vaccine, the stimulus will most likely stop. No stimulus in conjunction with a high unemployment will hault retail sales. With a vaccine, mortgage rates will start to creep back up, with will hurt the housing market. Once a vaccine is available, if the economy doesn't bounce back instantly, you'll see the market react. That, mixed with the election, is when a crash will occur.

&gt;Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell unveiled a new framework of thinking for the central bank that will tolerate inflation “moderately” above its 2% target. The Fed also committed to reviewing this policy every five years.

&gt;In a speech on Thursday morning, Powell acknowledged the painful lessons of runaway inflation in the 1970’s, but warned that the persistence of low inflation over the last eight years risks new economic difficulties. 

&gt;“Many find it counterintuitive that the Fed would want to push up inflation,” Powell said. But the Fed chief warned that low inflation leads to declining inflation expectations, which has the effect of “diminishing our capacity to stabilize the economy through cutting interest rates.”

&gt;The Fed’s target for inflation is 2%, measured as core personal consumption expenditures (which excludes volatile components like energy and food prices). But since establishing that goal in its 2012 Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, the Fed has averaged inflation of only about 1.6%, touching 2% only briefly in 2018.

&gt;In 2019, the Fed launched a nationwide listening tour to see if it could tweak its statement with the objective of nudging inflation up toward its target.

&gt;On Thursday morning, Powell announced the conclusion of that review and said the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee had unanimously approved new language that would allow for inflation moderately above 2% “for some time” following periods where inflation “has been running persistently” below that target. 

&gt;The strategy is known as flexible average inflation targeting, in part because the Fed will not use a particular mathematical formula to define a time horizon over which 2% inflation is achieved.

&gt;“Of course, if excessive inflationary pressures were to build or inflation expectations were to ratchet above levels consistent with our goal, we would not hesitate to act,” Powell said.



&gt;Powell emphasized in his speech that although the major changes address its Congressional mandate on price stability, the Fed still places a heavy priority on its other dual mandate of maximum employment.

&gt;The revised statement now says the Fed’s policy decisions need to be guided by assessments of “the shortfalls of employment from its maximum level.”

&gt;Powell’s remarks, delivered virtually to the Fed’s annual Jackson Hole meeting, describe the change as a reflection of “our view that a robust job market can be sustained without causing an outbreak of inflation.”

&gt;The Fed also added language that commits the FOMC to “use its full range of tools to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals.” The statement will now also require the Fed to undertake a “thorough” review of the statement every five years.",finance

Note: Any taxable withdrawal you receive that is not rolled over to another qualified plan or IRA will be included as part of your taxable income and be subject to federal income tax withholding.

personalfinance,Refinanced at the very end of 2019 and now thinking about doing it again. Appreciate any help you all can give,"We bought our house back in February of 2019 getting a loan from our initial lender for $324K with an interest rate of about 4.625%. Then in December we noticed that interest rates had gone down a good amount so we decided to refinance. 

We changed lenders and went with Quicken Loans, and I'm looking back and wondering if I could have done better, as the closing costs were really high, but what can I say I'm very much out of my element on this and didn't realize it at the time (This is the first time we've owned a house). The loan costs were over $10K. This brought our mortgage up to $327K, with an interest rate of 3.75%

Now with interest rates even lower we were considering again. I found this subreddit and realized that Quicken might be known for high fees. And that $10K from my first refinance seems to agree with that. We reached out to them again just to see what they are offering and I was curious if any of you all could offer feedback or suggestions. I'd like to get more familiar with all this because while talking with the agent I just felt very much out of my element.

Anyway the estimate provided is suggesting total loan costs of just under $5K with origination costs being about $3.5K. And I think the point they are trying to sell me on is that they are waiving the need for an appraisal. Should I think about shopping around? I'm just kinda frustrated that while I'm lowering the interest rate it feels like we are constantly hitting the reset button entirely on the mortgage. If we take this estimate we are back to owing $327 because of all the associated costs.

Additional Info that might help but things in context.

* the house is valued at about $400K


Thanks in advance!

**Edit:** Somehow I forgot to include the interest rate... The new interest rate would be 2.99%


**Update**
I just spoke to AmeriSave and after going through everything the estimate they gave me is offering an interest rate of 2.25% (buying down from 2.625%)

personalfinance,Only one income used for mortgage loan approval?,"My partner and I are about to close on a home and are co-borrowers on the mortgage loan. Due to employment uncertainty around COVID-19, the lender asked for extra verification of income--but only from me. When we asked why my partner didn't also receive the request, the lending agent responded that only my income was used for loan approval, since it saved on paperwork. This sounds reasonable, but I'd like to make sure that our combined incomes were used to determine the interest rate. Our loan application included financial information for both of us (and in fact, my partner was listed first, and I as the co-borrower).

So today, the Fed announces they intend to encourage higher inflation and keep interest rates low. If my understanding was correct, this should be good news for SCHP and bad news for SCHH. But the prices of those responded in exactly the opposite direction, SCHP (TIPS) down, SCHH (REIT) up.

personalfinance,Sell and buy again OR sell and rent,"Hi all,

I have a big financial decision to make and I'm just interested to hear others perspectives because I'm really struggling with a decision. I'm not in a hurry so that helps. A little background. My ex husband and I bought a home in 2005. We went underwater for a while in 2008, then him and I got a divorce. I was only working part-time and couldn't afford the mortgage but was able to apply for a modification and got the payment to a doable amount. After 5 years, my payment started going up between the interest rate rising (per the modification terms) and my property taxes. Fast forward to today and my mortgage payment (with taxes and insurance) is WAY too much of my paycheck. I survive (my bills are paid on time and my kids and I never go without anything we need) but there's nothing left for extras and I can't save anything. I'm at the point now (I'm 41) where I'm tired of living like this and need to make a change. Not having any savings (other than a small 401k) is killing me.  I can't sell and rent something in the same area because rent is insane and it wouldn't make sense. So I plan to relocate to a lower cost of living area (where I know a few people). I'm debating between two options.

&amp;#x200B;

1) Sell my house and use the equity to purchase a house outright (or close to it, maybe take a small loan) in the new location. This would leave me with not much leftover but I wouldn't have a mortgage payment (just taxes and insurance).

&amp;#x200B;

2) Sell my house, rent an apartment in the new location, and use the equity to pay off my student loans and other small debts, purchase a car because mine is very old and on it's last leg and invest the rest for retirement. Then eventually buy another house later.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just not sure what would be the best financial move. I'm leaning towards renting because then I'm able to pay off all my debt and get that weight off my chest. Just for reference, with the current value of my home, I'd probably walk away with about $400k. 

&amp;#x200B;

Additional info: I currently live in the Bay Area and I'd be relocating to Las Vegas/Henderson area. I would need to find a new job but it shouldn't be too hard in my field so I'm not really worried about that. My tentative plan is to make this move next summer. Two of my 3 kids are adults and the youngest is a freshman in high school. He has the option of staying in the Bay Area with his dad but I'm hoping he will come with me.  Also, I currently receive child support which will end when my son turns 18 (in 3.5 years), which is another reason I have to figure something out because without that child support, there is NO way I can continue to pay my current mortgage.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance for any advice! Let me know if you need any further info.",finance

investing,Why own value if it underperforms in both bear and bull markets?,"For this I'm specifically referring to Vanguard's Value (VTV) and growth (VUG) etfs which both started trading in 2004. 

With the most recent crisis there was an actual rationale as to why growth would outperform; most tech is considered ""growth"" and a lot of tech companies actually did do well with everyone at home. So I went back to the earlier days and looked at the great recession, and it surprised me. 

From 7/9/07 (peak before crash) to 3/14/09 (trough) VTV fell 55% whereas VUG fell 43%. Granted the outperformance is not huge, its surprising that growth outperformed at all. Following the bottom in March 2009 the ETFs kept pace with each other until VUG broke out in the second half of 2010 and widened its lead over VTV substantially in 2012. 

My core question is why the hell should I own value? It's meant to cushion the blow during downturns but growth outperformed during the past two major crashes. Many will say dividend yield is a main factor in value investing, but in that case, buying individual value companies is a better bet in my opinion. Offers typically higher upside without being exposed to companies which have been irrelevant for decades. 

I'm truly just wondering what I'm missing for owning value funds. The low interest rate environment is likely impacting the divergence between value and growth but still, with tech as resilient as it is, I don't see any reason to own something else.",finance

personalfinance,Does a rollover IRA have more tax benefits than a retail brokerage?,"I asked a few weeks ago about taking some money out of our HYSA and putting it into a retail brokerage. After getting some good advice, we looked back over our accounts. My husband has a Roth 401k where 10% of his check goes to pre-tax and 10% goes to Roth, which maxes him out for the Roth portion and also meets the match put forth by his company. 

In addition to that, he and I both have rollover IRAs from previous jobs. From what I understand, those aren't technically considered IRAs once they're rolled over. Is that correct? 

He does not contribute to his rollover IRA and I contribute a small amount ($100 per month and 2% of my credit card points). We were going to open a brokerage account through Fidelity and buy $10k worth of SPY but now I'm wondering if it makes more sense to split that and put $5k into each of our IRAs to max those out instead. 

The only downside I see is that if we put that money into our IRAs, we will not be able to take it back out until we are 59.5 or be subjected to a 10% penalty. If we take it out after 59.5, we will not be subject to the penalty but will have to pay state and federal taxes. 

If we put the money into a brokerage account instead and leave it for at least a year, we will have to pay taxes as well. So I guess I'm mostly confused on the tax benefits of a rollover IRA, or if there even are any. 

I promise I've googled and tried to figure this out myself, but it's just incredibly confusing, particularly because I'm not even sure our rollover IRAs are actually IRAs or if they're just brokerage accounts at this point.",finance

There were some posts on T-Mobile Money a while ago, but it seems they were created before interest rates on savings accounts dropped like a rock.

While I'm not looking to shift my entire savings account (ease of use &gt; couple of dollars saved, imo), I was considering maybe taking advantage of the 4% APY T-Mobile gives. I'd just drop 3K of my savings there and let it sit, basically.

There's no downside, correct? I'm still new to using savings accounts, so I don't know if there are things I'm missing. I know there's a deposit requirement to get that 4%, but I imagine me just transferring money from C1 should work.

I could just about pay for this out of my emergency cash fund but I really don't want to tap into it. It's about 2 months of my salary.

Quotes are coming in at about $12k and I need to pay a few grand to remove and reinstall solar panels.

I have a HELOC with about $5K available ($20K) limit. The \~$15k balance is a kitchen remodel I'm actively paying down. I was hoping to have the HELOC down enough to fund the roof, but again, this needs to happen sooner than later. I could probably cut that balance in half over the next year.

So I'm looking into my options. My wide an i both have excellent credit and besides the house/HELOC, we have no debt. Credits cards for routine shopping but we pay off the balance each month.

My home is worth \~$245K, $177K principle balance, 22yrs left (30/yr 4.125 interest rate).

I am looking to refi, but not sure I can cash out enough to pay for the roof, since I'd have to pay off the HELOC too. I'd also want to go down to a 20yr or even a 15yr if it was worth it.

I also could look to increase the HELOC balance to $30k (prime +1 variable rate). When we got it years ago for an improvement that's been paid off, it was based on a 90% LTV ratio. So there is equity in the home to do that if the bank allowed it.

Most people at my income level would probably consider this a reasonable purchase to make, but most people are not very financially savvy.  Also, the uncertainty of Covid affecting my job security affects my decision.

I'm considering saving about $500 each month for the next few months so that I could increase that 3k down payment to 6k.

personalfinance,Recommendations for children's bank accounts,"My wife and I currently have savings accounts for our kids at a local credit union that we put their monthly allowance into. We would like to move their money into something that has a better interest rate and makes it for them easier access to their spending money.

For each of the children I would like to set up both a high yield savings account and a checking account with a debit card so that they have a dedicated place to save and pool that they can spend from. 

I have accounts with Ally and am generally pretty happy. I was told I can open custodial accounts for the kids, but that they would be linked to my existing login portal. 
I would prefer that each of the kids have their own login account. This is primarily because I don't want to clutter up my view as I am doing my banking with irrelevant accounts; and as the gets get older I would like to loosen the reigns on their accounts without giving them unfettered access to the family finances.

Is there a better way to set up multiple accounts with Ally or is there another online bank that has an account structure that works well for getting children better acquainted with their money?",finance

stocks,Bond Crash and Dollar Squeeze,"I've been trying to understand the correlation between the bonds, currency, and stocks to determine what the macro outlook might be for the remainder of the year through 2021-2022. With Chairman Powell doubling down on the FEDs desire to maintain an average 2% inflation target (mind you this has never been achieved consistently) wouldn't this put selling pressure in the secondary bond market as bondholders seek yields? A selloff in bonds would inherently cause a rise in yields, forcing future bond auctions to raise yields to attract new investors. These higher yields would, in turn, cause an influx of domestic and foreign money into the higher-yielding bonds, causing a short squeeze of the USD. Or would money start to flow to emerging markets? I think that an uncontrollable rise in yields would be bullish for the dollar despite the FEDs dovish policy, partly because of the demand for dollars spurred by rising yields, but also because of the dollar's position as the world's reserve currency. The uncontrollable rising of yields would cause a dollar demand and another liquidity crisis, despite the massive printing via purchases. To be clear, the FED would not be able to purchase notes once a bond sell-off occurs without being forced to auction off new notes at higher rates. This would happen when there is no one left to sell. (i.e. everyone is in the pool, whether it be equities or emerging markets, at which point, no one is left to buy. With no buyer to push price higher, the market will fall, and abruptly.)

personalfinance,"Chase Auto insists a car loan my dealership paid off is delinquent, reported me to collections","Throwaway account but please don't ignore. :)

I am in an infuriating situation with Chase Auto after trading in a car with a loan on it (less than $6k... when I have over $100k in other accounts at Chase that I will be closing when all of this is done). A timeline is below:

* 7/7: Purchased new vehicle by trading in two vehicles, one of which had a remaining loan w/ Chase Auto Finance for $5,733.
   * I was told by the dealership they'd take care of the loan and not to make further payments.
* 7/27: Started getting concerned about the car loan after a few weeks and contacted Chase pre-emptively. They said they have not received a payoff and threatened me with a late fee.
* 7/28: Called dealership. They said don't worry, they contacted Chase and they're behind on processing payments because of COVID-19. They won't charge you a late fee, ignore any communication they send you about this.
* 8/3:  Chase charged me a $10 late fee and posted a late notice letter electronically to my account.
   * I called Chase. Was on hold for an hour, and their rep was rude.
   * He told me to pay the late fee, and have the dealership cancel their check and send another one.
   * I asked for something in writing stating they were behind on processing payments. The rep refused.
   * I called the dealership. They told me they'd fax a copy of the check. They said they realized this made them look bad, but wait until the 17th, it should be resolved by then.
* 8/17: It's not resolved.
   * I call the dealership and tell them I want a conference call between them, Chase, and I, so I can hear from whatever backchannel (?) person they're talking to at Chase that this problem is on Chase's end (at this point I'm beginning to distrust the dealership... I don't think they're scamming me, but them telling me one thing while Chase insists another isn't OK with me)
   * Dealership rep agrees and gets ahold of someone at Chase with what she says is ""good news"". Goes to transfer me (not conference call) and accidentally (...) hangs up instead.
   * Sigh.
   * I wait a couple minutes and call back the dealership to tell them they hung up on me. Rep gets flustered and says she has to ""try"" to get ahold of someone at Chase again. Says to expect another call soon.
   * Someone else calls me back from the dealership and transfers me off to Chase again. This isn't what I wanted.
   * Chase rep still says there is no record of the payment, the account is delinquent. Admits that Chase is behind on processing payments but won't provide anything in writing saying so.
   * Claims they didn't receive the faxed copy of the check the dealership says they sent in early August.
   * I escalate to a supervisor to get a written copy of Chase admitting this is because they are behind on processing payments.
   * Supervisor refuses to provide anything in writing. Provides a fax number to send the check.
   * I don't have a damn fax machine. By this time the dealership has emailed me an ""accounting copy"" PDF of the check they sent Chase.
   * I reply, asking if he can fax it to the number I was provided in my last call, with the account number prominently displayed, like Chase asked.
   * (Maybe the earlier fax went to the wrong number? Maybe they couldn't process it without the account number? It had the VIN, my name, the car make/model, and lots of other identifying information).
* 8/24: Received a letter from a ""Research Representative"" at Chase Auto asking for either a copy of the cancelled check or proof of payment.
* 8/25: Rep at dealership still has not responded to any emails.
   * Chase begins making unsolicited calls informing me the auto account is past due and needs to be paid. I explain the situation. Rep tells me to fax the copy of the check. Tells me the payment will be backdated once they receive the check, but they still insist that they haven't. This rep also states that Chase is behind on processing payments, but won't supply anything in writing. She insinuates that I'm being impatient due to COVID delays, and rudely tells me that Chase has ""hundreds of thousands of customers, sir"". At this point I had had it and hung up.
   * I emailed the dealership for a followup. Still (to this) day have not received any.
   * Realized the dealership doesn't gaf, so I both:
      * Sent a copy of the check in the mail to Chase's ""Research Representative""
      * Went to UPS store to fax the check copy. UPS gave me a report proving the fax was sent successfully, and I felt better anticipating hearing good news from Chase shortly
* 8/27: Woke up to credit monitoring alert from Mint telling me that Chase reported the account as delinquent to TransUnion and my fucking credit score dropped 103 points instantly. If Chase is supposedly behind in processing, why did they already report my account as delinquent?

At this point I am livid and trying to piece my options together. My first step was to put together this post for advice. My next planned steps are to confront the dealership in person, dispute the credit report, file a consumer complaint with state and/or federal consumer protection agencies, perhaps contact the car manufacturer directly (?), and lastly, if it comes to it, seek a lawyer. I do understand that in this shitty situation it is ultimately my responsibility to see the loan paid off, but I feel I've done a considerable amount of work here to try to get both Chase and the dealership to work together, and neither seem to care because I'm the one who loses.

I am looking for any advice and input from anyone who has been in or heard of this situation before.

Also, if you read this far, I'm also looking for a good bank to move my Chase accounts over to. I have Capital One already and am looking for something similar that I can set up all online without having to go into some branch office.

personalfinance,How much can I afford to spend on a house? Should I even buy one?,"Age: 26

Income: $130k per year

Location: Southern California 

Cash Flow/Savings Details:
- Current rent is $850 (don’t ask how I pay so little in the area; been living in a shithole with the hopes that it would mean being able to afford better things down the road) 
- $100k in savings account
- $130k in brokerage account
- Take Home minus retirement/insurance etc. is ~ 5.5k but that’s because I’d been contributing aggressively to 401k and Roth due to the stock market crash. Normally around ~ 6.7k
- No other loans
- Other expenses add up to around $700 per month

Current prices for areas I’m interested: $700k - $750k for a 2 bedroom condo of around 1200 sq ft.

I’m looking at this as an investment more than a house I’d be staying in long term but I thought I’d rather my money go towards building up equity since interest rates are low right now. Would be looking for 2 or 3 bedroom so that rent from the other rooms can offset my costs a bit. 

Down payment would come from the brokerage account and savings and it seems like I should probably leave around $20k in there for emergencies, based on this sub’s advice. In a worst case scenario, my parents have offered to put in up to $30k for down payment/closing costs but I’d rather not tap into that if I don’t have to as my parents are looking for a house of their own too.

But am I even thinking about this correctly or would you recommend continuing with my low rent and saving up for a nicer house in a few years?",finance

personalfinance,401k Strategy in the rest of 2020,"Now the feds will keep the interest rate low for a while, but higher inflation is unavoidable. History has taught us that once inflation goes over certain level, the feds will likely raise the rate, and stock market goes down. Currently I have most of my 401k on US fixed income and stable value assets. 

My own understanding is that when in the future the rate rises again, fixed income (bonds) will likely go lower since its interest value can't compete with new bonds with the higher rate. Now it may still be a good idea to stay in fixed income. 

My question is: if rate goes up, stock market and bond market both goes down, how should I strategy my 401k?? Should I move out from fixed income and into US equity again at some point? When? When the rate is about to be adjusted?? 

I've only started to pay attention to the market since the beginning of the pandemic, sorry if my own understanding is limited or wrong, please educate me in that case. I'm taking this as one learning experience.. Thanks for any input.",finance

Then, during the trip, I could withdrawal $13,555 a year, which equates to $12,200 in earned income after the 10% penalty. At this income level, I would owe no federal income tax.

10% penalty + lowered income tax liability vs. 25% income tax.

This isn't really the same situation for my parents and I. My parent's current rate is almost 5% and they want to refinance to under 3% (give or take). The problem is my dad is on furlough until the schools open back up - so he has no verifiable income. It's **not a question of making payments or being able to afford the house** (which has almost $300k in positive equity).- it's about locking in the low APR now and understanding how this would impact MY credit. They have made payments on time for 30 years and don't plan to stop now (yes they still owe as the house was refinanced multiple times before to pay for remodeling).

My main questions:

1. Does co-signing a mortgage invalidate or remove my eligibility as a first time home buyer?
2. Impact on credit score? If the house has positive equity, does the new loan still look like its sitting at 100% utilization/owed?
3. Anything else - that I don't know to ask or have overlooked?

I'm still open to people advising on why I should not do it - but needs to be something other than ""parents can't afford"".

EDIT: Thank you everyone - I think Ill let my parents know that I'm here for them, but cannot co-sign for them.

Current mortgage rate is 3.75%, and I'm hesitant to refinance and lose the interest rate.

personalfinance,40 pt credit score drop after car search and purchase. Is this normal?,"Started a car search in early July. Begin with 790+ credit score, a healthy amount of federal student loan debt, no derogatory marks, no missed payments, great credit utilization.

personalfinance,Student Loans vs Retirement vs Down payment on a house,"Hi everyone, have a bit of a dilemma that I'm not 100% sure how to handle the most efficient way possible while also keeping my sanity. I am trying to juggle paying off my student loans, while also saving for retirement starting as early as possible, while also trying to save up for a house. Bit of insight:

\- Graduated in Dec. 2016, been working a decent job since. Still living with the parents

\- Started with 160k in student loan debt (Yay out of state tuition). Have since gotten it down to roughly 100k. Most of all discretionary income has gone to paying this down

\- Have 23k in savings account. This was only 8k pre-Covid and was essentially my rainy day fund in case of emergency/saving for a future home. With student loan interest rates down to 0% I've been stashing would-be payments in here for now (potentially going to be dumping all 15k+ of that into the loans right before interest rates go back up)

\-Have 18k in a personal brokerage account, only 12k of which is principal. Rest is gains over the last \~3 years. This account is mostly for fun/learning/eventually retirement

\-Have  a solid retirement plan set up through work with a current balance of 27k

What suggestions would you make for a financial plan, specifically once interest rates on student loans go back up, and for in the next 1-5 years? I really want to buy my own home as soon as possible, but obviously not if its a reckless financial decision. Is it worth emptying my personal brokerage account, and if so, directing that money to the loans, or to the savings for a down payment? Any insight would be useful, thanks everyone",finance

personalfinance,What happens if you never fully pay off debts?,"Just to preface I'm not in debt. I just was curious. Debts have a minimum payment per interval but usually minimum payments can be multiple times less than the interest rate, but you're still ""paying it off"" even if the debt is climbing faster than you're paying it off.

So what exactly happens if you never actually fully pay it off? You're still meeting the minimum payment but the debt gets bigger :o

Or even if you're doing more than the minimum, what happens if you just always have it? From what I know, debts don't really have a deadline they just have a payment plan. Like you need to pay something off in 15 years or whatever. I'm just wondering what happens to debt if it just gets bigger and bigger.

personalfinance,Where is the gap in my finance tracking spreadsheet?,"For a while now, I've been pretty carefully tracking my household finances using Mint. A couple of years ago, I constructed a financial spreadsheet to help me understand the things Mint isn't tracking.

I've felt pretty comfortable about it, by and large. All expenses go on credit cards, so it's easy to track in Mint (I review transactions every couple days), and monthly I go through and make updates to the financial spreadsheet to track the bigger picture items.

I was looking at the numbers and trying to understand a big discrepancy. For example, in 2019, Mint says I spent an average of **$4,226** per month, for a total of **$50,714**. That smells right to me, I check my transactions regularly to see what I spend and never notice anything missing. I also track my savings rate, and in 2019, I saved **$54,783** (inclusive of 401k, HSA, Roth IRA and liquid savings).

In my financial spreadsheet, I have a big picture tracker. I record my gross wages as reported by my W2, record the amount of taxes I paid on the year as reported on my tax return, and subtract taxes from my gross wages to figure out my net income.

In 2019, my gross household income was **$145,508** and taxes paid was **$25,817** (state + federal).

You can see the problem here: that leaves a gap of nearly $15,000 between my net income ($119,691) and my tracked expenses + savings ($105,497). Some gap I'd be okay with (I'm aware of a couple things I'm not tracking correctly or with enough detail), but that seems crazy high and I can't imagine I'd just be missing $1000+ per month of expenses. I have almost no cash expenses.

Any thoughts as to what I might be missing?",finance
personalfinance,Looking for advice and want to ensure my financial advisor is guiding me down the correct path for retirement.,"Vital Stats -   
My wife &amp; I are in our late 30's, zero debt other than a mortgage and reasonable car payment. 

Combined taxable income of 157k, MAGI 182k

I currently contribute the full $19,500 to my companies 401k and it is sitting around $200k. My wifes employer contributes to her SEP IRA with a balance of about $12k. 

I have an IRA started years ago that I can no longer contribute to due to my income. Wife has about 15k in traditional 401k from previous jobs.

Question:

What are some ideas to further save $$$ for retirement in a tax efficient manner? My wife started contributing to retirement at a much later date, but for tax purposes, it seems we are in the same boat. 

Side notes:   
2 children - 1 in middle school, 1 in high school. Already have a 529 set up for both of them and we are contributing to it (although not the maximum at this point, unsure if there is a max)  
I have an HSA that I contribute the maximum amount to.

Feedback from Financial advisor:

Possibly could start a traditional IRA, and convert each year using backdoor Roth version, however could run in to issues with Pro Rata (coffee &amp; cream rule?) due to your existing IRA.

Taxable accounts, (bonds), but due to current interest rates, not favorable.

\-I've texted with many people on whatsapp personally asking me abt paying with bitcoin as i offer 20% off on btc payments, its similar what i did back then when i used to share paypal with my customers who had no idea what it is.

\-When i use btc to pay for things, i purposely pay higher fees when i can make it slower, i want miners to generate income too.

\-Most of my recent donations were made using btc, this is something i recently added.

\-Finally, i never used btc in any suspicious transaction, never used dark markets nor tried to escape taxes.

personalfinance,I just started a W-2 contract position at a new job - they're taking out half of what my previous employer took out in taxes despite making 50% more income. Should I be worried?,"I just started a new job as a W-2 contractor. Basically, a staffing firm is paying me hourly to work at another company - but it's still W-2 so I get my taxes deducted and have healthcare options. The staffing firm is located out of state.

I got my first paycheck today, and looking at the paystub it looks like they're taking out about half as much (percentage wise) as my previous employer did, even though I'll be making 50% more money at this job.

As an example, at my last job a week long paycheck was $1250. My tax deductions were as follows.  


|Deduction Type|Deduction Amount ($)|Deduction Amount (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|North Carolina Income Tax|$57.00|4.56%|
|Medicare|$18.13|1.45%|
|Social Security|$77.50|6.2%|
|Federal Income Tax|$179.28|14.34%|
|Total|$331.91|26.55%|

My new job, so far I've only worked two days (which equates to 16 hours), so my paycheck was $768.  My tax deductions now are as follows.

&amp;#x200B;

|Deduction Type|Deduction Amount ($)|Deduction Amount (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|North Carolina Income Tax|$19.00|2.47%|
|Medicare|$11.14|1.45%|
|Social Security|$47.62|6.2%|
|Federal Income Tax|$29.11|3.79%|
|Total|$106.87|13.92%|

So I'm paying much less in both federal income tax as well as state income tax. I'm thinking it's possible that they're basing it off me having made only $768 the entire year, and that as time goes on the percentages will increase greatly to offset them being too low. And/or that when it comes time to file for taxes that I will owe a lot of money.

Does anyone have any idea how I can make sure I'm getting sufficient taxes taken out? I don't want to be in a position where I owe a huge amount in taxes.

personalfinance,Contribute to 401(k) or pay off student loans?,"Hi all,

So looking towards the end of this year, 2020, I have two decisions:

1.) I could go all-in and contribute 40% of my salary to my 401(k) which would be about $6,500.

2.) My absolute minimum contribution to my 401(k) would be 6% of my salary to match employer's contributions and keep the difference ~$5,500 (or 34% of my salary) and use it pay off a considerable chunk of my student loan debt.

Right now, I'm going to be maxing my HSA this year. By end of September, I will have ~19k in savings and will be using 9k of that to pay off $25k student debt. By end of year, if I go with option #2 above, then I will have an additional $5,500 to pay my student debt and will have knocked it down from $25k to ~$10k, over half!

The reasons why this decision is difficult to decide is because:

1.) on paper, it seems more fruitful to pay off my student loans as fast as possible. The CARES act stops at the end of September and my 6-month grace period ends middle of November.

2.) I'm worried about rate of return on 401(k) in this COVID-19 climate. The rate of return YTD is -4.86% for the Vanguard 401(k) trust I'm looking at and I don't know if that's worth it to contribute so much into it at the moment. That YTD return would mean that for every $1,000 I put in, then I would lose $48.6, right?

Sorry if I threw around too many numbers and it's confusing. I can elaborate in the comments if necessary.

And unfortunately, I can't give student loan interest rate numbers. Cornerstone loan omitted that information because of the CARES act (they all say 0%), unless someone knows of a way to view it.",finance

personalfinance,"Advice regarding Series EE-Bonds, Student Loan debt, and future financial decisions","Hi,

I'm struggling a little bit to find out what the best path forward to keep my debt burden down and manageable (it will be), I was wondering if anyone could help out! I've bolded the specific questions.

I'm entering my junior year of university (USA, State school - engineering), and for some financial background, I currently have -$13,500 dollars in unsubsidized federal loans, $9-10,000 in mature and almost mature Series EE bonds, $1,300 in a budding emergency fund, and $3,200 in savings that consists of around $600 in personal funds and the rest leftover loan money, and roughly $1,500 dollars I have invested in stocks thanks to my grandparents. **My question arises mostly regarding current student loans, future student loans, and using Series EE bonds to pay for them as I could use some advice.** 

Here's my questions for student loans: 

I've recently discovered that I cannot apply my Series EE bonds to my student loans and have them be tax-exempt, so I am now looking into using my Series EE bonds to fund the next two+ years of my undergraduate education (I have done an estimation, and it should be enough with some left over). Retrospectively, had I known that loans were not a tax-exempt expense, I would not have taken them out for my first two years, or the full extent of the loan. My two loans consist of:

* $5,500 principal at 5.050% with $376.41 interest accrued. Disbursed 8/26/2018 &amp; 1/13/2019.
* $7,500 principal at 4.530% with $121.85 interest accrued. Disbursed 8/25/2019 &amp; 1/12/2020.

Currently, I have the ability to (I don't plan to unless it is necessary) take out an amount or all of a $7,500 direct unsubsidized loan at 2.5% interest. My first question is this: **Would it be in my best interest to use my Series EE bonds to pay off a the higher interest loan here (and some of the lower interest), and use the lower interest loan to finance the next few years of my education?** My instinct is not to, and to avoid any further debt. If I were to use the bonds, I would not get the full amount as it would be taxed, and if the bonds are cashed in within the same year, it would likely be more of a loss than the interest the loans would accrue over the two years I'd still have them. I would like to reaffirm that this is a bad idea.

One last piece of advice I was given comes from my father. He is a physician himself and has made some poor monetary decisions in the past and I am not too sure I trust his advice. **His advice is that I should take out the full amount of loans that I can as these loans may make the difference if I can attend, pay for rent, etc. at a graduate school, and pay back what you do not need.** All of those loans would be sitting and accruing interest and, from what I have researched, limit the amount of unsubsidized Direct loans I can take out to cover tuition for PA or Medical school in the future (which have a lower interest than GradPLUS). According to what I've looked into, after acceptance to a program, you can take out unsubsidized and GradPLUS loans for the full cost of attendance to the programs - considering it's been decades since he had his education, I'm not entirely sure he knows how it works now. The only credibility to his argument would be affording the rather expensive application process for these schools, which a lot of students tend to throw on credit cards (no way in hell am I doing that). This is, not to mention, an incredible risk considering there is the possibility I don't even get into a med/PA school. **This is bad advice, right?**

The market continued their bull run today, finishing modestly up. Major indexes are consolidating recent gains in the wake of a decrease in coronavirus cases, COVID testing developments, and a policy shift by the Federal Reserve. 

The NASDAQ closed 0.51% up. The S&amp;P rose to its fifth record close, ending the day 0.65% up. The Dow also rose today, snapping a recent streak of underperformance. It finished 0.58% up and sits just 1000 points away from February highs. An incredible rum overall in the market for this week.

President Trump announced a $750 million deal with Abbott Laboratories ($ABT) for rapid COVID-19 tests at the Republican National Convention Thursday night. Under the agreement, the administration would purchase 150 million of the tests, which take only 15 minutes to deliver results. The Food and Drug Administration granted Abbott's test emergency use authorization on Wednesday for patients with suspected COVID-19, making it the first rapid coronavirus test that doesn't require any special computer equipment. The test is the size of a credit card and is based on the same technology used to test for the flu, strep throat, and other infections. This new test has been hailed a ‘gamechanger’ by Yahoo Finance.

Meanwhile in Japan, its longest running prime minister resigned for health reasons. Europe continues with its fight to reopen the economies in the midst of the health pandemic. And for the meantime it seems like US and China trade talks are developing positively.

Finally there are very high expectations that we see an official announcement regarding the sale of Tiktok at some point over the weekend.

I have no assets in the US (no bank accounts, no property). I only return a few times a year to visit my parents that live in the US.

I wonder if there could be any consequences to me, living in Canada with no plans to live in the US, if I stopped paying my loans. Does anyone have experience or knowledge about this?",finance
personalfinance,Should I refinance my student loans?,"I have been paying $500 a month towards my $38,000 Sallie Mae balance, which is about $100 more a month than required. However, my balance is continuing to rise. I have not made a single late payment, and pay more than the required amount every month. How is this possible? 

I have seen the testimonies of people who have paid tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars toward their loans only to have the total decrease by a thousand or so. I am terrified that this is going to be me and have started to have daily anxiety attacks because of it. I'm a first generation student and my parents and I knew nothing about student loans when they picked Sallie Mae. 

My current interest rates are 7.5% and 9%. Will refinancing actually help me, or is it a scam? Are there any certain companies who are better than others when it comes to refinancing student loans and actually making it so I can pay them off?",finance

personalfinance,Saving for Retirement,"Hello, I am 23 years old, E4 in the military, and trying to start laying out my long term financial future. Since I've joined the Navy, I've been working on building my financial foundation to be able to purchase a house. Me and my wife just accomplished that goal, and will close on a house (hopefully) next month. Now that we're about to pass this major threshold, I'm ready to start aggressively saving for retirement. As of now, I plan on getting out at the end of my contract, so I don't want to dump too much into my TSP. I initially invested in some stocks, but took that out ($2100) to pay the remaining closing costs for our house. I have a 10k emergency fund, and my wife has a separate 12k in savings that she saved up before we got married, but we generally use that to pay for her masters degree. I'm thinking about attempting to get a job as a federal employee, so TSP could still be an option for me in the future. But what other options should I look at for retirement?

What gives? How are they so different. Both are 30year conventional loans.

I asked the Quicken people if they could match and they said they don't even see how anyone can offer the 2.25% on a 30 year, and have warned me that the interest rate will change as we close in on paper work.

personalfinance,Question on the best way to Re-finance,"Good evening! 

This post is for my mother and step-father, forgive my lack of knowledge in some areas. We are building a garage in the backyard, a new driveway, and some other upgrades. In order to keep cash liquid, my mother and step-father are toying with re-financing to fund everything. They have the cash to do it, but would rather keep that in the bank. Also, they want to take advantage of lowering interest rates at this time. 

I lurk on this sub every single day, so I told her I'd post and see what some of the opinions of what the best way to do this is. 

**Home Equity Line of Credit** or **Home Equity Loan** or **Cash Out Re-Finance?**

Their FICOS are mid to upper 700's.

The remaining balance on the mortgage is $131,898 @ 3.875%

Zillow and some other places ballpark the house around 290-310.

The last property Tax bill was $1276.

The backyard should be roughly 30k-40k in costs, maybe a bit higher, although I am not sure.

They are looking to pull 50k or around there.

Also, the combined income is around 130k.

I apologize for any information I left out or do not already know. I am trying to learn from this sub as much as possible. If I did miss anything, please notify me. I will try to get the info as soon as possible rather than getting flamed, haha. Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,Financing a car with a really short credit history?,"Hi everyone
I’ve been trying to research to see if what I’m trying to do is realistic but couldn’t find anything conclusive so I decided to ask if anyone has an idea or had a similar experience.
Basically I’m looking to buy a newish used car that’ll last me a while, and I’ve already decided what I want, and it’s going to cost me around 16-17k. 
I just opened my first credit card and have student loans of $2000 that have been open for 11 months. I haven’t paid any money toward those loans, no payments are due since I’m still in school, but it says I have 100% on time payment history. I’m planning on paying small amounts on that loan to possibly raise my credit despite not being required to. I have just made my first payment on my credit card. My credit score from credit karma from this is 680/700. My goal is to buy the car in 6 months, build credit history for those 6 months, put 9-10k down, and then finance the rest. 
Is it likely I’ll be able to do this? And qualify for a loan/get an interest rate below 10% without a co-signer?",finance

Forex,I have created a monster.,"I have been trading for 3 months (6 months demo before that).  Up until 3 days ago I have always traded with discipline, set SL, understood risk management and make reports out of downloadable CSV data from the broker.  I even journal each trade at the end of the day.  Each trade I make risks from 0.5% - 2% depending on how confident I am on the particular trade.  The first 2 months of grind made 5% and 7% respectively.

Several days ago, I lost 3 trades in a row and felt like [George Costanza](https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/ig822f/the_opposite_theory/).  It was especially demoralizing because I followed the technical, fundamental, trend, and confirmed with indicator, etc... yet, each went straight for my SL.  I took the day off and reflected on what I did wrong.  I lost 6% of my capital that day, a whole month's work.

The very next day, during the Fed chair Powell speech, I focused on EUR/USD, and as the chart started to run higher and higher, I am not sure what came over me, I entered long at 1.18401 and risked 20% of my capital.  I was going to enter my usual 2% risk, but the greed (subconsciously?) in me added an extra 0.  The very second the trade was entered, I felt a hot flash and my heart started pumping, I entered into loss territory, my heart sunk as I watch it go down 10 pips, 15 pips, if only for 15 seconds.  Then it started going up, and it was exhilarating watching the profits.  I had the good sense to enter TP at 1.189, and it got there 15 minutes later.  I had just made a little over 10% of my capital in 15 minutes.  Recovered yesterday's 6% loss and then some.

I told my self that this was a one time thing, stupid and impulsive thing to do... until the next day... 

I saw a good opportunity with USD/JPY.  I didn't even bother to check anything, technical, fundamental, indicators, NOTHING!  Just that vertical cliff short candle... , my god, that full short candle, and the speed!  This time, very much a conscious decision, I entered short with 30% of my capital at 106.5.  4 hours later, I hit my TP at 105.5.  I had made 30% of my capital in 4 hours.

In the last 2 trading days, up 40% of my capital, including my previous 2 months of measly 12% in comparison, I am roughly up 50% of my original capital in 3 months.  

This has been a good week to say the least.  But I am afraid I have created an insatiable monster.  The greed has overtaken good sense, and this is quite possibly the origin story of a blown account.",finance
stocks,Some interesting news in the stock market this week,"Insider Buying

On Wednesday it was reported that Marcus Lemonis, CEO of **Camping World Holdings** $CWH, acquired 32,250 common shares in the outdoor lifestyle co. in multiple transactions on Aug. 24 and Aug. 25 for approximately $1million.  It has been a pretty good year so far for Camping World as RV sales are up 8% and the company is undeniably getting a sales bump from the pandemic, longer-term migration out of densely populated cities thanks to cloud computing and remote work. But CWH sees further opportunity as households are increasing seeking access to the outdoors. It estimates some 11 million American households have an RV, and since it operates in just 36 states, there's a possibility it can continue to expand its footprint with approximately eight to 10 new stores a year.  With a PE of 12.0 the valuation looks very reasonable.

On Friday, **Pacific Ethanol** $PEIX jumped 9% after reporting insider purchases (including the CEO and CFO) totalling $390,000.  It’s always good to see insiders buyinto strength and with PEIX up 10x since March the CEO and CFO both seem to believe it has further to run.   The ethanol business has many regulations that act as barriers to entry and the company has benefitted from the COVID pandemic given the huge growth in demand for high-quality alcohol for cleaning and sanitation supplies.  PEIX has already guided for full year EBITDA of $76mn.  Next year, with increased capacity and the (currently ongoing) repricing of 1 year contracts, $100mn looks reasonable.  Beyond that is anyone’s guess but the current valuation at $235mn does look cheap.

&amp;#x200B;

Growth Stocks

On Tuesday **BigCommerce Holdings** $BIGC spiked 37% after the company announced that its e-commerce checkout service would be available through Facebook's Instagram app.  The app allows consumers to check out on Instagram, instead of leaving the app and going to a merchant's website to finalize an e-commerce sale and could help merchants (who sign up) more easily sell their products to Instagram’s 1 billion  users.  It could also help BigCommerce get a foot in the door with merchants before going on to cross sell other products and build their online store (similar to Shopify).  Shopify shareholders don’t seem too worried just yet.  Shopify is about 15x larger by sales, cashflow positive and building out a fulfilment network that could end up challenging Amazon.  Nevertheless, it’s a huge development for $BIGC who, with a market cap of just $8.8bn, are still at an early stage of growth with a long runway in front of them.  

Also on Thursday, **Dollar General** $DG reported strong comparable sales, up 18.8% in Q2, to top the consensus estimates of +14.9%. Same-store sales increased in each of the consumables, seasonal, home products and apparel categories, with the largest percentage increase in the home products category.  Margins were also up due to higher initial markups on inventory purchases, a greater proportion of sales coming from the non-consumables product categories (higher margins) and a reduction in markdowns as a percentage of net sales.  No formal full-year guidance was issued due to the pandemic but EO Todd Vasos was bullish saying ""We continue to operate from a position of strength and are excited to announce the acceleration of several key strategic initiatives, including the rollout of DG Pickup, DG Fresh, and our Non-Consumables initiative, as well as an increase in our expected number of real estate projects for fiscal 2020"".  The valuation at just 20x current year estimates looks very reasonable.

&amp;#x200B;

Value Stocks

On Tuesday **Toll Brothers** $TOL beat expectations in its Q3 with EPS of $0.90 and sales of $1.65bn versus forecasts of $0.71 and $1.5bn.  The company pointed to growing demand, driven by historically low interest rates, the undersupply of homes, and the COVID pandemic leading to consumers focusing on the importance of a home “more than ever.”  Forward looking gauges — pending sales, housing starts and building permits — suggest that, against all odds, the US housing market is holding up. The valuation at just 14x trailing earnings looks reasonable.

On Friday, **Big Lots** $BIG dropped 10% after reporting an outstanding set of results that beat top and bottom line forecasts.  Net sales increased 31% year over year to $1.25 billion and EPS of $11.29 ($2.75 after adjustment for sale and leaseback benefit) compared to $0.16 last year. The sale and leaseback transaction also transformed the balance sheet from a net debt of c.$400mn to net cash of $850mn.  That’s a significant amount for a company with a market cap of $2bn especialially given it has just announced the authorization to repurchase $500 million in shares.  All this makes Friday’s drop more bewildering. The stock price has soared since March lows, but with a trailing PE of 7.0 it still looks like good value.

personalfinance,Condo refinance came in with lower appraisal value,"Hi all, long-time lurker here.

I purchased a townhome in a complex at the beginning of 2017 for $220K with 10% down, financed with a 30 year mortgage at a 4.25% interest rate. I use it as a primary residence. In January 2020, interest rates were significantly lower, so I started the process to refinance to a 10-year mortgage at 2.75% or so. My income had increased significantly in this period, so I would be able to shoulder the higher payment in the interest of a shorter loan.

Unfortunately, when the property was appraised again in February 2020, it was appraised at $197K, a very unwelcome surprise when I was expecting to at least hold its original appraisal value. I couldn't afford the cash upfront to bring myself to %80 LTV, and had to scuttle the refinance. The appraisal company refused an appeal on the value based on alternate comparables.

The latest property tax estimate values it at $212K, and online tools currently estimate it at $230K or so. The property is in Houston, TX, which is currently being hit with a double whammy of COVID and low energy prices, which took affect after all of the above happened, so I'm worried about the property value  (and mortgage) deteriorating further.

My questions are:

* My base payment (with the 30-year loan) is $1300, but I put an extra $1000 towards principal every month. This puts me on target for being down in 13 years or so. Should I be paying it off that aggressively? Should I be looking for an out in the form of selling it all together?
* Should I pursue the possibility of refinance again, now that I'm fairly close to the %80 LTV of the new appraisal?

I guess I'm just frustrated at how this played out investment-wise, as real estate, particularly in high-growth cities like Houston, is generally seen as a more reliable investment vehicle. Thanks in advance for your advice.",finance

personalfinance,Military - Best Investment Moves Before I Hit 30.,"Howdy everyone!

Background: 26 years old, married, one child (5), single income home. No debt besides mortgage (about $1000 a month). Military earning about $49,000. Currently deployed so it will be higher due to the deployment benefits this year. Military is paying for my school, working on my BA in cyber security as we speak. Have federal TSP; Normally investing 5% to get 5% match. Increased to 15% during deployment in Roth TSP to reap tax free benefit. Not sure if I will keep it at 15% after deployment. 

Three main things I want to accomplish:

1. Build a safety blanket savings account - We tend to use most of our money from paycheck to paycheck keeping a blanket of about $500 in checking between pay periods. Currently with deployment and not being able to really spend money, we have about $3200 in the bank and will grow about $2500-$3000 per month. Putting as much of this as I can into my banks deployed savings account that yields 10% APY up to $10,000 for the length of the deployment and 4 months after. Want to have at LEAST 6 months or more of expenses covered in case the proverbial shit, hits the proverbial fan. Around $30,000 would be my comfort zone.
2. Open either an UTMA or UGMA for my kid - I transferred my GI Bill to my kid so paying for college isn't really an issue anymore. However, I want her to have a better start than I did when I left my parents house and have money ready to go for whenever she needs it. I plan on educating her on money and the value of a financial safety blanket. I don't want her dumping it all when she turns 18. 
3. Save up for a down payment on our forever home - Currently a homeowner but don't plan on living in the state I am stationed in forever.

So my question - What are my best option for growing these funds? Should I do a small amount for my safety net and then start investing in the next house and/or the UTMA/UGMA? Or do I build the safety net all the way up first, then worry about the rest? Do I lower my TSP contributions back to 5% so I save up for a house that will come much sooner than retirement (4-5 years)?

I got out of debt only about a year ago so investing money instead of keeping it in my checking gives me horrible anxiety and I'm scared to make moves to do these things. So know your advice not only helps me, but calms me down.

Thanks everyone.",finance

# **Stocks head into September in high gear as Apple and Tesla split, and markets await the August jobs report  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/28/stocks-start-september-in-high-gear-as-apple-and-tesla-split-and-markets-await-the-august-jobs-report.html)**
*****
&gt; September is historically challenging for the market, but stocks could start the month on an upswing after what looks to be the best August for the S&amp;P 500 in at least 34 years.
*****
&gt; The week ahead will be busy with Fed speakers and economic reports, including the important August employment count Friday. Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida speaks at 9 a.m. ET Monday on monetary policy. He is is one of several officials, who are expected to reiterate Chairman Jerome Powell’s Jackson Hole message that the Fed would be willing to let inflation run hot temporarily to help the economy and job market.
*****
&gt; The low volume days of late summer should be a hallmark of the week ahead, but there could also be window dressing trades around the month’s end, as investors rebalance holdings.
*****
&gt; On Monday, there could be some excitement around two of the market’s favorite stocks. Apple begins trading after a 4-for-1 split. Tesla is also trading on a split-adjusted basis starting Monday, after it split its stock 5-for-1. Apple’s split changes its weight in the Dow, so the index is being adjusted and there will be new names in the index Monday as some old ones leave. ExxonMobil, Pfizer and Raytheon will be replaced by Salesforce.com, Amgen and Honeywell.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was up 3.2% in the past week, and it could continue to make gains in the week ahead.
*****
&gt; “I think we’re still going to be basking in the the glow of an accommodative Fed, combined with the increased accessibility of Apple’s share price to retail investors,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Stovall said that after its last split in 2014, Apple gained 36% over the next year, but after its 2000 split as the tech bubble burst, it lost 60%. Apple has risen more than 30% since announcing its stock split on July 30.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was on track for a more than 6.9% gain in August, its best performance since 1986 if it holds that level through Monday. The S&amp;P recovered and surpassed its all time high during the month and is now flirting with the psychological 3,500 area.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has on average lost 0.5% in September, its worst month of the year going back to World War II, Stovall said. When the S&amp;P 500 has gained more than 5% in August, September gained an average 1.4% and was positive in four of the seven years also back to the 1940s, Stovall said.
*****
&gt; # Jobs, jobs, jobs
&gt; Economists are slightly more optimistic about the economic data in the third quarter, but the job market has been an area of concern with unemployment claims still running around 1 million a week. According to Refinitiv, economists expect 1.4 million jobs were created in August, down from 1.76 million in July. The unemployment rate is expected to fall to 9.8% from 10.2%.
*****
&gt; “I’m assuming we just continue the momentum we saw in the prior month,” said Aneta Markowska, Jefferies chief economist. Markowska said the monthly number has been difficult to forecast because the lack of correlation with unemployment claims, typically a strong barometer for monthly payrolls data but not as much since the pandemic.
*****
&gt; “What we’ve seen really in the last two to three months is a sharp snapback in the hiring in the sectors that were most depressed in Covid. You have restaurant workers, leisure workers coming back,” Markowska said. “At the same time, you’re seeing a much smaller wave of layoffs in other industries. There was a second order knock-on affect, as a result of profit weakness and companies trying to cut costs as a result of that.”
*****
&gt; Michael Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo, said there’s been a debate in the market for the last several weeks about whether jobs gains are beginning to flatline.
*****
&gt; “It strikes me that if you get a better-than-expected number that probably sends risk assets flying, but a somewhat worse-than-expected number would have less impact,” he said.
*****
&gt; Schumacher said the market may pay some attention to so far floundering efforts in Washington for a new stimulus package. But he added the market has been ignoring the issue for now, as Congress appears to be getting further apart.
*****
&gt; “We are worried about the impact on these small businesses if there’s no bridge for the next six months,” he said.
*****
&gt; # Fed message
&gt; After Powell spoke at the Jackson Hole symposium Thursday, Treasury yields moved in a wide range. The 10-year note was as low as 0.65% and as high as 0.78% Friday, before settling in at about 0.74% in afternoon trading Friday.
*****
&gt; Powell said the Fed would be willing to let inflation rise a bit above 2% for awhile, and that it would now target an average without moving to tighten policy.
*****
&gt; “The market reaction to Powell was a little confusing. I suspect the Fed did not want to see this back-up in nominal yields and I suspect they’ll push against it,” said Markowska.
*****
&gt; Fed watchers said the message from Powell was that the Fed will likely keep rates lower for a longer period. Bond strategists said the market was responding to the idea of higher inflation, and rates were rising, particularly at the long end of the curve.

So far this year, the 50 largest stocks in the S&amp;P 500 are up an average of 11.3% YTD, and if we were to take an even narrower look at just the ten largest stocks heading into the year, the average YTD gain is over 27%!

&gt; While the largest stocks are up a lot this year, the next 400 stocks in terms of market cap haven't fared nearly as well, averaging a decline of 2.0%. That's not great, but considering the pandemic this year, even a 2% decline isn't such a bad thing. The same can't be said for the smallest stocks in the S&amp;P, however. As shown below, the 50 smallest stocks are down an average of 15.3% YTD, and more than two-thirds of them are down!

&gt; Another way to illustrate the declining fortunes of stocks this year based on their size is by looking at a moving average of YTD stock performance across the market cap spectrum, In the chart below, the first point on the chart represents the performance of the 50 largest stocks in the S&amp;P 500 which have gained an average of 11.3% YTD. The next point to the right represents the average YTD change of the stocks that ranked between number 2 and 51 in terms of market cap at the start of 2020, and we continue that process down the entire list of components to the point where the last point in the series on the right side of the chart represents the average performance of the 50 smallest stocks in the S&amp;P 500 heading into the year. As mentioned above, that group of stocks has averaged a decline of 15.3% YTD. The performance of the 50 largest stocks in the S&amp;P 500 ranks as the fourth-best of 451 different points on the chart, while the basket of the 50 smallest stocks ranks as the 29th worst performing basket. In 2020, the bigger the stock, the better the returns.

&gt; # Which Bull Will It Be?

&gt; The incredible rally off the March 23 bear market bottom continues, with the S&amp;P 500 Index up more than 50% from those fateful lows. It feels like a lifetime since the longest bull market ever ended. Remember though, although the recent bull market was the longest, it wasn’t the greatest, as the 1990s bull gained more on a percentage basis.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.26.20-blog-chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; We discussed in detail what the new highs in the S&amp;P 500 meant here, so we won’t dive into that again. But this time we’ll show just how this rally ranks versus others that ended major bear markets. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, this new bull market, up to this point of about five months, is stronger than any other major bull market’s start going back to World War II.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.26.20-blog-chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “Yes, this new bull market is the strongest bull market we’ve ever seen after five months,” explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But that shouldn’t be a source of worry. The previous two strongest rallies up to this point were in 1982 and 2009, and both saw continued strength during the first year of the new bull market.”

&gt; Here is a chart showing just this bull market and the ’82 and ’09 bull markets.

&gt; # September Almanac: Only Modest Improvement in Election Years

&gt; Start of business year, end of summer vacations, and back to school made September a leading barometer month in first 60 years of 20th century, now portfolio managers back after Labor Day tend to clean house Since 1950, September is the worst performing month of the year for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 1000 (since 1979). Sizable gains in September 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2017 have lifted Russell 2000 to second worst (since 1979). September was creamed four years straight from 1999-2002 after four solid years from 1995-1998 during the dot.com bubble buildup.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/e4e433c87c6e4c76cefda4ccffbf5ab0/cfdd6d36ba180c35-7f/s400x600/836cc65ffaba5c46d56ea4566614d200638be344.jpg))**

&gt; Bullish election-year forces do little to improve on September’s poor overall performance over the same time frame. September’s performance does improve slightly in election years, but it is still negative nearly across the board. Only the Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 have been able to escape negative territory and post modest 0.2% and 0.8% average gains respectively in the last ten election year Septembers.

personalfinance,Trade nice truck for cheaper truck to reduce debt,"I have a nice 2018 truck with low miles.  I've been offered ~$9k more than I owe on it, only $5k less than I paid and I've owned it 25months.

The interest rate is 3.6%.

I don't need the money, we max out our 401(k)s and our HSA + are able to pay extra on the morgt after saving cash every month.

We have our 6+ mo emergency fund.

I bought the truck new at a seriously good deal planning to own it for 10yrs. I've only put 25k miles on it and it will definitely last and retain some value when I sell it. 

But, I feel like I could cash out and buy something for 1/2 the value of this truck and get the same utility. I'd likely still have a payment just to not tap emergency fund.

The downside is, the 1/2 price truck would have 100k miles and likely not be worth owning for 8-9 more years like this truck is.

personalfinance,We may need to financially help my wife's family in the future. What information should we get now?,"Background:  
My in-laws own their own cabinet shop. It is their only source of income and, to the best of my knowledge, the only investment they own. I've heard them say things along the lines of ""the cabinet shop is the retirement."" 

  
Being in a construction-related industry, the 2008 financial crisis was obviously hard on them and resulted in a personal bankruptcy. To my knowledge, they've crawled out of that and the business is now on somewhat positive footing, as far as cabinet shops go.

  
Last March, my father-in-law had a stroke. His thinking is a little slower and he's gotten a bit more emotional, but for the most part his intellectual capabilities were thankfully spared. Physically, however, he nearly completely lost control of one half of his body and is now confined to a wheelchair.   


They are now in the process of selling the cabinet shop and it sounds like they have a serious buyer. 

My mother-in-law has not worked in decades and has her own medical issues and is now the sole caretaker for my father-in-law, which makes it near impossible for her to work as well. For reference, my in-laws are both in their late 50s.

  
My in-laws also live in a split-level house, which for the time being they've outfitted with a mobility chair on the lower set of stairs so my father-in-law can live in the basement. Manuevering him around the house is a challenge for my mother-in-law who I imagine will not be able to do this long-term. They have expressed interest in building a modestly-sized single-level house to move into, and they live in a part of the country where this could probably be done pretty cheaply.

  
We and my wife's siblings are concerned about their long-term financial situation. My wife is going to visit and is hoping to broach these topics for the first time merely to collect information about their current financial situation, so that if we are going to need to help the news doesn't surprise us. We're hoping for the best but of course these conversations are always difficult. So far we are planning on collecting information about  


\- All current debts, their interest rates, and their minimum payments  
\- All savings accounts, emergency funds, retirement funds, if any, and what they're being held in  
\- What their expenses look like   
\- How much they expect to net from the sale of the business, whether they are expecting any inheritance from their own parents (one of whom is quite well off), whether they have any other unknown sources of income  
\- Equity in their current home  
\- More specific goals regarding the purchase of a more accessible home  
\- Expected mid-term expenses like further mobility modifications to their own home, new roof, etc  
\- Health insurance  


What else should she ask about? Does this cover the biggest bases? (Powers of attorney and other estate-related matters were already handled earlier this year following the stroke)",finance

stocks,My bank is going public...,"Hi folks,

Last week I came home to find my mailbox was stuffed  w/ 6 fat packages from Eastern Bank (3 kids have passbook savings, and my wife and I  have 2 savings and a checking account). At first glance I thought it was a new policies and procedures disclosure update. I was surprised when I  saw they were going public! Been an EB guy for close to 30 years.

They are primarily found in Massachusetts. This is what the google gave me:

**Eastern Bank** is the oldest and largest mutual **bank** in the United States and the largest community **bank** in Massachusetts. With 95 **branches**, **Eastern** had a 3.2% market share in Massachusetts in 2016.

They are offering account holders stocks @ $10/each if you had an account on or before March 31st. I have never been part of a bank getting a ticker, nor would I even begin  to know which existing publicly traded banks to look at for an equal comparison. I an considering picking up a couple hundred shares, and taking money from each child's savings passbook (which is making next to dust with the interest rates) and buying 100 each for them and will let them have it at 18 and they can do what they want with them at that point. (Edit: I think this will also be a great learning experience for my 3 spawns to hopefully get them to be smart with some of their loot and invest).

Here is the link to their prospectus:

personalfinance,Is there anything wrong with my plan to see in my taxable and buy in my Roth? (USA),"EDIT: Sell, not see.

Last year, I started my first brokerage account after years of being too scared to invest, largely from ignorance about risk. I also ended up opening a Roth because I received an unexpected retirement vestment from a former employer. Stupidly, in retrospect, I didn’t put anything more in the Roth, while investing large amounts (as in 90% of my non-cash assets) in the taxable account because I wanted it “liquid.”

I’m trying to be a little bit more sophisticated now. I’m still in the 12% fed bracket, so taxes aren’t a huge worry. I have reason to think in the next year or two, I’ll hit the 22% bracket because my career is finally taking off. What I was thinking of doing is selling my mutual fund shares (less than a year old) in the taxable account and buying the same shares in my Roth on the same day, to correct my past mistakes. It would all be FXAIX, institutional class shares. They are less than a year old now but don’t have massive cap gains.

Is there anything beside the immediate short term cap gain aspect I should be thinking about with this? I may wait a bit until I have shares over a year old so it’s long-term cap gains but that’s about it.",finance
personalfinance,Cosigning vs single-signer for auto loan,"My wife is buying a new car soon. Purchase price will be ~50,000 but I'll be putting a down payment and whatnot, hopefully bringing the price to the 25-30k range.

We want it so she's making the monthly payments with the least hassle possible, but also aim for an agreeable interest rate.

We both have excellent credit (800+) but she has 17k in student loans and no collateral.   
The house and both current cars are in my name and paid off.  She recently had a major promotion/raise and hopes to pay off her loans soon but still has no property.

I feel the *best* interest would be taking the loan out in my name and she reimburses me for the payments but that sounds like a hassle as we have separate bank accounts.

She could get the loan in her name but her existing debt and worse debt:income ratio will negatively affect her interest rate.

**Realistically, would there likely be much of an interest difference between ""I take out the loan myself"" vs ""she takes out the loan and I cosign""?**

personalfinance,Should I pursue a traditional home/mortgage or off-grid alternative in high COL area?,"My husband and I are in Denver, which has a not bad cost of living for everything except housing. We are in our third year of renting a 2-bedroom home (have 2 dogs and have been running my own consulting business from home for years, so needed the second space.)

Our rent is $1800/month plus some utilities on top of that. My income is $50-60,000 in self-employment and husband's is $52,000 W2. Our main debt is in federal student loans which we are chipping away at individually, $10,000 for him and $24,000 for me. We have excellent credit and no other consumer debt.

The current lease will be up May 2021 and we are desperate to get out from under Denver's high renting cost with the hopes that purchasing would at least have our housing payment be going toward something we control and could sell. We should have \~25,000 in total savings by spring which we could use some of towards a downpayment. Neither of our families will be in a position to help at all. We love the Colorado area and our dream would be to have a mountain home with a lot of land, eventually switching over to us both running businesses and working from home.

The low end of 1-2 bedroom homes in the west side of the metro or an hour outside within the mountains seems to be \~$250,000-275,000. Older, 1 bedroom/studio condos are cheaper of course, but not feeling realistic with the dogs and my business.

My question is, is it worth it to try to buy a (likely) 1-2 bedroom house and take on the mortgage + PMI, etc. to 1. get out from high rent and 2. hope to gain a small profit in the next five years?

Or, should I be focusing on something more alternative, like buying a small bit of undeveloped land ($15-20,000) and putting a used tiny, off-grid structure ($20-40,000) on it for 2-3 years so we can save money and maybe sell/rent out later? I realize the type of loan options here would be different.

If neither of these options seem very financially sound, please let me know. I appreciate any advice!",finance

So, i'm 24 and graduated college last May. Got my first job in September and alongside it my first car (2019 civic). The car is 100% in my name and have loved it ever since. The cost after all fees, taxes etc... was $22,000. I'm blessed enough to have my parents put in $4,000 as a down payment as a graduation gift. This made the total cost go down to $18,000. Since I didn't have too much credit history (only 2 credit cards for a few years), I financed at 8.8% for 72 months paying $350/month. Today I went to my local credit union for a refinance quote hoping now that I have better established credit line, i could get a better deal. I told them that i wanted to shorten my finance term to about 36 months. I currently have 61 months left on the car, and about $16,000 left to pay off. They offered me a 3.00% interest rate with a 36 month finance period for $480. My credit score is 727 with 3 credit cards and 1 car financed. I am also lucky enough to be in no debt, and live rent free with my parents for the time being. I make about $53,000/year. Is this refinance a good option to take?

personalfinance,Should I enroll in a masters degree knowing that I have to take a loan,"Firstly, I would like to start with a small summary of my past education and future work opportunities. Since young I have been between the top of my class, if not the best. Currently in my third and final year of bachelor in economics, so far the best student in my year. Despite that, opportunities aren´t coming in as expected, with little earnings potencial. In my country (in Europe), even though bachelors are almost free, starting salaries are very low for all areas, probably 2/3 times lower than in most european countries.

In spite of not trying to be blinded to optionality, I think that working in my country won´t allow me to achieve financial independence and have the impact on my area I wish. As a result, I would like to join a masters degree in finance in London or France. I have taken a Gmat (score 730) and Ielts to do so, plus I have done summer internships; as such I think i might be able to enroll in one of those courses. However, with the savings I have, doing so would require me to get a loan from 10 000 to 30 000 euros depending on the college and financial aid I get. Additionally, the loan might have a very high interest rate (17%) because my family has a bad financial history, so I am struggling to find someone in my family which will be my  guarantor.  I post here, because i wonder if I shoudl work a year or two in order to save up enough money to finance my studies or get a loan with a high APR and join a masters straight way.

For clarity, I have the 100k to pay it off in full. My question is, because the interest rate is so low is it better to never pay of the 100k and simply pay minimum payments and use 100k for a duplex and to put into the market instead.",finance

personalfinance,Selling house with significant equity. Can't make much off investing due to health insurance.,"We will be selling our house (hopefully) in the next month and I wanted some advice on what to do with the cash we get from it. We have a bit of an unusual financial situation, so let me lay it out for you. 

&amp;#x200B;

* I'm 39, husband is 42. Three kids 9 and under with medical issues.

&amp;#x200B;

* Bought a mild fixer upper in 2010 at the bottom of the market. Sweat and tears to fix it up with little money + down payment + current market bubble due to location that is good for people leaving NYC and low interest rates. Will probably walk away with a check for $150-180k. 

&amp;#x200B;

* We are pretty low income. Husband's prior job and new job don't offer health insurance. We are on CT's state insurance (Husky) which is awesome. We are currently $5k below the income cut off. 3 kids have medical issues and USE the insurance, so income has to go up a lot (like $20k+/yr) before it makes sense to go onto the exchanges. 

&amp;#x200B;

* New job comes with employer provided housing (facility director living on the campus, must be available all hours, etc) so we aren't buying a new house any time soon. We'll be there at least 5 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

* We already have a good sized emergency fund in savings, max out our Roth IRAs, have no debt except the mortgage. 

&amp;#x200B;

* We may someday need to buy a house again with this money as a down payment, so we can't tie it up long term. 

&amp;#x200B;

* My father is now retired, but managed some large investment funds. I grew up with a good idea of investing. But my dad has no concept (or approval) of working for tiny non-profits, not getting your health insurance through your employer, or the earned income credit... I don't know why I added this but it seemed relevant to me. He did offer to just take the money and invest it with his stuff and give it back to us later (all in legal ways), since it would make such a tiny smudge in his portfolio. But that seems messy. Too much family love and togetherness. 

&amp;#x200B;

* I have crippling anxiety over putting a large amount of money in a good mutual fund and having it earn lots of money and kick us off of our health insurance. This is probably ridiculous. Silly even. Who has anxiety over earning too big of a return on their investments?? Would the income on a mutual fund even potentially do that if our paychecks stayed the same?? I don't even know. I don't know who to ask?? 

&amp;#x200B;

* So, with all that in mind, when we get the check, what the heck do we do with the money? $20k into ibonds? The rest into an Ally savings account? That's what I've come up with so far. Somewhere very secure that doesn't earn too much interest and doesn't loose too much to inflation. The Goldilocks account. Does this exist? Is it even necessary?? 

&amp;#x200B;

* (As you may have guessed from a bullet point above, while I feel like we are in an okay spot retirement wise on our own, at least to continue our current chosen frugal lifestyle, we definitely have the privilege of not overly worrying about what retirement will look like due to my parents current finances.)",finance

Then outside of that it's just a few monthly subscriptions like Spotify, my phone (mainly covered by work, is only about $25/month) and groceries (trying to cut back on).

My salary is $130,000, a bit over $100,000 in RSU over 4 years and $10,000 signing. I have about $30,000 in student loan debt with most having an interest rate of 4.65%, outside of one private loan that's $2,000 at 15%. I have two credit cards, chase freedom ($0) and a Wells Fargo student card ($2,000 at 11%) both give back 1% on all purchases. 

My main priority as of right now is to pay off the private student loan first and then the Wells Fargo card. In a 3-8 months, I'd like to move-out of my parents and near my workplace that is currently WFH. It is in a HCOL area so I need to save for that. 

With all that said the questions that I'm most concerned with are:

* Once the private student loan and student cc are paid, should I only pay the minimum on the other loans and invest my left over money or just focus on paying the loans first?
* Are there any other CCs I should try to apply for?

Forex,Former investment bank FX trader: news trading and second order thinking,"Thanks to everyone who responded to the [previous pieces on risk management](https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/ia5f37/former_investment_bank_fx_trader_some_thoughts/). We ended up with nearly 2,000 upvotes and I'm delighted so many of you found it useful.

This time we're going to focus on a new area: reacting to and trading around news and  fundamental developments.

A lot of people get this totally wrong and the main reason is that they trade the news at face value, without considering what the market had already priced in. If you've ever seen what you consider to be ""good"" or ""better than forecast"" news come out and yet been confused as the pair did nothing or moved in the opposite direction to expected, read on...

We are going to do this in two parts.

**Part I**

* Introduction
* Why use an economic calendar
* How to read the calendar
* Knowing what's priced in
* Surveys
* Rates decisions
* First order thinking vs second order thinking

&amp;#x200B;

# Introduction

Knowing how to use and benefit from the economic calendar is key for all traders - not just news traders.

In this chapter we are going to take a practical look at how to use the economic calendar. We are also going to look at how to interpret news using second order thinking.

The key concept is learning what has already been ‘priced in’ by the market so we can estimate how the market price might react to the new information.

&amp;#x200B;

# Why use an economic calendar

The economic calendar contains all the scheduled economic releases for that day and week. Even if you purely trade based on technical analysis, you still must know what is in store.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/20xdiq6gq4k51.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6cd47186db1039be7df4d7ad6782de36da48f1db

Why? Three main reasons.

Firstly, releases can help provide direction. They *create* trends. For example if GBPUSD has been fluctuating aimlessly within a range and suddenly the Bank of England starts raising rates you better believe the British Pound will start to move. Big news events often start long-term trends which you can trade around.

Secondly, a lot of the volatility occurs around these events. This is because these events give the market new information. Prior to a big scheduled release like the US Non Farm Payrolls you might find no one wants to take a big position. After it is released the market may move violently and potentially not just in a single direction - often prices may overshoot and come back down. Even without a trend this volatility provides lots of trading opportunities for the day trader.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/u17iwbhiq4k51.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98ea8ed154c9468cb62037668c38e7387f2435af

Finally, these releases can *change* trends. Going into a huge release because of a technical indicator makes little sense. Everything could reverse and stop you out in a moment. You need to be aware of which events are likely to influence the positions you have on so you can decide whether to keep the positions or flatten exposure before the binary event for which you have no edge.

Most traders will therefore ‘scan’ the calendar for the week ahead, noting what the big events are and when they will occur. Then you can focus on each day at a time.

# Reading the economic calendar

&amp;#x200B;

Most calendars show events cut by trading day. Helpfully they adjust the time of each release to your own timezone. For example we can see that the Bank of Japan Interest Rate decision is happening at 4am local time for this particular London-based trader.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lmx0q9qoq4k51.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c6e9e1533b1ba236e51296de8db3be55dfa78ba1

&amp;#x200B;

Note that some events do not happen at a specific time. Think of a Central Banker’s speech for example - this can go on for an hour. It is not like an economic statistic that gets released at a precise time. Clicking the finger emoji will open up additional information on each event.

## Event importance

How do you define importance? Well, some events are always unimportant. With the greatest of respect to Italian farmers, nobody cares about mundane releases like Italian farm productivity figures.

Other events always seem to be important. That means, markets consistently react to them and prices move. Interest rate decisions are an example of consistently high importance events.

So the Medium and High can be thought of as guides to how much each event  typically affects markets. They are not perfect guides, however, as different events are more or less important depending on the circumstances.

For example, imagine the UK economy was undergoing a consumer-led recovery. The Central Bank has said it would raise interest rates (making GBPUSD move higher) if they feel the consumer is confident. 

Consumer confidence data would suddenly become an extremely important event. At other times, when the Central Bank has not said it is focused on the consumer, this release might be near irrelevant. 

# Knowing what's priced in

Next to each piece of economic data you can normally see three figures. Actual, Forecast, and Previous. 

* Actual refers to the number as it is released.
* Forecast refers to the consensus estimate from analysts.
* Previous is what it was last time. 

We are going to look at this in a bit more detail later but what you care about is when numbers are better or worse than expected. Whether a number is ‘good’ or ‘bad’ really does not matter much. Yes, really.

&amp;#x200B;

[Once you understand that markets move based on the news vs expectations, you will be less confused by price action around events](https://preview.redd.it/legsgu3vq4k51.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eacf318330878ab53bfc6af173899bf400e2a97b)

&amp;#x200B;

This is a common misunderstanding. Say everyone is expecting ‘great’ economic data and it comes out as ‘good’. Does the price go up? 

You might think it should. After all, the economic data was good. However, everyone expected it to be great and it was just … good. The great release was ‘priced in’ by the market already. Most likely the price will be disappointed and go down.

By priced in we simply mean that the market expected it and already bought or sold. The information was already in the price *before* the announcement.

Incidentally the official forecasts can be pretty stale and might not accurately capture what active traders in the market expect. See the following example.

## An example of pricing in

For example, let’s say the market is focused on the number of Tesla deliveries. Analysts think it’ll be 100,000 this quarter. But Elon Musk tweets something that hints he’s really, really, really looking forward to the analyst call. Tesla’s price ticks higher after the tweet as traders put on positions, reflecting the sentiment that Tesla is likely to massively beat the 100,000.

[Tesla deliveries are up hugely vs last quarter ... but they are disappointing vs market expectations ... what do you think will happen to the stock?](https://preview.redd.it/dawm55szq4k51.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a2e498683709c381a603b16358cf250d0106236)

&amp;#x200B;

On the day it turns out Tesla hit 101,000. A better than the officially forecasted result - sure - but only marginally. Way below what readers of Musk's twitter account might have thought. Disappointed traders may sell their longs and close out the positions. The stock might go down on ‘good’ results because the market had priced in something even better. (This example is not a real one - it just serves to illustrate the concept.)

# Surveys

It can be a little hard to know what the market really expects. Often the published forecasts are stale and do not reflect what actual traders and investors are looking for.

One of the most effective ways is a simple survey of investors. Something like a Twitter poll like this one from CNBC is freely available and not a bad barometer.

[CNBC, Bloomberg and other business TV stations often have polls on their Twitter accounts that let you know what others are expecting](https://preview.redd.it/hree40j5r4k51.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73f529f727e7dc2447b58f61ffc575a44b63fe40)

&amp;#x200B;

# Interest rates decisions

We know that interest rates heavily affect currency prices.

For major interest rate decisions there’s [a great tool on the CME’s website](https://www.cmegroup.com/education/videos/introduction-to-cme-fedwatch.html) that you can use.

&amp;#x200B;

[See the link for a demo ](https://preview.redd.it/w1xq0iibr4k51.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3049204d903afcc22d746382fee5947cf4a7a432)

&amp;#x200B;

This gives you a % probability of each interest rate level, implied by traded prices in the bond futures market. For example, in the case above the market thinks there’s a 20% chance the Fed will cut rates to 75-100bp.  


Obviously this is far more accurate than analyst estimates because it uses actual bond prices where market participants are directly taking risk and placing bets. It basically looks at what interest rate traders are willing to lend at just before/after the date of the central bank meeting to imply the odds that the market ascribes to a change on that date.

Always try to estimate what the market has priced in. That way you have some context for whether the release really was better or worse than expected.

# Second order thinking

You have to know what the market expects to try and guess how it’ll react. This is referred to by Howard Marks of Oaktree as second-level thinking. His explanation is so clear I am going to quote extensively.

It really is hard to improve on this clarity of thought:

*First-level thinking is simplistic and superficial, and just about everyone can do it (a bad sign for anything involving an attempt at superiority). All the first-level thinker needs is an opinion about the future, as in “The outlook for the company is favorable, meaning the stock will go up.” Second-level thinking is deep, complex and convoluted.*

*Howard Marks*

He explains first-level thinking:

*The first-level thinker simply looks for the highest quality company, the best product, the fastest earnings growth or the lowest p/e ratio. He’s ignorant of the very existence of a second level at which to think, and of the need to pursue it.*

*Howard Marks*

The above describes the guy who sees a 101,000 result and buys Tesla stock because - hey, this beat expectations. Marks goes on to describe second-level thinking:

*The second-level thinker goes through a much more complex process when thinking about buying an asset. Is it good? Do others think it’s as good as I think it is?  Is it really as good as I think it is? Is it as good as others think it is? Is it as good as others think others think it is? How will it change? How do others think it will change? How is it priced given: its current condition; how do I think its conditions will change; how others think it will change; and how others think others think it will change? And that’s just the beginning. No, this isn’t easy.*

*Howard Marks*

In this version of events you are always thinking about the market’s response to Tesla results. 

What do you think they’ll announce? What has the market priced in? Is Musk reliable? Are the people who bought because of his tweet likely to hold on if he disappoints or exit immediately? If it goes up at which price will they take profit? How big a number is now considered ‘wow’ by the market? 

As Marks says: not easy. However, you need to start getting into the habit of thinking like this if you want to beat the market. You can make gameplans in advance for various scenarios.

Here are some examples from Marks to illustrate the difference between first order and second order thinking.

&amp;#x200B;

[Some further examples](https://preview.redd.it/6q773o4qr4k51.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9f9a7b8cd4439bc17513967f247f486796f826f)

Trying to react fast to headlines is impossible in today’s market of ultra fast computers. You will never win on speed. Therefore you have to *out-think* the average participant.

personalfinance,To coast or not to coast...on my federal student loans.,"I'm just about to pay of a $62,000 private loan, after 2.75 years. Awesome.

But, here's the thing. I have $37,152 of Federal that I haven't really touched. And we all know, they're in deferment w/ 0% interest til the end of the year. 

And here's the other thing. I'm approaching 30 years old. I have a little over $6,500 in combined retirement accounts (401k and Roth IRA). I contribute the full match with my employer for my 401k. But, as I approach 30, I can't help but get really really anxious about not (ok, barely) investing still.

I'm currently on a PAYE program with my federal. Meaning, after all this COVID stuff ends, I'll be paying $367 for 120 months. Do the math, thats $44k and then they're forgiven. 

$367 a month is about 0.09% of my monthly income, which will increase as time goes by.

Or, I pay the $37k off ASAP, which, realistically, I could do it in about 1.5 years, give or take. The 0% interest will help with that. So, say I do that, I'm looking at almost 31 yrs old before I start truly investing my money. 

I'm so torn. I want to be debt free, but I also want to do what will make most sense in the long run. I lean towards paying it off, because I don't ever see myself wanting to buy a house with that much student loan debt left (granted, buying a house isn't at the top of my list of financial goals)...But, marriage, too. I'd love to be debt free before marrying my SO. But...at the same time, I could simply forget about it; let that $367 go every month until I'm 40; invest and save and live my life.

personalfinance,Best way to spend signing bonus?,"Hi there. I’m set to receive a signing bonus of $30,000 and am trying to figure out the most economical way to spend it. I have two options: Use the entire payment towards my graduate school tuition this year (totaling more than $30K, so I’d still have to take out additional loans), or use it to pay off my existing student loan debt. I currently have two fed loans; principal balance at $56K and unpaid interest at $1.5K and principal balance at $20.5K and unpaid interest at $460. Due to COVID relief, I am not/will not be accruing interest on those loans until Jan. 1, 2021.

personalfinance,Should I invest my student line of credit into property?,"I’m starting my second year of medical school. I have had an unsecured student line of credit for the past year that I have not used and do not forsee myself using. The line of credit has a $300k limit, with an annual interest rate of prime - 0.25% (currently 2.2% and highest 3.7%). The line of credit currently does not have to be repayed until 2025, which is 2 years after graduation. However it can be extended until 2 years after my residency, which would last 3-7 years depending on the program I choose.once repayment begins, it is converted into a personal loan with fixed interest.

My thinking is that it doesnt make sense for me to just have this money sitting there doing nothing. I was initialy thinking about investing it, but it seems extremely risky if the market takes a turn (which it did due to covid), at which point I am left with up to 300k in debt plus interest for a potential payout that isnt all that large.

I was talking to some people in my class and it seems like many people have recently bought condos. For example, one friend says they bought a place for $569k that is going renting for $2400/month, which amounts to a slight monthly profit after interest and mortgage payments. I did some quick research and looked at some mortgages and it seems like it could possibly be profitable depending on condo fees, taxes, etc. additionally, while I havent looked too deeply into it, property value in my city has risen 14% over 3 years and I remember having seen some articles recently which suggests that the value is still increasing.

With that said, I have no experience in property management, and I worry about possible the possibility of things like tenants not paying, needing to make repairs, or random condo association difficulties, such as very expensive renovations being voted for when not necessary. I figure that many of those concerns are eliminated by buying into a newly developed condo complex, which presumably wouldnt need renovations or repairs any time soon.

There is also the possibility of buying a plex, which would eliminate condo fees and might give more rent. 

What do you guys think about this idea? Is there anything I’m not considering? Is this just a terrible idea? Is there an alternative that is potentially more profitable? How big would the risks be in this situation?

personalfinance,Broker Margin vs Real Estate Mortgage,"Hey Frugal Community, 

I have a very large stock portfolio which has performed extremely well for me over the last 6 years (\~150% returns). I invested a lot of time in learning the space over the years and putting my hard earned money to work. I hold a long term view with almost all my stocks (\~7yrs) and can confidently say I know what I am doing (I don't speculate). That being said, this broker account has performed well for me because I was able to capitalize on undervalued companies but I was only able to do this by taking out margin. I have about 200k in margin but this pales in comparison to the overall value of the portfolio. Nonetheless, it is a large amount of margin at around 5% interest rate. ***This is the only debt I hold***.

I am now debating getting into real estate but am hesitant to do so because it would involve me taking out a mortgage - thus adding to the debt I hold in the form of broker margin. The idea behind getting into real estate is not because I wish to own a property to live in (I have low rent at $860/month), but rather to expand my investment portfolio and other sources of passive income.

Should I be thinking about taking out broker margin the same way as taking out a mortgage? I understand that margin has a higher risk due to margin calls but as I mentioned, my experience in the market allows me to manage this pretty well and I am nimble enough to make informed decisions to avoid such a scenario playing out (the March 2020 market crash didn't affect me at all). As far as I see it, at the end of the day, both margin and mortgage are loans which in return provide an ROI over the long term. Is this a valid reason to continue doing what I am familiar with and stick to long term stock investment while slowly paying off margin debt? Or should I seriously consider paying off the margin debt immediately and then move over to real estate investing with a mortgage?",finance
personalfinance,How best to pay off my debts - Chapter 13 a good fit?,"Back in 2010 my finances were pretty decent. I didn't have much but didn't owe much. My fiance and I at the time decided to buy a house and after that things got out of control. Some major problems with the house had to be fixed, we got married (though we didn't go crazy). Had two kids (the second was a bit sudden) and ran into medical bills when neither of us had great insurance. We also never had good financial habits.

A year ago I sat down and went through my our finances to try to get a handle of them. We made some serious changes

* No more vacations (Florida trips normally) - instead we were just staying with relatives and going to the beach
* Creating a meal plan each week and trying our best to stick to our budgeted number
* Cancelling all reocurring memberships (Gym, Netflix, etc.)
* Contacted all services (Cell Phone, Internet, Insurance) and reduced things as much as I could
* Ebayed things we had purchased recently that just were not in use any longer
* I took a new job that had more stability and a lot of long term perks (Pension, better benefits, stock options)

Since COVID I also did some other things:

* Contacted my Mortgage to suspend payments. This ultimately worked out I believe because I postponed 6 months of payments but put them into my savings account instead. I then only payed interest each month and escrow. Now my mortgage company says that I can push those 6 months to the end of my mortgage. This extends it but I felt the money is better being put towards paying off debt.
* I took a second job of sorts doing side work in IT remotely for different businesses. This helps out and I mainly use this money to pay off my monthly expenses.

I believe I am on the right track now and have made the right changes but currently we owe a total of $78,000 - This is a SOFI Loan as well as credit card debt. It is high and the interest is not great, This causes me to pay so much in interest each month that not much goes to the principal. Every month I take whatever left over funds I have and pay credit card on the highest interest as much as I can.

The difficulty now is that although I have got spending under control and I am not making matters worse - It will take a long time to pay things off due to high interest rates. I tried to negotiate with creditors but did not get anywhere.

Is trying to file for Chapter 13 bankrupcy an option for me? I owe $200,000 on my house that is valued at $315,000 today but really do not have anything else of value to my name. My understanding is that by filing Chapter 13 I can somehow perhaps reduce my debt a little bit but have it under a more manageable payment with a better interest than what I am paying now. I am not as considered with the fact it sits on my credit for 7+ years due to the fact that I have no plans to apply for anything using that for quite some time.

personalfinance,Should I roll all my loans into my mortgage?,"So, I have a lot of equity in my home and my mortgage payment is very low.  I have been in the process of refinancing the mortgage to include my student loan and car payment all in one, which from my understanding would actually save me money each month based on the low interest rate I locked in and not having to pay interest on two separate loans.  (Well, three with house.)

I am three years into a 30-year fixed rate mortgage.  I make about 30 grand a year, sometimes less.  If I ever made more I’d throw it at these loans, but fat chance.

I have been paying on my student loan almost ten years and have ~15,000 left.  I think interest rate is 4-something.  According to the repayment schedule, I think I finish in 2031.  My car payment balance is about the same amount at 4.1
percent interest, which is sadly ironic and I hate cars, sigh.

Anyway...is this a sound idea?  I’ve heard noise about student loan forgiveness for a long time, and I doubt it will happen but I can just see myself rolling l these together and then they decide to go through with it and I’m screwed.  I’ll pay off the student in ten or so years, and the car loan is probably 60 months.  Not sure on that.  So if I’m done paying on these two loans in 5/10 years, does it make sense to add to my mortgage and spend the next 27 years paying them off?  I think the paperwork says it bumps my mortgage up to 70,000, which is significantly less than what the property is worth.

I’m not good at math.  But I need to figure this out before I sign in the dotted line.  Thanks.",finance

personalfinance,PMI question - is the loss of investment returns always worth a higher down payment?,"Hi!  Thanks all for the huge amount of helpful info here.  A little background - looking at a house with an asking price of about twice my annual income, and I have no outstanding debt and a total of ~a year's pay in savings (of which about half is locked up in retirement accounts).

I'm probably going to buy a house in the next month or so, and I am just looking for a sanity check about PMI.  As I see it, the cost of putting 3% down instead of 20% is the PMI fee (1% of the total loan amount per year) plus paying interest on that additional principal (17% of the loan balance at 2.7% or whatever the mortgage rate is).  

The math gets a little complicated since the PMI amount stays the same while the mortgage interest rate is on the remaining loan amount, but am I right in generally thinking that the trade-off is the cost of PMI + interest on the higher loan balance (+ having less cash on hand for emergencies) vs market returns on the down payment amount?  

Even though the market return is not guaranteed, for a longterm investment it seems like it would at least make sense to start with a lower down payment and then calculate a time to pay down to 20% once the PMI rate climbs to a high-enough 'real interest rate' (the fixed % of the original loan amount vs the 'real' interest rate relative to the remaining balance).

personalfinance,Aging Parent Post-Divorce Housing,"Situation:

I have an aging father ~age 64 ish, still employed- though recently physically disabled, employment and future employment prospects are not particularly high.

Father recently just completed his 4th divorce, which, would you know it... when you're constantly splitting your net worth in half, you don't have a lot left by the time you hit retirement age.  As a part of the divorce, he owes ~30k to ex-spouse.  

Assets:

* $10k 401k
* ~ 90k equity in a ~100k house

Debts:

* 30k divorce settle
* Underwater on at least one vehicle
* Possibly a personal loan of ~20k due in 2021
* Probably a whole other treehouse of horrors if/when I ask...

So, on to the story, ol' man hits me up with a proposal... I pay him $50k cash and in return I own his house where he continues to live until curtain close.  He pays no rent, but pays all utilities, taxes, etc.  My $50k pays off ex-wife, the remaining $12k mortgage and probably misc debt.  In return, I own a property valued at ~100k.  I don't particularly want to own this particular property- its in a dead end town with no growth prospect.

I'm the only child of his first marriage, so no siblings to spread burden amongst. I have my shit together, not like FIRE level finances and I suck at investing- but doing the right things with emergency fund, college savings, minimizing debt, etc.  

The other thing...  we're not close.  I mean, the dude sorta tries and has tried- good heart, terrible choices along the way.  I can specifically remember a situation where applying for college aid that I was denied low interest fed loans because my dad's income was too high to qualify and so he was assigned 33% ish of my college debt expenses- but contributed absolutely nothing.  I ended up with private loans and paid off everything after school except for around 10% of the cost that my mom was able to pay even though her financial means at the time were far lower.  I can remember endless bitching when growing up about how the judge had assigned his support to be too high and my mom shouldn't be buying name brand school clothes with his crazy high support.  

I don't mean to turn it into a personal story on personalfinance, again, good heart and we're good now- but there is a certain degree of ""fuck 'em"" that I feel when talking about supporting a guy that worked his way out of his obligation time and again.  Idk, maybe I'm being petty here.

I will be asking a lot of questions about his finances, I feel like the publicly available stuff paints a bad enough picture and so the more private skeletons have to be way way worse.  Even if buying the house were a good (or hell even ""only a little bit bad"") investment, I feel like this now connects us financially and on an expectations of future dynamics greatly.  ie. if he's in debt and the debt holder is aware he lives in a house owned by family- I don't want any part of that.  

Guess I'm just looking for some good questions to ask in this situation to evaluate it further... or if this is an immediate ""No, run the fuck the other direction, NOW!"".  I don't particularly want to see him homeless and in a situation causing death of despair- but I've worked hard to stabilize my own immediate family and don't feel strongly about sacrificing much of that when I don't feel any sense of owing an inch for a limited supporting role in childhood.

The experience was disappointing as the rep was not very pleasant, and after about 30min discussing all the details said she'd call me back in 45 minutes, and did not. She called back the next day explaining they could not beat my offer.

I completed with the intent to proceed forms with the new lender who explained they'd need 45-60 days to close the loan due to high demand and covid related staffing issues.

A new rep from my current lender called a couple days later responding to  loan payoff inquiry. I explained the disappointing experience. He apologized and offered a lower interest rate, and significantly less in closing costs – a much better option all around.

Neither charged upfront fees, just a small 20-30 credit check fee. Other upfront fees will be rolled into the loan.

So I now have both in underwriting and plan to cancel the first offer, accepting the new one from my current lender.

Is there any risk or value in waiting to cancel the first, just in case one falls through, or misses the target closing date? Both have rate locks until mid Oct. Am I risking being charged title and associated closing fees or would those not apply till closing?

Thanks for your advice.",finance

I’m wondering what your thoughts are on when the banks will be able to resume there capital distributions in buybacks and dividends.  I feel the fed will probably be more conservative than not.  I’m wondering if you think the policies will go through until late late next year early 2022.   

Also, this is hypothetical but I’d like to hear some discussion- If the fed keeps this policy through 2021, but credit defaults never get to the point they think, won’t the banks just be sitting on enormous amounts of capital that’s doing nothing?",finance

personalfinance,Best Way To Tackle Credit Card Debt?,"35,000+ in credit card debt--what is the best approach?  Balance transfer? Personal loan? Slow and steady pay off?

Card A: \~1880 @ 12.99%

Card B: \~6760 @ 11.99%\* (new charges are at 16.99% and this is my oldest card so I make a small charge each month to make sure it stays active and pay that in addition to the min so I don't pay the 16.99%)

Card C: \~7100 @ 13.99

Card D:  \~19870 @ 12.49%

I was planning on using the avalanche method and starting with Card C, but then I thought maybe it would be better to try a balance transfer. My budget gives me at least $690 extra from now through December to put towards this debt (at least $480ish after January and I resume paying my student loans). 

The issue is I am not sure if a balance transfer is the right move and/or which balance to transfer if I don't get approved to a high limit or a low interest rate. My FICO 8 is 710 and my FICO 9 is 694--utilization is the only issue (using about 79% of available credit). Credit Karma's vantage score is at 619 and says I should get a personal loan (but they seem to think I would qualify for one at 25% and that seems like a bad financial move). 

I am also only allocating the 690 because I am still pulling money into a more robust (9 month) emergency fund as last year's 3 month fund was insufficient (and led to the debt). 

If anyone has any advice or anything I should be aware of, or even a recommendation for a good balance transfer card if that is what I should do, I would appreciate it.",finance

Not to mention we have a child on the way. I wasn’t exactly looking for relief a $1000 a week goes into an account for my bills, but I received a letter from a bank for a HELOC which would free up a lot of room, or so it seems. The house is worth more than what we paid for it and it seems as though regardless of the upgrades they essentially drive by and base it on the exterior of the dwelling. All of the work I’ve don’t has been interior, minus the lawn care and minor additions to the driveway. Would this be a good move to free up some of the monthly cost for debt?

personalfinance,$75k in charged off private student loans. How to rebuild?,"Long story short, I defaulted on my private loans back in 2015 as they were at 13% interest rate, expecting basically $2000/mo, and I was making $35k/yr fresh out of college. 

Fast forward to today, I finally got my feet underneath me. I've held a job now making \~100k/yr for 6 months. I've been snowballing debt down left and right. I'm working to fix all the bullshit I left for myself over the last 5 years. Throughout this entire process, I have never missed a payment on my federal loans, but I haven't made a payment on my private loans in \~4 years. 

Charged Off Debt - $75k

Federal Loans - $41k (@ $600/mo PAYE)

Current income - \~$100k

Take Home - $60k ($5k/mo)

Monthly Expenses - $3.5k/mo

I can spare about $1k/mo until April of 2021. After that, I will have another $500/mo to snowball my debts down.

Now that I'm in a position to start paying on these private student loans that have been charged off, how do I start? Should I give my creditor a call and figure out a repayment plan? What options do I have and what should I expect? Should I offer them $1,000/mo to start repayment and just fire as much money into this debt as humanly possible?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,401K vs Roth vs Roth IRA,"I have a few questions about 401K, Roth 401K, and Roth IRA contributions. I have posted about stuff along this line before in this subreddit but I guess the questions are becoming more detailed as I go.

Again some quick background on me: I'm an international student, did my undergrad in the US, am now working full-time (starting this past Monday - Aug 24). My company (like many) has a linkup with Fidelity. I will be making 72k a year before tax + 3k relo + 3k signing bonus. I have already filled out the Federal and State W-4s for the company.

Being an international student, in the future (once my current OPT + 2 extensions runs out) I will eventually need to get an H1B or some other work visa. I am also considering to go to grad school in a year (I got into a good one and am deferring my admission). But that doesn't eliminate the possibility that in the future I will have to go back to my home country, and to my understanding the 401K (while having employer contributions) is locked-in until I turn 59.5 yrs old. I am not sure how long I'll be in the US, and I don't want to lose too much if I have to leave to my home country (or to a different country).

So my question is: how should I organize my 401K and Roth 401K contributions? Or should I be doing something else entirely?

Details about my company's 401K: My company will match my contributions for $0.50 on every dollar up to 6% of my salary (so if I am contributing &gt;6% . There is a vesting period - if I leave my company within a year, I lose everything, if &gt;1 yr, then I get my money + 20% of employer contributions, if &gt;2 yrs then +40% of employer contributions... &gt;5yr I get all of my employer's contributions. For now, I would like to tentatively say that I will leave my company in a little more than 1 yr for my master's (which will most likely be in the US).

Because all of this is on Fidelity, Fidelity also lets you choose between its 'EasyContribution' options of 8%, 10%, and 12%. Or, I can customize the % of my money going to my 401K and my Roth 401K.

So, knowing all of this, what should I do?

financial,How should I move forward with finally using my credit card after six years of inactivity?,"Please bear with, I ask for your patience, professionalism, and guidance of six years worth of uninformed questions I'm asking for your guidance.  


I have had two credit cards with Bank of America and Wells Fargo for the past six years, but they both have a lack in any use of credit card activity because I've been too chicken shit about being financially irresponsible with late payments, increasing my interest rate, or spending more than I can afford, and getting screwed for honest human errors. 

I thought I had to manually pay in full each month by the due date of which changes every month and I didn't trust myself with this analog method. I just found out I can set up auto-pay for my credit card balance to be paid in FULL every month, thus completely removing any chances of any late payments and an interest rate increase.. (I know, fuck me).   


Apparently I have six years of having a credit card going for me from what the representative said. Is there anything I can do to rectify the six years of credit card inactivity?  


(today) CitiBank - $1,200 limit  
(6years) Bank of America - $1,200 limit  
(6years) Wells Fargo - $500 limit  


I just got approved for a credit card with CitiBank with a limit of $1,200. And from the rewards I was going to make it my primary for gas, shopping, etc.. but then I find out Wells Fargo and Bank of America have their own rewards too.. I'm in a dilemma on what card to use as my primary. All three? What would you do? or what did you do? What would you do?  


I also thought it would be a great idea to use each credit card to pay off another to build up credit on all three cards simultaneously, but I find out from a representative that doing that with CitiBank, whether it be receiving or sending will send me backwards into owing money, digging myself in a more deeper hole and thus defeating the purpose (something involving the cash reward program). Bank of America states there's a 3% charge in&amp;out of their institution, and with Wells Fargo there's nothing to be concerned about, except I'm not able to do that because in order to do so I have to have a limit beyond $500 at least. What is your experience with using credit cards to pay off others?   


Should I just set up my two of my bills on two cards  (WF &amp; BOA) with auto payment in full and use the third  one (CitiBank) as a primary to focus on cash reward?  


What unforeseen things should I be aware about moving forward with the intention of beginning to use my credit card?

I was not approved for Citibank initially because I specified I make an annual income of roughly $17,000 and have a monthly rent of $800. I went ahead an called them and told them it was an annual income of $25,000 and rent of $600 and was immediately approved.. just like that?   
If that was the process with no background check, can't I just claim to have made triple digits a year to have a more higher credit limit instead of this tedious, long and grueling process of building credit over the years into increase the limit?  


Does it matter if I spend $10 a month on a credit card or $100 to build credit and increase the limit?  
What exactly is the point of building credit, why do I need to do it?  


WF informs me that spending 30% and beyond the limit (in this case $500) is apparently a red flag, that I want to keep their credit card use at the maximum of $150 and below. For whatever reason the BOA and Citibank representative couldn't provide a ""red flag"" on their end. Does one exists for CitiBank and BOA?  


I don't know if this helps, but my credit score is 733 with roughly $18,000 in student loans.. which I have not been able to even make a dent on (forbearance).

personalfinance,"Trying to buy a house, balancing how high to offer to lower interest rates? (kind of a now vs later?)","Hi all,

Have been looking at houses w/ the SO for about a month now. The housing market is intense here. Anything ""good"" will hit the market in the morning/early afternoon, have multiple offers, and go under contract by the evening. It's incredibly competitive. (For reference - medium-ish COL, suburbs of a large city in the South, looking at stuff anywhere from 350k to 500k.)

It took us a bit to figure out what we wanted and to get comfortable pushing the button to make an offer, but we've now made two offers and didn't get either. The first one was 18k over asking, the other was 15k over asking.

Now, I don't know how much we're losing by, but I'm having a really hard time rationalizing going any higher over asking than we already are. It feels insane to go that far above asking, but it's starting to almost look like a requirement? 

We're not in a rush to buy (although sooner is much much much better than later), but I am worried about interest rates starting to go back up. The 2.6% we got a month ago is around 2.75% now, and will likely only go up the longer we wait. It doesn't feel good, but I'm starting to wonder if it would be better to just throw in another 5 or 10k just to be able to lock in the rate &amp; get a house we really want now?

Some friends have suggested waiting a few months, as once covid starts to wind down (whenever that ends up being) there may be more supply. (Either people feeling safer/having more reasons to move, like companies actually picking up on hiring, or people who haven't been able to pay finally getting foreclosed.)

I don't think we'll be directly taking that advise. We'll probably just keep doing what we've been doing: Look at houses, make aggressive but reasonable offers, and wait until something sticks. But man, it is so disheartening to keep losing.

personalfinance,"How long to wait before disputing a charge for wrong item sent? Petco.com online order, customer service no help at all, haven't received replacement","UPDATE (9/23/20): We disputed the charge with the CC company. One or two days later, we got an email from Petco describing the process for the replacement. We were told to put the wrong item outside our door and FedEx would pick it up and deal with it (we didn't need to put a label on it or even tape up the box). FedEx picked it up the next day, and about 3 or 4 more days later, the correct cat tree showed up at our door.

From what I can tell, the issue was that when we purchased form Petco, they contacted the manufacturer who sent the wrong item directly to us. So it actually wasn't Petco's mistake. But if they would have just explained that to us... anyway. At least it all worked out.

Thanks to everyone who chimed in and provided suggestions and advice! Very helpful.

\----

Background: Over a month ago, we ordered an expensive cat tree from [petco.com](https://petco.com). The item that arrived was a different (much cheaper, not that it matters that much...) item. We immediately contacted customer service, who said they'd get to work. They asked us for emailed photos of the incorrect item, which we sent. Over a week later, after no response, I called again and was told that they didn't see the photos attached to my request, and they asked me to send the photos again (to a different email address). I did that, then again no response. A follow-up email to that second email address did not receive a response.

Since then, I've called and chatted online with customer service multiple times and at this point I'm just receiving the same canned message, ""I will make sure that this request goes immediately to the appropriate department so that they can process your replacement."" I've even been told I would receive a call back from a manager within 24 hours; that never happened.

Questions: **Can I just dispute this charge with my credit card company at this point, on the grounds that I did not receive the item I ordered?** I have made many good faith attempts to have the issue corrected and those have not been successful, so I'm not sure what else to do. **Can I dispute the charge even while Petco claims to be in the process of working on a resolution?** I have never disputed a CC charge before, so I'm just not sure how it all works.

\----

*Rant:* How is it possible that in 2020 an online store could have such a huge issue with an incorrect item?? Are we the first people ever to receive the wrong item??? Why is this being escalated to a manager in the first place? Why did I have to email photos directly to one of the employees' work email accounts?? How was the solution not just, ""Oh, okay, we are shipping the correct item today, and you can put the old item in that box and ship it back OR here's a pre-paid shipping label OR drop off the old item at your local Petco.""

investing,$T - thoughts on the potential sale of DirecTV,"On Friday, WSJ reported AT&amp;T is exploring a deal for its DirecTV business, and has been in talks with private-equity players. This follows several other media reports over the last few years (CNBC, WSJ) that AT&amp;T has been considering selling its DirecTV business, as well as comments by DISH management that a combination of Dish's satellite operations with DirecTV are inevitable.

Goldman issued the following report this morning outlining some interesting thoughts:

**Why would AT&amp;T sell DirecTV? Three potential objectives:**

1. **Streamlining AT&amp;T's operations to focus on mobile, broadband and streaming entertainment.** AT&amp;T is the most diversified company in the US communications and media sector. While this diversification has the potential to yield certain competitive advantages, such as AT&amp;T's bundles of wireless and broadband connectivity with its streaming video services such as HBO Max, we believe it has also created a degree of operational complexity. This is especially the case, in our view, for the DirecTV satellite TV service, which is experiencing significant structural headwinds owing to industry-wide cord-cutting that is not only resulting in customer losses, but reducing the appeal of the service in AT&amp;T's product bundles.

With AT&amp;T having already made its flagship HBO Max streaming service available to its DirecTV customers, we believe the company has now captured the majority of the product and cost synergies from this asset. As such AT&amp;T may view that it can be a more focused and nimble competitor in its core mobile, broadband and streaming markets by divesting control of its satellite TV operations in the US. Indeed, separating from AT&amp;T could also allow DirecTV to operate in a structure that works better for a mature cash-generative business, which could benefit AT&amp;T to the extent it retained a stake in the company.

2) **Accelerate AT&amp;T's balance sheet deleveraging.** Since completing the acquisition of Time Warner in 2018, AT&amp;T has reduced it net debt by $25 billion from $177 billion to $152 billion as of 2Q20 through a combination of strong FCF, asset sales and other asset monetizations. While this has lowered its net debt/EBITDA from 3.3x to 2.7x, the company remains well above its historical leverage in the low-2x range, which we believe remains its long-term target. As such, we believe that AT&amp;T could likely consider any transaction that enabled it to accelerate its delevering by pulling forward value for non-core assets. Even if a transaction were only modestly delevering, in terms of its net leverage ratio, we believe that simply lowering the gross dollar amount of outstanding debt could improve AT&amp;T's financial flexibility by making it less reliant on the investment grade credit markets during a period of significant economic uncertainty.

3) **Achieve further cost efficiencies and synergies.** This opportunity would likely only apply to a combination with another pay-TV operator (vs. a financial buyer) owing to significant overlapping costs. We have not attempted to estimate synergies from this type of hypothetical combination, but AT&amp;T's own combination of DirecTV with its U-verse business in 2015 could be a potential precedent.

That merger represented the combination of DirecTV's base of 20 million US satellite TV subscribers with AT&amp;T's base of 6 million landline U-verse video subscribers. While these services were based on different infrastructure, the company initially estimated cost synergies would exceed $1.6 billion on an annual run rate basis by year-three after closing. One year later, AT&amp;T increased this target to $2.5 billion, based on lower programming costs across the combined video operations (DirecTV + U-verse) with other savings from core operational functions (e.g., truck rolls, billing, customer care, advertising, etc.).

**A combination with Dish could face regulatory scrutiny.**

For details on the potential regulatory considerations facing a potential merger of DirecTV and Dish, please see takeaways from our discussion with Andrew Lipman, partner at law firm Morgan Lewis, at the 28th Annual Communacopia conference in 2019. Here is our summary of Mr. Lipman's comments, which you can find in the report cited above:

Mr. Lipman believes that Dish and DirecTV could potentially get a deal through federal regulatory authorities if there was a will from both companies to merge. This is despite the failure of a similar proposal to merge between the two satellite operators in 2002. He believes that the pay-TV market has changed drastically since the original merger attempt (i.e. fiber and cable presence in rural areas, OTT offerings). Mr. Lipman believes that such a deal could potentially be structured in different ways to address the government's likely concerns that rural areas could be hurt by this merger including 1) price freezes or 2) allowing the two companies to combine back office functions, prior to a potential full merger.

**What impact would a sale of DirecTV have on the pay-TV market?**

We do not believe that a partial sale of DirecTV to financial partners, or any entity which would continue to operate DirecTV as an independent satellite TV operator, would have a material impact on the pay-TV market. This is because such a hypothetical transaction would not significantly impact the number of competitors. To some extent, it could yield a modest increase in competition as DirecTV would now compete directly with AT&amp;T's other pay-TV services, including its new Internet-based service AT&amp;T TV. However, we do not see this as a material change in the overall competitive backdrop.

A theoretical combination of DirecTV with Dish would represent a merger of the 2nd (DirecTV) and 4th (Dish) largest pay-TV providers in the US, resulting in a new company with over 25 million video customers (as of 2019), ranking it ahead of the current #1 Comcast (21.2 million). As such, a merger of the US's two satellite TV operators could lower competition among traditional facilities-based pay-TV providers. However, as we detailed in our recent initiation report on the US media sector, traditional pay-TV services are already experiencing material subscriber losses owing to competition from new streaming services. The pressures on satellite TV providers have been particularly intense, with the combined customer bases of DirecTV and Dish declining by 13% in 2019 vs. video subscriber declines of approximately 3% for the major cable providers. As such, a theoretical combination of these companies could potentially enable them to generate synergies that position them to remain viable competitors in the pay-TV sector longer than if they remained independent.

**What is DirecTV's financial contribution to AT&amp;T**

AT&amp;T does not report any financial or operating metrics for its DirecTV satellite TV operations. This business is included within the company's Entertainment Group segment, which in 2019 generated $45 billion of revenue (25% of consolidated revenue) and $10 billion in EBITDA (17% of consolidated EBITDA). Below, we provide our rough estimates for the size of the DirecTV subscriber base and its contributions to AT&amp;T's revenue and EBITDA in 2019. These estimates are intended to be illustrative in order to provide context for the scale of DirecTV within AT&amp;T's consolidated operations and relative to peers in the pay-TV sector.

**We estimate that AT&amp;T ended 2019 with approximately 16 million DirecTV satellite TV subscribers**, out of 19.5 million total Premium TV subscribers. As of YE2018, when AT&amp;T last disclosed the mix of it Premium TV subscriber base, the company had 19.2 million DirecTV satellite TV subscribers and 3.7 million U-verse video subscribers. In 2019, the company's combined Premium TV subscriber base declined 15%, which we believe was primarily driven by losses of DirecTV customers owing to the end of promotional pricing. For context, the large cable operators, whose video + broadband service bundles are more comparable to the U-verse offerings, saw their video subscriber bases decline by approximately 3% in 2019. If we assume the same trend played-out with U-verse, then that implies the DirecTV subscriber base declined 17% in 2019.

For context, this implies that DirecTV ended 2019 roughly tied with Charter (16.1 million video subscribers) as the second largest pay-TV service in the US. This compares to Comcast's video subscriber base of 21.2 million and Dish's satellite TV subscriber base of 9.4 million.

**We estimate that DirecTV generated approximately $25 billion of revenue in 2019**. We arrive at this estimate by assuming that ARPU for DirecTV subscribers is comparable to AT&amp;T's reported Premium TV ARPU in 2019 of $121. This implies that in 2019 the DirecTV satellite TV service contributed 57% of Entertainment Group revenue (14% of consolidated).

**We estimate that DirecTV generated approximately $7 billion of EBITDA in 2019**. This estimate implies an EBITDA margin in the mid/high 20%s. We believe this is a reasonable rough estimate based on few factors. First, DirecTV's closest peer, Dish, operates with an EBITDA margin of approximately 20%. Based on AT&amp;T's scale in video vs. Dish, we estimate that its average monthly programming costs per Premium TV subscriber is approximately $5 lower than DISH's. This estimated cost advantage represents approximately 4-percentage points of margin benefit for DirecTV vs. this peer.

Second, we assume additional scale benefits in SG&amp;A. For context, when AT&amp;T acquired DirecTV in 2015, its US satellite TV operations generated an EBITDA margin of approximately 25%. While we estimate that the DirecTV subscriber base in the US has declined by over 20% since the acquisition, we also estimate that AT&amp;T has increased the service's ARPU by over 10% and generated cost synergies, which management previously estimated would reach a run-rate of $2.5 billion. We therefore believe it is reasonable to estimate that margins have remained at least flat, and likely improved, since the acquisition of DirecTV, despite material subscriber losses.

Our approximate estimate for DirecTV's EBITDA implies that in 2019 it contributed nearly 70% of Entertainment Group EBITDA (12% of consolidated).",finance
stocks,Federal Aid For Airlines Ends Oct 1st,"The $25 billion dollar federal aid package for airlines ends October 1st. Airlines are expected to cut a significant amount of their workforce in an attempt to reduce their costs. 

For those looking to buy JETS or get into airlines I’d advise doing so after the share decline that is pretty likely coming late September and early October. This should give you less risk as FED money is what is keeping the airlines afloat right now so prices should go to what they would be without that aid once it ends. It also gives you a discount on share prices leaving more upwards room. 

What are your guy’s plans for airlines?",finance
personalfinance,Lender paid PMI vs Borrower paid PMI,"Hi PF,

Looking to refinance as we started with a pretty high 5.65% rate on a 318k home in a HCOL area. Most of our down payment was eaten in closing. We got two loans, one for the home and one for the down payment. I think we got lender paid PMI.

2 years later, our home value has gone up at least 10k and we are close to being eligible to refinance at a far better rate. Here are two choices I have gotten so far:

3.25% 30 yr fixed on 318k. $90/month PMI payment. Mortgage costs go down 300/month and the breakeven is at about the  2 year mark.

4.5% 30 yr fixed on 318k and lender paid PMI. Mortgage would go down around 150/mo so longer breakeven.

I am wanting to keep searching, but would appreciate any advice on these numbers so far. Its sounding like the lender either has to get paid in PMI or a higher interest rate. Is that always the case with a sub 20% LTV? Thanks!",finance
stocks,Why the stock market is disconnected from the economy,"Here's a snippet from a podcast I've listened to (by Peter Schiff) a week or so ago, thought I'd share it here:

&gt;Doesn't the stock market reflect the earnings of the economy? Well, no, it reflects the earnings of the companies that are part of the stock market. The vast majority of businesses in America are not publicly traded. They're not in the Dow 30; they're not even in the S&amp;P 500 or the Wilshire 5000. They're privately held companies, so they're not part of it.  
&gt;  
&gt;So, if you look at the makeup of the publicly traded companies especially on a market cap basis, which companies are doing the best? Amazon, Netflix, those type of companies. \[...\] What's happening today is heavily impacting smaller companies, mom-and-pop type companies. These are the ones that are struggling, and so, since these big companies now have less competition from smaller companies, that benefits the stock market.  
&gt;  
&gt;So to say, oh look, the stock market is booming, that means we have a strong economy. We don't. It is the weakness in the economy that is benefiting the stock market, and the weaker the economy gets, the better it's going to be for the stock market. Because what happens when the economy is weak? The Fed prints even more money, we get bigger stimulus. It does nothing for Main Street, it *sedates* Main Street, but it continues to pump air into the stock market bubble.

**TL;DR** Most companies are not listed on any major stock exchange. When you see the S&amp;P 500 up on the year, it's not the economy that's roaring. It's the mega cap FANG stocks, large-cap multinational retailers like Walmart and Target, big pharma, fintech, etc. None of the stock indexes reflect small businesses or even the overall economy. Don't look at the stock market to gauge the health of the economy, look at the economic indexes.",finance
personalfinance,RE: Financial Soundboard - Bankruptcy or Strapdown_NEED HELP,"Hi all -

I am going to seek some legal advice here soon but my gut tells me I am not quite there yet (bankruptcy) - but I could be naïve  … I have a good amount of debt that is hovering over my head. I will post my budget in detail. I am not sure it matters too much how I got here but a lot of it is from a separation, a failed business and then some of it is from bad consumer habits that occurred after feeling extremely down about the failures. I'm 30 years old, I am on the up now with an awesome job making \~$108K (my work week is roughly 40-60 hours but average closer to 45) and am attending a part-time MBA program at a top school which was something that I wanted to do since I was 23.. but now waited until I am 30 and though excited, the financial aspect of it gives me anxiety given my current circumstances.  My feedback from my friends/colleuges is that I am a smart, ambitious, and honest person. At work I am a high perform.. however, these personal finances are an absolute embarrassment and it took all I had to really outline this and post it. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

To break my specific debt down:

|Autoloan|26,000|N/A|588|4.3%||
|TOTAL|$88,000||$1,881|||

I am going to breakdown my monthly budget further but want to call out that one of my fears with going BK is I will have to withdraw from school and that has been a life long dream of mine.. though I know I am being very naïve in this sense - hoping someone can give good insight how to tackle this while still attending school.

&amp;#x200B;

My current monthly take home pay is $5,491. My savings is next to nothing &lt;$1K for emergencies.

|Disposable Income|$661||

&amp;#x200B;

Please notice that I did not put any budget in for fun as I would like someone to outline what they think I should realistically budget, if at all given my circumstances.  I should note I just paid off a 5K loan that freed up $400 a month and that felt really freeing but until then for the past two years I couldn't get anything to budge. I also have tried side hustles - think bookkeeping since I have experience. I have signed up for rover but barely get any bites.. I think a side hustle would go a long way in accelerating the payment of this debt.

Also, this may be a silly, but I have been dating someone just recently since my separation a year ago and really like this person but clearly I have a lot to sort out on my own - any thoughts on this matter. Should I close off my love life to strap down and pay this off in 3-5 years?

personalfinance,Is there any reason to pay off my student loans now?,"Hey all! Started with 65k of a refinanced loan at First Republic. I have \~15k in my account and \~13k left on my loan. I pay at least 2k per month, sometimes more. I should be done early next year, which is so exciting.

My interest rate is 1.95 and my loan servicer pays back up to 2% of interest if paid back before the loan is up (it doesn't expire until 2023). I live in my parents' home, my expenses aren't very high (just my CC bill and my loan, and I'm pretty good with saving money) and I'm pretty secure in my job. Is there any reason to pay it off now in full, or should I just keep paying the 2k a month until it's done? Was just thinking, if I were to get laid off I'm kinda screwed, but it would be awfully nice to be done with my student loans.

Am I missing something? Thinking I should just ride it out for another 6 months until they're done, but not sure if anyone had any reasons I should do otherwise. Thanks in advance, hope everyone is staying safe/healthy out there",finance
