personalfinance,Loan Forgiveness counseling for new college grad,"I recently met with a loan consultant in California who claimed she could decrease my college debt through different loan forgiveness programs. I was wondering if anyone could give any insight/advice regarding the news she gave me. I have $130k worth of student loans ($20k under my name as subsidized/unsubsidized and the remaining $110k under my mother’s name under a Parent Plus Loan). By using a loan repayment estimator on StudentLoans.gov, she showed me how I can repay my portion of the loans without paying ANY interest based on my projected starting income with my job. She then proceeded to show me that because my mother makes zero income (even though she files jointly with my father who makes $60k a year) that we wouldn’t have to pay ANY of the $110k back EVER given that she doesn’t “have” any money to give to begin with. She said that my fathers money is his money even if they file jointly and that it wouldn’t count as my mothers income. Given that she’d “retire” at 65 in 9 years, she’d never have to pay for the loans. She said we’d receive a statement balance of Zero dollars every month. She showed me the Standard Repayment Plans that everyone is given by default and those showed very high interest rates but she said that I was able to use these other repayment programs that essentially saved me hundreds of thousands of dollars. Is this not sketchy? She said she knows it may seem too good to be true but that it was created under the Obama administration.

personalfinance,Wrecked car and insurance questions,"Hello. As you could've guessed, we wrecked our car about three weeks ago and have been dealing with our insurance about repairing it, but it looks as if they'll total it out. They're currently paying for a rental until either it's fixed, thirty days have passed \(June 9th\) or it's totaled.

I was wondering, first, if the insurance would stop paying for the rental as soon as they deem it damaged beyond repair or if they would give us time to find a new car. After that, I'm wanting to get a newer car anyways, for safety concerns. I have a baby on the way and a Chevy Spark is not going to be suitable, space or safety\-wise.

I got the spark with a mid 500 credit score at about a 4&amp;#37; interest rate because we had a large down payment. I was wondering if the credit union would be more likely to finance us at around the same interest or a little higher, having financed through them already despite making some questionable decisions since we did. Not very hopeful on that one though because the loan we would then be taking out would be much higher anyway.

I'm just at a little bit of a loss right now because I haven't had to deal with this kind of thing before. Thanks in advance",finance

personalfinance,Expected to owe 40K in taxes... How to prepare?,"Dear PF community, 

It has been a great year for me financially. My base salary is 240K and I expect to make 200K in bonuses this year. They withhold 25&amp;#37; for federal taxes for my bonuses. I did a rudimentary calculation using Turbotax and I expect to owe 40K in taxes. My wife and I are ""Married filing separately"". She is a social worker and there is a huge disparity in our income. We are doing IBR with PSLF for her school loans. I did the calculations and surprisingly it still makes sense to keep going this way.

Where is the best place for me to keep the 40K until tax season?  I was thinking of opening an Ally Bank savings account to at least let interest accrue a little. Are there smarter options than this?  Would it make sense to invest in bonds in hopes of getting a better return?

personalfinance,Using Financial Aid Refund for Other Loans,"A bit of a back story. My wife and I got married 8 months ago. I knew she had some credit card debt before we got engaged. It was around $13k when I found out. I've never been in credit card debt, so it was a bit of a shock to me. It's actually taught me quite a bit about how difficult it really is to recover.

Anyways, I made a budget for her and she got a 2nd job to aggressively pay it down before we combined finances. I wanted her to be responsible for it before we got married and combined finances.

Flashforward another year and we are married. It's down to about $10k in debt where we combined finances and she could join Navy Federal with me. We immediately got her set up with a personal loan to consolidate the 3 cards worth of debt. The loan is around 15% APR for $9200 as of now.

Now my wife has been taking online classes towards her master's degree. She has just started her second year of online classes receiving financial aid. She just told me yesterday that she found out her school has a separate bank account with $18k in it from financial aid refund the past two years. Apparently the school sets up a bank account where the refund gets deposited. 

I dug deeper into her student loans and she has loans from undergrad ($12k at 5.5% unsubsidized and $15k at 6% subsidized). She's currently not paying on these due to being in school. The graduate loans are $12k at 6% and 18k at 5.3% both unsubsidized. She won't need to start paying on these until September 2019, but I do realize they are accruing interest. 

We do pretty well financially now that we have a solid budget, and I have her being more responsible. We can save around $2k/month but just don't have a solid savings yet. My instant reaction was to flip this $18k back towards the student loans, but then I remembered about her personal loan.

I've never really thought nor hear much about using financial aid refunds to pay off higher interest loans. My thinking is to use $9200 to pay off her personal loan, and then use the other $8800 towards the 6% unsubsidized student loans.

It almost sounds too good to be true. Is this a smart path to take?

I'd also like this to make other people see this as an option that doesn't get brought up too much. I realize that most students receive their refunds while in undergrad and will need it for living expenses so this may only work if you're working full time and don't need the refund to live off of.",finance
personalfinance,Student Loan Services Changed My Interest Rate,"This is an incredibly short story, but I never thought these loans had a variable interest rate.

I was paying my monthly student loans and noticed that my interest rate changed recently from 6% to 6.75%. This adds a little more burden, but I always assumed rates were fixed for these types of loans and planned accordingly. There's still ~$8,700 in it.

Has this happened to anyone else? Given the amount still left over, should I consider refinancing or taking a personal loan with another lender for a lower rate? My credit score is in good shape, but a 6.75% interest rate looks to be the average for this loan type now, so I don't want to make inquiries on my credit if it's going to be a waste of my time.",finance

investing,White House officials are making plans to order grid operators to buy electricity from struggling coal and nuclear plants in an effort to extend their life,"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-01/trump-said-to-grant-lifeline-to-money-losing-coal-power-plants-jhv94ghl

&gt; The Energy Department would exercise emergency authority under a pair of federal laws to direct the operators to purchase electricity or electric generation capacity from at-risk facilities, according to a memo obtained by Bloomberg News. The agency also is making plans to establish a ""Strategic Electric Generation Reserve"" with the aim of promoting the national defense and maximizing domestic energy supplies.

&gt; ""Too many of these fuel-secure plants have retired prematurely and many more have recently announced retirement,"" only to be replaced by less-secure, less-resilient natural gas and renewable power sources, the memo said.

&gt; Trump administration officials have contemplated action for more than a year. After the Energy Department conducted a reliability study last year, Energy Secretary Rick Perry proposed a rule that would have compensated coal and nuclear plants for their ability to store months’ worth of fuel on site. Federal regulators shot down the idea in January.

&gt; That didn’t quell requests for help. A FirstEnergy Corp. subsidiary requested immediate intervention from Perry’s agency in late March. That plea followed the Akron, Ohio-based company’s announcement to shut three nuclear power plants that feed the grid operated by PJM Interconnection LLC, the largest in the country. FirstEnergy Solutions filed for bankruptcy within days of its emergency request.

&gt; Invoking national security concerns could bolster the Trump administration’s case in any legal challenges over the intervention, said Ari Peskoe, director of the Electricity Law Initiative at Harvard University.

&gt; ""It’s going to be tough to get a court to question DOE’s factual finding -- particularly if it relates to national defense,"" Peskoe said in an interview. Tapping two statutes simultaneously also could give the administration more ""legal room,"" Peskoe said.

&gt; The government last invoked the Defense Production Act to address the California energy crisis in early 2001, ordering natural gas sellers to prioritize contracts to sell supplies to utility Pacific Gas and Electric Co.

Disclaimer: I own $PEGI and $NEP shares.

NEE's electricity generation portfolio consists of roughly half from natural gas, about a quarter from nuclear, about a quarter from wind, and single digit percentages from solar, coal and others. Back in 2017, coal was about 2% of their portfolio, but they recently shut down a major coal fired plant and replaced it with more natural gas and solar. I'd also expect their solar portfolio to rapidly grow as they had convinced a Chinese solar panel manufacturer to setup a plant in Florida by promising to buy GWs of solar panels.

I don't remember exactly what NEP's electricity generation portfolio consists of, but it's likely somewhat similar to NEE.

PEGI is self explanatory.

First Energy's portfolio consists of about 50% from coal and 25% from nuclear.",finance

personalfinance,Prioritizing my wife's substantial student loan debt,"Hi all,

&amp;nbsp;

I wanted to get some feedback on my approach to the long-term goal of paying down my wife's substantial student loan debt.

&amp;nbsp;

**EDIT: Updated strategy (original post starts below line)**

Thanks for everyone for your time and thoughtful responses. I can't express how much it is appreciated.

Here's an update for your feedback.

**Updated strategy:**

* Filing taxes married-filing-separately to reduce my wife's AGI
* With reduced AGI, she should qualify for income-based repayment on her federal loans, the largest amount we owe, hopefully reducing these payments to $0/month
* With an extra $500+/month free, our additional payments towards principal will be somewhere between $1,300-1,500/month (as opposed to the current $850/month, final amount still not decided)
* This amount would go directly towards the principal on her private loans
* Her current employment qualifies for PSLF, meaning the remaining balance on her federal loans (which we would continue to *not* pay) would be forgiven as early as March 2026

*With the new immediate goal of focusing only on her private loans, it seems possible that we would have them completely paid off within 3-4 years. At this point, we would essentially be ""done"" with payments, since we would just need to ensure that we pay nothing on the federal loans until PSLF kicks in.*

*My wife would be committed to working until her private loans are 100% completed. At that point, we can evaluate our lifestyle and situation (multiple kids, etc.). She may potentially stay at home for a period starting then with our new flexibility. On an income-based repayment plan, her loan payments would still be $0 (as I understand it). When she goes back to work, her PSLF-eligible payments would resume. This would delay how long we have until we move from ""done"" to DONE, but may be the best situation for us at the time.*


**Next steps:**

* Submit PSLF paperwork

I provided this paperwork to my wife for her current employer to complete. Submitting the initial paperwork will help us confirm everything in on track for PSLF in the future.

* File 2018 taxes married-filing-separately 

I looked into amending our 2017 taxes to start this strategy immediately, but evidently you cannot switch from MFJ to MFS after the April 15 deadline. So reduced payments will need to wait until next year.

* Submit income-based repayment paperwork

Following completing 2018 taxes with reduced AGI for my wife.

*How does this look? Am I missing something, any details?*

**Student Loan Details**

Total Debt: $148,849

Total Monthly Payments: $1,257.68/mo

- $84,209.14 at 5.88% fixed (Federal consolidated loan): $512.81/mo
- $2,675.73 at 6.5% variable (private): $50/mo
- $3,454.81 at 6.5% variable  (private): $50/mo
- $19,957.74 at 4.78% variable (private): $50/mo
- $38,551.68 at 6.24% fixed (private, consolidated): $451.55/mo

&amp;nbsp;

*We have never missed a payment.*

&amp;nbsp;


Consolidation:

- The consolidated federal loan was previously 3 loans, all with a similar interest rate to her current federal loan

- The private consolidated loan was previously 3 other loans, all with significantly higher interest rates (between 8 and 9%), which I consolidated close to two years ago

&amp;nbsp;

Brief Finances Overview:

- Income: $55k/year for me (graphic designer), $45k/year for my wife (teacher)
- Mortgage: $961/mo
- Daycare: $290/week (both my wife and I work, we max our daycare FSA for tax benefits)
- No credit card debt: we utilize cards for points and pay balances in full weekly
- No other outstanding monthly payments: cars are paid in full, etc.
- Retirement: we both contribute the full amount for company match, no more (currently, we've done more in the past but I am re-prioritizing)
- Emergency fund: was set at $5k, am prioritizing this and increasing to $10k (in Vanguard mutual fund)
- Education savings: $100/mo into a 529 plan for our kid since we don't want to delay this, though obviously this is not a huge amount (originally funded with $2k of our own money and $1k from grandparents)

&amp;nbsp;

**Ok, so what's the question?**

According to the flow chart, which I am 100% on-board with strategy-wise, any flexible money we have at this point should go into ""high interest debt"". Personally, I am incredibly motivated to demolish this student loan debt.

&amp;nbsp;

*My strategy: currently we make a $200 payment per week to our next financial priority. This payment is non-negotiable for us. This is the amount we can currently afford, though it will fluctuate over time (started as $150/week, may have to go down in the future). Any additional money that comes in (e.g., tax refunds, reimbursements from our daycare FSA) also goes towards our next financial priority.*

&amp;nbsp;

Right now this payment is going towards beefing up our emergency fund. Once we have hit our current goal there, I intend to use this weekly priority payment to start hitting student loans. This is obviously better than nothing, but given the extreme amount of debt she developed in school, it's going to take a *long* time. I plan on starting with the higher interest loans, which also happen to be the smallest amounts now thanks to consolidating.

&amp;nbsp;

**My question:** Does this strategy seem sound? Making additional payments towards the principal is obviously the fastest way to pay down this debt. I am extremely disciplined; trust me when I say these payments will happen and will not be forgotten, and I will not lose track of our financial goals. 

&amp;nbsp;

The issue for me is psychologically evaluating the opportunity cost. This amount of debt is *insane* to me. It's hard for me to imagine paying every spare cent into this financial beast for 10+ years. I'm financially savvy (to a certain degree), and the thought of losing out on potential returns, other goals, and just feeling solid financially is so very disappointing to me. Is there more I could be doing? Is there a way to be more effective here?


&amp;nbsp;

Any advice is welcome.

&amp;nbsp;

*For those wondering on some more personal background:*

My wife is not very financially aware, though she is extremely responsible and disciplined as well. Her family in general doesn't think about this stuff. It wasn't until we were engaged that she mentioned to me that she had student loan debt. She didn't know the amount. When I asked how much she paid a month, she wasn't sure. I sat her down and laid it all out in a spreadsheet for her, at which point you could see the light go on, ""This is drastically going to impact our life."" Her father-in-law made extremely poor decisions about funding her college, which are now directly impacting the opportunities we have for our own child, where we live, and our financial future. My wife went into triple-digit debt to become a teacher...Funny enough, it's because of this that I have become so much more aware myself, but literally: my family is in the exact same situation as hers (we met because our dads both have the same job, we both went to private 4 year universities, my parents are smart about that stuff, my loan payments are $63/mo).

&amp;nbsp;

Yes, I struggle psychologically at times with the thought, ""This is ruining real opportunities for us, and it is going to for a very long time."" No, it's not really helpful to know there are people just like me out there, some with more debt; I just think that underscores how much this sucks for everyone. I try to stay positive and know that, 20, 30, 40 years from now, we will most likely have met all of our financial goals.",finance
CryptoCurrency,Started an online Crypto only Liquor store after being defrauded $1000 on an order from our regular site.,"Last Christmas we had an online order come through to our old website for an expensive champagne. Usually, these types of orders set off some red flags, so we personally review them before proceeding. In this case the credit card name, billing address and shipping address both matched. We also had a AVS match response from our credit card gateway. In the past we have had fraudsters try to ship to alternate addresses or a name that does not exist at the shipping address. I double checked the shipping address in public records and sure enough, the name and phone number all matched. Even the IP address originated from the same town as the shipping/billing address. Basically, this order met all the checks of a safe order to ship. 

Anyway, about a month and a half later, I get a notice from the credit card company that the cardholder was disputing the charge. Normally, what we have to do is prove that we had an AVS match, and that the billing name and address matched the shipping address on the order. When I went to investigate the tracking, I noticed the order was rerouted to a Fedex pickup location at a local Walgreens, we never authorized that, but apparently fedex will allow the customer to do that. Strange thing was, that it was a month and a half later, but the tracking status showed it wasn't picked up yet. So it seemed like this was in fact a fraudulent order used with a stolen card number. 

So a few weeks go by and the credit card company says they are denying my chargeback reversal because the items did not ship to the original billing address, even though we didn't authorize the change. Oh well, so I  asked Fedex to return the items to me since it was still listed as not picked up. At least I wouldn't be out the goods. Another couple weeks pass by and nothing happens. I call Fedex to investigate and they said the package is not there, so it must've been picked up by the customer, but they have no record of it being scanned out. So now I am out the goods and the $1000! 

Anyway, long story short, that was our last straw. We stopped offering shipping on our old site and opened a new site. www.blockchainbottle.net  The credit card company obviously knew that this was a fraudulent order with a stolen card, but we also followed all the proper protocol for an online order. They could've easily taken the loss on this, but instead put it on us instead.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Friends have money but won't pay off loans. Is there any reason this is a good idea?,"**Backstory:**  A married couple in their mid-20s that I am close to has a good deal of money. She has what I believe to be around $1,000,000 in an IRA that was left to her, and she just sold two apartments that were also left to her for around $300,000 each. She made at least $2,000/mo. from those apartments in rent. She works part time, and he works full time. I estimate that they make around $85k a year at most between them. They currently live in an apartment that costs them $1,525/mo. and have been known to complain that they don't have money, despite her buying a ridiculous amount of things for herself. But that is besides the point. They have around $100,000 in student loans, some of which are private loans at around 9-11% interest.  

**The Problem:** They are looking to buy a house. Particularly a duplex so that her father can live with them, though they won't be charging rent. Their max budget is $600,000. They just made an offer (but changed their minds after an inspection) on a house for $485,000. Their plan is to put a little extra down, and get their mortgage to around $2,000/mo. They also plan on refinancing their student loans as a part of their mortgage to decrease interest rates. All of this at the advice of their realtor, whose advice they took to buy a house in the first place.  

**My Problem:** I care about them a great deal, but the fact that they're looking to buy a house, not pay it off quicker, and also not pay off their student loans blows my mind and worries me. I don't claim to know much about finances, but if it were me then my first move would be to pay off my loans *at least*. They're just paying the minimum payment on everything and that's going to cost them so much more money in the long run.  

I'm going to sit down with him next week and talk to him about this from a place of care and concern, but I want to make sure that I have the right idea. Can anyone please tell me if their plan is a good idea, and if so, please help me understand why?",finance

personalfinance,"Is this a good plan to get my own car by the end of the year? (ON, CAN)","Hi everyone, so I just graduated university recently and have a job. I live three hours away from my parents. I drive my parents' car, but it's getting to be in pretty rough shape and my parents rarely do anything beyond very basic maintenance to save money. My car has had leaking head gaskets for a couple years now, for instance. Asking my dad to get anything fixed results in a big fight, so I would like to acquire my own vehicle as I believe I can afford it now. Here's my current financial situation:

Income: I'm currently on a student contract making $16 an hour, but I'm waiting for a full\-time contract. It's the government; they move exceptionally slowly on these things. I gave them my graduation confirmation like three weeks ago, and they've confirmed that it is in the works. Anyway, my pay right now averages about $850\-$950 a pay check... I don't get paid sick days yet and I have had to take some time off recently because my mental health issues have been flaring up. It'd be almost exactly $1000 every two weeks if I took NO time off. Once I get my contract \(likely in a week\) I should be making between $1300\-$1400 a pay check, or $2600\-$2800 a month \(total gross salary being roughly $47600 a year\).

Liabilities: I use my credit cards to pay for life expenses such as groceries or the new mattress I bought recently. I also have $17,506 of student loans.

Savings: I have approx. $9,000 in savings right now. I have \~$3,000 spread out over 2 tax\-free savings accounts and \~$6,000 spread out over 3 standard savings accounts.

Expenses: My rent is $850 a month. I live alone in a 2bed\+office on the top floor of an older house, and this kind of rent is really low for the amount of rooms. I pay $50 for parking at work, $50 for Internet \(I share with my neighbours who own the plan\), $45.20 for my phone after taxes, around $26 for renter's insurance, Kindle Unlimited which is $10 a month. I have CAA which is $126 a year; I just paid that like a week ago. I have around $100 dedicated to going out for lunch and stuff at work, but I'm working on lowering that. I also just got a [cat](https://imgur.com/a/rvm2XFS) \(first foster that I couldn't bear to give up, whoops\), and I already have a hamster and Betta fish so I'm not sure yet how much I can expect to spend on cat food/vet bills \(the cat and ham have a vet appointment in two weeks\). Unrelated question: Would getting pet insurance for my cat be worth it? He's 3 and a former stray. Also, my car is horribly fuel inefficient so fuel costs can run me up to $300 a month, mainly if I go home more than once. Also, living in northern Ontario means the fuel prices are ouch. I take medications but they are all covered under OHIP\+ since I'm under 25, so that's not an expense I gotta worry about.

Since student loans accumulate interest, while I don't need to start paying until November \(grace period\) I'm thinking that once I get my contract/first paycheck from said contract, I will call OSAP and ask to make an early payment, throw $5k of those savings at the loans and then aggressively save for my car. I want to buy a used car that's between $8\-$10k with a downpayment of $5k \(preferably a Subaru Impreza, which is what I have right now, and I'm a Subaru fangirl, what can I say?\). If I work overtime and such I should be able to easily save $4500 \(I allocated $500 to a savings account for it already\) by December, I'm hoping? Even if I don't, if I'm smart \(and eat a lot of pasta, lol\) I think I could still do it. I have a goal to save $100 a month towards a new phone by next summer but I can always put that money towards the car for now... Student loan repayments should start in November but I want to take a long term and then throw extra money at it as I've got it, with low monthly payments for any months I might need it. Hoping to pay in 3\-4 years. As for car insurance, my parents pay it rn since they own the car \- it's about $1,700 a year and when I looked up quotes, it should be around the same for me.

Does this sound realistic? Also, I know that dealers will sometimes negotiate, is it realistic to look at a car that's, say, $11,000 but say ""I really like this car but my budget is only $10,000, can you work with me here""? Do you have any other tips for me? Oh, and I plan to get a loan through my bank as I've heard the interest rates will probably be better!! I should mention that last time I checked, my credit score was 786.

personalfinance,"23yo Undergrad Senior, what do with work-study money?","Hi guys,

I want advice on where to put my money.

So I'm 23 and will be graduating college this upcoming year. I'll have 25k in federal student loans, most are subsidized, but a couple are not. The jobs I want only require a bachelors \(although I'm still looking at fully\-funded grad programs\) and I'll have about a year and a half experience in the field before I graduate thanks to internships/work\-study jobs. I have an IRA with $1500 and a 700\+ credit score, but I'm out of savings thanks to surprise medical issues, sudden car problems, and bad spending habits \(I'm still able to pay off my credit card every month, but after that, I don't usually have much\).

Right now, I don't get many hours in my work\-study, so I make between $50\-$100 per week. My parents are financially supportive and send me down money every now and then, but not consistently and the amount varies a lot.

So my question is: where should I put my work\-study money? In an emergency fund? Towards student loans? In savings for an apartment/etc?",finance
personalfinance,New grad wanting to hit 1Mil by 30.,"Wondering the feasibility of my goal. Im a new grad (just finished my masters). I'm looking to hit 1Mil by 30 and I'm currently 23.

Currently, I'm making slightly over 100k. I've paid off all my school loans and bought my car in cash. I've maxed out my 401k (currently putting in over 20% since started later in the year to help hit the federal maximum) with a 4 percent match. I've saved exactly 100k and have about 6k in crypto (off a 300 Investment), some money in mutual funds and 19k liquid doing nothing.

I live like a cheap college student, rent is currently 300/mo. I plan to move to a large city in 2019, where I can expect rent increase to 1800.

What should I do to hit my 1Mil goal and is 7 years too soon?",finance
personalfinance,Roth Conversion Vs Brokerage Account,"Throwaway account, sorry.

I’m a federal employee under FERS that is eligible to retire under special rules.  My wife and I are both 32. I’m eligible to retire at 47, and forced out at 56 \(mandatory retirement\); however we are both planning to go at 52.  At that age I will have available my; TSP, FERS annuity, and the special retirement supplement all penalty free \(again we have special rules\).  My wife only has a 401k through her employer, however she cannot touch it until 59 ½ without penalty.

So here is the question; we need to bridge the gap from 52\-59½ until her 401k kicks in, that roughly comes out to $1500\-2500 a month for that time period.  Is it better to put money into a Roth Conversion \(we make too much to put straight into a Roth\) and take the 10&amp;#37; penalty plus capital gains \(which would be taxed at our ordinary income level 24&amp;#37;\), or simply use a brokerage account and only pay the capital gains at 15&amp;#37;?  Using a brokerage account, I have to pay capital gains on dividends etc for the next 20 years vs deferring that cost.  I know I can use the 5 year distribution rule to avoid the 10&amp;#37; penalty on the Roth, however I’d like to stretch those distributions 7 plus years \(does the 5 year rule still apply if stretching it to a longer time frame or can you even do that\)?

Additionally I’d like to use some of that money for some large purchases early in retirement \(50\-100k worth of purchases\).  The only advantage I can think of for using the Roth is that should the funds last longer than 59½, we would then have access to the money at a potentially lower tax rate.",finance
personalfinance,Moving out with remaining student debt,"Hi All! I am one year out of college and would like a financial check to make sure that I'm not overlooking anything. I have read the wiki but want to know if I am missing anything obvious!

**Background:**  
I graduated with $70K in debt but it had ballooned to $87K due to 12&amp;#37; interest rates. I pay $2,200 per month towards my loans and throw any additional left over funds when I can. All my extra payments go to my private loan @ 4.75&amp;#37; and I am paying minimums on the federal loans. 

Ideally, I would like to move out once I get my debt to around $40K since I have been living at home since December of 2016. Additionally, I travel for work 30&amp;#37; of my time and would love to live closer to the airport. I will be moving out with a roommate and am looking at paying less than 1.2K per month in rent and utilities.

**Income:**   
56K \+ bonus. This comes out to approx $780/week after taxes and 401k contributions \(6&amp;#37;\). I budget based on 4 weeks per month so some months I have an extra $780. Any bonus goes directly to student loans. 

**Current Monthly Expenses:**  
$80 gas  
$200 food  
$150 entertainment/drinks  
$50\-100 clothing

personalfinance,Just (re)discovered I have an IRA. What do I do with it?,"I worked for my university in graduate school and unbeknownst to me they set up a Rollover IRA for me. I first became aware of this account around 2009 or so, when I got a statement in the mail one day (had never gotten one before, probably from moving around a lot in and directly after university). I kinda just let it be and didn't do anything with it. I just remembered about it recently so tracked it down. It's still there, making a whopping $2.50 a month for the last year or so. Balance now is only around $1,800 USD.

I am living overseas now and my wages in this country are comparatively low by American standards, plus I'm expecting my first child, so I'm not really in a position to contribute to the IRA right at this moment.

However, would like to know what kind of goals I should set for starting and then continuing to contribute in the future in order for this account to actually start doing something interesting. Like, what's the bare minimum I should start to put into it, if/when I can afford to? 

I have very little concept of what an IRA is, just that it's money that's growing by a small interest rate and I can't/shouldn't touch it now. I'm 37 y.o., for reference.

Last year was tough. Contract expired, dried up savings, and I was on the cusp of being evicted, so I had to take out a title loan on my car to avoid that. I got a job around that time, but my check(s) wouldn't come in until a few weeks after rent was due.

personalfinance,Taxes for a student working out of state,"Hey guys I'm just trying to make sure I'm sorted out in where I'll be paying my 2018 taxes. 

I attend school in Alabama as a full time student, August-May since August 2015.


I work in the summer in various states and do not live at home. Last summer was MS, this summer is Indiana

While I am in school, my parents have lived in a few states, all for ~6 months. Ohio, Nevada, and now Washington state. I am a dependent of them

For my 2017 taxes, I claimed non-resident of MS, paid the very minimal local tax or something like that ($30) and got the rest back in refund. I paid my regular state taxes to AL as I had lived there longer than my parents had lived in any of their states and it seemed like the best option.

Now looking onto 2018 taxes, I'm interning at a university and being paid a living stipend ($1500/month june-august) which is taxable income but not in the usual employment way. It gets filed under my education/scholarships/grants section and is only responsible for being taxed by federal and state taxes, not SS or medicare.

I'm putting away 20% of this each month into a separate account I wont touch for paying taxes next April.

For the next tax season, will that be paid to the state of IN? or can I claim non residence in IN and pay state tax to AL? I'm a little confused if I can do that if the income is not a standard kinda W2 employment. Also, is there a way I can claim residence in WA as I am dependent of my parents living there and pay no state tax? Technically they do help me with college costs, living costs, healthcare, etc. but I really don't live with them and haven't for nearly 4 years. I've worked out of state every summer since beginning college.

TL;DR
I get paid in IN as a student living stipend, go to school in AL, my parents live in WA. Can I somehow claim WA taxes as my parents live there? Also is 20% out of my paycheck cutting it too close do you think?

Bitcoincash,Bitcoin Cash help for small farm.,"https://m.imgur.com/gallery/oQIBpbo

I need a BCH donation bomb thrown my way. A little about me, I recently moved my family out to Battle Creek Michigan. I bought an old horse farm, in full, for cash. Total price for my 12.5 acres? 39,000. The property has about 4 acres of cleared farmland and an almost 9 acre woods behind it. Right now, because the property has been vacant (hence the price) it needs a ton of work. I live here with my wife and 4 kids, and we are all working on fixing it up. At present, there is no electricity. The power company wont turn it on until the work is up to code in the house. (I did it, but I have to finish putting the floor in so the contractors can get in there) So far I’ve gotten the roof done, the walls torn out and down to the studs, electrical is in, and soon to be the floors. We are staying in a camper, with a generator and a port-a-potty until its done.

To say that it has been challenging would be an understatement, but I know that this is ultimately whats best for us. We dont have a payment and we owe no debt. I own our family van, and I own all of my things. No credit cards. If we cant afford it, we dont buy it. I knew it would be a stretch. A longshot for my family. We had a talk about it before we made the move and everyone was onboard. The kids too. They still are despite the obstacles weve encountered. Theres magic interlaced with mundane though. Ticks? Ive got them here by the thousands. We’ve gotten so habitual at tick checking and removing, that it no longer seems scary. Bug trying to eat me? Get in line bro. Everything in my yard is trying to eat me. But for every tick or millipede or wolf spider, theres a turtle or a firefly, a den of bunnies, and yes even kittens. We found the newest addition to our family living in the house when we bought it. A female manecoon about 5 weeks old. My daughters named her gandalf and now shes one of us. (funny how that happens isnt it?) My kids are enchanted by the woods and all that they bring. I have a spring fed stream that runs the length of my property, and its not uncommon for us to find turtles in the yard. Box turtles, painted turtles, and even a few salamanders. My neighbor told me that the forest behind us is actually a cat forest. He says feral cats overran it years ago and since the woods are so think no one goes in to get them. They just stagger out from time to time. Several neighbors have confirmed this. No mice though! I find things here, like horseshoes, tools, and old knick knacks. I rehung an old tire swing for my kids and was the hero of the day! I also setup a small baseball field here for my kids. Its been fun and exciting for them and has helped them stay in good spirits while I redo the house. 

Its a bold move. To put it all on the line. To know that the highest choice for my family is to be able to grow ALL of our own food. To drink clean well water not saturated in chlorine. To breathe the fresh air and be more in sync with nature. To get back to the basics of what you need and whats really important. 

Im also a huge Bitcoin Cash supporter. I tell everyone I meet about it. I’ve setup businesses to be able to accept Bitcoin Cash. I tip in Bitcoin Cash. People always ask what it is when I give them some, and by the end of the conversation, they are on board. The baseball field I put in here contains things purchased from my neighbors for Bitcoin Cash. I bought 2 benches and a wooden sign from him. Im an active member of the Bitcoin Cash community and much like knowing I needed a homestead for safe and sound living, the world needs a safe and sound way to do banking. Im all in on it.

 I am going to complete the homestead. It may take a while, but it will be done. I’m asking the Bitcoin Cash Community for help. By sending BCH, you will be helping me to get up and running much sooner than I otherwise would be. I can incorporate projects that could be years away (Bee Boxes, Outside Smoker, Canning Supplies, etc) Some of it is directly needed. I need drywall, and insulation. I need a shower/bath, and cabinets. If this sounds like something you would be willing to help with, please do. Give a man a fish and he eats for a day. Help a man build a self sustaining homestead and he and his children, and their children eat forever. Bitcoin Cash is for Everyone, even the homesteaders use it. I will remember you all.

Does anyone have some tips on how to make sure I set aside enough money to pay once the payments kick in?  I'm thinking about getting another bank account to funnel money into, but there has to be a better way. 
EDIT: I should add, I only have to pay rent for a month and a half, and otherwise have no major work expenses other than traveling in my car (for work). I already use a mileage tracker, since my employer doesn't have a mileage reimbursement set up yet, so I can deduct those expenses when I file. 
Any other tips for someone just starting to actually have real money to spend/invest/save are greatly appreciated, too!",finance

So to make it short, I currently have 3k sitting in vanguards mm fund, and I'm wondering what I should do with it.  I'm not looking to invest it, as I may need the money in a year or two, and I see that the fund has a small (~1.4%) yield.  Should I keep the money in there or transfer it somewhere else?  I don't think its worth and extra .1% to open a ally savings account, tell me otherwise if it is.

personalfinance,Opinion: Private Job vs. Federal Gov Job,"throwaway account for obvious reasons...

I am new college grad starting a position in the Houston area in late June for a starting salary of $101k \+ benefits. I was recently contacted by a supervisor \(we will call her Joy\) at a military\-affiliated organization to apply for a job with them in Huntsville as a GS\-11 Step 7 for a term position \(3 years guaranteed, may be renewed after that\). Joy said that's the absolute highest she can do because she must stay within the GS\-11 pay band for entry\-level positions. She also stated that all of her other hires started \~$10k/year less. They are throwing in a recruitment incentive to pay off all my expenses to leave my job in Houston. She also said that after 1 year of experience, the salary can increase quickly since that will push me into GS\-12/13 pay bands which have a much higher ceiling.

Joy believes that this position will be renewed into a permanent position after one to two terms because this position is back\-filling retiring employees. I calculated the net tangible benefits that I will be paid from both jobs \(vacation, sick leave, 401k/TSP, pension, health insurance cost, etc.\). I think that the two jobs are worth $110k and $79k, respectively. However, I've been informed that the $110k job is a minimum 50 hour per week job, whereas the $79k job is almost guaranteed 40; if you go over 40, you get compensated for that with either straight time or vacation time. This significantly affects the hourly rate of each job.

When adjusting for COL differences \(Huntsville is about 11&amp;#37; cheaper than Houston\), the hourly pay from the $110k job becomes $37.84 whereas the hourly pay from the $79k job would be $37.98. With only a $0.14 difference, it seems like it would be a wash at the end of the day, but the salary themselves are $26k/year apart! In addition, the $79k job would be about an hour per day less commute and closer to family/friends. Plus, it gets 26 days of paid leave each year as opposed to 10 days at the $101k job \(but this was already accounted for as a cash\-value benefits\). Finally, this offer will be made to me after clearing a security check which could take anywhere from 2\-12 months from now, so I will have some time to think it over.

It will require me to burn a bridge at my high\-paying job for a much lower paying job, but it would be a less stressful lifestyle with possibly more rewarding work. In this situation, what would you do? 

TL;DR: $110k private job vs $79k public job. Which job would you take, and what circumstances would sway your mind?",finance
personalfinance,Pay off rental property?,"My only debt is my rental &amp; primary mortage.  Being a rental, the interest rate is not great (5.875).  Last statement, amount paid towards interest was $480.  It's cash-flow neutral.  I get about $1200-1300/mo in rent.  Zillow estimate is $200k - I don't put too much faith into that.  Paying off the $100k left would leave me $20k in reserve.  The reasons I hesitate to pay it off is that the community is only 1/3 developed, it's a townhouse (shared wall), and worried about another housing bubble.  New investors have started to build out the community, though.

personalfinance,Advice on student loans or investing...,"My basic question is are we missing the boat on investing now by focusing on student loans..

My wife and I are both 32 years old and we have a 7 month old. My wife graduated 2 years ago and we knew we wanted to have a child as soon as possible. We didn't expect we would get pregnant on the first try.  We then focused purely on adding to our savings in case of a difficult pregnancy or delivery. Thankfully everything went smoothly and we were able to throw 20k right at her students loans only a few months after having our child. We sit with a 10k emergency fund at all times.  Each month we scrape together 4 to 5k to throw at the highest interest rate loan.  We only have 48k left to pay off and we fully expect to be done with student loans by next June 2019.  My parents are taking over daycare at their desire which will save us 800 a month, which gets added to the student loan payment. 

Most interest rates are between 4 and 6%.

Should we continue the snowball effect or should I look into some investments as well?

1) What amounts should I move from each account? I am thinking about 40k from the large account and 5k from the smaller account. The remaining balances would leave a very comfortable emergency fund. 


2) My mom is a joint owner on the large account (though all the money was placed there by me-- she opened the joint account with me when I was 9). Do I have to coordinate with her to move the funds?


3) Will the banks be concerned by me moving such a large amount of money? Should I instead do it incrementally?

personalfinance,Questions about home equity loan.,"I have a few questions, first some basic facts (all currency quoted in USD):

1. I own a home in Michigan free and clear worth &gt;300K (owned over 10 years)
2. I own a home in Maryland worth $220K and owe $160K (owned over 15 years)
3. I make a bit over 36K per year, though last year was lower since I moved from Japan to Vietnam and needed to rebuild my client base.  If I need to I can fairly easily make more (I'd max out at about $85K but I'd be extremely unhappy doing that, at about $50K I'd be hitting the limits of a work/life balance I'd be able to live with).  
4. I want to take out a loan of $175K in order to purchase and develop property in Vietnam, I expect to pay this back in 10 years but to ask for a longer term with no penalty for early repayment in order to have a comfortable margin in case I have any financial difficulties.

So my situation is as follows:

Work:  I spend the vast majority of my time outside of the USA working as a volunteer in Vietnam and although I could qualify for FEIE based on physical presence if I were to open a business office abroad, I pay federal taxes in the United States both because I hope for long term benefits from this and because having a business in the US makes my life immeasurably easier (previously my office was in Japan when I was living there full time, and the headaches were constant).  My current business has been open for approximately 1 year.  I do not currently pay state taxes since I don't physically live in the USA and my LLC is located in Wyoming.  I provide my services (allied health) via the internet through my US business serving both my own client base as well as contracting through a company to schools in the US.
_____

Income:  I make a bit more than 36K per year, and could make more if I wanted.  I live most of my life, with rare return trips to the USA, in Vietnam where my monthly bills are under $1500 all in.  Credit karma lists my credit as 660, and the areas of need are my credit age (average 6 years, 6 months) and total number of accounts (3 opened, 5 closed).  I have no other problems except one missed payment on a credit card on my payment history.
_____

Properties:  I own a house in Michigan free and clear and let my disabled brother live there as a caretaker.  I could consider this my primary US residence since I make no money from it (I pay the taxes, insurance, etc., my brother pays his utilities) and when I (very rarely) return to the USA this is where I stay.  I also own a house in Maryland worth ~220K with ~160K owed that my mother lives in.  She pays the mortgage/bills.  She will soon move to Michigan to live with my brother and the house will become a rental property.
_____

Wants:  As I said, I live in Vietnam.  I have a wife who has minimal interest in living anywhere else (she's willing to live anywhere I want to live, but her strong preference is here), so we want to buy property and build a house.  We want to borrow 175K in order to achieve this goal, this will buy us the 'rest of our lives' house that we will pass down to children later.

Questions:

Am I in a position to qualify for a loan?

What kinds of rates should I be looking for?

Is a home equity loan our best option?

Should I focus on getting a loan from my current mortgage holder, a different lender, or through my credit union (Navy Federal)?

What other questions should I be asking and other information do I need in order to make a sound decision?

personalfinance,Mom (64/F) retires this year and has a lot of questions. Can anyone help?,"Hi guys, my mom could really use some help. She's about to retire later this year (turning 65 on December 1st) and she keeps asking me a lot of questions about retirement since she thinks I can magically google them and help explain it to her. I've been googling things but I'm not sure what advice to trust and what's best with her particular situation. I'm not sure what information you guys need in order to help her so I'm just going to toss some numbers/assets out here and hopefully you can help her out?

**Current yearly income** (gross): $53,000

**Amount saved** (mixed btwn 1 savings and 1 checking account): $28,000

**401K** (a Merrill Edge and Vanguard account - but she just took all of the Vanguard out to consolidate into the ME account ""to simplify my life""): $820,000

**House** (completely paid off): worth about $170,000

**Car:** barely running '00 Ford Windstar that will probably need to be replaced in the next year

She's wondering:

* Do I have enough money to have a decent retirement life? I plan to not take full retirement until 66. (Note: we calculated and it looks like she can survive frugally the first year and then live on close to $43k a year at a 3% withdrawal rate, which is basically what she lives on now. I think she just wants someone other than me to validate that for her.)

* Was it a bad idea to put everything in the ME account? Should I have kept the Vanguard open? If so, is there a way to fix this?

* I have some savings bonds that are matured now. They were going to be for one of my two kids for college but she has decided not to attend. If I cash them, where should I put that money to get the best interest/return?

* I don't need $28k in my accounts with such low interest rates. How do I decide how much to take out and where should I put it for solid returns/interest rates?

* What taxable liability do I have taking out 3% on 401k? Should I be withholding about 15% for taxes or is that too much?

* Are there any resources I could read that can help me learn more about this before I take the plunge in the next 6 months?",finance
personalfinance,credit card debt and car help,"I currently have around 18K in cc debt and have a $620 monthly car payment. I just recently got promoted at my job and will now be making roughly around 4500~ a month. My car is a 650i BMW with around 43K miles on it. I've owned the car for about 1 and a half years already with about 29k left on the car. Some of my credit cards aren't charging interest yet as I'm still in the 0% APR rate but will start be charging me soon... I understand I need to be paying all my highest interest rate cards down first which should be around 7K the rest is still at 0%.. The 7K is split amongst probably 4-5 cards. I'm just looking for some general advice how to pay down that debt on my CC because when that one card with about 12K of cc debt goes out of the intro 0% I will be really screwed as I still haven't even taken down all my other debt yet. Some options I was thinking of would be:
1) sell the bmw but I am upside down in that car probably -$3000 dollars..  and maybe lease something cheaper around a 300 dollar payment a month?
2)take a personal loan that could charge me 25%+ interest of $20K to pay off all my cc debt.
3)take a loan off my 401k or make some ROTH IRA withdrawals to help me pay off some of this debt.. 

My credit score has taken a huge hit because of my credit utilization which would be at around 55% right now so its sitting at around a 645.. So I do not think I would get qualified for a balance transfer credit card, I've hit up a local credit union as well to see if I could apply for a personal loan but was declined for cc utilization and recent requests for credit..

I understand that if I keep up with my payments on my BMW at the end of the payments I will have all equity in the car and it might be the smartest way of doing it but the car is super unreliable and I have probably paid around 7000 dollars in repairs over the course of owning it so far. It is a 2014 650i V8 there has been engine problems with the car all the time and I have a third party warranty but it doesn't cover everything all the time which is hurting my wallet too.. If I should sell it, where should I sell it? I've gotten it appraised at the dealer which quoted me 25,000, and at carmax which would give around 28,000. Both of which would leave me upside down on the car.. My family is out of the country and I could drive their car which is an older SUV since they are not here so that is an option too..

investing,Independent mortgage companies get home loans for borrowers with weak credit or low incomes—and taxpayers back them,"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-05-24/small-time-bankers-make-millions-peddling-mortgages-to-the-poor

&gt; Taylor had recently filed for bankruptcy because of his $25,000 in credit card debt. But he just bought his first home for $120,000 with a zero-down loan from Christian’s company. Monthly debt payments now eat up half his take-home pay. “If he can help me, he can help anyone,” Taylor says. “My credit history was just horrible.”

&gt; Christian can do this kind of deal because he is, in effect, making the loan on behalf of the federal government through its most important affordable housing program. It’s a sweet deal: He gets his nearly risk-free commission. Taylor puts no money down. If things go south, the government ultimately bears the risk.

&gt; No one is saying the system is close to another collapse. Yet nonbanks, more loosely regulated than the JPMorgan Chases of the world, are bigger players today than during the last mortgage bubble, according to a Brookings Institution report. They’re making almost half of new loans, compared with 19 percent in 2007. As before, many are companies you’ve never heard of, like American Financial Network, a closely held firm based in Brea, Calif. A few are better-known, such as LoanDepot, Freedom Mortgage, and the industry leader, Quicken Loans, with its ubiquitous Rocket Mortgage television commercials.

&gt; Nonbank mortgages make up about 80 percent of the loans for borrowers insured by the U.S. government. 

&gt; To protect taxpayers, FHA borrowers are supposed to make small down payments, equal to 3.5 percent of the home’s purchase price. But many FHA borrowers put nothing down at all.

&gt; In civil fraud complaints, the Department of Justice has accused many companies, including Quicken and Freedom Mortgage, of improperly underwriting FHA loans and then filing claims for government insurance after borrowers defaulted.

&gt; There are other worrisome signs. Even in a strong economy, recent FHA loans are souring faster than those made years ago when the industry had stricter credit standards, the Mortgage Bankers Association says. About 9 percent are 30 days or more past due, manageable by historical standards and well below the high of 14 percent in 2009. But the FHA itself is concerned that, on average, borrowers are spending 43 percent of their income on debt payments, the highest level in at least two decades.

&gt; Last year the FHA’s capital reserves barely met the legal minimum the government must set aside for bad loans.

&gt; If too many loans sour, she says, the FHA could end up financially weakened and unable to extend help during the next downturn. “Borrowers are stretching more,” she says. “We’re concerned about it from a borrower perspective and a taxpayer perspective.”

&gt; One reason more borrowers may be stretching: Real estate prices are soaring again. Bidding wars are back in many cities. That’s only making it harder for first-time and lower-income borrowers... Homeownership has fallen from its 2004 peak of 69.2 percent to 64.2 percent in the first quarter. Rents are skyrocketing, too, pricing some families out of any shelter at all.",finance

personalfinance,Adjusting taxes to maximize my benefit considering the EV tax credit.,"Hello PF,

This year I will be getting a Tesla Model 3 and will be able to claim the federal EV tax credit on my tax return. However, recently I've increased my 401k contribution and am now realizing that my taxable income will likely fall under the minimum required to claim the full credit, so I'm trying to figure out exactly what to do to make sure I can get the most out of my situation. I believe my main choices are adjusting my 401k contribution, and adjusting my HSA contribution.

Notes:

The EV tax credit can't be rolled into another tax year.

My base pay will increase in August, I don't know how much, and I don't know what my 2018 wages will be exactly until I at least get my 3rd quarter bonus statement in November.

My employer doesn't do 401k matching, instead they do profit sharing, so it doesn't matter how much I put into it.

My HSA funds aren't invested and I have medical costs that will use a significant part of the (small) balance this year.

I have a (roth) IRA maxed out this year already, so I can't take advantage of IRA contributions.

As far as I can tell I can't retroactively change a 401k contribution or do it 'manually,' I can only contribute through payroll in this actual year.


Considering all that, I believe the best outcome is where I contribute enough to my HSA to cover my medical expenses exactly (including using the existing balance), contribute some amount to my 401k, and before credentialing the EV purchase end up with a federal tax due of exactly $7500.

To accomplish that as closely as possible I believe I will need to:

Estimate my total wages, medical costs, taxable interest / dividends / itemized deductions ahead of time.

Know everything that changed or is changing about federal tax for 2018.

After knowing the above, estimate how much I can put into my 401k and then adjust my contribution again, first soon, and then again in early December.

In January adjust my 401k and HSA contributions back to what I want for 2019 contributions.
 (my HR lady is going to hate me)

While doing my taxes, make a final HSA contribution for 2018 (if necessary) such that 1040 line 47 (tax) equals line 55 (credits, including EV and foreign tax paid).

Any thoughts? Am I going about this the right way or did I miss anything, or is there an easier or more concrete way to accomplish this? Anything specific I should know about 2018 tax law changes? This is easily the most complicated tax game I've ever played.

Thanks.",finance
financialindependence,Starting road to FIRE! Advice on starting out?,"Hello all! I've been looking at this community for a bit and figured it was time to post finally. I'm starting my full time career in July and wanted some mentorship on the right moves to make to hopefully end up FI. 

So a bit of background is in order I suppose! I'm working in western MD (so lower COL) and starting out making 70k. Living with the parents for a year or so before they kick me out, then either renting or buying with my girlfriend.

Between scholarships, parents help, and internships I managed to get my degree debt free and start a decent savings account and make some investments in my parents real estate ventures. I also have 2 full years of contributions in ira's so far. 

All in all I think my net worth is around 80k right now, with about 10k in cash, 25k in real estate investment to hopefully cash out soon, and 10k in gold and silver coins gifted from family. 

I'm currently interested in more FI than early retirement since I haven't even started working my career yet. A few questions I have would be: 
What's a reasonable net worth I could expect by 40 or 50? Can I assume I can reach FI without a genius idea or lucrative side business? 

I currently have a savings account with a smaller local bank and want to explore online banks for a better interest rate, any suggestions on what to look at?

I want to start investing in the market (putting 10-20k in from coins or real estate investment to start soon, then based off salary later), should I do etfs, mutual funds, etc?

gaming,Halo hasnt been the same since Halo 3 and Halo 5 is a step in the right direction. Halo 6 could save the series if they build off of Halo 5,"I hope Halo 6 is the title that brings everyone back.  The entire series went to shit after halo 3, well at least the competitive scene and online did.  

I played Reach but didnt like it because of the loadouts and loss of a true ranking system based on skill.  Ranking up this game required playtime and not skill.  It was an XP system and eventually you will hit whatever rank you wanted if you just played enough.  They also added armor abilities that you were able to choose from with the loadouts and this took away a lot of competitveness.

Then Halo 4 came out so I thought I would try it because I was hoping they changed backed to what Halo 3 was like.  Instead, they went in the complete opposite direction.  Not only were there still loadouts and armor abilities, but now you were able to customize them.  They also added armor mods, which are basically perks, and the ability to call ordnances.  And they kept the XP based ranking system and still didnt bring back the competitive ranking system.

Then my saving grace was coming in The Master Chief Collection.  They were bringing back Halos 1-4, even though it was the 1-3 anyone cared about.  The ranking systems and online multiplayer were coming back and we were finally going to have a competitive Halo game again.  When released though, the game wasnt finished and was unplayable.  The game quickly became a dead game and by the time they fixed it, it was too late.

After the big disappointments from Halo Reach, Halo 4, and the MCC, I was fed up with the series and wasnt going to buy another game again.  I havent played a Halo game since 2014 and recently tried out Halo 5.

Companies nowadays have a problem with releasing incomplete games with a lack of content and no end game.  They then finish the games after theyre released and expect us to pay again for the extra content that should have been there on release.  So I would always find myself comparing every single game I played to Halo 3.  It was the definition of a complete game. Campaign, ranked/social playlists, forge mode, it had everything and it gave us the ability to create and share our own content.  This is when I thought I would give Halo 5 a try.

Halo 5, in its current state, is a HUGE step in the right direction.  Halo 5 is a truly complete game and that is something we dont see nowadays.  They FINALLY brought back a competitive ranking system.  They booted the loadouts and everyone has the same armor abilites, which are minor and were necessary for it to evolve.  It has everything Halo 3 had and then they added Warzone to it and a Custom Games Browser so you could join any custom game you want.  Being an old school Halo player, I find that the online multiplayer of Halo 5 feels a lot like Halo 3.  Everyone spawns with the same weapons and abilites and have to fight for the power weapons.

Halo 6 needs to be a big hit to save the series. They need build off of Halo 5 and not Reach or Halo 4. They have to make the ranking system more of a grind with less resets.  They could put more maps in the rotation and the ability to choose from 2 maps and a chance to veto to a different map.  They could maybe take out the hover and ground pound abilities but the others are fine aditions.  I would love to see more unlockable armor through achievements.  With gamers annoyed about how games lack content, a complete Halo game should save it.

What do you guys want to see in Halo 6 and what do you expect them to have in it?

TL:DR
Halo Reach was a step in the wrong direction by basically making Halo into a CoD game and removing competitive ranks while adding loadouts and armor abilites.  Halo 4 added onto Reach by making loadouts customizable and adding perks. The Halo MCC was unfinished and unplayable.  All these disappointments ruined the series name and scared me from buying another Halo game.  After being fed up with the lack of depth and content from other games I decided to try Halo 5.  It actually ended up being a great game that felt like Halo 3 and was a step in the right direction.  I hope Halo 6 will build off of Halo 5 and save the series.",technology

Home maintenance (covers repairs/potential vacant rental unit months/etc): $9k

~6 months Emergency: $25k

Leftover Cash: $97k


30 year mortgage @ 4.375 on (investment) house; no other debt

Background:

- recently acquired a multi family in a hot market that I will live in and rent out the other unit.  Plan to acquire a ""forever home"" in &lt;5 years and potentially keep the investment property depending on the market at that time

- I anticipate having a wedding in &lt;5 years but not within the next year (hence the 12 mo CD) - would not like to spend more than $20k, ideally under $10k

I have about $97k of extra cash to do something with.  Questions - 

1.  I am thinking of keeping $50k of that in the HY savings for a ""New Home Purchase"", as I plan to use it to purchase another house in &lt;5 years - is there somewhere else I should be putting this?  I feel like I'll be holding on to too much cash for various savings needs, but common advice says if you need the cash in &lt;5 years put it into HY Savings

2. The remaining $47k I am thinking of just potentially putting into FSTVX.

I'm having difficulty deciding if I should just sell out my entire FSTVX position and buy into an ETF (ITOT)

personalfinance,In-laws want to pay my debt,"Here we have an interesting situation.  I just got engaged to a wonderful woman whom I met in dental school. We just graduated and are starting our residency. 

Her family is quite wealthy. Apparently they are “freaked out” about the amount of debt I have from school and the interest that is accruing. Thanks to my lovely fiancé for even telling them my loan amounts. 

They want to have a meeting to discuss this on Thursday- a proposition to pay off all my debt and draw up a loan with them at an interest rate of 2% or something instead of the 6% it is now. 

Part of this is because their daughter has no debt. Part of it is because they want us to take over the family dental practice (buy them out) in a few years and so we won’t get denied a loan. 
Part of it genuinely is them wanting to help us not be in such a big hole. 

The thing is, I am very good with money and I really feel uncomfortable with this arrangement. Maybe some of you on here can help me decide.  This looks good on paper. But for obvious reasons I am hesitant with mixing finances with in-laws. Also I fear that I don’t really have a choice here and denying their proposition may result in rocking the boat before the wedding (that they are paying for).

personalfinance,Is there a way to transfer my student loans after I have graduated?,"So basically, when I was young my parents made a goal to save $100k for me to pay for my out of state schooling for 4 years as they assumed the price would be around 25k a year. As it turns out it was a lot more expensive but they are very good with their finances and had money to pay for the rest of my college with the premise that anything over the 100k would end up being a personal loan from them with about a 5&amp;#37; interest rate. So I just graduated in May and ended up owing them somewhere around 35k which I don’t have to start paying off until I start my job. I recently got a job offer that starts later in the year at around 65k before taxes but, a huge benefit at my company is that they will pay $2000 of my student loans each year up to $10k. the problem is that I don’t think that my student loans, which are just a personal loan from my parents, qualify for this program since they are not even on record anywhere at a bank or anything. So my question is basically, is there any way I can do something along the lines of taking out a student loan of 10k after I have graduated without going back to school, giving that 10k loan to my parents to pay down that debt, and then having my company pay off the loan to the bank that would now qualify for their program?",finance

Nothing fancy, not even sure what ""deals"" I get from them or interest rates or etc, given I've had it for so long and haven't made a single change to the details of the account since it was opened.

What I know: I have a checking account that links to a way2save account \(that I basically use as my savings account. I transfer money from checking into there for emergencies, \~5\-6k\) and a credit ""platinum card"" account.

Basically I use it as a hub for my money and that's it:

Debit\- direct deposits from my work, automatic pay for car insurance/phone/etc \(the basics\), school loans, apartment rent, etc. I use 99.9&amp;#37; of my spendings/pay bills this way.

I'm 25, have a pretty good job that pays well, have student loans that I pay off each month without difficulty, can manage my other bills \(apartment, electric, car insurance, phone...\) well, and have excellent credit.

My question is this: where do I go from here? Is it okay to just remain with these cards? As stupid as it sounds, I feel less of an 'adult' by being so minimally knowledgeable about this and I want to change that. I know there are credit unions and travel cards and etc, but it feels overwhelming to think about opening another card.. though I know I can probably be getting more out of a bank than what WF likely provides me \(which is nothing in my eyes?\).

My husband bought our first home because I didn't make enough when we first purchased it, so I am a first time homebuyer. I assume unless it's just me buying this house, there are no deals but it never hurts to reach out and ask more questions. We've also considered a USDA loan, but we make $3000+ over the maximum required for that type of loan. Any ideas? Is there something I'm not considering?

Edit: We live in Kansas City, MO where housing is very affordable, as is everything else. We don't plan to live beyond our means. Looking for a 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom that can range from $80,000 to $175,000. Everything else is just a perk. We don't plan to move for a year.",finance
MachineLearning,"[P] How should I approach a binary classification task for time series (x,y positional data), using deep learning?","So I have a sequence of positions on a 2D screen, representing where a participant is looking on a screen.

My current approach is to build rolling features (over the past 5 seconds) of the data, which look like this:

    {variance of position, average speed, variance of speed, time spent in fixations, variance of fixations}

(fixations are just low-velocity sequences of the eye position).

There exists such a feature vector for every timestamp in the recording, and there is a label 0 or 1 associated. (stressed/not stressed).

This is a standard supervised learning task, which can be fed into an SVM giving ~70% accuracy. I'm struggling to understand what the input vectors look like for an LSTM/ other deep learning approach - is it still the same kind of feature vector one would use?
Or could I also try feeding in the instantaneous x,y coordinates and expect it to extract the relationships?

I'm happy with my traditional ML classifiers such as SVM, trying to apply deep learning to achieve this same task!",technology
personalfinance,Need some advice on optimizing my fiances/deciding the best route.,"As of May, I am officially one year out of College, living with my folks while my girlfriend finishes grad school. I am looking to better optimize my finances and decide whether I can start thinking about moving out. 

Currently, my salary is 62K/year before taxes and before quarterly bonuses &amp; overtime pay. 

My living expenses are cheap since my parents don't charge me rent, but to help out I do pay the household cell phone bill each month. It's ~$240 a month. I am not exactly in a rush to move out since this allows me to save/pay more loans, but I am getting a bit closer to wanting to do that. Rent prices in the tri-state are intimidating though!

I have a car payment that is $300/month, and I have my student loans. One is 15k @3%, the other is 50K @8%. I've been trying to aggressively pay down the 50K loan, but if I paid the minimums it would be about $400/month. I typically take any bonuses from work and drop that lump sum on the highest interest rate.

I have no credit card debt since I always pay off monthly, and my credit is in great shape. I currently have 15K in my savings and ~2k in my stock portfolio. 


I have been trying to look into consolidation of my loans as I would love to get that interest rate down as low as possible. I've also been thinking about taking 10K of my savings and putting it in a money market account to earn some more interest. Are there any other optimizations I can make to help keep my money on the right track? Am I on the right track to possibly move out within 1/1.5 years?",finance
XRP,2 reasons I think another credit crunch / recession could accelerate xrp adoption,"The credit crunch of 2008 was in large part due to uncertainty as to which banks were critically exposed to bad debts and therefore banks were reluctant to extend credit etc ( the current process of cross border settlement is a form of credit extension as there is trust involved ) Xrapid with atomic swaps (all the money moves or none of it moves) removes this need to extend trust / provide credit. Central Banks had to pull out all the stops in 2008 to try keep funds flowing and provide confidence to the banking sector to keep working with each other. Xrapid facilitating capital flows that may otherwise slow down or cease would have a positive effect on Central Bank monetary policy effectiveness. Ripple working with 40 - 50 banks......

Secondly given the changes in Basel rules funds sitting in Nostro Vostro (ours and yours) can no longer be counted towards capital reserve requirements (the level of actual cash that needs to be held by banks) thus a recession and credit drying up would further incentivise banks to adopt Xrapid freeing up these dead funds to either meet their reserve requirements or stimulate the economy as incentivised by the Central Banks either by carrot or stick. A further thought is that when Xcurrent and Xrapid reach a tipping point you may see banks particularly in a time of economic uncertainty only doing business with banks that use Xcurrent and Xrapid further accelerating global adoption.",cryptocurrency

I am getting married in 26 days and my fiancé’s house is a bit bigger and better equipped for a growing family.  We listed my house 2 months ago for 279,900. Right off the bat we got an offer for 274,000. We talked them up to 275,000 and accepted the offer. Two days later they’ve backed out, saying they were going with new construction instead. We have had 8 offers on the house and have accepted 6.  All of the buyers backed out within 24 hours. Some have given reasons for backing out such as they found out they were relocating the next day or They found out their interest rates would be 8%.

This past Saturday we accepted an all cash offer of 267 and said she could close in 12 days.  This woman had previously offered 240 and we told her no. We accepted the offer of 267 on Saturday. Sunday morning, our realtor called us and said the woman backed out because she was driving Through the neighbor hood and saw a do not dig sign placed there because of a high pressure gas line. Apparently this freaked her out and she backed out.  We lowered our asking price to 269,900, but I’m not sure that was the right thing to do since we have had no trouble getting offers at the higher price.

We are not in financial trouble and can afford to make mortgage payments on both houses, but would obviously rather only have one house. We have considered renting but due to the strict hoa rules have decided that it’s not a great option with this house.

Does anyone know what the issue is here?  Any advice?  Do we need a new realtor?

personalfinance,Best way to payoff student debt AND have enough for house downpayment,"Good evening Personalfiance!

Throwaway for anonymity.

I just graduated medical school and will have my first job in a long time this July as a resident physician. I am starting to plan how best to pay off my student loans as I will leave my loan forbearance August 7th.  I have read the wiki \+ flowchart and have followed it as best as I could\-\- I budgeted, currently hold emergency funds, savings, retirement and no credit card debt. However, when it comes to all the possible ways to pay this ""monster"" off it leaves me brain dead. I want to pay this off as efficiently as possible. I have previously used the ""snowball method"" on a few of these loans by paying off the most expensive interest rates first. These loans were also the highest balance however. 

Currently my total debt is $273,503.09 with $16,329.98 in unpaid interest. On august first as I understand it my interest will become part of my principle balance making my debt a total of $289,833.07. 

My salary will be about $50k before taxes for my first year and I am expected to get a $2k raise a year for 5 years.  After that the starting salary for my field is $220k. My wife is a teacher and while currently employed we will be moving to a new town and searching for a new job. She is expecting to make around the same salary as me. Our rent will be $1000/month not including utilities for a 1 bedroom apartment.

In total we have about $40,000 in savings and dream accounts, $15,000 in retirement accounts, $17000 in checking account. We have been hesitant to empty our accounts to pay off these loans because we would like to put a down payment on a house in the next year \(although I have heard about a Doctor's mortgage which does not require a down payment.\) 

My debt is split into 9 federal loans: 5 direct unsubsidized Stafford loans and 4 direct student plus loans.

My list of loans are: 

1. Balance: $21,689.58, unpaid interest $397.55, interest rate: 5.31&amp;#37;

Bought a house, remodeled the basement and added 4 rooms and a bathroom. It is now a 7 bedroom/3 bathroom house, renting out all 7 rooms making an average of $6000 per month (netting an average of $3200 after mortgage/utilities).
 
However in the process, we spent roughly 90k due to issues with the city we kept running into regarding safety codes, plumbing, electrical, etc.
 
I had spent 40k of my own money and savings, but about 50k is still owed between a HELOC (variable interest rate which keeps going up) and three high interest credit cards. We spend about $1,100 a month on these credit lines and I do feel these will take a while to pay off considering the interest.
 
Current mortgage: $2,050 (330k loan)
Total Credit card monthly payments: $1,100
Two Car Payments: $900 ($300/$600)
 
New Mortgage: $3,200 (470k loan, 85% LTV since the home appraised at 550k)
This pays off all my debt (50k) including my vehicles (36k and 16k).
 
This saves me $800 a month, but I lose the option of paying down my other debt early if I wanted to and makes my mortgage significantly higher.

personalfinance,Thoughts on a signature loan or short term loan when considering purchasing a home,"Hi everyone! You guys have been a great source to learn more about personal finance and I have tried to find threads with similar questions to mine but no such luck 

Long story short, my husband and I got new jobs in a new state but they couldn’t fund both positions (we work at a university) at the same time. They hired me in February and he will get hired on in July. I now make 53,000 a year and he will make 40,000 a year starting July 1st. We have been living on my income solely while he has stayed home and watched our daughter. It has been really tight and we have had to put a lot of our credit cards as well as rely on a lot of family help (in the form of personal loans) to make it through. 

We currently have $5,500 (ccs are all completely maxed out) in cc debt and $4,000 in personal loan debt(to our parents.)  We also have a car payment and we owe about $12,000 on our car and some small medical debt for around $5,000 (it should be noted these have been sent to collections due to us not being able to pay on them over the last few years because we only made $37,000 a year total) 

With my husband starting on his salary in July we will be making a lot more money than we ever have and we would really like to be financially responsible and actually start saving for retirement, college etc. We qualify for a first time home buyers loan and would love to buy a home within the next year or two. We live in an area that to qualify for the FHA loan the home needs to be valued under $300,000 according to the county we live in. We could purchase a home for about $10,000 down and we live in an area that you can get a nice home for under $300,00. 

However, we are both rehabbing our credit and both scores are in the low 600’s/ high 500’s. Our interest rate on all of our credit cards is about 25%. Our thought is to get a personal signature loan for $10,000 and pay off our credit card debt and debt to our parents. The incentive behind this would be to restructure the debt and get a lower interest rate and to help our credit. We are unclear if this will impact our ability to get a mortgage in a year or two. I know this will up our credit to debt ratio on paper but we won’t be able to start saving for at least a year because we plan on throwing a lot of money at our cc debt if we don’t get the loan. We just hate being renters and would like to actually start investing in our home and paying our own mortgage. 

What do you guys suggest? Suck it up and just be in the current state of debt for a year and not start actually rehabbing our credit for a year or so and then save to buy a house delaying the process 

Or get the signature loan and get our credit scores up and people paid back in our life and save for a house so we can purchase a home next year? Will a personal loan really affect our ability to get a mortgage? 

We never even dreamed of owning a home and now that it’s a real possibility we want to make sure we don’t screw it up by getting a loan now to help with our current situation

personalfinance,Using 100k USD to pay down mortgage or invest in index funds (no other debts),"Hi, throwaway for this one. I understand many people have serious financial problems so I hope I don't stir up any pitchforks for asking the following: I am seeking advice for how to allocate 100k USD of cash that I have saved up over the last 7 years. 
Yes, I have read the wikis but did not think they covered this specific topic.



Background info:

* Personal info: Age 34, not married and no plans for marriage but partner with similar financial situation, no children or plans for children. 
* Location: Euro-zone (pension scheme taken out of salary automatically)
* Job status: equivalent to tenure, ie. permanent contract with little to no chance for termination.
* Savings per year (from salary only, after holidays, all costs and luxury items) : 25-30k USD
* Other assets: 30k in collectors items which I am holding purely as investments and have grown 100% in 2 years. Current market is very strong. 
* Debt: Mortgage only. No student loans, credit card, car, etc.
* 2 year plan: no significant expenses related to home or family.
* Longer term plan: I conservatively may need 30k within the next 4 years to pay down a larger home. 



Options :

1) Pay down a large part of my mortgage (190k USD currently left of original 240k USD)

2) Index funds: just started with this and have 4k USD invested

3) Savings account: 1,5% interest rate


My concerns regarding the options are:


1) Opportunity cost; missing out on investing in index funds. The US and Euro markets are at an all time high with the longest lasting bull market still going strong without a significant correction (according to my research). So, I could pay down a large part of my mortgage and start monthly investments (from salary) in index funds from now to spread the risk and not worry about losing a large percentage of current savings if there is a repeat of 2008 financial crisis next month. I already set up an automated payment to invest 1k USD per month from my salary and I manually transfer whatever is left in my account to index funds when the next payslip comes in.

2) How much of my current assets to allocate in the short term? If I decided to invest e.g. 80k in index funds, it seems risky to put it all in in one go so how should I split it, e.g. spread it over 8 months with 10k per month?

3) Reading up on different types of portfolios I would put myself as conservative and like to have some cash available. Currently I am thinking of 10k as an emergency fund and 10k as cash if I want to make an unnecessary expense or trip.


Any advice, recommended reading, or other options would be appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,Refinance credit cards with lower interest student loans a good idea?,"Hello all,

I've got a question for you. To me it seems like a ""good idea"", but I've been bitten by my own ""good ideas"" before so I'd like a second opinion.

Basically what I want to do is use federal student loans (at a 5-6% interest rate, somewhere in there) to pay down my credit cards, and then take a personal loan (at a 12-14% interest rate) to pay off the rest of the credit cards. Each of the cards has an interest rate higher than 16%.

I've got a good job, and start back to school next month for a master's degree. My house and land are paid off, two of the three vehicles are paid off (the third has a 2.99% interest rate, no worries there), and the credit card payments aren't a huge problem even if I don't basically refinance them with other loans.

I just really want to get lower interest rates. Again, to me it seems like a good idea, but I definitely want to know your opinions and any possible drawbacks before I pull the trigger. Reading through this sub has really opened my eyes on some financial options I had not considered before (my job has an HSA-once the cards are paid off, it's getting maxed out, for instance).

Feel free to ask any other info that might be useful in giving me some advice.

personalfinance,How to handle summer stipend (taxes and possible loan payment)?,"I am 19 years old and am currently apart of a research program for my university and wanted to see if i can could get any advice on how to handle the income I will be receiving. I will try to go into as much detail as I feel comfortable sharing and can. Before I state facts I would like to add background information that could possible help discussion or advice I may receive. The program has been very clear to let us know that we will be receiving our payment not as employees of the university but as grant recipients \(I think those were the exact words but can get clarification if needed\). Likewise, they were also clear that we will not be receiving any help with taxes \(forms etc.\) from them and we should handle it ourselves. I have 0 knowledge of taxes \(and don't want to screw up\) and have done some googling but this community seems to have positive input when it comes to newbies so I was hoping to get some help. This research program offered us on dorm housing \(which they said was nontaxable\), a stipend, and meal allowance 

I have no outstanding bills or due payments, I have a car that is very low maintenance and hardly drive so gas is very minimal. I do need to pay back some personal debts \(around 800\) with family members. That aside, I did take out 2 federal loans for my first year of college  \(one subsidized and one subsidized\). [LOANS](https://imgur.com/a/gGQlty4)

The research program is paying me a stipend of $5000 and $1200 meal allowance. The meal allowance is split between $380 of basically ""university cash"" and the other portion of it is actual money \(if that changes anything\). 

Additional information: My future schooling situation has allowed me to continue until graduation \(2021 or 2022\) without needing any more loans. So basically the current student loans are all I will need to take out until I graduate. I am majoring in EECE so job outlook is not too bad. 

Assuming I eat a lot and actually use the 1200 for food, I am left with 4200 which is enough to pay off one entire loan and some of the other. 

My actual clear questions.

Do I need to pay taxes on my income? If so, on what portion of it \(stipend and/or meal allowance\)? How do I calculate it? What forms will I need to fill out? When do these forms and payment need to be made? 

With whatever money I have left, I would assume that paying my unsub loan would be the first loan I would want to pay back asap. Is this correct? 

Should I pay back both loans entirely if I have the money? Or should I leave the sub loan and wait to pay it after I graduate.",finance
personalfinance,How should I save up money for $150K MBA program?,"Hi there,

Just a heads up - it's a long post...

I am a 26 yr old male working full time and have seriously been thinking about going back to school for a MBA. I haven't applied, but taken a first few steps by looking into different programs and taking GMAT. I am only particularly looking into part-time programs, as the current job that I have is well-paying and I enjoy doing my job. The reasons I want to go get a part-time MBA are (1) it will help advance my career much faster within my company, (2) it will give me opportunities to other jobs if I ever decide to leave the company in the future, and (3) I also can't justify giving up a well paying job to go full time, which will incur me almost $200K in debt, plus the two years of wage. 

As mentioned above, I haven't applied or been accepted into any programs yet at this point. but I want to plan ahead and be ready for the cost of MBA if I ever do get in (let it be in a year or two). This way, I want to have enough savings to help me pay tuition, while working full time during the program to help pay as well. The goal here is I want to try my best not to use my stocks (outlined below) to cover my tuition.

Below is my current financial situation &amp; plan

Pay structure:

1. $80K base salary (expected to rise ~2-3% a year. Salary usually goes up 16-17% if I get promoted and promotion usually takes anywhere from 18 months - 36 months)

2. ~$200K in stock compensation that will vest in the next 36 months. 

3. ~$6K additional annual income from rental property that I own 

Savings:

1. ~$30K in 401K - I am not going to touch this and will continue to put in 10% of my income to 401K

2. ~$28K in stocks that I trade on Robinhood (YTD, made about $1.8K) - I can liquidate this to cover my tuition if needed.

3. ~$10K in savings account for emergency fund. - I do not want to touch this as well.

Cost of attending:

1. $40~$45K annual tuition

2. $5K - $10K in annual travel expenses (if I do weekend MBA, it will require me to fly every weekend with lodging and uber, etc)

3. $2-3K in annual school supplies, including books

Plans:

1. Save $2.5K a month for the next 12-24 months (currently saving about $1.5K a month). This will get me up to ~$30K to $60K in total savings before going into school. 

2. While working full time, I should still be able to save $1-$1.5K which I can put towards my tuition. 

In net, I will probably still need close to as little as $50K or as high as $100K to cover the cost, as my company does not cover any tuition. 

So questions here

1. Will this $150K MBA be worth it? (I am applying Chicago Booth, Berkeley Haas, and Northwestern Kellogg) - I think it's worth the cost if I can get it from any of these three schools, but want to hear your opinions.

2. Looks like there is no subsidized loans for federal loans. Do you happen to know any subsidized federal loans for graduate school? 

3. Do you have any other feedback on how to plan for the cost?",finance
personalfinance,"Wife and I applied for a Mortgage Loan, and it’s been an absolute nightmare. Any advice helps.","My wife and I started looking for a home back in late March, and we’ve since applied and shopped our loan at a couple of Lenders as was advised to us. In mid-April we got pre approved for a Mortgage loan on house valued at 260K, with a roughly 4.8 Interesr Rate. Our credit has never had any issues and our FICO ranges from the mid to high 700s.



At least, that was all true until today.



We recently found a beautiful townhome and we decided to move forward on it, there was strong incentive to go through their lender (Closing Costs covered) so we applied for pre approval with them, no biggie, we figured we’d see how competitve the rate was and if it was worth it, we would move forward. After all we had visited two lenders before choosing this property and the rates were similar.  



This is where it all fell apart. 



The Lender called me today and she informed me that everything looked good, that we were pre-qualified and that we could move forward, but that the only thing that prevented us from getting a better rate and a lower Mortgage Insurance Premium was my wife’s credit, as her FICO was really low. ‘Weird”, I thought, since the last two lenders made it abundantly clear that my wife’s FICO was better than mine. I relayed this info to the Lender and she said that the reason why her FICO was low was because she had a Collections open for Medical Expenses, that they ignore those because their medical but that the interest rate and insurance premium would be higher because her FICO was low. I was confused as to how my wife would have a bill in collections considering we hadn’t received anything in the mail or even a phone call asking about the bill in question. She said she would talk to a credir advisor and see what could be done, but that at the moment, the interest rate would now go from 4.8 to 5.2. Needless to say I was upset for a lot of reasons, but just wanted to get to the bottom of everything.



I talked to my wife and she didn’t have any idea who or what the bill was regarding. Our lender gave us the Collection agency’s info so we called them to find out more. The Collection Agency told us over the phone that the original  bill was sent out in August of 2017 and after no response  they sent it to collection batch. She mentioned  that there was no number on file and the street address didn’t have our Unit number on it so there was no way we would know about it. She gave us the address to the clinic that billed out the expense (totalling $309) and it was a Medical Center for Women’s fertility and Cancer research. Neither of which currently pertain to my wife, and she never assisted the facility in question. The rep on the phone gave me an address to the collection agency and said that if we went in and paid the debt in cash that they would provide a letter to remove it from our credit report at the start of July. 



So now We’re in a nightmare, as the Unit we’re purchasing will be complete in August, and I have to pay $2,000 in earnest money to hold it, but now I have to deal with either attempting to Dispute the Charge, which could take months, or paying the debt and see if the collection agency will remove it from our report. I’ve looked up the agency and they do not seem trustworthy at all, and everything I’ve google today has indicated that whatever happens must be in writing or the agency may take the money and still not remove it off if my wife’s credit. The timing just sucks because this is literally the worst time and thing that could happen to as just as we’re close to getting our home. I’m feeling frustrated and nervous at the same time because I’m certain there is no immediate/quick solution to this. My wife went from having a 760 FICO to a 648 in the course of a month because of this place, and now we’re afraid we’re going to miss out on this home because the Insurance Premium and Interest Rate will make the rent unaffordable.  We live in Arizona and We’re first time buyers and have never had to deal with collection agencies, and I’m beyond frustrated. Does anyone out there have any advice or know if there is a viable solution to our problem? I feel like there *has* to be something we can do, it can’t end like this.  Thanks everyone.



TL;DR. Applied for Mortgage Loan under impression it would be no different than recent prior attempts, then possibly erroneous/fraduelent collection charge shows up and tanks wife’s score, Interest and Insurance Premiums went up, closing is 2 months away.",finance

personalfinance,Paying off the flat really aggressively,"Hi,
we decided to pay off our flat really aggressively. My SO and I bought a flat in 2015. We pay off ca. 1100€/month, that's about 4% of the initial loan per year. Additionally we pay another 10500€ per year as an extra repayment of the loan, that's another 5% of the initial loan. We have a fixed interest rate of 2.37% for 20 years (until up to 2035). We will probably be debt free in 2026.

On the other hand, we only save 160€/month by investing into an ETF fund (120€ MSCI World, 40€ MSCI World Emerging Markets).

Our reasoning is:

* I've got tenure as a teacher in Germany. We will stay here, in our own flat.

* I'll have a pension of probably around 1800€ in today's money, when I retire. No need to pay into a pension fund for that.

* My SO will have a pension of (hopefully) around 1500€/month.

* The interest is really low and investing more money/paying off the loan more slowly would probably make more sense, but we are not comfortable with taking risks as long as we are in debt.

* I intend to invest more into ETF-Funds, once we have paid off the flat. I would really like to have 100,000 - 200,000 in addition to our pensions, that pay us some interest. I'll see if I can persuade my SO to invest more aggressively, once the flat is paid off.

How mad do you consider us to be for taking hardly any risks and paying off the loan, instead?",finance
personalfinance,Helping my mom with her student loan,"Hey everyone, I've made a throwaway to seek out some help with my mom's student debt. Here's a little background. Unfortunately for my entire life (I'm in my late 20's) my mother has been pretty awful with her personal finances and has always had difficulty holding down a job for various reasons I won't go into. She's now in retirement age and has no savings, collects social security worth about half her rent, is on food stamps, and luckily has subsidized housing. She doesn't need to work much to continue supporting herself and her health is relatively good. 

A few weeks ago she came to me asking for help sorting out a federal student loan she took over 20 years ago to attend what sounded like a scammy for-profit course to learn to become a flight attendant (the course, as expected, never got her a job). From what I understand, she never paid a cent back of the loan (whose principle I believe was about $6000), and went into default years ago. The debt is huge now and worth more than double the principle. I apologize for not having the precise information as my mother is not a very put together person so I've been gathering what I can from her.

From what it looks like, the best option for her is likely an income driven repayment plan. Here's the link to the website I was consulting: https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/understand/plans/income-driven

As of right now she does not have a permanent job and my concern is that even when she gets one she may lose it quickly and will have trouble keeping up with paying her loan repayment on time/updating her current income. The upshot, from what I understand, is that if she is out of work her repayment plan could be quite low or be nothing.

I understand this is a lot of information so let me just clarify what I need help with. First, what do you all recommend is best for my mother to get this debt off her shoulders? Second, what do you recommend I do to help in a way that ensures she's regularly up to date with her debt? As of right now she gets a ton of spam calls with people offering to aid her with the issue but some quick searches reveal that they're not needed or are scams, so I've actively told her to ignore those calls.

Here is the information I have so far:

1. The federal loan was originally $6000
2. It was through Bank of America
3. It was taken out 20+ years ago and payments were never made
4. The amount owed is more than double the principle at this point
5. She's a senior citizen, and on all the federal aid programs I know of
6. She's unemployed but actively works odd jobs and is in the process of applying for more permanent labor. However, due to not so great aspects of her personality and the line of work she regularly seeks permanent employment in (cooking/maid) she never has held down a job for more than three years. I'm in the process of getting her a job for the city designed for people like her, so hopefully that helps but I know her and I'm not sure how far that will take her.
7. As far as I know she has no other debt.
8. I've offered politely and uncritically to help manage a savings account for her, but I'm focusing right now on getting this loan sorted and getting her a job.
9. She's located in California.

I apologize if I haven't done enough research or have not provided enough information. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",finance

CryptoCurrency,Will the US pay it's debts?,"The long term picture for the US debt doesn’t look so blooming, spending minus taxes known as the deficit is at record highs after years of wars in the middle east,central Asia and even in the African nation of [Niger](http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/10/27/the-real-reason-u-s-troops-are-in-niger/), all this foreign policy adventurism joins an expanding US health care and social security expenditure. Every year this deficit joins the larger debt.

Adding to the debt are the unfunded liabilities which are the payments the US promised to make to its own citizens 

What complicates the issue is that the US,unlike other nations,only owes money in terms of it’s own national currency,the dollar,which since at least the 1970’s during the Vietnam war has ceased to be backed by gold as a tangible asset 

Broadly speaking,the dollar is most commonly created when the us treasury issues a new debt bond which is then converted by the US fed to money in the government’s account,then,based on that banks create the loans given to the public.

An interesting case study is the US relation to the Marshall islands where the US experimented with atomic weapons,since the islands went in to the free association agreement with the US in 1986 the islands use the dollar as their currency, apart of the US navy base there ,part of the agreement is that the US gives aid to the country,which is about to be cut in half in 2023.with the current state of things in the US it is not at all clear that it will be able to meet its obligations this far out into the future,so the Marshall islands are going crypto,with a new currency to be used as legal tender alongside the US dollar,this is intended to bring the islands more liquidity and investment by riding the crypto trend,like Puerto Rico,that with favorable legislation became a colony for the crypto\-rich,the Marshall does intend to fine tune its regulations to make this initial money offering attractive and make the Marshall islands open for business thus maximizing the advantages and minimizing the disadvantages of this tectonic move in the regulatory environment.

The full implications of this still remains to be seen,but what is certain is that it will be interesting",cryptocurrency

My father passed away almost 2 months ago and he left money for my brother and I.  I've paid off my student loan and put $10k into a savings account for my child.  How do I go about investing the rest?

If I were to keep the remainder of the funds from life insurance in the account it's in currently, it sits at an interest rate of around 1.85%.  Are there better options?  Should my wife and I invest the money for my son a different way than a savings account?  Not sure what the interest rate is for the savings account off hand.

More info:

-About $65k left in life insurance which sits at 1.85%

-Income: ~$105k per year between my wife and I

-Expenses: $1950/month for mortgage, $350/month utilities, we don't tend to go out often and bring lunches to work.  Our cars are both paid off.

-We have around $25k sitting in a savings account (not counting our son's savings account)

-Both my wife and I have Roth IRA accounts we contribute to as well as 401Ks through work.  Don't know numbers off hand currently.

We obviously don't want to start spending the money on things we don't need.  I'd rather sit on it somewhere (CD, savings account, etc) and only dip into it when needed.  I'd rather burn through our savings first than to start dipping into the remainder of what's left in life insurance.",finance
personalfinance,My student loan processor doesn't let me make additional payments to principal. What payoff scenario would be best?,"Okay so I have the majority of my loans through FAFSA via fedloan servicing (3 @ 6.55%, 1 @ 4.41%, 1 @ 3.31%). They don't seem to allow you to make additional payments to principal (they just treat it as an extra payment, therefore you pay interest and principal). I do have 2 smaller loans with a bank (1 @ 5.08%, 1 @ 4.37%) that allow me to make additional payments fully to principal. I also have a truck loan @3.04%

Originally I was putting extra payments to my lowest balance loan that had 6.55%, using the avalanche method. But after seeing that almost half of my payment goes to interest, I'm wondering if it would be better to put my extra payments to the 5.08% bank loan first. Am I thinking about this correctly and does this seem to be the optimal method for paying off my loans? Thanks.

Edit: Thanks for all the responses everybody. It turns out, I have been paying directly to principal. I have been making additional payments for awhile so I technically have $0 due each month. I calculated the daily interest and that is being paid with the initial payment, the extra payment is applied at the same time and that is going fully to principal.

My confusion stemmed from an email from the support team where they told me they treat additional payments as if they were another monthly payment. She didn't specify that if you are ahead on payments, there is no interest calculation applied and I took it as they calculated future interest on the loan. Dumb oversight on my part.",finance

~$14k student loans (~$10k at 6.21% and ~$4k at 5.84%)

Should I:

a) just pay off the CC balance

b) put a chunk toward my student loan

c) keep making normal student loan payments, paying aggressively on the CC balance, and still try to buy a house soonish

d) some combination of the above

Once the promotional 0% financing ends, that’ll be high-interest debt, which is obviously to be avoided at all costs. On the other hand, I’m prefer not to have my student debt hanging over me for years. And on the other (third) hand, considering how crazy the housing market is, I feel like the longer I wait, the harder it will be to afford something decent.

personalfinance,Selling My House to Cover Student Loan Debt,"Hey Hey r/Personalfinance – I need some advice.

• I’m 30-years old, no retirement, small emergency fund, and married with 2 small kids. My SO is a stay-at-home parent as we have no help from family/relatives. I make around $45k currently and will likely be the sole income earner for the next few years.

• Currently in law school and I estimate my final Federal student loan balance will be just over $100k with an average of 6% interest. 

• Purchased a home over two years ago in an area that’s a now a hot market and I could basically sell the house now and pocket $100k. 

• I budget (YNAB) and I’ve used student.gov’s repayment calculator (which led me to write this post).


I’m inclined to sell the house and wipe out that enormous amount of debt so I can begin funding retirement options. Although I’m sure my income will rise after school, I would rather not bank on that. I’m also cognizant of the fact that the real estate market may look drastically different in a few years and would like to take advantage of it now. 


The advice I’ve received so far from family/co-workers is to keep the house, which seems to ignore the massive amount of interest I would pay back over the next decade. According to the student.gov calculator, interest adds an extra $30k over the repayment period. 


In closing, I’m unsure of what to do. Starting a new career with $0 owed in student loans sounds immensely appealing, but I’d be losing out on a house in a good area. 


Thanks for your help!


TL;DR – Selling my house could cover law school debt, but I’m not sure if I should do it. 

Edit 1: If we sell, we would stay with my in-laws for a month or two and then rent in the same area. Rental prices are more or less around where my mortgage payment is every month currently.

We currently live in house with three bedrooms but now with three kids it's beginning to get fairly tight. We were planning on listing our house this summer with the hopes to buy up in house but after running various ""house affordability"" calculators it really seems like a bad idea.

We'd obviously like to be in a good school district and buy a newer home and not buy a older home for the sake of space. But then there's the issue of actually affording it. From the potential profit on our current house and some savings we thought it would work to purchase a newer home with the bump in mortgage, but when factoring other monthly debt ($600 in cars, 2k in credit card which are always paid off) into the calculators it doesn't look to promising.

Normally I'd take this advice and just wait but I am concerned about a few things:

-Potential for interest rates to rise making a dent in potential savings -the housing market is very good now and may be able to get much more now for our current home

Logical side of me says to just wait, but then another side is saying to attempt to sell but buy up into a slightly newer house for space.

personalfinance,Can I take out a new lower interest loan to repay a higher interest student loan?,"I have a high interest student loan of like $20K at something crazy like 11.5% interest. Is it possible to get a new loan for the amount at a lower interest rate to pay this loan off in full?

I have made on time payments for over a year straight on the loan. 

I believe the original interest rate is high because I had no income at the time and needed a cosigner etc. (not sure what else would cause the rate to be high).

Seems likely this isnt possible but I figured I'd ask because seeing that interest rate is making me sick.",finance

personalfinance,Banking Advice,"So I currently belong to BoA for my main deposits/checking, and I also have an Amex high yield for savings.

I'm getting really fed up with BoA.  Been hit with several fees lately, and I'm pretty anti-big bank, especially now that Congress is making them unaccountable to consumers again.  

I was considering joining a Credit Union like Navy Federal (my father is a Veteran and I think can get me in), but the downside is I occasionally need to deposit cash and while I'm currently in the DC area now, I may move to NYC in the near future where I don't think they have any Navy Federal.

I also hear good things about Charles Schwab for checking.

personalfinance,Student loan - previous semester,"Not sure if this is the right thread, please let me know of there's a better Reddit! This looked like the best fit.

Question: can you apply for a private student loan after the semester ends? We need one for spring semester (2018) and due to ""life"" stuff, we didn't get the application in until late. We were trying not to use one but this semester but with his schedule and workload, income was limited. 

 
Backstory: My husband (43) has gone back to school part time to finish his degree. His job downsized and he was miserable anyway, so...here we are. We have a mortgage and one salary (at a non-profit). It's been an insane struggle this past year, barely making ends meet. Both of our cars died. My work changed. I was confused working 2 jobs to try and cover the costs but it's still not enough. He works whenever he can but taking classes chem and microbio 4 days a week cut into his availability. He's picked up some part time work but it's not consistent enough to pay the bills. We have Federal loans to pay for what we can. We are able to take out more to assist with room/board/housing. We were trying to hold off and find a way to make ends meet but it didn't happen. We tried to apply for a loan and financial aid office says they don't think Wells Fargo allows you to get a loan after the semester is over. We can't find it anywhere in fine print and some when know where to look.

Does anyone know the answer or where to start?

personalfinance,How to deal with student loans!,"Hello personal finance redditors, I am in need of some advice, 6 month ago I finally graduated college, and like most students I came out with loans on my name. Now my about before interest is 17000 dollars (not as much as some people but still a lot for me). I have it set on a 10 year standard plan that at the end would accrue 3500 dollars in interest.

I have been taking to people and I have 3 options that I am trying to simulate in my head and see which would be the best.

1. I have two cars, one is a old basic everyday car, not in the best condition but it works (worth nearly nothing, maybe upwards of 1000). My second car I bought 3 years ago and it has a resell value of around 19000 dollars. I realize going to a dealership and selling it would take out a grand or two, so lets stick with 17000. That would pay off the loan and I would never have to worry about the interest.
My issue is all thats left is a car that I'm not sure how long it will last.

2. Try to pay off the loans as much as I can as soon as I can. I have a few grand in my savings for emergencies, and I don't really want to use that for this. If I really make it stretch in my lifestyle, I can place up to 500 bucks a month on the loans, this will leave me with bare minimum, and if I actually continue that it will be done (with interest) in just about 3-4 years, but the problem is that my girl and I are trying to save for a house and to start a family, and me just dumping money into the loans won't be helping with that.

3. Pay off the loan as it comes, this ultimately seems like the most expensive method seeing as all the interest would accrue naturally making me pay over 20000. However it doesn't prevent me from saving, just slows down the process. 

I am stuck on which method to go. If anyone has any ideas or experiences to share, it would be very appreciated and valuable. 
In part to the first method, I do have a great great score, so I can easily get another car at a low interest rate.",finance

personalfinance,Options for $1600 Hilton Hotel Overcharge. 1 year later and still trying to get reimbursement.,"First off. Thank you all for the help you provide this sub. I read daily and still a novice when it comes to finances and this has helped a lot with getting me on the right tracks in life.

TL;DR - I stayed at Hilton Garden Inn. Got overcharged $1634 for coworker's rooms. I have email records, statements dating back 1 year trying to resolve the issue and proving I was overcharged. I was ""roped"" along by hotel managers for too long and when I finally was fed up I contacted my bank and they said it's been too long to get refund from bank.

Here is the whole story...

It's nearing over a year ago (June 2017) when I went on a business trip and stayed at a Hilton Garden Inn. I went with 20 other work employees (I'm active duty military) and was incharge of setting up logistics (schedule meetings and setup transportation and lodging). I only stayed for the first few days to make sure everything was setup and no issues. I reserved all the rooms, but I had to put my work credit card on file. 1 month later, I was reviewing my work card statements and noticed an over charge of around $1000K. I found out later that there was actually over $1600 worth of overcharges that was billed to me for my coworker's rooms. What sucks is that these members got reimbursed for rooms that they did not pay for by my company (military) and I was out $1600. 

 Once I noticed the charges, I contacted the hotel manager and he said he would work the issue (I have this all in email). I also verbally talked to our finance manager and he said there isn't anything he can do once the vouchers have been paid. The part that really started to suck was the Hotel managers were not very responsive and I have emails of me reaching out to them about 1-2 times a month asking for an update. 

 In November 2017, I gave up on the hotel managers and contacted my work credit card company to see if they could help (Citi bank) and was told it has been too long and to engage with either the Hotel or legal. I contacted my company's legal office and they advised me that there is nothing they could do and I can only hope the Hotel pays me.

 I spent the next 2 months calling and emailing the help desk and hotel managers and in February 2018 I finally got a hold of the Senior Manager and was assigned a case number. However, in mid conversation the phone dropped (due to me being overseas on a short deployment). I called back immediately (no more than 2 minutes passed), but the Sr Manager had already stepped out. I left a message, but did not hear back. I called several more times over the next 2-3 months to only get front desk and ""all managers are off-site, but I'll have them call you"". I recently returned and called again and got the same story. 

 This gives me anxiety each time I think about it and keeps me up at night. I have credit card statements and my checkout receipt. I don't have the receipts for when they charged my coworkers with my credit card, but you can easily see that I was charged multiple times throughout the week and after I checked out.

What options can I pursue or is it too late? Can I take them to small claims court and would I have to pay out of pocket for a lawyer?

Thank you all again for the help in advance.",finance

personalfinance,[USA][NM] To sell or rent our house,"TLDR Trying to decide if we should rent out our house or sell it.

1.	We’re moving out of state but have friends, family, and handyman that are local.

2.	House value $255,000

3.	Owe $190,000

4.	Payments are $1,300/month (includes taxes, insurance, and HOA)

5.	Interest rate is 3.25%

6.	All new appliances with warranties

7.	I am eligible for the guaranteed home sale program, http://www.nab.usace.army.mil/Portals/63/docs/RealEstate/DNRP_Handbook_May_26_2016.pdf?ver=2016-05-26-135703-683 , where after 90 days of it being on the market the government will purchase the home

8.	A potential renter we don’t know wants to rent the house (friend of a friend of a friend)

9.	No foreclosures or evictions but low 500’s credit score due to unemployment and recent charge-off of bad debit during unemployment

10.	Renting for $1,700 months, similar houses rent in this area for $1,450 months

11.	They are willing to pay 3 months’ rent ($1,700) up front and double the security deposit ($9000 in total) to rent our house

12.	The husband is employed (3 months) making 10K monthly, wife makes 3K monthly in some sort of stay at home work (4 months).

Should I sell the house or rent it to out? We don’t need the money from the sale of the house in the near future. Assuming nothing breaks in the house we will make $4800yr. My plan right now is to offset the $4800yr with depreciation on the rental property. We have considered the time investment but we would also be first time landlords.

personalfinance,"UPDATE: Spectrum ""Lost"" My Returned Router","I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8m57d0/spectrum_lost_my_returned_router/) last week about my experience attempting to return a router to Spectrum, which was similar to experiences others had detailed in [this other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8jdimu/always_get_receipts_and_keep_them_stored_properly/) from several months ago.

The TL;DR of the original post is that I returned my router to Spectrum in their box with a pre-paid mailing label they sent me, and then they charged me for it anyway and wouldn't cooperate with me with respect to getting it tracked down even though I called multiple times. I eventually paid the charge because I didn't want it sent to collections.

However, on the same day I paid (and posted) I also filed complaints with the FCC and the FTC about their business practices. That seemed to light a fire under their ass, because several days later, I received a phone call from Spectrum informing me that my issue had been forwarded to their research dept and that they were working on it. They proceeded to call me every day thereafter to give me updates, and this morning I got a call informing me that they had the tracking number of the label they sent, that their research showed that it had indeed been mailed when I said I had mailed it (shocking!), and that they would be refunding my payment for the router today. 

I just wanted to give an update about this so that others know that if you cannot get satisfaction from the low-level reps at the cable companies, filing a federal-level complaint may get some actual traction going on your problem. 

10/10 would take on Big Cable again anytime. 

**EDITED TO ADD:** Several people asked how Spectrum knew I filed complaints against them. Several days after I filed I got an email from the FCC notifying me that they had served the complaint against Spectrum, and that the company had 30 days to respond. The next business day (and every day thereafter) I got a very polite call from a Spectrum rep informing me that they were working on resolving my issue. The difference in how they treated me before and after filing that complaint was like night and day (they actually seemed to give a damn post-complaint).

Also on edit: I received a letter from Spectrum (Charter) in the mail yesterday about this issue, dated the same day the FCC served the complaint on them. As part of the letter, they referenced the FCC case number, so it was definitely the FCC complaint that prompted them to take some real action on my behalf.

The ""Penalty Paid"" is `outstanding balance * 0.005`, since it's my understanding that you incur a 0.5% late payment penalty each month in an installment plan.

I'm 28 and in a decent amount of debt. I couldn't tell you why it has taken me this long to start taking control of my financial life other than due to my own stupidity and laziness. However, the good news is I know it's possible and I am determined to pay off for the mistakes my younger self made.  

&amp;nbsp;

I currently help run an events company and will often drive to shoot weddings or corporate events. I make about $4,200 if it's a good month (maybe $3k on the low end) since I'm mostly on commission + hourly for events.

&amp;nbsp;

I recently went to Wells Fargo to talk with someone about my account and they mentioned it might be a good idea to take out a personal loan to pay off some of my credit cards. My dad on the other hand has recommended I should try to get a 0% interest credit card to transfer as much as I can and pay it off within the interest free period-usually 18 months. I'm not sure what is the best option for me and am hoping someone can help. I've gone through the first 3 pages of the ""debt"" filter on PF and haven't quite found the best solution for me form what I can tell. I understand I should stop eating out, cancel any non-necessary monthly bills like the gym, and probably go with the ""snowball"" method for paying down my credit cards.

* Rent: $1290 with gas, water, and trash.
* Food: $150-$300 roughly includes groceries and eating out.
* Internet: $30
* Gas for car: $80-$120 depending on how much I need to drive for work.
* Electricity: $25 roughly
* Cell: $60
* Gym: $36 (rock climbing gym)
* Adobe $30
* AAA: $140

* SallieMae Smart Option $3,145.87 @ 11.375% 
* Original balance was $3,100 and she was paying the minimum since 6/2017. I would help her pay the minimum when she couldn't, which has been happening more recently since she lost her 2nd job.


 

**Credit Cards** 

* Wells Fargo: $7,398.91 ($10,500 limit @ 16.65% variable)  
* Discover: $6,514.72 ($11,500 limit @ 17.49% variable)

* Bank of America: $3,404 ($4000 limit. My dad uses this account. I believe it has 0% until around November or December; kinda regret this as well)
* Barclays: $2,501.51 ($7,000 limit @ 0% interest until 12/2019)

personalfinance,Starting a business and looking for funding/consolidating debt,"I'm currently in the process of starting a new business, for which I'll need to spend about $5000 as an initial investment. 

I have no liquid funds at this stage and so would need to take out a personal loan/business loan (advice between the two would also be appreciated). In addition to this, I have about $10,000 in credit card debt, and I'm in the process of paying off about $10,000 in remaining student loan debt. Interest rates on the credit cards hover around 20&amp;#37;, and interest on the student loans at about 6&amp;#37;.

My thought is to take out a loan in the region of $25\-30,000 to cover the new business expenses as well as consolidate my existing loans. 

Would love any advice anyone has to offer about this situation. 

For reference, with the new business, I expect to make around $4000 per month to start with (there's little to no risk with this #, it's just about guaranteed) and my credit score is around 610.

personalfinance,Very small windfall...torn on how best to use it.,"We've recently sold some timber on a small piece of land we own.  After setting aside some of the money for savings, taxes and the purchase of a headstone for my MIL's grave, we will have about $7000 left.  

We currently have a personal loan with just under $7000 remaining on it, and we pay approximately $624 monthly on it ($288 every payday).  It has a decent interest rate.  We also have several small amounts on various store and credit cards with interest rates all over the spectrum, adding up to around $6000, with monthly payments averaging $550 (assuming I pay only minimum, which I never do...always more).  

My dilemma is that I'm torn between paying off the loan and then snowballing the other debts until they are all paid, OR paying off the smaller debts instead, then adding the money saved to the loan payment.  (Or to our auto loan, or mortgage...)

We're not in any trouble financially or anything like that...our scores are good, etc.  We are trying to pay everything except the house off within the next few years so hubby can retire.

personalfinance,Oral Surgeon Billing 36 Months Post-Procedure,"*UPDATE 6 June 2018*: I spoke to Teamcare BCBS. They verified that they did not receive the claim until 11/13/2017 (my copy says 11/15 but whatever) and the claim was denied because the filing was past the 12-month limit. I asked if it mattered that the surgeon was under ""signature of physician;"" they said what is important is the office/Dr listed under ""billing provider info""

I verified that, had the Dr. submitted the claim in time, that BCBS would have paid for both of the codes listed on the claim. I then asked if my DDS (billing provider) was contracted with BCBS at the time. The rep confirmed that they were contracted in 2015 and also checked 2016, just in case.

I asked if there was something in the contract between the provider and BCBS that barred the provider from billing the subscriber if the provider failed to file the claim in time. After a brief hold, he said ""yes, you are protected per the provider contract with BCBS"" and told me to tell that to the billing rep.

The billing rep was ""in meetings"" every time I called today. I will try again tomorrow and provide another update
______________________________________________________________________________________

I will do my best to keep it brief while getting all the details in order.; my apologies for the length. I am in Maryland, if that matters.



In June 2015 I had an oral surgery to remove and biopsy a growth on my tongue. The oral surgeon performed the procedure at my normal dentist's office. They are *not* technically the same office; according to my DDS, the oral surgeon works on her patients once a month out of her office and ""we don't even use the same billing system.""



Last week, I went to get my bi-annual cleaning at my DDS' office. As I was leaving, she stopped me to give me three statements from the oral surgeon's office. They were marked return-to-sender with the dates 4/2018, 4/2018, and 5/2018 (I don't have the envelopes in front of me).


The statements were for $410.00 but had no information that is typically on a statement (procedure, date of service, etc) they only said ""balance forward.""



I called the surgeon's office and spoke to the billing specialist. I requested a legitimate-looking billing statement because I'm not about to just pay some random amount without ensuring it's correct. During the course of the call, she stated the following (some of these are obvious responses to my questions). I am including these parts because they seem very...odd?:


* BCBS, the insurance I had at the time, denied the claim stating that I was not covered. I WAS covered by BCBS until March of 2016, when I turned 26.


* She couldn't give me a copy of the denial because ""it's all in the computer.""


* She had been sending me statements this whole time but they kept being returned to sender. I explained that my mail forwarding from that address *just* ended in January or February, and my parents lived there until very recently. I had lived at that address from 2003-2017.



* She said they just got my new phone number from my dentist. I told her I have had my phone number since I was 12-years-old; this is my only number.



* She said that my insurance didn't cover oral surgery(??!) but both my brother and I had our wisdom teeth removed under this insurance, and oral surgery is covered under one of the Teamcare BCBS brochures I could find (unfortunately can't find the 2015 one).


It was very strange. I'm not sure if she's new or something, but she seemed really uncomfortable. I'm not trying to be accusatory; she was very kind. 


The lab where my biopsy was performed was paid as they submitted their claim within the time limit. If I wasn't covered, why were they paid? Edit: I know this because I called Teamcare BCBS to inquire about the claim/claims during that month. The insurance rep. said there was no claim from the oral surgeon in 2015.



I asked that oral surgeon's billing rep send me an actual statement so I could submit it to BCBS myself. She told me they'd probably deny it due to timely filing (they did). However, the EOB Teamcare BCBS sent me states that the process date was 11/15/2017 (service date 6/15/2015). There is a note that says ""Denied per Plan Section 11.03: Claims must be filed within one (1) year from the date of service."" I assume this means the oral surgeon never actually submitted the claim until 2017, and that is why they were told I wasn't insured with BCBP any longer? 



One thing of note, because I know this isn't uncommon, but I am not sure how this works. The claim form sent to me by the oral surgeon's office lists the oral surgeon under ""signature of physician"" but lists my normal DDS under ""billing provider info.""



FWIW, my DDS was and is in the provider network for BCBS. I will have to check to see if the oral surgeon is/was. I did have a PPO with out-of-network bennies, though. :(



*Anyway* what are your thoughts? I am sure I will be on the hook for the payment, unfortunately, but I feel pretty miffed that this simply wasn't my error. I'm not trying to get out of paying it, but surely they should at least allow me to pay Reasonable and Customary since this is their error? What would you do?",finance

25yo male, engineer, have been gainfully employed making ~70k+ a year now for 3yrs.

Credit score is a 690ish (due to early screw ups in my financial life, no problems with delinquent payments for about 2.5 years).

I am living in a small college town working as an engineer for a multinational resource company, making $75k a year base salary.

Is there a minimum down payment that I need to reach first? Do I need less debt first?

personalfinance,"New job lied to me &amp; coworkers about PTO and sick leave, and manager gave poor performance review because I have regular medical appointments and was sick.","Hi all \- throwaway here.

So at my new job, during recruiting, I and several other coworkers were sent documents stating and told we would have 16 days PTO and unlimited (paid) sick leave. However, we were told recently that this was a mistake as this was meant for salaried employees, and we actually have 10 days PTO and 8 days of sick leave.

Unfortunately, the contract we signed simply states that we're full\-time, non\-exempt employees, with full participation in employee benefits and doesn't specify amounts. I'm guessing this means they don't have any legal obligation to give us what was previously discussed. This obviously leaves a bad taste in my mouth, especially because when they were discussing their 'mistake', they basically just said sorry and said they'll see what they can do, with no updates since.

This ties in with my recent performance review, where my manager's biggest complaint was that I was out of the office extremely frequently and therefore am a poor worker. He actually said that my review had to be moved due to me being out so often, although he had changed it three times in the preceding few days, citing meetings.

I am required to have just one appointment per month due to a medical condition (not something disabling or protected by a federal law, although I wonder if this is still legal to discriminate against someone for having medical appointments), so I get in about 2 hours later than usual for one day a month, with advance notice of course.

I also had the flu a few weeks ago, but was out for just 3 days. I needed much more time to actually recover, but I knew my sick leave accrued at a glacial pace. I ended up going back in and getting another coworker sick, and despite what I had been told by my manager to put in my paid sick leave (as we were told we can borrow/dip into the leave below 0 hours), it ended up being unpaid and I was only told a week later when it was denied. This of course incentivizes me to go in no matter what I'm sick with, and the deception again being such a slap in the face.

I know at least several coworkers that were deceived as well, but I don't expect much from the company since it's pretty young and not established, and the recruiter and my manager are pretty high up since they've been with the company since early on and are friends with the executives.

Am I being unreasonable? Am I justified for feeling tricked and annoyed at this situation? Any advice? I'm definitely going to check in with HR again, and I'm looking into other jobs or school, but I also don't want to leave after a short amount of time, likely without a reference, and like my coworkers a lot. But I definitely have been extremely discouraged and stressed about all of this, so I'm open to suggestions.

I know the traditional wisdom is to buy stocks and stock based funds in a non tax advantaged account and our bonds and bond funds in a tax advantaged account.

Take the following examples.  A person has $100,000 each in a stock fund like VTSAX and a bond fund like VBTLX.  

From a quarterly dividend standpoint VTSAX would come to about $455 before cap gains taxes while VBTLX would be something like $780 before income taxes.  A person in the 24% income tax bracket would still come out ahead with bonds after the taxes.  

I know the importance of a balanced portfolio.

technology,Why I’m excited about the Github buyout and you should be too,"First, if you aren’t scared that Microsoft purchased Github, you’re being naive. They’re a corporation looking to make money, first, who’s only real contributions are a code editor and their own dot net product. If you’re interested in paying for Github Teams, then disregard.

For the last ten years, many sites with public open source repositories have been migrated to Github. Many times, instead of a programmer making their own site and learning something new, they would create a barren Github repo for it, or Github Pages.

Now we will hopefully regress back to programmers learning new skill sets, like how to use a VPS and build their own site. Hopefully, many will be encouraged to not only share content from their own site, but also be prompted with maintenance to add new content to their site. This may lead to technology around git and how we collaborate finally evolving, not out of hobbyist desires but out of necessity. This could ultimately lead globally to more code in production. There are already talks of GitLab federations and I’m sure other ideas too. Atlassian and GitLab added build runners a long time ago as a native thing, which might prompt people to try continuous deployment. This change might be good for folks.

Our new blockchain Hive improves all cryptocurrency instruments: from technology and infrastructure to regulatory compliance with current regulations. Business platform Profit, developed under our project, will be a universal solution for everyone: from developers and basic users to commercial organizations and ICO projects. Moreover, the project is a great investment opportunity in virtue of its tokens.

WankCoin

WANKCOIN is a digital currency for purchasing adult items and services in situations where other payment options are either not available, or not ideal for you. WANKCOIN takes away the fear of your data being stolen, your identity being sold, or your credit card being charged without your authorization. It is one of the safest ICOs in the market right now as it is a proven concept. Wankcoin was first built on the same algorithm that bitcoin uses (SHA-256). Wankcoin has converted from a SHA-256 coin to an ERC20 token and is now doing crowdsale. It has been part of the market as a SHA-256 coin since 2014 so it is a great opportunity here.

MonsterBit’s product is very promising. It is another clone of CryptoKitties but with strong add ons. MonsterBit is catching everyone’s interest as it has some exciting add ons that I suppose every one in the crypto community would like to have their hands on. The monsters in the game unlike in cryptokitties, can be evolved and every monster with different age can be sold. The criteria for evolving the monsters is to win battles for food, weapons or monsters. Food will help monsters to get evolved, the won weapons can be sold in shop, and the monsters can be trained or sold too. It doesn’t end here, our monsters will also be able to advertise products for real money. MonsterBit is doing much more interesting things other than these like stuffed toy store for monsters, and the owners of monsters will get certain percentage. MonsterBit is coming up with unique and promising module in this industry and I am really excited to play. As I am a gaming enthusiast, and a blockchain believer too, this one is one of my favorite ICO to invest in.

Got something in the mail from Simple Path Financial based out of Irvine, CA, decided to apply and give it a whirl. This is what they came back with:

“Underwriting has confirmed you are approved and qualified for a non-credit based consolidation option.  
Commonly referred to as the Federal Trade Commission Compliant Debt Resolution Program, this complies 100% with the strict rules dictated by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and is overseen by the American Fair Credit Council (AFCC) for consumer protection and streamlined cooperation with creditors.  As of the most recent quarterly reporting, there is over $6.2 Billion in consumer debt currently under management with over 756,500 consumers enrolled .

This plan consolidates debts into one much more affordable monthly payment and all future interest is eliminated entirely.  Once the compounding interest is eliminated, debts can be paid off in an average of 3.5 years (versus 30+ years under the clients existing terms).

Most importantly, this program helps consumers avoid the long-term catastrophic effects of more extreme consolidation options such as Consumer Credit Counseling Services and/or Chapter 7 or 13 Bankruptcy filings.  The program itself is NOT reported to credit bureaus so all reporting will show you paid the debts and not a 3rd party.  
As outstanding balances are paid down and the utilization rate decreases on the client's credit report, the FICO score and the client's credit worthiness rapidly improve so that traditional lending is more attainable in the near future.”

Bitcoin,I love this concept! First heard it articulated by Saifedean Ammous.,"Bitcoins value proposition is NOT fast transactions. Cash is instant, people in sub-saharan Africa send money over sms, developed nations use tap and pay credit cards. No one is buying bitcoin to get faster transactions.

Bitcoins value proposition is NOT cheap transactions. Cash is free, merchants pay credit card fees, national bank transfers are free, international wires can be done over ""transferwise"" and the like for next to nothing. No one is buying bitcoin to get cheaper transactions.

Bitcoins value proposition is NOT that its ""digital"". 90% + of fiat money is already digital. Nothing more than an entry in a data base. No one is buying bitcoin because its digital, infact trying to understand the digital nature of bitcoin turns more people away than it attracts.

It is fantastic that bitcoin is fast, cheap, digital, uncensorable etc etc. But bitcoin really has only one value proposition, and it is extremely important.

Bitcoin is the only asset on earth that is strictly scarce, its supply cannot be diluted. Bitcoins value proposition is its immutable unchangeable monetary policy of a set issuance rate and set total supply.

Everyone buying bitcoin is buying for this one reason whether they realise it or not. Afterall who would buy bitcoin if new bitcoins could be created arbitrarily at whim. No one. Even bitcoins price appreciation is due entirely to the fact excess supply cannot rise as demand rises, supply issuance rate is set in stone.

Once people start to wake up to the fact that bitcoin is the only strictly scarce asset on earth whos supply cannot increase with more time or effort like every other resource the implications will be profound.

Everyone is running around trying to understand why bitcoin is important or why it will work or why they even bought some in the first place. The answer is this one reason. Its supply is absolutely strictly limited. If you own 1 out of 21 million bitcoin today you will still own 1 out of 21 million bitcoin in 50 years from now. No one can dilute the supply.

Bitcoins immutability is the foundation of this whole technological movement. Any coin that can hard fork at will is not immutable. The fast cheap payments will come and one day will be used all around the world, but the value today is solely in bitcoins immutable monetary policy.

If anyone asks you what bitcoin is. Tell them ""Bitcoin is the worlds ONLY liquid asset whos supply cannot be increased as demand rises. Bitcoin is the ONLY strictly scarce asset on earth.""",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Proactively Reducing AGI,"**I want to keep my wife's AGI under $31,170 for our 2018 taxes, and am looking for input on how to make sure we hit that mark.**

The goal is for her to qualify for an income-based repayment plan on her federal student loans. By keeping her AGI below 150% the poverty line for a 3-person family (the above amount), we will qualify for $0/month payments. We have public service loan forgiveness in the works (initial paperwork in progress), and want to avoid paying any money on her federal loans until they are forgiven.

*Why am I asking for help?*

This will be our first year attempting this strategy, and our first year filing married-filing-separately (to make sure her AGI qualifies). Knowing that we will lose some deductions that we've used in the past (filing-jointly), I want to be sure I'm understanding everything, *before* I need to.

&amp;nbsp;


**The Details:**

Wife's Current W2 income: $45k

Expected Deductions:

- $5k pre-tax Dependent Care FSA contributions out of her pay
- 4% pre-tax 401(k) contributions reduces AGI $1,800 (can be increased, but the idea is to have more money available *now* for paying down her private loans that won't be forgiven)
- $250 educator expenses (this is capped at this amount)


&amp;nbsp;

**What more can we do to reach our AGI goal?**

This may be relevant: on my return we will itemize several deductions since I work from home full-time (a percentage of mortgage interest, utilities, property tax, etc.).

&amp;nbsp;

personalfinance,Starting my first post-college job soon and could use an extra set of eyes on my budget/plan,"Here's my situation as it relates to PF:

Living with my gf who is about to start grad school. She's paying for that with loans and money from her grandparents' estate. I'm paying for our shared expenses. We're both under 26 and are each planning to stay on our parents' health/dental insurance plans until turning 26 - maybe sooner if we want to be truly independent after getting our feet under us.

Things like cell phones and car insurance/registration are still being paid by our parents and we're planning to start taking care of those this fall (I'll turn 25, which will hopefully make my insurance cheaper). Our parents aren't in much of a rush to make us start paying that stuff.

On my W-4 I claimed 2 federal allowances and 1 state allowance (Iowa). Then used ADP's online tool to figure out what my paychecks will actually net. My employer contributes to the 401k at a max of 4% when employees contribute 6% and that's the default upon hire so I'm planning to just do that.

personalfinance,CC Debt (CAN),"*I've posted on PFC* OK, so this scenario is for my SO. I've been thinking all night how to tackle this without actually involving my money. I've never had debt and never felt it first hand until this situation.

We are both only 21 she has 2 kids but she had a bad run with an ex in the passed and for whatever reason now has 4200 CC debt and 1400 hydro. Old house has 650 sent to a collecting agency and 750 currently.

So she probably has a rough 800$ a month after all expenses paid (I made her fill out a quick budgeting sheet) and I just moved in with her so that + whatever I contribute to groceries/rent. She rarely wants to take my money for whatever reason but I gave her 300 to throw on the CC yesterday (my part of the $875 rent).

So I'm just looking for anyone who can help devise any sort of plan, the CC debt seems to be ridiculously growing I looked at it quick and it pretty much increases a good $150. How do people go about tackling this?! I have the money to pay this off straight but this isn't an answer to her accruing all this debt and would not be a good lesson if done that way.

Also how do you find the interest rate for a credit card. It shows something like %19.99 but that can't be possible? That'd be like 800$ monthly on 4200 CC ?

Feel free to ask for more details.

Forex,Data Analysis for Forex market? (Time Cycles),"I got interested in this topic, after reading about Time Cycles from Murphy's book. Time cycle seems pretty much Fourier series analysis. Just to try it out, I took the monthly data for EURUSD for its entirety.

First, [this is the monthly EURUSD chart](https://i.imgur.com/NyYwwbc.png) (x-axis is just data points).

I take a Fourier Transform of this data, select the low-frequency components, and then Inverse Fourier Transform, to [give this graph](https://i.imgur.com/uT7Y73M.png) (red graph is the standard EURUSD Monthly data). The blue curve is showing an interesting cyclic pattern. It seems set to repeat a bullish wave.

To make it cleaner, I pass the EURUSD monthly data through a Low-pass filter, set at cutoff frequency of 0.05 units (which is around 5 times the frequency step size), and then I get [this graph](https://i.imgur.com/0Oz0wXg.png). We are clearly seeing initiation of a bull run again.

I was wondering if professionals consider this a reliable analysis of FX markets? All other forces of the market (ECB, Fed, rates, trade agreements/wars, Futures), they are perhaps unwittingly playing their part in helping this cycle evolve naturally? Or is this just a fluke?",finance

personalfinance,Stock Buying/Selling Strategies,"Most of my investing is in index funds and ETFs, but I did purchase a few individual stocks about three years ago (Netflix, Google, Amazon, Apple, Disney, etc.).   Most of them have far outperformed the index funds.  For example, I have a 27&amp;#37; gain in FSTVX, while the individual stocks have grown by 100&amp;#37;\-300&amp;#37;. 

At what point do I sell the individual stocks?  I would hope they continue growing, and I don't need the liquid cash right away, so I'm tempted to leave them in with the hope that the individual stocks will continue to grow.  Plus if I were to sell my Google stock, for example, I would probably want to re\-invest in Google.  So would it be better to sell now to secure the gain and then re\-purchase, or to leave my current shares alone and purchase additional shares?

A bit unrelated, but when calculating the rate of return on a stock, I imagine it would be best to not only consider the cost basis but also the federal and state long term gain taxes, which in California, would be equal to about 24&amp;#37;!  So when determining the rate of return, I should probably discount the gain by the tax rate to calculate the true change in cash, correct?  For example, if a stock grew from $100/share to $150/share, the rate of return pre\-tax would be 50&amp;#37;, however the return post\-tax would be 38&amp;#37; (i.e. \[(150\-100)/100\] x 0.76 = 38&amp;#37;), correct?",finance
personalfinance,"How much house, if any, should we be buying this summer?","Here's my husband's and my current situation:


2 kids, early 30s, excellent credit, renting an apartment, and both of us have long-term renewable contracts at a public university. Base pay (gross) is 115k total, but come August it will be 130-145k. We also often teach summer/winter classes, so our gross pay for next year should be 150k plus.


We have a 21k e-fund and 39k saved in addition, with an extra 15-20k (net) coming in this summer from teaching. Roth IRAs (total around 50-60k maybe) are being maxed, as are our employee retirement plans (our 5% with employer's 7% match, total around 30-40k).


If we don't buy, budget for the coming school year would look like:

2 biweekly checks most months, totaling about $6k (guessing a bit with raises/witholding changes)

$1800 rent (includes all utilities and cable/internet)

$200 insurance (includes auto, renters', and life)

$40 cell phones

$600 groceries

$200 gas

$880 Roths

$700 miscellaneous (includes entertainment, car maintenance, eating out, ...)

$1500 savings (toward a bigger down payment, if we decide to buy next year instead)


I tend to be pretty conservative financially and think we'd be in a much better position next year, but my parents are visiting and have convinced my husband (and maybe me) that we're in okay shape now and could perhaps get a better interest rate now.


So we are looking at houses in the $230-330k range, which looks like it should give us enough space around here as the kids grow. (Edit: some of these would reduce our commute and/or put us closer to town/shopping/groceries, we are pretty rural now). Is this reasonable?


Our down payment would be less than 20% and we would have to take out a 30-year loan, but I've always sort of imagined putting down 20+% on a shorter term. Am I being overly conservative? Should we be looking at houses more seriously? Could it free up some money to start serious college savings?",finance

personalfinance,My wish-list of elements for a decent mortgage calculator,"I'm thinking about getting some new digs, so am spending a lot of time thinking about what I'd like to see in a mortgage calculator. When I bought my first house a little while back I was consistently frustrated by how most online mortgage calculators were basically referral sites for lenders and real estate agencies. I think there are more choices out there now, but I wanted to share my wishlist for a good online calculator, along with some suggestions.

**Elements**

*Minimum elements:*

* Cost of the home
* Down payment amount
* Interest rate 
* Loan period

*Additional elements:*

The top elements will do for uber-basic calculations, but generally I need to see these things if I'm going to put the calculator to use:

* Property tax
* Homeowner’s insurance and/or HOA Fees
* Private mortgage insurance (if applicable)

Where I think calculators really set themselves apart is where they account for ongoing costs that aren't actually part of the mortgage, but are nonetheless huge factors in calculating affordability:

* Home maintenance costs
* Utility fees for electricity, water, sewage &amp; sanitation, etc.

**Function**

Regardless of the elements, a mortgage calculator should be straightforward and intuitive while retaining the ability for complex math. Sliders are nice, and defined terminology is key.

I also appreciate getting ""free"" additional information like how much I could make investing instead or comparing buying to renting, without having to provide additional info.

Along these lines, anything a mortgage calculator can do automatically like calculating property tax based on zip code gives massive points.

Here are a few of my go-tos (when I'm not using my own):

[The New York Times rent/buy calculator](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/upshot/buy-rent-calculator.html) - I love this one because it's basically a comparison calculator that doubles as a cost of ownership calculator. It's also a classic they've updated several times over the years.

[Walletwyse Home Purchase Calculator](http://www.walletwyse.com/category/homes) - A newer site, but it checks a lot of the boxes. They also don't seem to be affiliated with any lenders or mortgage companies.

[BrainSturgeon's Mortgage Calculator](https://rebrn.com/re/brainsturgeons-mortgage-calculator-i-was-frustrated-that-most-mo-1054995/) - About as detailed as you can get, and probably one of the more user-friendly excel-based mortgage calculators out there.

personalfinance,Any reason not to shuffle credit card debt between existing cards that have special offers of 0% APR on transfers,"This is a bit complicated but I currently have three cards and around 20K in debt but the interest rates on two of these are killing me.

Gold Weekly

[http://i63.tinypic.com/2ylnuc5.jpg](http://i63.tinypic.com/2ylnuc5.jpg)

So here is where I get confused. AUDUSD is testing the weekly support line which may turn it into a resistance line. However... If the US Dollar is going to enter monetary tightening then this means that the Aussie needs to strengthen more in order for AUDUSD to still go down.

USDJPY is also retesting the weekly support line BUT I know that if greenback goes down then so should USDJPY. This makes sense. If USDJPY and AUDUSD should be inverse right?

Here is the reason I believe that Greenback will enter monetary tightening. Unemployment is below full employment. We have 3 to 4 rate hikes with June pretty much being guaranteed. The S&amp;P 500 is continuing to go up (which means that firms have extra cushion). Treasury bond yields are rising. Inflation is 2&amp;#37; or above which was the fed was aiming for.

I'm pretty sure the June interest rate is already priced, but the other 3 might not be. I am worried about the foreign tariff's. If steel tariff's go into place then that could be bad news for Aussie. If Aussie doesn't strengthen then the trend line might still be a support, but who knows. Also if tariff's do come into play then we can see USDJPY can Gold climb higher. They tend to climb higher during global political turmoil.

Oil prices are rising which means that there might be an artificial increase in US inflation (I remember hearing the fed mentioned not to pay attention to monthly CPI data because it could be wrong). I try to keep track of the difference between the change in disposable income and the change in oil prices monthly and quarterly. As long as the oil futures prices are decreasing lower than disposable income than I think consumers can still retain purchasing power. As unemployment goes up though I can imagine this will become harder and harder as monetary tightening progresses. I am curious if Canadians retain their purchasing power because one of Canada's biggest exporter is oil. Hopefully marijuana will become Canada's next biggest export!

I was taught that gold is a safe haven for the dollar which helps keeps the dollar in check, but does this also work for the S&amp;P 500? Most high dollar investors look to get residual income. The Benjamin Graham strategy is to find blue chip stocks that pay the highest dividends and then when the S&amp;P 500 becomes volatile store the money in bond yields. Why would an investor that is looking for residual income store their money in gold?

Regardless the gold weekly chart is looking like it's creeping closer to breaking the monthly/weekly resistance line. If the dollar starts to climb much higher the price structure might break though.

I realize that I am all over the place, but I didn't want to make multiple posts addressing my multiple thoughts. If I missed anything let me know!",finance

A friend of mine who’s a life insurance agent encouraged me to buy an IUL (Indexed Universal Life) policy for myself. She quoted me for $50/month for a $100K policy.

She explained that an IUL increases no matter how the stock market changes, you can borrow from the cash value at low to no interest rates, and a LTC (Long term care) rider will insure me if I have a disability later on.

I know she would try to get the best product for me, even if it is the one she gets the least commission for, so this isn’t a concern (Don’t worry. I know this for a fact).

Any advice or experience with IUL’s or life insurance in general? Should I go for less, more, not at all?


Background info:

I’m around 20 and have nobody I’m financially responsible for, but that could change in the future if I get married or something.

I understand I can just get a term life policy later on, but I’m primarily interested in borrowing from my policy and for the LTC insurance.

I would be able to afford the premium and maybe a little more because I work part-time.",finance

personalfinance,"Thinking of buying a house in south florida, need advise","Hello Everyone,

I am currently thinking of buying a house in south florida. I moved here around 3 years ago for a job. Luckily my job is very stable (we have a customer service contract of 10 years) and I am able to bring home 70k a year post\-taxes (income from Salary). I am in my late 20s. Unfortunately I have not saved up much money, I can only afford doing a 20k down payment. I have more money on a 401k but I am not touching that money.

At the moment I am paying 1300 in rent monthly for a small apartment. I am thinking of buying a town\-house that's around the low to mid 200k. I have no other debts besides a small debt of 1000 dollar of furniture I bought. I have a credit score of 750. 

My biggest concern is that I keep hearing from my friends that it is a terrible time to buy a house. I think interest rates are at 4.5&amp;#37;. Am I risking too much by buying a house in that range? It would be my first home, do you have any advise for me? How soon should I start looking for pre\-approval? do pre\-approvals hurt my credit score? are there programs I should take advantage of? and finally is the low to mid 200k a reasonable range for my finances? 

thank you guys!",finance

personalfinance,To Sell Or Not To Sell? To Declare Bankruptcy Or Not To Declare Bankruptcy? Single 49 Person Seeking Solution To A Shakespearean Dilemma Of Their Own Making....,"Hi all, I'm on the horns of a dilemma, and am asking this question of /frugal, /financialindependence, and /personal finance.  I will then combine all perspectives to make my final decision.  Below, I've laid out my personal details, budget, debts, assets, and 8 possible options on how I can move forward.

# Personal Details

* Location:  suburb of Seattle (50 minutes away by public transit, so can sleep on the public transit).
* Me: Single 49 year old male (no kids), with a fair amount of IT skills, should be easy to get another job as I look young \- appear to be about 37\-39.  Currently unemployed as I moved to another city to be near my now ex\-girlfriend, and then moved back. I rented a room when I moved to that city, so I appear as if I've never left my house.

# Budget:

* Mortgage:  $1250/ month .
* Unlimited Cricket phone $65/month
* Food:   $200/ month \-\&gt;  just got a hotpot, so am eager to lower this bill.
* Gym: $21/ month
* Netflix: $15/ month
* MoviePass: $99/ year. (about $10/ month)
* Coffee:  $300/ month.  This will be $10/ month as I've just discovered the joy of French Press...so good!
* I will confess my ex\-girlfriend loved going to very expensive restaurants (paid by me).  I don't plan on dating until my financial situation is under control \- or I find someone who's willing to split dating expenses.

# Assets:

* House is valued at approximately $270,000 \- I owe $155,000 on it. So, after selling would have about $100,000 (had house since 2004, and have been living in it the entire time, but need to pay realtors).
* No 401K (cashed out when I was an alcoholic \- fully sober for over a year now) or retirement savings.  Yep....way behind where I should be financially, but just counting my blessings on no longer drinking.
* Car is a 2012 Prius, fully paid for.  Value about $8000.

# Credit Score:

* 626 \- it was 780 before I started racking up the below debt.  I'm at 100&amp;#37; on all payments now, so if that debt was paid off, I'd be anywhere from 790 to 810( I was at 780 with a 97&amp;#37; on\-time payment rate).
* I used /pf to raise it to 780 from 580 (thank you!).

# Debt - the following debt was incurred to fix up my house and cover day to day living. I am doing all the work myself, so have saved a lot of money with that, but materials cost money. 

# Total Debt:

* $56,082.37, if not including school debt or parental debt.
* $71,082.37, if not including parental debt, but including school debt.
* $101,082.37, if including all debt.

# Debt Details:

* Mortgage:  $155,000 left, $1250/ month
* Assorted credit cards \- 26,082.37 debt incurred.  Total Credit Limit $52,300.
* Personal loans through Marcus and Prosper:  15,000 each or $30,000 total.
* IRS:  have not paid taxes for a few years \- I owe $10,000 for the first year of those years.  Due to the alcoholism,and being wayyyy under\-employed, the government most likely owes me money for the years after that.  So, $10,000 to the IRS minimum, maybe $12,000 maximum.
* Parental Units \- owed $30,000.  They are comfortably retired, so there is no pressing need to pay them off immediately \- but I **WILL** pay them off no matter what happens.
* School Loans:  $15,000.  I know \- I should have paid them off when I had the money.

# Wildcard (IASIP):

My house is on a huge lot.  I have a tiny house on it that I can move to the far part of the property, and live in it legally while renting out my house. The house would rent out for $1600\-$1700.  So, everything would be covered including food.  Zero bills as long as I'm frugal.

# Potential Jobs:

Should be able to get a job anywhere from $45,000 to $55,00 minimum.  I am evaluating possibly hitting a code academy, but at 49, not sure if that would be a good thing to do.  I'm good at coding though, and learn very quickly.  Still researching it...

# Potential places to move to:

Outdoor activities on the weekend are very important to me, as it keeps me out of bars.

* If I stay where I'm at, biking around Seattle, surfing in Westport, or stand\-up paddleboarding on lakes near Seattle.
* In Portland (which I'm in love with), biking around Portland, wind\-surfing on the Gorge, and surfing at Ecola Beach.

# Variables:

* Interest rates are moving up, and housing prices might crash.  I bought my house in 2004, and watched my house's value crater in 2008/2009.  Very sensitive to this.
* Self\-driving cars might cause housing values in near suburbs to crash \- why pay more for 1 hour away, when you can live 2 hours away and pay 1/4 less?  On the other hand, the massive loss of driving jobs might cause a necessary implementation of UBI (Univeral Basic Income), so being a landlord might be advantageous.

# Which option do you recommend?  I know which one I'm leaning towards, but am very eager to hear your opinion/recommendation.

# Option 1:

* Don't sell.  
* Rent out the house and tiny house it up. 
* Get a job and use the lack of mortgage to pay off all debts \- probably take 3/4 years to get them all paid off.  Getting two jobs is not really an option due to the commute.

# Option 2:

* Don't sell.  
* Rent out the house and tiny house it up.
* Declare bankruptcy, using Washington's bankruptcy wildcard housing exception of $125,00 to shield house and car.  Due to the recent upsurge/possible continued upsurge in value of the house, might lose the car.  While I would hate to lose the car, I can get by with a bicycle if needed.  
* Note:  I'm very good at building up my credit score thanks to /pf. I believe I could be back to 700's within 2 years.

# Option 3:

* Don't sell.  
* Don't sell, bring in roommates to cover all but $200 in the mortgage, and split all utilities. 
* Declare bankruptcy, using the housing exception, etc.

# Option 4:

* Sell.  
* Use the $100,00 profit from the house to pay off all debts, except for parental debt, leaving $30,000 to live on while moving to Portland.
* I am very comfortable living out of a car using 24 hour fitness/ storage locker, etc to keep expenses low until I get a job. 
* Pay off parents after getting a job.

# Option 5:

* Sell.  
* Use the $100,000 profit to pay off all debts, except for parental and school debt, leaving about $44,000 to live on while moving to Portland.  (live out of the car..etc).

# Option 6:

* Sell.  
* Pay off all debts, including parents.  Live on the street in Portland making use of 24 hour fitness, storage locker, etc.  
* Use credit cards to pay for food, until I get a job.

# Option 7:  

* Sell. 
* Use the $100,00 to live off, and don't pay off the debts, but pay them off incrementally until I get a job.  
* Move into an apartment right away.

# Option 8 ?

personalfinance,Switch to personal loan from student loan for lower interest rates ?,"Hi guys

I took a student loan in my home country at 13&amp;#37; to study abroad. It was not a ""pay after you graduate type of loan"" so i was making payments some interest and some installment. I have now graduated and started working in the ""abroad"" country making a good salary

However i still have that student loan at 13&amp;#37; ROI in my home country where i am sending money to. Based on my current salary i can easily get personal loan at 6\-8&amp;#37; in the current country. 

Would it be wise to pay off the entire student loan by taking a personal loan in my current country ? For the most part the benefit i see here are two things primarily 

1. My parents mortgaged their property for my student loan, this will free up that property
2. lower interest rate so i'll save some money

the only thing that will go out is that my father became the co signer in the home country and avails the tax benefit but that is easily trumped by the amount of money i save in interest

also the thing about student loans is you can overpay and get rid of them when you have the money which will have a penalty in a personal loan.

I want to be debt free so i might want to do that

what are your thoughts ?",finance

1) Pay off the remaining portion of the loan?

2) Refinance to a lower interest rate?

3) Make double or even higher payments on the current loan?

financialindependence,[Philosophy] Start mentally thinking wealthy. Time for a 21-day makeover (summary),"*The middle class trades currency for liabilities. The wealthy trades currency for assets. It is much easier to go from nothing to producing than it is to remove the liabilities incurred from a middle class lifestyle* - Jacob Lund Fisker, paraphrasing.

You are in a great position to change/alter/rewire your perspective and principles towards money, wealth, and even retirement. But in-order to change, you need to establish new routines. 

On the blog ""early retirement extreme"" is more of a philosophical approach/guideline. This individual managed to live on $7000 (2008) per year and retire with a $200,000 ""nest egg"" within 5 years. His income never exceeded more than $45,000, which is more obtainable than a lot of retirement advice using six figure incomes. 

The principles are what I am stressing. Humans only are able to control a limited amount of items, but these items have immediate impact. Taking personal responsibility towards behaviors can often feel like a scary but liberating process. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day 1: Finding a Place to Live - http://earlyretirementextreme.com/day-1-finding-a-place-to-live.html

Highlights: 

&gt; * A home is basically only a place where you sleep and keep your stuff 

&gt; *  An extra bedroom might add $200 a month to the rent.

&gt; * This extra amount requires $60000 and $80000 in total assets to become sustainable. How many years will it take you to save this much more money?

&gt; * Three basic values for a home: Location relative to your work, location relative to your grocery outlet, cost.

&gt;  * If you ever purchase a home, do not think it is a good idea to consider the house you live in an “investment”

In summary, if you had the option of living somewhere close, cheap (per person), and within a walking/bike distance towards your work and grocery outlet, this is the favorable route even on minimum wage ($14,500 per year). We are cultivating a budget around $8,000 per year. Additionally it takes around one month to move, but this is compounded within the second point. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day 2: Decluttering and Managing Stuff: http://earlyretirementextreme.com/day-2-decluttering-and-managing-stuf.html

&gt; * The cumulative mountain of unused stuff is a symptom of economic inefficiency

&gt; * Inefficiency is what will slow you and everyone else down from early retirement or even prevent it.

More likely than not, you probably do not have much stuff. And this is a good mentality to keep. Additionally, if you are able to free up your time, you can ""exploit"" those who have too much stuff by purchasing it cheap at garage sales or thrift shops. Minimize your total items and maximize your returns (check eBay's sold listings for a complete guide to pricing). 

But the idea is that you are getting out of one lifestyle and into another, do not fall into the stuff trap! 

If you have things you need but are limited in funds, do not worry. There are programs and many others out there. The blog recommends: freecycle.org which has people giving out free items to those who need it instead of tossing them away into a landfill. You can pick up furniture, bikes, electronics, and other items depending on the availability within your city/town/location. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day 3: Grocery Shopping - http://earlyretirementextreme.com/day-3-grocery-shopping.html

&gt; * So many people are clueless about nutrition so if experts recommend eating a little bit of everything, chances are that nobody will develop any nutritional deficiencies — well other than eating too much.

&gt; * During my first 3 years, I ate mostly lentil soup (lentils, onion, garlic, cheese, rice, carrots) and tuna sandwiches with lettuce or kale.  (Editor note, but the idea is that most ""meals"" can be constructed cheaply around three staples of rice, beans, onions)

&gt; * Avoid preprocessed food. Personally I draw the line at canned tomatoes and bread. I would never buy sauces, powders, or frozen ready meals.

&gt; * Highly recommend flipping the standard western idea of basing all meals on milk and meat around. Consider going vegetarian.It is much less expensive both in terms of food cost but also in terms of reduced medical costs (cholesterol and all that). Also it is very hard to stay overweight on a vegetarian diet. 

&gt; * Additionally, consider meat a treat. Besides, leftovers without meat tend to store longer. (Editor note, basically meat and fruits are your new ""junk food"" addictions. Treat them sparingly as they are addictive and pricey. 

&gt; * I gave up on the whole milk idea when I moved away from home. The idea of picking up a milk every six days was too inconvenient.

&gt; * Food limit: Depending on where you live: $50-75/person/month.

My budget is similar to his recommended. Very small amount of meat (1/8th of a pound) grass fed beef, beef stock, and lots of veggies including onions, beans, carrots, kale, spinach, and potatoes. Meal prep and freeze your meals to last longer and save time. Each one meal per day for optimal health and time efficiency. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day 4: Drop the Cell Phone Plan - http://earlyretirementextreme.com/day-4-drop-the-cell-phone-pla.html

&gt; * There was a time, a simpler time, perhaps a few years ago(*editor note, 20 years ago), when people were able to make detailed advanced plans to meet their appointment to do a certain thing at a certain time.

&gt; * Today, cell phones have replaced these skills. In fact cell phones are now considered a need and have even begun to replace basic parenting as some parents are beginning to use cell phone tracking to keep track of their kids.

&gt; * Regardless, cell phones are not really needed. In fact phones are not really needed. For years I relied on email (I did have access to a public phone in the hall in case of emergencies) and now I have skype for talking.

&gt; * Is your cell phone worth it? This is easy to answer. Multiply your monthly bill with 300. Then divide this with your monthly savings rate. This is the number of months, that your cell phone is keeping you from retiring e.g. If your bill is $50 and your monthly savings is $500, then your cell phone is delaying your retirement by 50×300/500=30 months or almost three years.

This is true. Most smartphones and even cellphones are not ""needs"" and have replaced the skills that actually allowed for survival within plans in the past. Additionally (from what I recall), ALL cell phones even if not activated with a paying plan are required to dial out to an emergency number in the USA. A charged but inactive phone can be a good preventative measure for dire situations. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Day 5: Find a Free Hobby - http://earlyretirementextreme.com/day-5-find-a-free-hobb.html

Hobbies are broken down into three categories (according the the blog): 

1. Spending on equipment, activities, or the like (in other words, costing money). 

&gt; * In the end we all have the same to show for it: Nothing. We have been entertained, but I honestly put the value of the entertainment I received 5 years ago close to nothing. 

2. ""Free"" hobbies 

&gt; * There are also hobbies that cost nothing or are in a sense close to price neutral. Learn Ancient Greek, play chess, start a vegetable garden (the costs are cancelled out by not having to buy the vegetables)

&gt;  * It is not hard to find free hobbies and in general it is possible to develop an interest in almost anything. The reason is that things are mostly uninteresting simply due to a lack of understanding of the hobby.

3. Productive ""giving back"" hobbies 

&gt; * Engage with other people.

&gt; * The author's free hobby interest (point number two) in system administration meant that [he] got to run the department servers where [he] worked 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Day 6: Clothes - http://earlyretirementextreme.com/day-6-clothes.html

&gt; * The most effective option to save money on clothing clearly is not to buy any, hence this is what I would recommend.

&gt; * This strategy can work for several years because most people, myself included, simply have way too much clothing e.g. more than what we can wear at one time. If you have clothes you can not wear at all, get rid of it. Someone else can probably use it.

&gt; * Now, your average piece of clothing should survive the laundry cycle about 100 times, maybe even 200. If you have 10 shirts, that’s 1000 cycles. Even if you only wear them once before you wash them, that’s three years.

&gt; * Thrift shops, second-hand, clothing repair skills, freecycle, hand washing (or cold washed, line dried) for longevity are all your friends 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Day 7: Going Car Free - http://earlyretirementextreme.com/day-7-going-car-free.html


&gt; * Everyone needs to live somewhere, but not everyone needs to drive somewhere, especially not those that found a place to live that is close to work on day 1. Next to housing cost, transportation costs are the second biggest source of expenses.

&gt; * The average American spends 18% on his income on transportation. That is 0.18×12=2.1 months a year of work. That is a lot of time that could conceivably be used for something better.

&gt; * Assume he also spends an hour daily in his car commuting, then that is 250 hours a year, assuming 250 working days. That is 1/8 of the working day on top of the working day. Hence, that is 12/8 = 1.5 month in addition.

&gt; * In other words almost 3 months a year goes into being able to drive back and forth from work. Hence if you would otherwise calculate 6 years until retirement, then if you own a car, you will only be able to save 9/12 as much, so your time until retirement would extend by 12/9*6=8 years or two additional years. Correspondingly, if you calculate 12 years until retirement, then you are really looking at 16, or four more years.

&gt; * Not owning a car is therefore an extremely helpful measure towards early retirement. If you want to retire extremely early, it is almost a prerequisite.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Day 8: Get Engaged - http://earlyretirementextreme.com/day-8-get-engaged.html

&gt; * No I’m not talking about getting married. I’m talking about finding something that motivates you: Perhaps your calling

&gt; * I found that once I found a free hobby, the more I focused on it, the less money I spent. 

&gt; * The problem with our society is that we have basically been conditioned and programmed by marketeers to equate often pointless consumption with rewards or  entitlements after hard work.

&gt; * To pay it off consumers go to work the next day to manufacture stuff for the next consumer that comes along and needs to feel good. This is the very definition of a consumer driven economy. It has little other purpose than building things for people to buy things so they will keep working.

&gt; * The conclusion is obvious. If you want to stop working, stop behaving like a consumer.

&gt; * Start finding something you can identify instead of work. This is psychologically very important and it is one of the things that took me the longest to find out myself.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Day 9: Budgeting - http://earlyretirementextreme.com/day-9-budgeting.html

&gt; * I see no need for detailed budgets or tracking expenses. In my world there are basically two categories: Money spent and money kept 

&gt; * Money I keep, therefore, represents freedom. I value this very highly. To compare this to the spending category, I estimate the monthly cost of spending on some item, and then multiply it by 300 (more calculations in the blog).

&gt; * It is quite possibly that it is this enormous multiplier, the factor 300, that discourages people from saving for passive income. Saving $30000, after all, “only” results in 100 bucks a month and saving $30000 can take years or even decades when one is not aggressive about it. In that sense not-saving creates a double-whammy. 

&gt; * Hence, if I want to purchase something that will cost me $5 a month, I do not see a $5 price tag. I see that category 2 needs to be boosted by $1500. Suddenly $5 does not seem so trivial anymore. On the other hand, paying $4000 for something that I can sell for $3500 and that will last for 15 years … that is only $2.7 a month.

&gt; * This means that price tags become irrelevant. All that matters is monthly expenses and the size of the principal. I always try to decrease the former and increase the latter. When they meet, you have arrived (retirement).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Day 10: Calculating Your Net Worth - http://earlyretirementextreme.com/day-10-calculating-net-worth.html

&gt; * It seems that everybody calculates net worth differently. For extreme early retirement or financial independence, there is only one way to do it.

&gt; * The only thing that matters to your net worth are assets that can easily generate income (All savings accounts and checking accounts, all brokerage accounts, all real estate you own that you rent out. If any are mortgaged, subtract the debt).

&gt; * Do not include the following: Any kind of tax-deferred/locked retirement account (unless you are older than 55), the house you live in, cars, boats, airplanes, or other big ticket items (unless you rent them out), Bling-bling.

&gt; * Calculate your annual expenses. Multiply this by 25. Is it lower than your net worth? If yes, congratulations, you are financially independent and historically speaking you can go for a few decades without a job. Now multiply your expenses by 35. Do you still qualify? If yes, then historically, you could go on forever.

&gt; * If either is a no, then you still have work to do, literally. Work hard to maximize your networth while minimizing your expenses. For most people the latter is far easier since the leverage factor is in the hundreds e.g. $100 saved per month translates into $30000 less in retirement requirements.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Day 11: Connecting Your Stuff with Your Neighbors, building communities - http://earlyretirementextreme.com/day-11-connecting-your-stuff-with-your-neighbors.html

&gt; * On day 2, I recommended getting rid of a lot of your unused stuff, that is, stuff you haven’t used for the past 1 months (books and DVDs were allowed a slightly longer half-life, about a year). The point of that operation was to make it easy to move into smaller housing and thus remove the main cost of having too much stuff namely, indirect housing costs.

&gt; * It is possible to go further than that. Whereas the above may be thought of as an inventory reduction, the next step is to take inventory management to the next step, to something akin to the Japanese Just-In-Time except what we’re going to do here is to store some or our things “off-site”.

&gt; * I suppose you’re familiar with the idea of borrowing things from your neighbors. But have you ever systematically done so? Set up a system so that each person (who is interested) provides a list of what they have but do not use every day. This could be tools, kitchen utensils, DVDs, and even bicycles.

&gt; * Rules of borrowing: If you break it, you replace it. Return it in a better or as good as condition as you got it in.

&gt; * It goes without saying that the first and the last method requires some upstanding friends. Normally this will develop automatically. People who do not respect the system and other people’s things will eventually get excluded from the system 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Day 12: Establishing a Savings Account - http://earlyretirementextreme.com/day-12-establishing-a-savings-account.html

&gt; * It is vital to the early retirement plan to be able to access savings in your retirement. For those younger than 55, saving in plans, which presume that people should retirement no sooner than age 59-67 (depending on your country), is thus of little use.

&gt; * Having implemented all changes of the makeover so far, it should be possible to save at least $500/month… more if you’re making more than minimum wage ($12000/year). Those ambitious enough to retire extremely early should be able to save more as well as earn more.

&gt; * Initially, it is important to stay motivated. I wrote a post last year — one of my first — on how to compare your savings to big ticket items on a regular basis to stay motivated. To wit, being able to buy something worth $10,000 makes one happy on a daily basis, or at least as often as one thinks about it, whereas buying it will only create happiness for a few weeks.

&gt; * It matters very little whether your saving is done in a savings account, a checking account, a money market, or even under the mattress. As long as your cash position is less than $10,000, the difference in interest rates is minute. Besides, keeping a non-working cash position is useless for early retirement. 

&gt; * The so-called emergency fund is only useful for workers who live above or close to their means, but for extreme early retirement you live at less than half your means

&gt; * In a short while we’ll start building a position in a brokerage account. This will be accessible to be liquidated in case of any “emergency”.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Day 13: Insurance - http://earlyretirementextreme.com/day-13-insurance.html

&gt; * An emergency fund is essentially a form of unemployment insurance where you self-insure. This idea can easily be taken further. Consider for a moment what else could be self-insured? Your house? Your bicycle? Your stuff?

&gt; * Think of insurance as a money transfer from people who get into accidents less often to people who get into accidents more often with insurance companies taking a cut (this is called the combined ratio) of typically 10% to arrange this transfer.

&gt; * Would you voluntarily take this offer? Only if you are more risk prone than average (say you eat 5 double cheese burgers a day, smoke, and have an annual car accident) or you can not afford to cover the loss if the event happens to you or both.

&gt; * For instance, due to the prevalence of frivolous lawsuits we carry liability insurance. You never know if someone is going to stumble on your door step and then decide that their clumsiness was your fault. We do however not insure our stuff as this can easily be replaced many many times in case it gets destroyed

&gt; * For my health insurance, I carry a HDHP, which has very low fees, because I carry all risk from $0 to $3500/year after which the insurance pays the rest. Thus I’m protected from catastrophic loss but I have a fairly large economical stake in my health. The money to cover this comes from a HSA which can be increased tax-free by $3050 per year. (Editor note, before the ACA). 

&gt; * This is all relative to say having your health insurance through your job and worrying about getting so sick that you eventually get laid off unable to work after 1.5 years thus losing your nice corporate health care, and then what?

Day 14: Investing for Early Retirement, part 1 - http://earlyretirementextreme.com/day-14-investing-for-early-retiremen.html


&gt; * If you plan to retire early, you are eventually going to become a “professional” money manager as in a sense you will be managing your money for money. You will, of course, be operating on a much smaller scale and so you will have a much easier job than a real professional who is subject to regulations and other restrictions. 

&gt; * One size does not fit all! You need to be sufficiently wise to acknowledge whether you are informed or uninformed. If you believe you are an informed investor but you actually are an uninformed investor, you will lose money to informed investors. If you believe you are an uninformed investor but actually are an informed investor, you will lose opportunity cost. You must realistically determine this for yourself.

&gt; * Learning to manage your own investments is not easy and you will have to spend considerable time educating yourself. (Editor note: the vast majority of individuals should stick with index funds, but like their nutrition, they might be overeating due to lack of understanding). 

&gt; * Detailed investments are covered on the Wiki: https://wiki.earlyretirementextreme.com/w/index.php?title=Investments

Day 15: The First Two Weeks of the Makeover (The personal quiz) - http://earlyretirementextreme.com/day-15-the-first-two-weeks-of-the-make-over.html

&gt; * The first two weeks of the makeover covered the most important aspects of the ERE strategy. Out of those 14 items, the most important are housing (day 1), transportation (day 7), and food (day 3). Ignoring those and focusing on the rest will only bring about cosmetic changes.

&gt; * In fact, if I were to create a quiz, and actually I am, housing would be worth 30 points, transportation would be worth 20 points, food 10 points and the other 11 subjects about 4-5 points each.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Day 16: The Stuff You Actually Keep and Use - http://earlyretirementextreme.com/day-16-the-stuff-you-actually-keep-and-use.html


&gt; * One of my core philosophies is to maximize the quality of things I spend a lot of time with/in/on and minimize the quantity of things I do not spend a lot of time with/in/on.

&gt; * This way the reduction in quantity pays for the more expensive quality. This works well because in our society, quality is often underpriced and quantity is overvalued. What I mean by this is that it is easy to earn enough to afford high quality because wages are so set so as to be allow one to afford enormous quantities. Quality is also cheap because people do not put value on it.

&gt; * One example: Six pairs of shoes at $20 that last 2 years each vs one pair of $120 shoes that last 12 years. Which is better? Obviously the latter. The cost is the same, but you are wearing something that is better constructed for a good many years. 


&gt; * Other high quality items may command a substantial used price. For instance, a watch acquired for $200 new will have a used price of very little five years later. A watch acquired for $800 will probably sell for close to the same five years later. Which is less expensive?

&gt; * The three set strategy: Plan to keep everything you own forever(*), consider everything you own for sale at all times, minimize the use of resources.

&gt; * Over time (years), consequently, your stuff will increase in quality and decrease in quantity.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Day 17: Maintaining and Repairing Things - http://earlyretirementextreme.com/day-17-maintaining-andrepairing-things.html

&gt; * As I have explained before, it mostly comes down to housing, transportation, and food. There are really no magic tricks other than discovering that you will be just as happy — but probably more motivated — if you spend 20% of what you’re currently spending while saving the rest.

&gt; * Today, I’m going to talk about repairing and maintaining things. As a society of “use and throw away” these skills and habits have entirely fallen into disrepair.

&gt; * The challenge thus comes in two parts — and I can empathetically state that this is the area that I find to be the most challenging: You must acquire things that have been constructed to be repairable and You must learn to do some or most of these repairs yourself.

&gt; * For the first item, I’m not and I’m never suggesting that you toss a functional object just to buy another object. That is just wrong! You wouldn’t toss a pet either just because you lost interest or found something cuter, right? Ownership implies responsibility: You were responsible for digging raw resources out of the ground and now you’re responsible for getting the maximum use out of the object, so there 

&gt;  * If it’s built of metal, wood, or natural fibers, it is typically repairable.

&gt; * For the second item, you must get in the habit of maintaining your stuff. This usually means cleaning after use, storing things well, and replacing or repairing breaking parts before they start breaking down other parts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Day 18: Join a Challenge - http://earlyretirementextreme.com/day-18-join-a-challeng.html


&gt; * Some people like challenges and if so, adopting a challenge is a good way to stay motivated. Just think of the 100 push up challenge, the buy nothing for a year challenge, the no-car challenge, the X dollar a month food challenge, the no impact challenge, and so on

&gt; * Finding a challenge is good, because it provides you with some rules and often there is much creativity and a greater sense of accomplishment involved with finding ways to solve problems under those restrictions rather than just using the traditional method of paying by credit card and arguing with a representative customer service until you get (or go) your way.

&gt; * For instance, if you take a packaging challenge e.g. having to store all packaging in your house, not only will you gain a real understanding of all the superfluous wrapping that consumer products ship with, but you will also find ways to avoid buying things that are excessively packaged. If you start weighing your outgoing garbage, maybe you will start composting to reduce that number.

&gt; * Most of those challenges are finite in time, typically a year. I don’t know why that is? Possibly because it provides people with a way out? Or maybe it provides people with a goal or a finish line after which they can revert to their old habits. I think this completely defeats the purpose, unless you’re only looking for a book deal which seems to be a dime a dozen on those kind of projects. 

&gt;  * So just ignore the deadline and adopt it as a lifestyle. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Day 19: Getting Rid of Your TV - http://earlyretirementextreme.com/day-19-getting-rid-of-your-tv-addiction.html

&gt; * and computer games, apps, reddit, netflix, and any other consuming vegetable activity. 

&gt; * While I can not prove this, I think not having a TV, or at least not watching it, is a big factor when it comes to choosing unconventional paths. Naturally, there’s this popular idea that TV feeds the masses with certain values, but I believe this is exaggerated.

&gt; * Most programming offers fairly reticent opinions and is quite free of content. The great beauty of TV is therefore not so much that it acts as a form of active propaganda steering people towards certain goals, but that it keeps people from having goals in the first place. 

&gt; * When TV was invented it was thought to be a great opportunity, a great teaching tool for quickly reaching the masses. However, ironically, it turned out that TV was much better employed to keep people from learning

&gt; * During the day, professionals attend to their jobs. During the evenings, they vegetate in front of their TVs, thereby preventing them from learning anything, and this effectively keeps them in their jobs.

&gt; * Retiring early is not just about saving enough money. It is also about learning things with the aim to save money as well as with the aim to find something with which to occupy yourself once you retire from employment.

&gt; * Watching TV prevents this development, that is: 1. It prevents you from developing a dissatisfaction with your current life. 2. It prevents you from developing new ideas. 3. It prevents you from learning anything that can change your life.

&gt;  * In other words, it promotes the status quo; your status quo. In other words, if you want to stay where you are. Keep your TV, but if you want to change, maybe the first thing to do is to get rid of your TV.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Day 20: Own Classics - http://earlyretirementextreme.com/day-20-own-classics.html

&gt; * When something stands the test of time, it becomes a classic. As far as I am concerned, everything else is “contemporary junk” items. I would strongly encourage anyone interested in living well on very little to “invest”, that is, buy and own classics rather than cheap—frugal is sometimes used as a euphemism—junk.

&gt; * Another way that classics are cheap to own is that you will be able to pay the lower used price, which admittedly is close to the new price if it’s still in production. However, should you decide to sell again a few years from now, you will be able to sell again at the same price or even perhaps slightly higher or at worst slightly lower. The difference can be thought of interest or rent depending on whether the return is positive or negative.

&gt; * Accumulating classics require slightly more knowledge than driving over to the mall and swiping the credit card, but it is really not that hard. 

&gt;  * Here’s a short list to get started: shoes, fishing reel, binoculars, pocket knife, wristwatch, music instruments (non-electronic), clothes (filson, barbour, burberry, etc.), pens, furniture, silverware. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Day 21: Investing for Early Retirement, part 2 - http://earlyretirementextreme.com/day-21-investing-for-early-retirement.html

&gt; * As mentioned in part 1, I am reluctant to give specific investment advice on this blog. The reason is that unlike frugality and personal finance, which anyone can learn in a couple of months (the difficult part is following through), investing properly takes at least a couple of years (here too, the difficult part is following through).

&gt; * I saved money for 4 years before I even began investing. I’m throwing this out there, because an extreme early retirement strategy does not rely on compound returns simply because there are not very many years during which it can compound. If the market is with you, you may reach your goal in 4.5 years instead of 5.5.

&gt; * (The article goes into specific methods related for his best interest)

&gt;*  Yet as I said, investing is very individual. Do whatever makes you sleep well at night.

BlockChain,Taxation of Cryptocurrency is Needed with Guidance of Supplemental IRS,"Cryptocurrencies are regulated at federal level in the US. They are characterized as money, property, commodity and a security by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCen), the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) respectively.

The industry participants are waiting for answers and clarification as there are uncertainties to the taxation of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology due the multi\-classification.

On 30th May, the American Institute of Certified Accounts (AICPA) sent a letter to the IRS for the second time asking for more specification on cryptocurrency taxation beyond Notice 2014\-21 which treats cryptocurrency as property. The first letter by AICPA to the IRS was sent two years back on June 10, 2016.

Annette Nellen, CPA, CGMA, Esq., chair of the AICPA Tax Executive Committee said, “We recommend the IRS release immediate guidance regarding the tax treatment of virtual currency transactions, similar to that of Notice 2014\-21 so that authoritative guidance exists.”

American Bar Association’s Tax Section also addressed in a letter to the IRS during the first quarter of this year about the issue,“Specifically, we request additional guidance that will address items from the original Notice 2014\-21, and new issues that are relevant to the 2017 tax year, such as chain splits, forks that have arisen subsequent to the release of the original notice.”

Last year I sold approximately $130,000 worth of stock to help pay for a down payment for a house. I have always filed my Federal returns to pay capital gains tax. I received a call today from my tax professional who said he did the research and believes that I have to pay State capital gains taxes as well which I admittedly did not know would be a requirement for a sale of stock and would require me to pay many thousands of more dollars than I originally anticipated.

personalfinance,Current home or move now? How much?,"I'll try to make it pretty brief because I'm not sure the best option here and want opinions.

My wife and I net income: 6700ish/month, not counting bonuses, after retirement/healthcare/taxes. Our jobs are very stable even if the economy were to tank neither of us would likely be laid off.

Own both cars, don't expect anything big for 3\-4 years.

No School Loans

Day care costs: 900/month

Current Mortgage: 165k house, I put 20&amp;#37; down 5 years ago, I owe 120k on it. (3.8 interest rate 30/yr)

Savings: 35k in savings

Our current house is about to need several things done: 

New Roof 10k

New Floors 10k

New Deck (may be savable but it is beginning to sink), would probably scrap and get poured patio, still expensive \- 2\-3k

Driveway fixed (also sinking a bit needs to be fixed) \- 1k

Optional:

Kitchen Slight Makeover \- 5k

I am thinking moving may be a better option since I think we could afford it, but at the same time I don't want to be house poor. We are going to extend our family to 2 Adults/2 Children in the near future and our house would be a snug fit in my opinion at least. 

Our house would sell for 225k\+ in the current market. I would roll in the 60k in value I gained from my house into the mortgage 100&amp;#37;. Most of the fixes I said above would not postively affect or negatively affect the value of my current home.

personalfinance,Pay off OSAP? vs. Invest? vs. Buy a House?,"Hey All, 

I was hoping to get some advice on what I should do regarding the situation I'm in. I'm undecided so I'd appreciate any advice and guidance. 

I'll be going into my last year of University this coming year (Sept 2018 \- April 2019). I am working this summer so I am making and saving to pay off my loan. So my total loan NOT accounting for the last year is 30,600. I assume this amount will increase since I will be applying for OSAP in my last year of studies to approx. 39,000 max. I hope. I currently have just enough money to pay it off. My total savings after working part\-time and working summers I have a total of  33,247.04 saved as of today. After this summer ends I am hoping to have around 43,000 in total savings (this is what I have setup after budgeting my income vs. expenses). I have already paid rent for the next year in full so the only cost I would have would be utilities and food, which if I work part\-time in the school I should be able to cover. So my question is what should I do? or better put what would be the wise thing to do with this much money? I'm young and not stupid with money but I'm trying to learn how to be better with my money. 

**Summary:**

My loan: 30,600 \+ 8,400 (Cost of last year estimate) 

*= 39,000 approx.*

My Savings: 33,247 \+ 9,735(savings this summer planned) = 43,000 approx. \- expenses for the year ($1500 max) 

*= 41,500 approx.*

**OSAP breakdown:**

* Federal Student Loans \- 70&amp;#37;  *\[Rate: 2.7\%(prime) \+ 2.5\% = 5.2\%\]*
* Provincial Student Loans \- 30&amp;#37; *\[Rate: 2.7\%(prime) \+ 1\% = 3.7\%\]*

So 70&amp;#37; of the loan is considered Federal and 30&amp;#37; of the loan is considered Provincial. They have different interest rates as noted above. 

Also, OSAP applies 6 months of interest onto the Federal Loan (is this compounded interest???) and no interest for 6 months on the Provincial loan. This is considered the 6 month grace period after you graduate and for these 6 months I do not have to make any payments. 

**Questions:**

1. Should I pay off my student loans just before I graduate? That way I pay no interest just principle and be debt free.

2. Should I invest the money in stocks, mutual funds, GIC's, etc..Open to idea's......

3. Should I invest and buy property? (this ones just random, thought I'd ask haven't really considered it an option tbh)

If I'm wrong about anything please let me know. I appreciate any advice or if someone could point me in the right direction I would also appreciate that. Thanks for taking the time to read this. 

Have a great day,

personalfinance,Credit card payment strategy advice?,"Hi new here and need some financial advice because I dont think with my brain :(. So a friend and I was thinking of setting up a video production company and used my cc to the max to buy cameras and stuff we need for production. Now a month later, we don't have much clients and I have a cc bill of almost $5000. I called my credit card and they're willing to set me up for monthly payment of around 300$ for 24months with 1.5&amp;#37; interest. But when I computed it, it looks like I will pay a total of 7000$ because of the interest rate. Should I accept this setup or should I sell some of my stuff, keep looking for video jobs with the hopes of making a dent at that $5000 bill, let it get interest for this month (3.5&amp;#37; finance charge) and keep working until the next month and hope I can again pay enough to lessen that bill. Any thoughts?

TLDR: 5000$ CC bill, 2 choices:

1) Accept credit card company's terms of paying monthly for 24months at 300$ per month but in the end pay 5000$ because of interest

2) Pay more than the minimum per month with the hopes that I can strike a nice handsomely paid gig one month and pay it all off",finance

I decided to make a quick example of a W2 worker vs a real estate investor making $125,000 per year filing jointly. I am using the Kentucky tax rate (5.8%) for this example because that is what I pay. Please let me know if you see any errors. It is also worth considering that property depreciation is only deferring tax. However, if I die my children would inherit the property on a stepped-up bases and not pay any recapture taxes on the depreciation. Also, retirement accounts would be available for either person so they were not included in this example. This is merely an example and every situation is different. I am not trying to convert anyone from index funds, just thought it was worth sharing

The W2 worker pays $28,162 in Fed, State, Local Tax, SS, &amp; Medicare - Giving them an annual take-home of $96,839

The real estate investor pays $5,049 in Fed, State taxes - Giving them an annual take-home of $119,951

The difference comes to $23,113 or nearly 24% more take home pay for the real estate investor

Edit: Just for clarity, the $125,000 rental income is net after all associated expenses

personalfinance,Save for Home VS Pay off Student Loan,"Seeking some advice on my family’s current situation. Wife and I are both 31 and we currently live in Chicago. We have an 18-month-old daughter and a son due this September. We currently rent but are in the early stages of planning to purchase our first home. Overall, we are in good shape financial (specifics below) but we do have a never ended mountain of student loan debt we are trying to climb out of.  I consistently go back and forth on what the best path forward should be for our future. Save for a house or just throw a large chunk of money at our student loans so we don't have to deal with them till 2030. I know this is a big no-no, but I've recently been thinking of withdrawing a portion of money from our 401Ks just to make them go away. Buying a house (suburbs) is important to us, and something we would like to do in the next 2-3 years.  But I also don't want to pay 1,200 a month in student loan payments for the next 10 years. 

Any advice?

**Specifics**

personalfinance,21 y.o. looking for 1st credit card with 688 credit score from student loans,"Backstory: I'm 21 years old and too out $2k loan for community college.  I went for a year and then stopped going and have been making small payments every month since then.  

I'm finally making some money now and looking to get a credit card because I want to buy a car from CarMax in a year or two. 

I make $26k/year, likely will increase to $29k in the next year.  

I don't make a whole lot but I save a ton by living frugally, working alot, and saving a ton of money.  

In a year when I want to buy my car.from CarMax I will have enough to put a $7 or $8k down payment and then I will lease the rest for 24 or 36 months. 

I'm looking for a credit card with good flight rewards because I travel whenever I get the chance.  

My credit score is 688 from paying off the small student loan the past 2 years and never missing a payment on it.  

I'm good with my money and plan on using a credit card on groceries, gas, and restaurants when I allow myself to go out twice a month.  

I know my credit line will likely be $500 or so on my first card but I'm only planning on using $200 or $300 of that on the necessities to rack up some reward points or miles.

Can you recommend a card with good airline miles as rewards preferrably?  I'm also open to other cards, doesn't matter what the interest rates are because I'm only using it for the bare necessities and I'm already extremely frugal as it is and will be paying in full every month.

personalfinance,Does the length and duration of my car loan impact my credit scores enough to justify the interest?,"I don't have a lot to complain about here, but I definitely don't want to pay more than I need to. I'm 28, was 27 when I took out this loan. My credit score has been very good for years, hovering around 750. I have been fortunate enough in life to have never needed a real loan of any kind. My thinking based on rudimentary advice I have been given was that I needed some kind of loan history to impact my credit in ways that a simple score doesn't indicate. I.E.: If I want to apply for a loan in the future, they will look and say I don't have any credit history to go off of as far as loans go. Perhaps I would not get a good interest rate or get declined.

So, I currently have about a $7000 balance on my car loan at about 4% interest. I have the ability to pay it off early penalty free if I want. It certainly would be more convenient for me to let that loan ride, but theoretically I *could* pay it off soon. It would just hurt to do. Still, it bothers me knowing that I'm in debt and paying interest. I have not noticed my credit score improve after 6 months of having this loan, although I understand there are different scores I may not have access to. 

To the point: Is it worth sacrificing my interest to improve my credit? Does having a history of loan credit *actually* improve my ability to get better rates in the future should I need another loan?

Thanks for your help.",finance

personalfinance,Clearing debt to buy a house in limited time,"I'll try to get very specific since I have an interesting situation.
I'm 28 and my wife is 24, we have a 1 year old and live in the California suburbs near the capital. My wife has MS and has trouble walking(I tell you this so you don't say ""just have her work more hours""), she got a job she loves and works about 20 hours a week for about $14/hr. I work at a software company making $57k/yr with the potential for $12k/yr in comps. We are finally both working stable jobs we love after several years of shitty jobs and dealing with all the trips to the doctors to get her diagnosis. We struggled for a while during that and racked up some credit card debt in my name paying rent/school/food/etc. After taxes each check is around $1650 for me bi-weekly and for her about $600 monthly. We are both maxing out our 401k options for employer match. We had a family friend trying to sell us her house for several months in our dream part of town, after it being on the market for too long she agreed to rent it to us at a loss on her end($1500/m) on the condition we buy it in two years.
We have $13k and $7k debt on CC with 18% interest and $1800 for my wisdom teeth interest free for another few months and then goes up to 24%. She has about $1000 in debt in her own name. We had $7k in savings but used $1500 to get into the house and our apartment is agreeing to break the lease with no fee, just a prorated rent fee. We both have our own ""Side-hustle"" and I make about $400-700/m doing that and she makes about $100/m. We need to pay this debt off, and I know we should do avalanche or snowball method but I'm wondering if a personal loan with a better interest rate would be a good idea. I know I could put my head down and pay it off, but we need to save a down payment as well. The house was on the market for more than all comps in the area so I think the down payment we need according to simple math is more than we would actually need and achievable.

TL:DR We have ~$22k in debt and want to pay it down super fast and want to know if a personal loan would be better to avoid all the interest. Or use all our savings to at least knock one out. California living is rough and we're trying to secure a home while the market is stabilizing(hopefully).",finance

About a year ago i was convinced to transfer that into a combo policy with NW mutual with additional disability insurance. I pay $171 a month for the entire policy. I transferred 2k cash value from the USAA universal life policy and after a year of the NW policy my total cash value is up to $2500 dollars versus the $4100 I've paid into the policy thus far. 

My current insurance/savings situation is about 8k in a Roth in which I contribute about $100 to monthly, $15/ month for term life (250k), and about 9k in a separate savings account.

I'm torn as to if I should just cut my losses and cash out the Universal Life/Disability policy given that its usually not recognized as a great investment, but I don't know if I'm concerned for the wrong reasons. Right now the Death Benefit is $145,257 and $565 of that is from dividends. The cash value starts to exceed the amount I've paid around year 7.

personalfinance,(US) I worked at a company long enough ago that they offered employees a retirement plan at the time (as a benefit). They are pretty much shutting down the plan and have thrown me a few options for what to do with the money. I am a bit befuddled as to the best path...,"Hello,

I worked at a company long enough ago that they offered employees a retirement plan at the time (as a benefit).  Over the years they have offered buyouts but now they are pretty much shutting down the plan and have thrown me a few options for what to do with the money.

Some of the relevant facts that I figure help guide this decision:
* have no debt to pay down
* don't need the money for anything right now (find me in /r/frugal not /r/moneybags)
* we are on a nice glide path to retirement given our meager plans and current savings
* current retirement plan did not count on this money
* taking the check directly I don't believe would bounce me up a tax bracket

The offered me the following options

Lump sum - I just get a check in the mail.  There seems to be 30 days to put it into an eligible employer plan allowance.  I am not sure if my companies 401k that I max out each year counts toward this.  I know it would not get matched, but can I avoid paying taxes on it for now?  If I keep it, they take 20% toward federal off the top.  Then we settle up in April I guess.

Immediate Annuity payment - breaks out into a variety of monthly payments for life.  Some included survivor payments, and a 10 year certain and continuous annuity.

Defer payment until later (request-able after my early or normal retirement date).  Basically the amount here would be better than the payout if I survive for 7 years.  This does not take into account if my investing would be better or taxes hitting me for taking it out now.

Most of my retirement is in a 401k and a bunch of other non-tax sheltered stuff.  My wife has her's in a SEP-IRA.  

Frankly I was expecting a letter at some point saying ""Sorry, we just lost it all in vegas..."" but apparently not.

Can anyone tell me what are the sort of things I should consider in picking from the above options?  I would like to not take a tax hit on it since I can sock it away till retirement.  Otherwise, can I roll it into something like my 401k or should I delay payments until I retire, assuming the company they turned this over too has not headed to vegas :)

personalfinance,Upcoming marriage has me looking to manage my retirement funds better.,"Hi PF, 

My fiancee' and I are tying the knot here in about a week! I am try and take a better look at my retirement finances and gain a better understanding, as well as set myself up for later.  I'm a frequent reader, but still feel as though I'm lost in the void here when it comes to fund choices. My fiancee' and I have frequently taken advice from PF,  especially in regards to retirement. 

I'm currently 26 and maximizing my  Roth IRA in a Vanguard TD 2055 fund. My future wife is doing the same. She has her 401k taken care of and has had her fund choices looked over and given the PF stamp of approval! I'm looking to do the same here - as I want to start contributing more to my 401k than I currently am.  Perhaps to later pursue FI, but for now I'm just interested in a little head start :) 

I selected my funds quite some time ago, based on the notion that I should have 100 - (my age) in stocks and the rest in bonds. I've slowly realized that this is not the case ( based on skimming posts here). So, since i'm so far from retirement, I've decided to switch to a far more aggressive stance. 

 My 401k is through TIAA, I wanted to present you with my fund options, my elected choices, and ask for PF's feedback. 

I've taken the liberty of removing the Lifecycle TD funds, but I do have the options from 2020 - 2055. 

I've also not listed the bond funds, as i've been informed that I shouldn't be in them for at least 10 years.

&gt; Argentina secured a $50 billion stand-by arrangement from the International Monetary Fund to help restore investor confidence as the government takes aim at double-digit inflation and a widening budget deficit.

&gt; The rescue program’s size, which would run for 36 months, is the largest ever in IMF history though it will depend on how much the government taps. It comes amid an emerging market sell off that has shaken developing economies around the world including Brazil, Turkey, Indonesia and Mexico and has forced central banks to hike interest rates.

&gt; Of the economies that have been hit hardest, Argentina tops the list. It has indicated it plans to draw on the first tranche of the program, after which it will treat the loan as precautionary, the government said in a statement.

&gt; ""**The amount we received is 11 times Argentina’s quota**, which reflects the international community´s support of Argentina,"" Treasury Minister Nicolas Dujovne said in Buenos Aires. “It’s very good news that the integration with the world allows us to receive this support.""

personalfinance,What to do with $9k...Roth IRA Rollover,"I started making contributions to my prior company's traditional 401k straight out of college.  A couple years later, I realized how much money I would be owing in taxes down the road, and switched over my contributions and company match to a Roth 401k.

I recently left that company and direct rolled over both balances to IRAs.  Both the Roth and Traditional IRAs have $9000 each.

The goal:  Save up as much post-tax money as possible for retirement via Roth contributions.
The dilemma:  In order to roll over my Traditional $9k balance to the Roth, I'd owe roughly $2200 in federal+state income taxes.

Short-term, I don't see the advantage to budgeting another $2500 over the course of this year to pay the government for $9k.  Which leads to my question-- 

Considering I plan to keep contributing to my Roth-- Am I wealthier long-term, down the road if...
(1) I bite the bullet now and roll over the $9k Traditional into the Roth?
or
(2) I leave the $9k Traditional alone, most likely in a target date fund, and never touch it?",finance
personalfinance,End of year high school research paper: I chose personal finance in high school,"I’m a junior in high school and chose to write why personal finance courses should be taught in all high schools. Class is AP Comp.

Why Personal Finance Needs to be Taught in High School
    
As of today only one state has received an A+ grade from the CCCFL for their financial literacy courses taught in high school, while many states offer no personal finance courses at all. High school students are subject to many dangerous ploys that are obscure and meant to lure them into costly decisions as soon as they turn eighteen. This may be through credit card offers, student loans, elaborate scams, or simply deceitful advertising. These traps may stay with the student for the rest of their life, such as identity theft or high interest debt that will take decades to pay off. Statistics reveal that 75% of credit card carrying college students were unaware of late payment charges, additionally the late payments are typically the minimum amount required, so students still incur interest on the remaining amount of money they did not pay off.  As a result, they will ultimately pay an exuberant amount of money due to outrageous interest rates and hidden fees that come with the credit card. The consequences of the majority of states not requiring financial literacy courses to be taught in high school are horrific and result in lifelong struggle and hardship for many students. Students desperately need help and lack the basic financial knowledge they need to protect and help them immediately following high school, and mandatory personal finance classes in all states would fix this problem and help all students.
    

Perhaps the most misunderstood and most costly decision a student will make early in their adulthood will be signing up for the first credit card offer they recieve. A tactic used by credit card companies in the past would be to bombard students with attractive offers as soon as they turn eighteen. Additionally, these companies often downplay or hide the terms that consist of high fees or increasing interest rates after the first 6 months. For example, Bank of America recently settled a lawsuit for deceiving customers and charging them for services they did not sign up for when acquiring a credit card-- Bank of America ultimately reimbursed customers over 66 million dollars.  Financial literacy classes would teach students to be wary of these hidden fees or conditions and to do their due diligence before signing up for a credit card, potentially saving them from unnecessary debt and stress. More recently, credit cards will require a parent to co-sign for young students and will cap the amount of the money they may put on the card, thankfully protecting the student-- and the credit card company. Should a student acquire a credit card to build their credit, they should use a secured credit card which requires a down-payment which will be held for the life of the account, and allows the cardholder to only spend up to that amount. Personal finance classes would teach students the responsibilities that come with a credit card and what to look for when signing up for one, such as no annual fees and low interest rates-- although students should be making full payments at the end of each month.
    

While students must be wary on how much money they spend and put on their credit cards, they must be more cautious on how much they are saving. As proclaimed by Warren Buffett, “Do not save what is left after spending; instead spend what is left after saving.” 
A student’s savings rate will determine their financial future and provide them with a look into their future financially, allowing them to plan retirement and provide them with a sense of security. A financial literacy class would teach students about the minimum 15% savings rate recommended by most financial experts, while many experts say one’s savings rate should surpass 50% after all debt is paid off. A 35% difference is huge and truly shows the consequences of acquiring debt and why everyone should avoid it, with the potential exceptions of a mortgage and student loans-- as a last resort. If students are taught the fundamentals of saving in high school and are able to practice good habits, they will be set up for a successful future and also help them in college when they have little money to spend. An alarming statistic reveals 4 in 10 millennials are overwhelmed with debt, while over half of millennials are living paycheck to paycheck (Source 2). Had these people been taught the fundamentals of saving early in their life, these statistics may be different. The more than half of millennials living paycheck to paycheck will be unable to build a nest egg to retire with unless they change their habits and cut expenses, such as avoiding car payments they can’t afford and following a budget. It appears many millennials do not follow Warren Buffett’s philosophy, as saving is obviously not a priority and the majority lack emergency funds that they should have built early on. They are consequently putting themselves in a dangerous position in the case of an unexpected health problem or the potential loss of their job, in addition they lack a sense of security and may be constantly riddled with stress.
    

A financial literacy class would teach high school students where to park their money after they have built an emergency fund. But first, know that the emergency fund should consist of 3-6 months income and be held in a savings account with an interest rate greater than 1%. While a 1% yield doesn’t beat inflation, it is unimportant since the majority of one’s savings will be held in low cost index funds yielding much more. Personal finance classes would teach students the value of low cost index funds-- specifically those that mirror the entire US stock market-- while teaching the benefits of maxing out tax-deferred accounts before anything else. Students would learn to max their IRA, or individual retirement account, to the max amount-- either $5500 or $6500 if the contributor is older than 50. The two types of IRAs are traditional and roth, and while both have different benefits and rules, most experts would recommend students to max out their Roth IRA every year, especially since they are more likely to be in low tax brackets. This is beneficial because only earned, taxed income may be placed into Roth IRAs and all gains, such as dividends or when one decides to sell an investment, are tax free! To know whether it is best for oneself to be utilizing a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA, one must predict their future and think if they will be in a higher tax bracket when retired-- note that tax brackets can change and tax rates may increase in the future. To quote Warren Buffett, a strong believer in the index fund, “The rich invest in time, the poor invest in money.” The following figure features an initial investment of $10,000 at an annual 8% interest rate-- the past 40 year average for Vanguard’s total US stock market index fund-- and reveals the power of compound interest and why all people should be investing in time instead of money. 

-FIGURE OF COMPOUND INTEREST- 

The figure shows the results of a $10,000 investment at an 8% interest rate, one investment with simple interest and the other with compound interest. After fifty years with a compound interest rate of 8%, the $10,000 is now worth over $450,000. This is with no additional contributions! Only the initial investment. The ability to utilize compound interest, such as investments in the stock market, will yield the investor much more money rather had it all been sitting in a savings account. We consequently see that investing in time is much more beneficial than investing in money. In other words, decisions shouldn’t be made based off what would yield the most money in the shortest amount of time, instead the costs and benefits should be weighed with a long term time frame in mind. These returns are possible because compound interest allows the investor to earn interest not only the initial investment, but also on the money the interest has earned in the past, while simple interest only earns the investor interest on their initial investment. While in the past 40 years the total US stock market has yielded an average 8% return, not every year will yield 8% in returns. For example, the total US stock market yielded over 20% over a dozen times in the past 40 years, some years reaching over 30% returns! While in contrast, there have been multiple years of negative returns, resulting in the decline of the price of investments. For these reasons, the buy and hold strategy glorified by Warren Buffett should be implemented; a common mistake made repeatedly from both new and veteran investors is to sell when the markets crash-- the worst possible time to sell. The markets may be volatile in the short and corrections could exceed 30%, but this time is a blessing for those who take advantage and buy more, since stocks are on ‘sale’ and will exceed their all time highs-- as they always have-- in a matter of years. Index funds are passively managed and beat over 98% of actively managed funds over a 40 year time period. Actively managed funds also have higher costs than index funds, so investors are paying more to make less money. Financial advisors are unnecessary and many do not keep the clients best interests in mind. Many advisors will actively manage your portfolio so they are paid the most money possible in commissions, while their clients yield a lower return than investors in passively managed, low cost index funds. Not all financial advisors or managers are bad and may provide a sense of security for new investors. The majority of investors are best off doing their own research and sticking a diversified three fund portfolio. Students would have learned in financial literacy classes to only buy stocks and index funds they are willing to hold for 10+ years, to never sell during market corrections, and to never invest money they do not have or money they owe to others.
    

Had financial literacy classes been taught to high schoolers, they would’ve taken away these key ideas that will provide them with the fastest path to financial independence with the least amount of risk: first, avoid as much debt as possible-- primarily credit card debt-- and if debt is acquired, it should have a low, fixed interest rate. An emergency fund consisting of at least 3 months income should exist in a savings account, and a budget should be set in place so money out of every paycheck is placed into retirement accounts until they are maxed. The retirement accounts should be invested in low cost index funds, never to be sold, and reflect the entire US stock market-- Vanguard’s funds are ideal. Credit card bills should be paid in full every month to avoid high interest debt, and everyone should strive to find a balance between reaching their financial goals and living a sustainable, happy life. It is extremely unfortunate personal finance courses are not taught in all high schools across the nation, and we see the consequences. Over half of millennials are living paycheck to paycheck-- even though unemployment rates are reaching all time low levels-- and many people are overwhelmed with debt. Many of these people will be relying on social security, which will be extremely difficult to live on for millennials considering their past spending habits. Future generations can learn from these mistakes and should be supplied with the knowledge they need through high school finance classes to allow them to live sustainable and positive lives.",finance

personalfinance,Multiple loan strategy a good idea?,"I’m looking at buying a new car. 
I went in to the dealership to discuss finance options &amp; the value of my current car (which I own 100%).

They offered me the car I’m after for 24k, with repayments of $98/wk over 7years- the repayments get lower over the course of the loan, and the interest rate was just under 10%. Unfortunately there is a fee to pay the loan off early, starts at around $750 and also lowers over time.  Another factor, and the one I think makes their finance worth it, is that they will extend the manufacturers warranty from 5yrs to 8yrs. 

I got all the info I was after and left, and looked in to other loan options as soon as I was home, finding I could get a discounted interest rate (around 6%, which works out to around $70/wk I think) as my credit rating is in the highest category, BUT, if I borrow through a lender other than the dealer I won’t get the 8 year warranty; the warranty is the main draw for me to get a new car by the way.
SO was wondering if there is any major negative to borrowing a majority from the lower rate lender, and then the rest from the dealer to get the longer warranty?

Also, when they valued my car for trade in they really lowballed me, offering 3k-3.5k max, current market value is 6k-7k and my car is in ok condition with full log book service history, so I thought I’d just chase down a private sale for a few extra thousand- so hopefully I’d only need to borrow around 18k. 

Thanks for any help!

Edit: Ok. Not gonna do it. I’ll keep saving for now, do a LOT more learning, thanks very much for the advice &amp; links- happy to owe you guys one, rather than the dealers thousands:)",finance
Forex,"""the dollar will move higher as capital again flees Europe""","Comment from ZeroHedge (better than the article it's commenting):

&gt;""And  anyone who thinks that the US currency is going to explode higher when  the ECB is about to ends its QE program needs their head examined."" This  is exactly the reason why the dollar will move higher as capital again  flees Europe. This has been happening since 2011 moving not only the  dollar higher but also the Dow. Again Armstrong Economics computer  models forecast all of this back in 2009 predicting dollar strength and  the US equity markets moving higher from international capital flows.  Again in June of 2016 the models forecast that if gold did not break the  1362 reversal level at July's close this would indicate capital is  again moving out of Europe and this would cause massive dollar strength  and the Dow would continue to move higher. Gold closed at 1361 dropping  to around the 1100 handle and the dollar gained strength and the Dow  moved much higher. In fact there was so much capital being converted  from euros to dollars that this actually created a dollar shortage in  foreign markets prompting the FED to ask all central banks with excess  dollars to flood the international system. Even China did so as the  dollar was making US imports to China extremely expensive and hurting  their exports. Of course the alt media was full of claims that China was  dumping dollars and treasuries as they no longer had any faith in the  assets. To show you how wrong the alt media was, China then started to  buy treasuries in late Jan. 2017 for over a year buying billions a month  to replace what had been sold. Of course the alt media has been  claiming for over 5 years that the dollar and Dow would collapse ""any  day""  Bullshit!  
&gt;  
&gt;    The models have forecast that as we move to the end of 2018 the  capital flight will again accelerate out of the EU and move into dollars  and the Dow as Europe comes to a head by 2021. It is flat broke.  Spain's pension fund runs completely out in 2018, (along with many  others including the MEPs pensions in Brussels), all of France's cities  are insolvent, (migrant cost), and has ask for help, over 50&amp;#37; of all  German cities are insolvent, (again migrants), and even the German  Health Ministry announced yesterday that they completely  ""underestimated"" the cost of migrant health care and now has over a $3  billion deficit. This is a time when German industry is complaining to  Berlin that they must lower taxes so they can compete or they are  threatening to move production to the US. Germany has already the  highest taxes of all any western countries. These are not isolated cases  but is happening in most of the EU. Just look at Italy and Spain. This  is the tip of the iceberg. Of course we have Sweden sending out notices  to all citizens to prepare for at least a week with no government help  and the National Guard announcing a nationwide ""drill"" and are you ready  for this. The reason? The Russians! You can't make this crap up. Why  the hell would Russia want to occupy Sweden? The people in Europe has  totally lost it.  
&gt;  
&gt;   The ECB knows it must taper or more capital flees as the euro goes  south even faster at the end of the year. This means the only sector to  buy toxic sovereign debt is the private sector and they will demand  much higher rates due the the risks and to pay for the much higher  insurance associated with the risks. My question is what firm would  underwrite and sell risk insurance on any sovereign debt in the EU. Even  Germany is in trouble and in addition both Italy and Spain own the  Bundesbank over 1 trillion euros each thru the Target 2 Settlement  Mechanism as capital also fled to Germany. The reason is that when the  euro goes the capital will be converted to marks, hopefully. The  remaining capital is taking no risk and has and still is moving to  dollars.  
&gt;  
&gt;    The computer models track domestic and international capital  flows and large amounts of capital moving out of a market or country or  trading block always causes severe economic downturns, bank failures,  businesses failures, sovereign debt defaults and the collapse of  existing governments. Ring a bell? By 2021 the shit will have already  hit the fan! Where else is left but dollar assets which has become an  enormous problem for them as they have been desperate to weaken the  dollar not only so they can have some flexibility in bring back yield,  (think pensions here) and also when the capital again accelerates from  Europe to dollars. Are you really going to park it in any EU bank? EU  countries sovereign debt? Those dollars and that Dow don't look that buy  now, do they? It is not about a return ON capital but a return OF  capital. Leaving it in the EU means you get nothing!

I’m in the US and about to start my last year of college in the Fall. Usually my family is able to help me cover the cost of what I can’t get covered in federal student aid (~12-15k) but this year they just took out a mortgage and don’t want to hurt their credit any more by taking out the PLUS loan, so I’m looking into options for taking out private loans. I have two years of internship experience under my belt and can expect to make ~70k out of school in a relatively easy to get hired field (from what I know and have experienced at my school, 87% of those not going to grad school get jobs after graduation). 

With this in mind, should I favor a variable loan since I should be able to pay it off in 1-2 years tops and the interest rate will be low, or is the gamble far too much and I should just take a fixed rate? My credit score is around 720 if that’s helpful at all. Also, if anyone’s taken out private loans and could recommend a company to me, I’d appreciate that too. I’m considering Discover since I have my student credit card I used to build credit through them and haven’t had any issues.

1) do I put the $27k into the student loans when I know that my home equity will be able to knock out that balance next spring?
2) do I put the $27k into an IRA/roth IRA? Do I even qualify for this option? If so, how much could I put in?
3) do I just invest the money in a Vanguard brokerage account?
4) do I ramp up my employer 401k to its max and just use this money to replace the income that would be sent into my 401k?

* Can be fined for anything based on the ESFI's discretion and are obliged to pay in 15days Among other things.

This has received alot of flak from the international esports community and caused ESFI to to release a statement which is basically PR bullshit and no guarantee that anything will change.

Economics,The Fed Will Let Inflation Eat Your Dollars,[deleted],finance
personalfinance,"If you haven't filed your US Federal tax return yet because you owe and can't pay, file it by June 14 to avoid the higher late-filing penalty.","Taxpayers who owe tax and file their federal income tax return more than 60 days after the deadline will generally face a higher late-filing penalty. Ordinarily, the late-filing penalty, also known as the failure-to-file penalty (FTF), is assessed when a taxpayer fails to file a tax return or request an extension by the return due date. This penalty, which only applies if there is unpaid tax, is usually 5 percent for each month or part of a month that a tax return is late.

If a tax return is filed more than 60 days after the April due date -- or more than 60 days after the October due date if an extension was obtained -- the minimum penalty is either $210 or 100 percent of the unpaid tax, whichever is less. This means that if the tax due is $210 or less, the penalty is equal to the tax amount due. If the tax due is more than $210, the penalty is at least $210. The late-filing penalty will stop accruing once the taxpayer files a complete and correct return.

The FTF penalty does not apply to the Taxpayers who met this year’s April 18 deadline to file their individual tax return. It also won’t apply to the Taxpayers who asked the IRS for a six-month extension of time to file, as long as they file by Oct. 15, 2018. 

In addition, the IRS urges Taxpayers to pay what they owe to avoid additional late-payment penalty and interest charges. The late-payment penalty, also known as the failure-to-pay penalty (FTP), is usually 0.5% of the unpaid tax for each month or part of a month the payment is late. Interest, currently at the rate of 5 percent per year, compounded daily, also applies to any payment made after the original April 18 deadline.

After a return is filed, the IRS will figure the penalty and interest due and bill the taxpayer. Normally, the taxpayer will then have 21 days to pay any amount due.

personalfinance,Should I pay off my mortgage or invest?,"I recently sold a piece of land so I have some excess cash sitting around. I am trying to decide whether to use this money to pay off my current mortgage or to invest this money. The most important thing is that if I invest, I want it to be as risk free as possible. 

My current mortgage is at a low rate of 3.75%, so theoretically if I could (almost) guarantee making more than this, I would go that route obviously. I only want to invest in fixed income that would yield higher than 3.75% after tax. What are some options for me to do this, and more importantly, should I be investing in some funds that have floating rates so that I can protect myself from rising interest rates?

Thanks in advance!

Edit: While I am aware of the benefits of paying off my mortgage, which I very well may do, I have my bearings covered, and my mortgage will not be a problem. While I know that there is a psychological benefit of getting it paid off first, I would prefer to be able to keep the money to then be able to invest differently later, or pay it off as I please. That being said, I appreciate the advice either way, but would love to hear some suggestions of funds that I may check out if you have any suggestions. I would just like to do my DD.",finance

btc,Run-up to August 1 (because of the implication),"With the 1\-year anniversary of the origination of BCH on the horizon, we need to remember that (for U.S. owners) there will be a significant reduction in taxes owed for the sale of coins. With this, I think it's important to recognize possible movements as possible pump specifically leading up to a massive August 2 sell\-off. 

I'm, of course, holding, but I've been thinking about this for a while and it sure seems to me like the most likely case is that people are going to compare their normal interest rate that would be applied to a short\-term sale to the difference they gain immediately at 1\-year, and begin making sales or trades, and continue those until the price has dropped by about that same percent difference.

Ripple,Monetary Policy in the Digital Age - IMF,"&gt; ""And unlike bank transfers, crypto asset transactions can be cleared and settled quickly without an intermediary. The advantages are especially apparent in cross-border payments, which are costly, cumbersome, and opaque. New services using distributed ledger technology and crypto assets have slashed the time it takes for cross-border payments to reach their destination from days to seconds by bypassing correspondent banking networks.""
&amp;nbsp;

&gt;""So we cannot rule out the possibility that some crypto assets will eventually be more widely adopted and fulfill more of the functions of money in some regions or private e-commerce networks.""
&amp;nbsp;

&gt;""As IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde noted in a speech at the Bank of England last year, “The best response by central banks is to continue running effective monetary policy, while being open to fresh ideas and new demands, as economies evolve.”""
&amp;nbsp;

IMO are the highlights of this article, but I recommend reading it. Central banks are feeling competitive pressure to innovate due to the fact that the existing system is not evolving to current economy demands. With this in mind, Ripple has placed itself perfectly in this ecosystem between ""crypto assets"" and regulatory bodies (IMO). We can already see banks adopting Ripple's technology, it's just a matter of time before they are FORCED to adopt.

personalfinance,College student seriously considering buying a house to rent out.,"That title probably aroused some emotions. Let me explain my background.

I am 20 years old and a rising junior in college (Aerospace engineering). I have an internship/scholarship that pays me a $36,000 stipend every year while I'm in school, covers my tuition and school fees, gives me an internship every summer until I graduate, and then a guaranteed government job after graduation. After graduation I will start off at $50,000/year and will be at $73,000 after 3 years.

I've been pretty frugal with my stipend so far and when I get paid next week I will have $20,000 saved up, and barring any unforseen calamities I'll be able to completely avoid touching that $20k if I want to. That means I want it to start making me some more money. 

My parents said I should look into buying a house for like $80,000 (make the 20k a down payment) that I rent out while I'm in school and then I'll have a place to live in for next summer's internship (since it's several hundred miles away from home) and when I graduate and move down here full time I'll already have started paying off a house. I have a very good credit score (well within the zone to get the best interest rates) so I think I'll qualify for a ~$60,000 bank loan. After I graduate I plan to live in the house for at least 5 years.

This sounds like an excellent way to get some passive income going and will also have my housing situation solved for the foreseeable future. But I'd like to get this sub's opinion on the idea as well as anything I should consider if I go through with it (like financing it for 15 years vs. 30, etc.)",finance
personalfinance,Advice on how I am doing and how to prepare for the future,"MODS: I don't post at all usually, sorry if I'm doing anything wrong.

tl;dr : Finally looked at my stuff, doing ok. Looking for any advice on how to improve.

Long time lurker, reached 100k in net worth and felt I need to take financial planning seriously. Took inventory and slowly trying to figure out how to plan for my future. **US, currently living in Florida. Age 28 software engineer 93,000 annual salary**. I am living pretty comfortably, and I think the budgets I set up fall in line with my lifestyle so some more saving could be done if needed. 

Current Assets: (Fidelity and various banks)

* Roth IRA - 11,350 (Late start, on contributing, but intend to do max every year)
  * FDEWX [fidelity index 2055] - 8,700
  * ITOT [S&amp;P ETF] - 2,600
* 401k - 33,271 (Switched jobs and didn't contribute for 2 years, probably can contribute more)
  * lifecycle fund 2055
* Stocks - 3,682 (mostly just toying around, completely new to stocks)
* Foreign stock - 13,469 (bad tip from almost 5 years ago, lost 30% since I started)
* Liquid cash in savings and checkings - 53,715
* Debts - Auto loan: 8,300 remaining @ 1.89%

I've been using Mint to keep track of my expenses for years, but honestly didn't really curate and follow budgets. I want to start changing that and have set some budget plans moving forward.

Intended budget plan:
[Sankey](https://imgur.com/YOlz6Qt)
[Pi-chart](https://imgur.com/ParAUSU)

Item | Budget
---|---
Retirement | 1,316.79
known expenses | 3,681.13
Food Budget | 350.00
Shopping Budget | 250.00
Dating budget | 200
Savings | 1,000.00
Unbudgeted/buffer | 355.94

Future planning:

* I'm thinking that once my savings hits 5-10k I'll move it to some investment account.
* No specific FIRE plans, shooting for 65 I guess? Been playing with retirement calculators but have no idea what I'm doing.
* Worried about my parents (age ~60), they are just above minimum wage pretty much with no real savings. They just started a traditional IRA and and have some life insurance I think. So I figure they would have just barely above social security, they own a condo worth about 130k according to zillow. I don't expect to be able to support them fully with my current career track, but I want to assist so they are able to live comfortably in 10 years.
* My current gf does not make a lot, and I also want to save for a wedding probably in the next 2-5 years. (Even if it doesn't work out saving is always good)

Questions:

1. Are my IRA/401k invested properly? Tried to follow the guides here.
1. Should I just pay off the auto loan? I figure since it's a relatively low interest rate, I could use it to boost my credit a bit. 
1. I want to have about 5k in buffer money, and 10k in emergency funds. That means I have 38k in excess cash I want to invest. I've been renting and don't know if I want to buy a house or not, my current area would probably increase in value in the 10 years but I have no idea where I am going to be. Should I just put it in more index funds while I decide? Or would a time-CD be better?
1. I think I have 12% directed to my 401k now. Would it be worthwhile to figure out how to hit the annual max? Would it be worthwhile? My employer only matches 6%.
1. After finally looking at where my money has been going, I've definitely been spending more than I thought I was. If I did my charts right, I'm at 18% in 401k/IRA, and 14% in 'saving', if that saving goes towards investments would having ~25% going toward retirement be good?

Ramblings: It's amazing where money leaks when you don't keep an eye on it. I feel like I could've done much better to hit 100k sooner and be in an even better position. Having said that, I realize that the best time is today and at 28, I don't think I'm in a terrible spot.",finance

I'll have a Bachelor's in chemical engineering and I'm confident that I'll be able to pay off the loans eventually.

personalfinance,(CAN) I currently have $5000 in my chequing account and I wish to invest them into something. Where do I invest in?,"This is my current situation.

* Age: 22
* Income: $1500 USD/month
* Objectives: Get reasonable amount of money annually
* Risk Tolerance: I am willing to take moderate risks if it is backed with evidence that it will succeed.
* I currently have no holdings
* No other assets besides my PC and clothes.
* I would prefer to be able to use this money in 2-5 years.
* I am currently $8000 in student debt.
* I have another $5000 that can be used to invest if there is a minimum threshold I need to surpass. I also reside in Ontario, Canada.

I only have basic knowledge of investing and find myself struggling on where to invest. While I research more and find help from registered financial reps, can you guys give me some insight on what is good to invest and what is not? I currently have nothing in my savings account as well due to the fact that it only provides 0.50% interest rate. Thank you!",finance

So im signed up for Navy Federal right now ( prob going to sign up for USAA for insurance, haven't looked at rates for them yet) , but I still have my WF account open with my 12k in it. I was thinking I could transfer all the money to my new NF savings to make things easier considering both interest rates are relatively the same .

And if I were to go with NF I would get the cash rewards credit card from them. But I was also talking to my dad about this and he said to just keep my money in WF or put it in a ""CD"". Not sure if I explained this all correctly, but hopefully I can get some input!

CryptoCurrency,Regulated Crypto Investment Advice Takes A Giant Leap Forward,"“We are thrilled to announce that Fusion Financial Advisors, LLC (“Fusion”) is now the first federally registered investment advisor regulated in the United States, offering diversified portfolios consisting of cryptocurrencies.

The Fusion team is currently hard at work building the technology infrastructure that will enable our mobile web-based investment advisory services, allowing Fusion to provide consumers additional options to manage their wealth with diversified portfolios consisting of exchange traded funds (“ETFs”), digital assets (also known as “cryptocurrencies” or “coins’) and other limited investment products.
These services will initially be offered to users of the Ethos.io platform (the “Ethos Platform”).

We’re extremely excited about our relationship with Ethos as we are their first Bedrock Business Customer, meaning the two teams will collaborate on the design and functionality of the dynamic Ethos Platform. This relationship will also allow Fusion to offer automated-investment advice directly to our target user audience, through the Ethos Universal Wallet mobile application.

Once our technology is finalized later in 2018, users of the Ethos Platform that choose to become clients of Fusion will have the ability to access the Fusion Application (Web-App) directly within the Ethos Universal Wallet to learn more about investing, track third-party financial accounts and/or digital wallets, and create and manage a hybrid crypto and investment portfolio designed to meet their financial goals, interests and beliefs within their respective investment objectives, risk tolerance and financial parameters.

The advisory services offered through the Fusion Application will initially consist of advice limited to only mutual funds, exchange traded funds (“ETFs”), and digital assets (also known as “cryptocurrencies” or “coins’), as well as cash and cash equivalents. Fusion’s advisory services are intended for long-term investors that are focused on building wealth over time through a highly diversified portfolio, and are not geared toward short-term, active investors.

In parallel with these efforts, the Fusion team is also working diligently to finalize several strategic partnerships that will allow us to deliver on our long-term objective of providing global consumers with a robust digital financial experience traversing wealth management, brokerage, and banking products and services.

All these efforts are well underway.

Registering as investment advisor brings Fusion one step closer to the reality of delivering Automated Fusion Investing For The Future.

investing,Student Debt Default,"While I have found varying information regarding that exact statistics of student debt currently in the US, there appears to be well over a trillion dollars in outstanding loans and student debt.  Many sources state this is the second largest debt, behind housing, which is taking graduates around 20 years to pay off.

I am interested in how defaults on these federal loans will impact the United States stock market.  I linked a recent article which discuss an individual who has nearly a million dollars in debt.  This individual only pays the interest rates every month while the debt continues to grow.  This individual is an orthodontist, obviously a high paying profession, who has no motivation to pay these loans.  Instead only pays the monthly interest rates to please the government.

How will defaults on student loans impact the United States markets?  How will individuals who use loans to become lower paying professions, not doctors or orthodontist but rather teachers or other professions(is there any hope for lesser payed college graduates to repay these ever growing loans), who default and have no chance of repaying these loans impact the markets.  Could a mass default send markets into another 2008 crash.

Just curios about this since we are currently in a large bull market and it appears that all of this debt is overlooked.  I am rather new to the field and any answers are appreciated.

personalfinance,Am I going to get screwed?,"So I’m filling out my FAFSA and I needed my Dad’s tax info to finish it up. He ducked and avoided it all despite me really needing the FAFSA for federal student aid. With no answer and him telling me he doesn’t have a return for the year despite working, I decided to poke around. 

I have reason to believe he hasn’t done his taxes in 12 years or so based on that year was the last filing I could find in his filing cabinet. He’s worked most of those years and I’m fairly certain he has withheld at least a little every year. My parents divorced before he stopped filing and since I live with my dad, my mother doesn’t claim me as a dependent and I’ve filed my own returns every year since I started working. 

This probably has been asked a million times but how bad is this going to be when they find out? He hasn’t made a lot of money but gets a lot of it from a trust fund so I’m not sure how that factors in, if it does. Is there any way this could impact my personal finances? There’s a good chance he can’t afford to pay back much of this, as he hasn’t taken good care of any of his finances and currently isn’t working.",finance

personalfinance,Beneficiary Advice,"Hello /r/personalfinance, this is a throwaway account!

A few months ago my mother passed away unexpectedly. I’m processing it very healthily. I was left with $174,000 in a [PERS](https://www.oregon.gov/pers/pages/index.aspx) retirement account and $34,000 in a [Lincoln Financial Group](https://www.lfg.com/public/individual) 403(b) tax deferred retirement account. Here is the information.

With the PERS account I can do a few things.

1. Take out all $174,000 and get taxed 20% federally.
2. Take out all $174,000 and put it in an IRA within 60 days and get taxed 10%.
3. Take it out in a monthly payment of $1,000 a month taxed as income for the rest of my life.

Financial Info

* $55,000 annual income ($3,500 a month after tax)
* $7,000 in the bank
* $8,500 in a Roth IRA ($0 of $5,500 contributed this year)
* $11,000 in student loans at between 4%-6% interest (making $500 payments a month)
* $710 a month for rent
* Live in Washington
* 26 years old

Currently think I would like to take all of the money out of the PERS account, put $5,500 in my Roth IRA, pay off my student loans, then put the remaining $122,700 or so in an index fund like FUSEX500. Not sure what to do with the Lincoln account though.

personalfinance,Dependent Care FSA Tax Question,"My wife has a dependent care FSA through her employer. Since we typically file taxes jointly, we have her making the maximum $5k/year contribution. 

For 2018, I'm considering filing taxes separately (to reduce her student loan payments on an income driven plan). This reduces the maximum contribution she can make to the childcare FSA to $2,500. But she's already contributed more than than in 2018...

My question: since my wife will have contributed more than the $2,500 limit for an individual in 2018, if we file separately, what impact will that have? I assume we will need to pay taxes on the over contributed amount. Is there any other impact? (This isn't a question about reducing our tax burden, just how the FSA will be handled)

For those curious: ""Isn't filing jointly almost always better?"" My wife currently pays over $6k/year on her Federal loans, which will be forgiven in 2026 through PSLF. If we file separately and contribute heavily to her 401(k), her AGI will be low enough to qualify for $0/month payments. So unless the difference between filing separately and filing jointly is $6k in our pocket, it  seems like it will pay off for us. Of course we will compare both options come tax time, but this seems worth it.",finance

Number 4 links to a an article that was written may 15 this year and can only be seen if your register or use google cash.

That's very transparent Jemima Kelly, but your FUD is not suited for Wikipedia. 


 Number 5 links to an article written on August 2 2017. Again it's behind some kind of blockade so you can't just read it. This time even google cash [can not help us.](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.telegraph.co.uk%2Ftechnology%2F2017%2F08%2F01%2Fbitcoin-cash-everything-need-know-bitcoins-hard-fork%2F&amp;oq=cache%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.telegraph.co.uk%2Ftechnology%2F2017%2F08%2F01%2Fbitcoin-cash-everything-need-know-bitcoins-hard-fork%2F&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i58.1600j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8) 

But let's look at where the word ""strand"" comes from. 

&gt;Bitcoinhas split into two in an event known as a “hard fork” that has divided the virtual currency’s online community.

&gt;Two competing strands of bitcoin emerged after some of its leading backers disagreed on the best way to take it forward.

It looks like the article that is used to justify calling Bitcoin Cash a strand is actually using the word ""hard fork"" 

You know, cause that's the one that is factually correct, the other words are opinions. 

[Number 6](https://www.technologyreview.com/the-download/609485/bitcoin-cash-had-a-big-day-hinting-at-a-deep-conflict-in-the-cryptocurrency/) is the first link that links to something that anybody can read without having to register first. 

Number 7 links to this article. From September 19, 2017. There is even a  nice video. They are talking about Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Segwit1x and Bitcoin Segwit2x and in that context they are saying: 

&gt;In recent weeks, a group of miners -- people who crunch complex math problems to generate and transact the digital currency -- split off from the legacy bitcoin to use a new version known as Bitcoin Cash. Ver is moving some of his funds into the new offshoot as he anticipates what would **be the second split of the currency of 2017**. Ver admits he could potentially benefit from such a schism as more coins are created.

split off is technically correct, but does the current wikipedia on Bitcoin say that Bitcoin + Segwit + a low blocksize is a 
split off from Bitcoin without segwit? 


[Number 8](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-cash-litecoin-ether-oh-my-whats-with-all-the-bitcoin-clones-1514037600) is again ... a blockade. It's most as the person who put these links in wanted to make it as hard as possible for people to read them?

I have not found a way of reading this article. But the title makes it look like bitcoin cash,litecoin, and ether ... are all just clones of Bitcoin. By the way what is ether? Does the writer mean Ethereum? I don't know if the author of the article is differentiating between forking the software, or forking the blockchain (which you need enough hardware support for).

It's not fair that all these articles are being used on wikipedia to give Bitcoin Cash a name that is technically and factually not correct because the writers don't know history. So .... when is the wikipedia page finally going to become fully protected instead of semi protected. 

I link to it a lot because Wikipedia is the most decentralised encyclopedia that we have but this shit needs to stop. 

Edit: And here is the full text for [number 8.](https://pastebin.com/xVTcPxD0) 

&gt;Fork?
 
&gt;A fork is a term for a new version of a software program. Bitcoin is really nothing more than software, a program that allows two people to make an exchange of value. Because nobody owns that software, anybody can “fork” it, can create their own version of it. Bitcoin Cash and all these other altcoins are really just versions of the bitcoin program.
 
&gt;How is Bitcoin Cash Different from bitcoin?
 
&gt;In most respects, it is similar to bitcoin. It works the same way, **and it has the exact same transaction history as the original bitcoin, up to Aug. 1, 2017.** Its primary difference is that it is designed to allow more transactions to pass through, on a per-second basis, than bitcoin, which leads to lower user fees. And, of course, because it is a different market, Bitcoin Cash’s price moves independent of bitcoin itself.

So there you have it again. An article that calls Bitcoin both a altcoin and a fork is being used on wikipedia to call it an altcoin. But Bitcoin Cash is not an altcoin. 

Wikipedia itself says this about the term altcoin:

&gt;
The term altcoin has various similar definitions. For example altcoin has been referred to by MarketWatch as a short for alternative protocol asset and the term used to refer to derivatives of bitcoin.[11][12][13] Stephanie Yang of the The Wall Street Journal defined them as ""alternative digital currencies,""[14] while Paul Vigna, also of The Wall Street Journal, described altcoins as an alternative versions of bitcoin.[15] The New York Times refers to altcoins as any cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin.[16]

   
On the Bitcoin wikipedia article there are sections on altcoins and sections on hard forks. 

&gt;Altcoins

&gt;Over the history of bitcoin there have been several spin offs that have lived on in separate blockchains. These have come to be known as altcoins, short for alternative coins, since bitcoin was the first blockchain-based cryptocurrency and these are derivatives of it. These spin offs occur so that new ideas can be tested, when the scope of that idea is outside that of bitcoin, or when the community is split about merging such changes.[39][40]

One early altcoin was Litecoin, which began in October, 2011. Since then there have been numerous altcoins created as interest in cryptocurrency has increased.

&gt;Forks

&gt;On 1 August 2017, a hard fork of bitcoin was created, known as Bitcoin Cash.[41] Bitcoin Cash has a larger block size limit and had an identical blockchain at the time of fork. On 24 October 2017 another hard fork, Bitcoin Gold, was created. Bitcoin Gold changes the proof-of-work algorithm used in mining.[42]

So Bitcoin Cash is technically and factual a hard fork of Bitcoin. And Bitcoin with segwit is a soft fork of Bitcoin. And LN is  a second layer network build on top of Bitcoin. Etc etc.

investing,Inverted Interest Rates Risk,"I initially posted this on the r/finance sub, but it seems to have been removed, with no explanation.

But regardless -  

I am invested in a mortgage REIT and I noticed that the 5 year interest rate is at 2.77% while the 30yr interest rate is at 3.08%.

That means the spread is .31% and is pretty much the narrowest the spread has been in a very long time. For reference, back in mid to late  2014 the spread was over 2%.

This is  not just happening to the 30-5 spread, but the 10-2 spread as well, now down to .43%. For reference, back in mid to late 2014 it was over 2.4%.

Given the spread difference - just  two more rate hikes from the Fed and we'll have inverted yields. Are they even paying attention to this?

Any way to hedge against an inverted yield curve? Or security to invest in?

Inverted yield curves are also a typical precursor to a recession. 

Also, any theories on what is keeping long term debt rates artificially low considering the amount of debt the US gov has and the massive deficit that we are now running under Trump (future high inflation)? All those things should have made long term debt rates go up proportionally to short term debt. I get why short term debt rates are going up, cause of the deficit spending and the Fed rate hikes.",finance

investing,Potentially a signal for the next big crash,"I've been growing in concern over the massive stock buyback bubble we are experiencing over the last few years.  This year alone, companies are on track to buy back $800 billion dollars of themselves (a 51&amp;#37; increase from last year and another all time record) (citation: [http://fortune.com/2018/04/20/stock\-market\-buybacks\-nervous/](http://fortune.com/2018/04/20/stock-market-buybacks-nervous/)) . Most of these buybacks are centered in the tech sector that has subsequently experienced the most growth with the most gains when they did the most buybacks. Apple alone is buying back $100 Billion dollars this year. One figure alone said that many of the tech companies in the S&amp;P 500 are planning to buy back as much as 10&amp;#37; of their market caps. This normally wouldn't concern me that much except that there's this: [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/NCBDBIQ027S](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/NCBDBIQ027S)

It's a chart of nonfinancial corporate business debt. (The fact that it's nonfinancial is significant because financial companies are typically quite leveraged, and high debt is just a sign of success) Now, the debt levels wouldn't concern me either if the money was being used to reinvest in the businesses, but they aren't. If companies were just using their excess cash to buy back stock and issue dividends, I would see it as just a business decision, but they are literally cannibalizing themselves by taking on massive loads of debt just to pump up their own stock prices. The majority of the new debt that isn't used for refinancing is used to buy back stocks. 

I see a direct parallel to the Mortgage Backed Security market of 2005. In a controlled environment, isolated failures would be absorbed by the larger system with minimal loss. When everyone is too leveraged though, a small failure can have catastrophic consequences. Back in 2004, I had a blog preaching a possible crash in the MBS market, and I was dead on right. The part I was wrong about was that I expected it to happen a LOT sooner than it did. Markets can behave irrationally for a LONG time. 

This is how I see this potentially playing out. Interest rates go up a percent or two because a company is too leveraged and because the whole bond market raises its rates (pretty much a sure bet this will happen), one company can't refinance its debt without showing a loss. So, they reissue a small amount of stock or just accept a reduction in their credit rating. The problem is when all the companies suddenly have to deal with this, the bond market would shift rapidly to higher interest rates to compensate for all the reductions in credit rating and an overall uneasiness about the state of the debt market. This would make the problem worse which would in turn make interest rates even higher. It's a feedback loop like the MBS crash and subsequent foreclosure crisis. Companies will be left with no choice but to reissue stock to raise capital, and that will crash the stock market resulting in much less money for the same amount of company sold. So, they will have to sell more resulting in bigger valuation reductions. In other words, I see a 25&amp;#37; crash in the stock AND bond market in the imminent future. Once again, I'm probably calling this way too early like I did last time. So, this might not happen for two years, but it will most likely happen.

Any thoughts, arguments, discussions welcomed on this please.",finance
Bitcoin,The cap of 21 million coins,"Changing this would be a profound event in bitcoins history if it were to ever happen.

My thoughts are that just like the fear around the Y2K bug in 2000, we will reach a similar fear in 2140 when the block reward ceases causing people to make irrational decisions.

There may be propoganda and lobbying to convince people that it would be a good idea to increase the supply.

Lets look at history. How many times has consensus lead to abandonning the gold standard. Zero, it was always a sly roundabout dictated decision made by those in power like the ""Nixon Shock"" in 1971 removing the dollar from gold. Consensus would never agree to this and miners are not the only constituents of consensus, everyone has a say by voting with their money.

If this change were ever to be implemented as a hard fork the chain would obviously split. That would leave the inflationary chain to compete with the supply capped chain. In this environment everyone would have the same number of coins on both chains and the inflationary chain would naturally lose value aginst the supply capped chain. Users would choose the chain that holds its value better and miners will choose the chain that the users choose to ensure they earn more in transaction fees. 

This is of course only true if average users use the main chain. If we have a main chain that is only used by ""5000 central banks"" as a settlement layer as Saifedean Ammous puts it because fees are too high for average users, then those central banks could migrate to the new inflationary chain leaving the supply capped chain with no use making it trivial to keep miners chasing profit on the new inflationary chain rendering the supply capped chain useless.

How does lightning network split between 2 chains? Obviously the lightning hubs choose which chain the users end up on, correct?

Someone explain to me how it is impossible to increase the 21 million cap once lightning hubs dictate which future chain ends up with all the users.

Edit: overall im not worried as someone in 2140 could just create a new capped coin and airdrop the total supply to all btc users in a proof of stake model to counteract it giving people a choice but it would be like starting from scratch again. Just worried this scenario can destory bitcoins hard cap limit.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Debt snowball vs. top down (I have no idea what the actual term is) for paying off student loans?,"My wife and I are working on paying off her student loans right now and I'm trying to figure out what the best way to do it is. She has about 5 or 6 I think that we're paying toward. We have the ability to either pay off the biggest one, or pay off a few of the smaller ones. My question is: which is better?

We took Dave Ramsey's Financial Peace course earlier this year and based on that logic, paying off the smaller ones first would be recommended. My argument against that is that the bigger loan is growing the fastest, even with a lower interest rate than the smaller ones, due to the principal balance.

I just want to pick the option that makes it easier for us to pay these off in a shorter amount of time while also paying the smallest possible amount over time to actually get these paid off.

Foolishly I fed into the potential hype, knowing my chances of disappointment were high, and was of course let down as expected. 

I'm realizing now that unless Skate is miraculously shown at Microsoft's conference, there is a real possibility that EA intentionally turn the servers on as a bit of a publicity stunt in an attempt to get people to watch this year's conference.

I thought I had a good chance at a job 1+ hour away in major city but as it turns out I was offered a job one town over (less than 5 miles from my house) equally as close as my current job.  I live in a HCOL suburb in CA.  I’ve been an attorney for ~2.5 years. 

Current job: ~$85k maybe a little more with a few bonuses but not over $90k - I bill about 1800-1850 hours per year. Current bonus structure isn’t very incentivizing. I’m happy-ish with the firm but know I am very undervalued in compensation but that’s just how the firm pays. CA only firm. 

Job offer:  $114k plus a little bit in bonuses I probably shouldn’t count on the first year but with a strict billing minimum of 2000.  I do have a concern of being able to hit this amount and having to live in the office basically. 
                     But bonus structure goes up pretty high and you can earn about 10%-30% more of your salary if you churn out hours. They have made it very very clear I have to bill 2000 and should be factoring in my own vacations/sick time. National firm.  
                     This is probably the highest amount of compensation I could get in my area without a commute. But if I kept looking I might be able to find something with lower billables but I could end up looking for a long long time. (If I had to commute to the city, I’d probably be spending 450-500 hours doing so per year). 

Both have similar practices of law. 

I’m torn. Help! Take it? Or wait for something better?

Debating on what to do about my student loans ($17k). I just want it gone. I'm interested to hear your thoughts on what I should do, as I'm thinking it doesn't make much sense to pay in full since my monthly payment isn't agonizing.

Monthly payment is $282, however I have been paying $350 for some time now. About $30k in savings, steady income, 401k, $2.7k monthly expenses (student loan included).

Should I drop the $17k and pay them off? Should I pay off a chunk and drop $5k now and another 5k in 6 months? Or should I keep doing what I'm doing, continue to pay over the required monthly payment?

Thoughts and advice appreciated!

*EDIT*
- The interest rates on the loans are: 3.6%, 6.5%, 6.5%, 6.5%, and 4.2%.
- I also have plans to purchase a camper van (no more than $8k) to travel the US for no more than 2 months, which is why I'm a bit hesitant to drop the $17k to pay off the loan. Want to have at least $10K towards my trip.

personalfinance,I need to apply for many things requiring a credit check. Should I space them out?,"Hey All,

I might be overthinking this, but I have quite a few things that I need to do relatively soon that will require a credit check.

\- I need to get car insurance by the end of the month

\- I need to refinance my student loans \- I am paying $650 a month in interest alone, I need to get these rates down

\- I have to move to a new apartment in August, which will require a credit check

\- I am in the process of changing jobs, which will require a credit/background check

I know that each time you do a hard pull, it lowers your credit score. I have been building up my credit and am at a 760.  Is there an order in which I should approach this so that my credit score doesn't affect my rates? My thought process would be to do the student loan refi, then get car insurance, then deal with the apartment and job later.  The higher my credit score, the better interest rate I'll get on my refi. Is this the same case for car insurance too? Should I spread the applications out over a certain time frame, or will it matter if I do this all on the same day?

personalfinance,Is this ESPP even worth contributing to?,"Hello PF,

Just looking for some advice, perhaps I am overlooking something here.

My Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) seems... dismal to say the least. The plan caps at a 10&amp;#37; base salary \+ bonus. 

The only incentive is a 5&amp;#37; discount on the closing price of the stock, on the last day of the offering period. The offering periods are 6 months each, twice per year. No minimum holding period.

The advice I have heard when it comes to ESPP's is to sell your shares immediately when you receive them, and use/save the cash as you will. This is at least what I would plan to do, and with no minimum holding period, would do.

However, when I do the math, it just seems not worth it. After taxes and fees associated with selling the shares, it seems the return on my contributions would be a piss poor \~3.5&amp;#37;.  This honestly does not seem worth the hassle of accounting for this on personal taxes, and a 3.5&amp;#37; return on 10&amp;#37; of my income definitely is not worth hiring an accountant for.

Am I missing something here? It seems like there is no reason to contribute, the interest rate on my student loans is higher than 3.5&amp;#37;. It would make more sense to pay those off with the money instead. 

Is there some tax, or other benefit I'm missing out on?",finance
personalfinance,Former international grad student trying to establish a decent credit score in the US... without much success.,"PF, I came to the States in 2012 for grad school with the intention of returning to Canada afterwards... and a few months ago I got a tenure-track professorship lined up here in the States. I was not going to look a gift horse in the mouth, and I promptly realized I had to start developing a credit score here in the US.

Here's the problem: I had absolutely nothing until that point. I'm 30 years old and until two months ago had no lines of credit. I paid everything off with a debit card, never had a house or a car or anything, had no student loans, nothing like that. I currently make 60k/year as a postdoc and will be making over twice that as an assistant professor. I have rented apartments since I was 17 and have never been late on any payments for rent or utilities, but I haven't had any loans to speak of. I'm very careful with my savings and things are going great for me financially.

With a baseline understanding of how credit works, I decided I should probably get a credit card. Obviously, with no credit, I was declined when I tried to get the lowest-level card my bank (Arvest) offered. I wound up going for a Discover secured credit card to try and build some credit. First month, my Equifax score came in at 665. Okay, thought I, that'll improve over time, and I put about $60 of balance onto my $500 card, then paid it off promptly at the end of the month.

The result? Month two is a score of 662, down from last month. I get that this is because I now have a balance on my card where before I had none, but I'll admit to being a little frustrated at how silly this all feels. 

Is this likely to even out as the account ages? Is there something else I could be doing to grow my credit faster? I worry about getting declined for leasing an apartment or getting some not-great interest rates down the road. Have I made things worse by opening this line of credit? Am I worrying over nothing?

My fiancé and I have 6 credit cards between us, and they are all pretty much maxed out. I took a giant pay cut last year and we had some unexpected auto problems ($4000 worth) and we didn’t adjust properly. Here is the breakdown of the balances and limits.

Cards in my name.
3 cards total balance $10,600 - limit $11,300

Cards in her name.
3 cards total balance $13,400 - limit $14,400

We have a little over $6k in our savings right now, so here is what I thought about doing. Paying off both of my cards with the $2000 limit to zero. Then applying for a signature loan to consolidate the rest of the cards and pay them all down to zero. Once they are all zeroed out, keep our 2 oldest credit cards and never use them again, and keep whichever card between the 2 of us has the best interest rate to use for emergency’s or travel in the future. Canceling the other 3. That will still leave us $2000 in savings in case we need it. Then I can just pay the signature loan off over the next 2 years. My credit is decent despite having so many maxed out credit cards, so I’m hoping the loan will be around 5%-7%, significantly better than the 20%+ we pay on the cards now.

- both in our late 20s
- both have steady jobs with good income
- want to buy a house in the next year
- both have student loan debt still totaling about $20k

personalfinance,Buying a new car may not be that much more expensive than buying used,"I am starting to think of replacing my 2010 Kia Forte, and I wanted to do some calculations to see just how much more expensive buying a new car rather than a used car is.

&amp;nbsp;

I decided to look at the cost of buying and replacing a new car versus a used car over 40 years. (I used this common denominator method rather than an equivalent annual operating cost method because I assumed that the annual maintenance costs were variable, and dependent on the age of the vehicle).

&amp;nbsp;

In my calculations, I assumed that:

- You bought the new car with a 48 month loan (2% interest rate)
- You bought the used car with a 48 month loan (3% interest rate)
- If you bought used, you bought a 3 year old model
- You kept either car until it was 8 years old (The average lifespan of the car according to one questionably reputable site)
- You paid the fair Kelly Blue Book value
- You sold the car when it was 8 years old for the fair Kelly Blue Book value
- A new car has $0.04/mile maintenance costs. This increases linearly to $0.06/mile by the time it is 8 years old
- You drive 12,000 miles/year (To estimate maintenance costs)

&amp;nbsp;

The results for a Hyundai Elantra (I like Korean cars I guess) are:

- Buying new Elantras costs $92,714 in loan and maintenance costs over 40 years
- Buying used Elantras costs $79,528 in loan and maintenance costs over 40 years
- The new Elantras cost 16.6% more in nominal terms (22.7% more if you use discounted terms, using a 5% post-inflation discount rate)

&amp;nbsp;

Here is how much more it costs to buy the new car for all of the models I tested:

&amp;nbsp;

| Hyundai Elantra   | Honda Civic    | Honda Fit     | Toyota Corolla     |
|:-----------|:------------|:------------|:------------|
| 16.6%       |-1.2%          |     8.1%      |          13.8%
   

&amp;nbsp;

As you can see, it costs roughly 10% more to buy the new car rather than the used car. However, some models, such as the Honda Civic, actually cost slightly less to buy new!

&amp;nbsp;

I'd say the biggest take away is that it is only marginally more expensive to buy a new car using these calculation parameters. Of course, the specific result is dependent on the model, how long you plan to keep the car, the loan conditions, and a million other things. I also assumed that outside of the price of the car itself and maintenance, both options have similar expenses. (This is not quite true as new cars will cost more to insure and to register, but older cars will have more fuel costs, etc.)

&amp;nbsp;

These results are definitely making me consider buying a new car. The small increase in costs are probably worth it to me since the new car has better safety features, possibly a better warranty (Kia and Hyundai warranties tend to not transfer to the 2nd owner), and newer overall features.

&amp;nbsp;

If you have any questions about my assumptions/methods, or want to tell me how awful my calculations are, let me know!

* Loan 2: $8.5k, 5.5%, ~$95/mo
* Loan 3: $30k, 7%, ~$280/mo

I'm not sure if I should pay down loan three first, since it has the highest interest rate, or if I should pay down loan 2 first, that way I can snowball it's payment into loan 1, and then both into loan 3 once they're both paid off. Is this one of those flip a coin situation?",finance

personalfinance,Used car: full cash or use 1.9% loan?,"I’ve always read that people should be pay cash for their cars (and not buy above 10% of their income) because car loans are usually a big loss in the long run. However, I work for a university and our credit union has a 1.9% interest rate for used cars 2011 or better. That means that over the 5 year life of the loan, I’d be paying like $200 dollars more, in order to keep $9k liquid in my pocket.

Use the loan, right? It seems obvious but I’ve also never bought a car before so I’d love some help.",finance

We told them numerous times we didn't want the interior warranty. As I was reviewing the paperwork, they snuck the warranty into the price of the car.

personalfinance,How does a miser buy a house?,"Wife and I(35) have wanted a new house for quite a while, and now have a child. I make $120K in the Pittsburgh area (which is fairly above average), in the IT industry, and she is a stay-at-home mom. We are not super uncomfortable in our current house, but have been talking about upgrading for years now. We are outgrowing our space, but we come up with some efficient ways to manage. 
The market in the Pittsburgh area has always been fairly stable, but recently we are seeing the same shortages that other cities are seeing.

We both have nearly perfect credit ratings.
I have over $100K in savings, have about 55% equity in my current townhouse that is probably worth about $220K.
We have very minimal car loans and school loans, roughly $500 total, all with very low interest rates. We live pretty efficiently, and I’m able to save about 3000 - 4000 every month after expenses.
We've been house hunting in the $350K price point, and not really seeing anything we like. Most of the houses in the area are 20 year old $350K - $400K places, and are coming due for roofs, HVAC and windows.
Our agent suggested that we take a look at the 400K or 450K price points. Prices in the area are rising quickly, so I don’t want to overspend.
My main concerns are the housing bubble bursting right as I purchase and the possibility of economic recession just as I buy my new house. We’ve worked so hard to be fiscally responsible and save, and it’s nice to have the security of liquidity.
I really hate debt and buyers remorse, and try my best to avoid them, and that has made it hard to pull the trigger.

My options at this time, are to take what I’ve saved, put 200K as a downpayment (100K savings + 100Kish from the sale of my home), and finance the rest.
Or
Try to save for another year, banking as hard as I can, and hoping that the 40 - 50K that I can add to a downpayment, offsets the rising prices and rising interest rates.

Am I being too miserly? Am I overvaluing my current financial situation? Is the timing right? How do I know what I can afford? Should I maybe think about building instead?",finance

Banking,Fed Runds Rate - Practical Use / Explanation,"Hi all \- I have an idea for a fintech company and am curious about the practical usage of the Fed Funds Rate with regard to companies like Robin Hood.

It's my understanding that one of Robin Hood's main revenue drivers comes from lending overnight a portion of the $'s held in their customer accts via the Fed Funds rate. 

Let's say that Robin Hood lends $1mm overnight, and let's assume the fed funds rate is 1.75&amp;#37;.

Does this ***literally*** mean that in just one night, Robin will earn $17,500 in interest? Or, is the Fed Funds rate an annual percentage rate, and therefore they will earn interest at (1.75&amp;#37; / 365) overnight...therefore earning \~$48?

crypto_currency,Wall Street Coin.,"Wall Street Coin is an ecosystem that is based on the Ethereum Network. This will make it possible to develop a peer-to-peer network without the use of any middleman. This will make it possible for investors to avoid stock selling campaigns and invest in the startups that they love.

The idea behind Wall Street Coin is to offer a Peer-to-Peer Blockchain-based Stock selling and investing platform open to everyone. The platform will be based on Blockchain technology and Smart Contracts, functioning as a Decentralized Stock Trading Platform.

To ensure correct stock shares evaluating, avoid fraudulent stock sales and other potential threats to investors, every company listed for public stock sale on our platform will undergo a background check by a team of financial experts.

The current Stock Exchanges are all based upon centralized platforms. Counter to that, Wall Street Coin Platform will be based on Ethereum Blockchain technology, offering full transparency and all-time log of all the trades ever done within the platform.
WSC platform will organize and systemize the stock market, bringing stability and identity verification, transparency, security and trust to a traditionally insecure stock market.

How Wall Street Coin Blockchain Stock Exchange Market Works


With the help of the blockchain, it will make it possible for Wall Street Coin to ensure the transparency of every investment and its security. Right now, the brokerage firms have a huge amount of power, which is growing daily due to centralization. A major issue of centralization is vulnerability. Most brokerage firms have leveraged on this to manipulate the prices and values of shares.

This manipulation is done to increase profits for brokerages at a cost to investors. With the Wall Street coin algorithm, companies with great ideas will be given priority to sell shares. The prices will be accurately and legitimately valued. This way, investors can purchase these shares at the right price.


The Current Situation In Stock Exchanges.

Stock exchanges offer a medium via which investors and brokers can trade shares. Besides that, exchanges provide the facilities necessary to redeem dividend and securities. The stock market offers huge opportunities. Companies are able to sell part of their company to gain capital.

Upon purchase, the value of the shares will increase as the value of a company grows. Every day, there are new companies trying to access the stock market to raise capital.
However, the stock markets are currently plagued by numerous inconsistencies. 
There is always a danger that these inconsistencies could cause the markets to crash. Some of the reasons the markets could crash include tax regime changes, investor panic, inflation, interest rate changes, too much leverage, and speculation. The Wall Street Coin plans to correct these issues.

The aim is to boost the quality of the market by offering transparency, security, and trust through the blockchain. Today, just 10% of all stocks traded are based on the actual value of a company. The rest of the transactions are based on something extra. In short, real value has been cast aside in the current situation.


Issues Wall Street Coin Seeks To Solve

One of the issues the Wall Street Coin will solve is lack of speed. Today, a single transaction on stock exchanges can take as long as three days. By then, market conditions may have changed. This would mean you might purchase something today only for it to become worthless upon processing.

The other issue is losses due to lack of transparency. Today a broker will sweet talk an investor into trading in a company, despite the fact that they know it offers no real value. At the end of the day, no matter who buys or sells, the broker still makes money.

investing,Help me understand Bitcoin economics,"I have a question regarding bitcoin economics. If bitcoin is used more it’s value increases and if it’s used less it’s value decreases. So as a holder of bitcoin it’s paradoxical in the sense that if I spend then I won’t realize the benefit of price appreciation and if majority hold there won’t be price appreciation. When a recession hits when spending is less the value of money I hold in terms of bitcoin will fall where as if I hold in cash it stays the same. In an ideal case central banks help economy by reducing interest rates thus reducing incentive to hold cash and artificially provide stimulus for economic growth . When u have cash ur buying power doesn’t fall during recession where as with bitcoin since its value falls its buying power will go down . So based on this doesn’t bitcoin just exaggerate boom and bust cycles? Am I missing some point of view ?


Edit: things escalated very quickly. So let me just rephrase few things. I do understand blockchain how it works. I am removing bitcoin out of the equation. Let it be about blockchain.

Hi everyone! I was wondering what some reputable, high-yield savings accounts there are in the US for college students.  My current bank only offers .01% interest for their savings account under $10,000 and .03% once $10,000 is reached.  I have heard about CIT Bank (an online bank) that offers 1.85% APY and was wondering if this is a legitimate bank or a scam.  This was the highest yield account a quick search resulted in.  The website explains the high % being due to the fact it's purely online; no physical banks so less operation costs and more money back to the customers.

About me:
I currently have no money saved up for when I graduate and about $100 in my checking account (the past three years of uni I haven't had much time to work during the school year, so whatever I make during summer/winter break is what I have as spending money the rest of the year).  I'm incredibly grateful that I will be graduating debt free, so while I'm not terribly concerned with my current financial situation, I do want to put the majority of money I make over this summer (I finish final exams this week) into a savings account with a decent interest rate so I can have something saved up for when I graduate in a year.  I will be working next school year as well since my degree is almost finished (I only have 5-6 more classes to take before I'm done, which is a super light workload on a quarter system).  I plan on living with my parents (already discussed with them) after graduation so I can work full time and save as much as possible with the intention of waiting a little longer to move out so when I do I can buy something instead of rent.

Any help or suggestions is really appreciated!  I know I'm a little old to just now be learning about my personal finance, but hey better late than never, right?

personalfinance,EFC has doubled since last year. Disqualified for any financial aid.,"I just received an email from the community college I'm attending that says I don't qualify for ANY financial aid at either the state or federal level. I called to find out why this is since my tuition last year was fully paid and they said that my EFC (expected family contribution)  had more than doubled since last year from 24,000 to 56,000. I don't understand how this is possible since my personal income has gone down and my parents income has stayed the same. There certainly hasn't been a substantial enough increase in anyone's earnings to explain that kind of change in my EFC. My parents make very little and even if they did give me any money for anything (which they don't) they wouldn't have enough to cover my full tuition.

personalfinance,"Need some tips for first ""real"" income.","After finishing university I have just started my first job with a decent income. I am already using YNAB for several years and it helped me to keep my expenses on track, so I survived with not so much money.
However, now I have way more money than I was used to, which isn't essentially bad. But with higher income comes higher fear of wasting it. In the past I have gotten a feeling (besides tracking in YNAB) of how much money should be on my account for what time of the month.

Now everything is new to me. Currently I have around 500€ unbudgeted, which is almost 2/3 of my past income during university, so this is a lot of money.

Since the interest rates of money on my day-to-day account are pretty much 0, this is not the best situation. But of course, I want to do myself a favor, since now I have the money, which I haven't had the last few years.

I am able to transfer money to a savings account with a somewhat higher interest rate, so I want to do this for some amount of these 500 euros. But I do not know how much. So I need to categorize the budget.

To be clear, every other expense I will have this month is already by the budget, according to the amounts I needed in the past time. The 500 euros are really money I don't need right now, but could need in the future, for whatever reason. 

How do you categorize your budget, besides your already mandatory expenses like rent, food, Netflix, etc?

Should I just make arbitrary categories and sort the money in? Should I really spend the money, or just put into savings?

I think it might be some kind of psychological issue right now. The only time I have had this much money in the past was on rare occasions, like after Christmas, or when I sorted out unused stuff I had and put it on ebay. On these events I didn't want to spend the money on one item, eg new headphones, since who knows when I will have this much money again?

So, this is my essential problem: I have money I don't need to survive right now, I have a good filled amazon wishlist, and I want to be happy that I can allow myself to spend the money. But somehow I can't, since I am not used to it. Has anyone any advice for me in this situation?

It started with a store card that only allowed purchases in store, then somewhere along the line changed to a general MC that allows purchases anywhere. I started using it to pay for gas and groceries, but then it turned into tickets and clothes and eating out to the point where it got out of hand. I never paid off the balance. My naive self just thought I would ""deal with it later."" I don't know what I was thinking.

Fast forward two years and I'm in over 10K of debt from this. I've done 3 balance transfers to reduce my interest rates, and now have a $1,000\+ balances on 4 cards. Three of them have 0&amp;#37; interest, one of them has 23&amp;#37; and it's making my payments seem worthless.

This is such a huge drain on my mental energy, knowing I can't plan any vacations, or go out for drinks or entertainment without feeling guilty. I got myself into this mess so I know I can get myself out, but it is demoralizing to see my payments slaughtered by interest charges. It feels like I can't afford it at all, so I'm not sure what to do to break this cycle. PLEASE HELP!!

Edit: My recreation/entertainment expenses:

Two things that are ingrained in my lifestyle are (1) my gym membership ($40/mo since 2015) and (2) Summer time softball \- 10 games for $70, summer soccer \- 7 games for $70, winter indoor soccer 8 games for $100, in addition to the pickup leagues. This stuff keeps me sane. Does anyone think it would be possible or wise to keep these expenses? Absolutely unnecessary, and could find alternative ways to still enjoy things.

Edit 2: Thank you everyone for all the feedback! Going to look seriously into selling the car and replacing with a beater that doesn't require crazy high collision coverage, using the leftover to cover CC#1. Cutting the gym membership, cutting the summer soccer, and cutting the groceries to $150. Hopefully, I'll have a 1 year update post with good progress.",finance

personalfinance,"Bought an apartment somewhat overpriced, how would you treat this higher price (Norway)?","Hi.

Bought my first apartment recently. It's a fairly good 3-room (*bed, bed, kitchen, livingroom and bathroom - all separate rooms*) with a west facing balcony with great sun conditions. Features that should make it easy to sell.

However, in the bidding round we went over price estimation by 7.5%. I don't know the standard of the apartments that are next to ours, but this one was a quite high standard, with no renovation needs for the foreseeable future - that might've been what set it higher than the other ones.

It was funded with 33% down payment so I'm not in any kind of trouble, but mentally I'm not sure how to treat this. The interest rates here are disturbingly low (2%), and primed to increase this fall. Chances are the housing market will receive an influx of new apartments this and next year too (lots of projects that started building apartments in 2016 are now nearing completion).

Loan periods in norway are maxed out at 30 years, and I did pick 30 years (could've gone with 20-30). So if a interest hike comes, I've no options left. Granted, the interest will have to increase by 5% before I'm really really in trouble, but it's just new to me having to worry about these things.

My income is $52k/year, and my girlfriend is still studying but making 25k/yr for now. Our mortgage is $280k.

What would you do in our position? Should we concider the difference between the price we bought it at and market price as some kind of personal debt we should try to pay down as soon as we can ($30.000~ ish) while the interest is still low? My worst case fear scenario is the prices will drop so much our apartment will be worth as much as the loan sum, and then we'll be stuck here due to no equity left, with interest rising to 6-7%.

This is probably just a first time buyers anxiety (*in which case I'll happily take some soothing words of wisdom*), but I am interested in hearing what y'all would do in this position.",finance

personalfinance,Invest or pay down debt?,"Hey Reddit! 

So I’m getting $18,000 soon and I was wondering what I should do with it. Is it better to invest the money or pay down my car that I owe $39,000 on with a 3.25% interest rate?  My car payment is $640 a month and if I paid it down it would lower my payment to around $350 which would help free up $300 a month.

I could also put it towards my house, but not sure that would make a difference. I owe $450,000 with a 4.2% interest rate. I don’t know anything about investments. I have around 2 months of emergency savings in my account ($8,000). 

I’m terrible with budgeting and don’t know what to do first!

personalfinance,How do I ask for a raise when there's no comparable job?,"Not sure if this is the right forum, so apologies if not.

I am at right around 3 years at my company. It all began when I started working for another company, where my boss was supervisor there. 6 months into my employment there, she let me know she has been quietly planning to break away and start her own company doing the same type of work. She basically ran the whole deal at our old company, so she wanted to fully own it. I was 100% on board and left with her.

I was the only employee for the first couple years. In the past year, we've grown so much that we have the freedom to tell prospective clients NO if they seem like too much trouble. It has been great. My boss moved and lives out of state. We have 2 full time employees in other states now, and I have 1 under me (soon to be 2, as an intern is starting next week).

I started at $35k. I am relatively young and was still new to what we do, so this was reasonable. I was 1099 and also paying my own health insurance. I have since moved to W-2 and am making $41k. However, I am still paying my own health insurance ($400/month).

I have a lot of freedom in the sense that I can work from home, come and go as needed, don't need special permission or even documentation of time off, etc. However, I also go above and beyond in a lot of ways (and it has come to be expected). Clients are 2 hours behind me, so I regularly work on things later in the evening outside of ""work hours"". During busy season, I stay in the office late almost every day due to the sheer amount of work. I travel for my job, which often means I'm ""working"" (traveling) on Sundays and also as late as midnight.

I doubt I exceed 40 actual working hours most times, so it isn't really an overtime situation.

I really, really, really love my job. I am good at it and I enjoy it. My boss is younger and very awesome. She is so laid back and doesn't measure your worth by ""clocked in"" time. Rather, she just cares that the work gets done. I definitely don't think she is trying to screw me.. I just think I'm starting to feel that I am worth more. My responsibilities have increased quite a bit as we've grown. And we are only getting larger each year, so even though I'm not really being assigned new tasks, I am performing my tasks on a much much larger scale. 

The issue is that there aren't really any other companies that do what we do. I am a consultant in a niche that we basically created. I don't really have anyone to compare to. The work that I do for our clients is work that is generally split amongst several of their employees, so I can't even really compare myself to what they'd be paying their own employee. 

My work requires pretty extensive knowledge of federal and state level requirements. A huge part of my job is making sure my clients are compliant and pass their state audit. So not just anyone could hop into my place. If I left, I'm not naive enough to think the entire company would implode.. but I am responsible for a large enough % of what we do that it would be EXTREMELY burdensome on my boss/coworkers.

$41k per year with $400/month going to health insurance just doesn't seem right. I have friends teaching kindergarten or ringing up groceries at Trader Joe's making more than that. I just need some guidance on how to go about bringing this up.

Because I do have such a lax schedule as far as ""time in office"", I don't know how to put a # on my work. And I don't know how to compare myself to others, as there are no others.

Advice?

EDIT - I should add that I absolutely do feel like my boss would be open to giving me a raise. I guess it is just difficult to know where my expectations become unrealistic. The average person doesn't get a $10k raise. They get like a few %. But I kinda feel like $50k (and insurance covered) is where I should be right now.",finance
personalfinance,"Received a check for $2,000 in the mail, not to my name. I have a few questions.","Hey PF,

I received a check in the mail to my address. Without giving too much personal information away. Here are some details:

- The amount of the check is a bit over $2,000.
- It's a cashier's check (says ""federal credit union"").

My mother looked the place up, gave them a call, and they had no explanation for the check situation, but received numerous calls from people with the same issue.

Now I have a couple questions:

- Is this some type of scam? Regardless if it is or not, my mother and I are not going to attempt to deposit the check because (a) it's not our money, and (b) it's probably a scam. Basically, I am telling my mom it's a scam, but she doesn't see how it can be one.
- Secondly, if it is a scam, how would this work? There is no way for me to deposit the check since it's not made out to my name.
- What should I do with the check? Burn it? Report it some where? I have no idea. If it's not a scam, I'd like to get it to where it belongs.

I hope to receive some insightful responses for not only myself, but other redditors that may be in the same situation. Thank you!",finance

personalfinance,Credit Card Tip,"Not sure if this is a well\-known strategy or not, but I wanted to share what I feel is a super helpful way to pay off credit card balances. As you know, credit card debt can add up super fast with the insane interest rates; leave just a small balance unpaid for a few months and it's suddenly really difficult to break out of it. I've combatted this by opening a savings account called ""Credit Card"" with my bank. This is the account that's linked to my credit card and is set up for autopay. Each time I use my credit card for a purchase, I immediately transfer the money from my checking account into the ""Credit Card"" savings account. Not only does this ensure that my balance will always be paid off in full each month, but it also helps me feel the true effect of spending with a credit card (taking the time to actually move the money and see it leave my account makes it feel like real money is being spent). 

If you use this strategy just be sure to leave a balance of one cent (or whatever your bank requires as minimum) in the ""Credit Card"" savings account at all times so that it doesn't close!

Anybody have other strategies?",finance

I’ve been a long-time lurker on reddit, especially this sub, and I’ve been trying to keep it to self research but I’m still struggling to understand a lot of the things that are discussed here. 

I just want to make sure I’m maxing out my potential to save/invest and feel like my money is sitting stagnant. I’ve just started an acorns account to invest but I know there are better options.

My situation:
28 yr old E-5 in the military married to E-5
2 kids (3 &amp; 1)
Banking through USAA
Recently bought first house one year ago
~35k in savings (my wife and I combined)
$9,800 left on auto loan at 2.8%
$500/mo into savings
15% contributions to TSP L2050

We use a joint account to auto pay our bills but have separate checking accounts for what is left over for personal spending (which after the 500 to savings and auto payment isn’t much, but that’s how I budgeted it out). Also, I’ve read threads/information about savings accounts and whether to just have a simple emergency fund in savings account and invest the rest, the problem is I don’t know where to start.

My questions:
1. I’ve seen and read a lot of post regarding investing using Vanguard. I’m not sure what this is or how to do it. I’m not sure rly investing in anything besides an Acorns account I recently set up. Which leads me to:

2. Is Acorns a bad idea? I like the idea of the automatic roundups being invested, but feel that there may be better options.

3. Since I have joined, I have only used the USAA Rate Advantage credit card for the low interest rate, but I want a better option with the best rewards of cash back or points. I’m bummed that I missed the 2.5% cash back through USAA. Also, we don’t travel too often so preferably the cash back option, since (from my understanding) the points are mainly used for airlines and lodging discounts.

4. Mutual funds. I read a lot of comments and threads about them and the S&amp;P500. Is this entailed in Vanguard investing?

I apologize for what may seem to many of you as elementary questions, but I’ve tried researching myself to no avail, and am a little scared to throw money around in volatile places (like acorn?). I’m a late bloomer in financial investing/security so bare with me. I know this is a novel, but I just want to ensure that I set my family up for financial success the best ways I can. 

Who knows, maybe someone else will benefit from my financially illiterate questions too? (Probably not)

• Card 1: $11,700

• Card 2: $17,200

• Card 3: $8,800

• Total: $37,700

Last month's interest:

• Card 3: $170

Interest rates:

• Card 1: 24.49&amp;#37;

• Card 2: 20.49&amp;#37;

• Card 3: 24.4&amp;#37;

Monthly amount that I can reasonably devote to paying all this off: $1,500 now, possibly up to $2,000 later in the year.

-) Would this consider a gift and do I have to pay tax on this?

  Hi people,  I’ve been thinking about putting some money into high yield bonds, knowing that they are closer to equities in terms of risk (but not quite as risky) and oftentimes around as high yielding as equities.   The thing is, I’ve heard so many people say that for \*regular\* municipal bonds, to invest in short term (\&lt;5 years) given the interest rate increase risk form the feds that highly probable, about to happen. Of course with shorter term bonds more bonds will come up for maturity and the bond fund management can quickly get another new bond instead of being locked in for 10\-20\+ years as with long term muni bond funds. However, for  \*non regular\* AKA high yielding muni bonds, how much does the term matter? 

The thing is, if for these high yielding muni bonds if it’s super important  to have a short (5 years ish) bond fund instead of a long term fund, then is it worth sacrificing the the yield? Since the longer term the bond then the higher the yield but there will be interest rate risk.  For a 600K portfolio I was initially thinking about doing 100K into NVHIX (Nuveen short term high yield muni bond, lots of articles recommending it but no rated on Morningstar or zack’s) and then 100K divided between BATEX (https://www.zacks.com/funds/mutual\-fund/quote/BATEX) aka (http://www.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/batex/quote.html) and DHMBX (https://www.zacks.com/funds/mutual\-fund/quote/DHMBX) or maybe NCHRX with rest in regular bonds and  in equities and come the impending? Recession of 2019\-2021, sell all my shares in all three high yielding bond funds. But, given that the high yield muni market is small and it is hard to buy and sell, does that mean that I wont even be able to sell these HY Muni funds then or would it be for a lower cost?

It being a narration gives you a false sense of security, that is completely shattered once Alexa tells you what really is happening around you.

Only gripe I would have is probably the fact that it is completely single player, other than that the concept is great.

personalfinance,Is mortgage a good idea for just 5-7 years?,"My spouse and I are considering buying a house but we don't plan on living in our present city / country for more than 5-7 years. Given this and the following terms of the loan are we better off renting or buying?

Interest rate = 2.15%
Loan term = 30 years
Down payment = 13% (our entire life savings btw)
Change in property prices= in our city property prices go up 2-4% on average each year. 

Currently, while renting we save roughly $1000 per month. If we mortgage, we won't be saving much. We'd be making interest payments of roughly $5000 per month and principle payments of $5000 per month. Hoa fees + insurance + utilities would be another $5000 per month.",finance

BlockChain,Blockchain Development Initiative for Foreign Investment by Irish Governmental Agency,"On 11th June, according to The Irish Times, a government agency namely, IDA Ireland is responsible for attracting foreign direct investment (FDI).  They have decided to take an initiative to promote blockchain development and investment.

The local news outlet reported, that the project “Blockchain Ireland” is set to be launched by IDA. It also aspires to promote the blockchain technology and unite with international companies working with blockchain technology. The project “Blockchain Ireland” is an online platform that advertises Ireland as “ideal location” for international blockchain\-focused firms.

The project for the development and investment of blockchain has been initiated by various parties. The parties included are Irish Blockchain Expert Group (IBEG), an IDA Ireland\-led forum, the Department of Finance, Enterprise Ireland, and Consensys, a US\-based software\-production studio that was founded by Ethereum (ETH) co\-founder Joe Lubin.

Last month, the government was urged by the National University Ireland Galway to promote the technology in the country. They highlighted the potential of blockchain technology, how it could help in the growth of the economy and  how it could transform the structure of operations of government and businesses.

In recent years, Ireland has managed to position itself as the hub for tech business. They have attracted foreign companies with a 12.5 percent corporate interest rate as well as tax credits for research and development.

Bitcoin,Why We Are Here,"With the bear market ensuing it is now more important than ever to remember why we are all here in the first place. Here is an Op\-Ed from CryptoGlobe you might enjoy...

We are here because we know something is very wrong in the world. We know that the international monetary system, based on the US dollar, is profoundly corrupt. Why? Because it allows one country to print paper money out of thin air and redeem it for energy and other valuable goods and resources produced by other countries. Thereby enabling the people of that country (or more precisely a small segment of the people in that country) to live at the expense of the rest of humanity. This rigged printing system debases the US dollar after it is spent by the small but powerful few who control its supply. This act robbery is called inflation and year on year it systematically robs all nations and people who have to hold wealth in the US dollar.

We know this absurd privilege is jealously guarded – hence the almost permanent wars in the Middle East and the ceaseless mainstream media propaganda of ‘Terror’ that accompanies the drums of war. This despicable system can only be described as a protection racket. The fact that this system is all encompassing – excluding only a very limited number of jurisdictions – is frightening dystopian nightmare.

We are here because we regret a system of financial repression that enslaves most of humanity by requiring them to accept worthless paper promises issued by their respective elites in exchange for their daily hard work. Or requires them to borrow at extortionate interest rates this same worthless fiat.

We are here because we regret the fiat money system. A system that prints money at will – gifting it into an extremely small group of financial institutions for them to exercise control over us. A system that prevents saving, that creates an artificial illusion of scarcity when we could so easily have a system of abundance, based on sound money.

If only we could overthrow the small coterie of corrupt elites – the ungodly alliance between the money\-printing cartel (the banks centred around the BIS) and the military\-industrial complex (the mercenaries of death centred around Washington and the Pentagon).

What gives them the power to control us? Money. Their control of money and the political narrative around money. Their use of our sheep\-like behaviour in meekly accepting their worthless paper promises. Their use of the welfare state to buy acquiescence, to issue small bribes on a continuous basis in order to maintain the calculus of consent. Our craven willingness, imbued from birth and relentlessly drilled into us every day at school, to accept the boundaries of consciousness set by the state and surrender all faculties of critical thinking.

Hence bitcoin. Hence crypto. Bitcoin (and its ancillary protocols) is devised to be everything that fiat money is not. It is deflationary where the existing system is wildly inflationary. It is an anchor in a safe harbour whilst the existing system demands that we should be permanently at sea and should never find rest. It demands personal responsibility and self\-actualisation while the existing system encourages childish selfishness, endless self\-indulgence and a culture of entitlement. It is permissionless and free where the existing system is weighed down by command and control and the Kafkaesque tyranny of “compliance.” It is non\-political and decentralised whereas existing currencies are political and are thereby used as a means of financing war and suppressing dissent.

We aim to cast off the fetters of fiat and save humanity from the existing system of slavery which masquerades as progressive liberalism. We aim to dispossess the banks and the mercenaries of death. We aim to be free.

Welcome to the revolution.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,"In 2014 I worked for a contractor and was laid off seven months later. I owed ~$2400 to the IRS and paid, now they want more?","2014 was a big year for me tax-wise.  I bought a house, I was in college, I had a job in the beginning and got hired on as a contractor in my field.  I was let go abruptly, and when tax time came around I found I owed a cool $2400.  I contacted the IRS, worked out a payment plan, and they took $120 out of my account direct for nearly 2 years.  

This morning I got a letter saying I have a lien against my account and owe another $860.  I have the paperwork showing my payments.  My bank (USAA) has a statement every single month from the IRS showing their withdrawal.  I've never been contacted about anything extra, and I did all of my taxes and talked to them.

Does the IRS make mistakes like this even when I set up everything through them?  I'm going to call in an hour when they open, but I have no idea what to do other than, ""Please look at my account and find where I paid you money for two years.""

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

UPDATE: So it is from the state revenue department. However, this letter came as a notice of a lien against me for failure to pay, but it's also the first I've seen from the state, especially from this year.

I called the lien department, disputed because I've set up payment plans and paid through a service the IRS provided me where, since I also owed federal taxes, they took on the state taxes through their plan - or so I thought.

I got sent through a few departments with our state (surprise) and they said nothing came through from the federal side, so I needed to contact IRS.

I call IRS, they've run through my past history, say my account through them is fine, but to their knowledge nothing came from them to the state. When I inquired why they offered the plan and it didn't happen, they seemed to believe it was an error on their side, and the $2400 I paid was all federal.

So I've run through my bank statements. I've owed state/federal since that year and I've paid. Everything seems good. I have not received anything about 2014 since 2014 (aside from pay statements). It's really confusing to me.

I don't like that they're currently saying it's in collections and I'll have fees and stuff for no communication prior, but I never got anything. Will update again when I have more info as to what is going on.



**FINAL EDIT:  After the 4 1/2 hour runaround I have confirmed that I paid the IRS, and that my state had fudged a number somewhere along the line.  I had paid the initial amount to the state in full (~$300), but there was an issue.  They claim they sent about 4 letters over the past 3 years, and that they have my same address on file, but I never got any of them.  I was never notified in future tax filings.**

**When I brought to their attention my attentiveness to my taxes and taking care of them (as I owe every year), they pretty much gave me a clear ""Tough Shit"" and told me there's nothing they could do about the lien and that it'll only be lifted once I pay off the balance.**

**So, I paid off the balance.  And they told me it'll be 60 days before they lift the lien.  I had the person I spoke to clarify to me that there was NOTHING left against my name for any amount of time because this has been an awful and expensive experience, and I'm clear.  I called the IRS again and made sure there were no surprises there (none, so that's good), and then I asked for documentation that this was paid, and that there's NOTHING left.**

**My advice - If you are halfway decent in any specialized field and some guy comes and offers you a lot of money for a contract position, save as much as you can and don't listen when they say you're a valuable asset and they want to see what you can do and you're 100% safe - because I was canned the week after finishing/presenting a project and apparently I haven't gotten away from the financial burden impacted in January 2015 until this afternoon.**  

**To Add - Not saying it's the job's fault that I'm in this now.  I was naive, had a fat ego, and didn't budget because it was the first time I was making money and I was having a great time planning my wedding and travelling with my wife.  I couldn't even get a job at Wal Mart to supplement my finances in the interim between losing that job, and it took 15 months for me to find new, gainful employment.  Treat yourself as number one, and treat any job as temporary (at least form a personal, financial standpoint), or you'll be like me and have the worst Tuesday morning ever.**  

**Thank you to everyone who took the time out of your day to talk to me and help me out.  I appreciate it very much.  You guys are great!  Have a great (and less expensive) day!**",finance

personalfinance,"25 years old, 8K in credit card debt - feeling overwhelmed and in need of advice","Hi all, I thought to write so as to just reach out to people and hear honest opinions / (hopefully) encouraging words.

I'm 25 years old living in Japan.

Due to nothing but simple stupidity and reckless spending to keep up with glorified lifestyle and friends, I managed to compile 8K in credit card debt (one card, annual interest rate of 15&amp;#37;) in less than 2 years.

I make 40K a year and take home income is about 2600\~2700 (USD) per month. I'm so tired of living pay check to pay check and the debt is stressing me out so much. I'm overwhelmed and scared, and would appreciate some words of wisdom and encouragement.

Budgeting (disposable income 2650) :

* Rent 830
* Utilities (water, gas, electricity, internet, phone plan) 160
* Food (groceries, eating out, coffee; I don't drink) 300
* Transportation (I live in Tokyo so this cover my commute pass &amp; all train rides): 100
* Swim lesson 150
* Toiletries/Medical (I have a skin condition that requires certain medical /skin products): 100
* Entertainment/going out/any shopping: 200
* Savings: 250   \-\-this includes funds for travel (I go back to my home country once a year)
* Monthly Credit Card Payment: 500

Why I am worried and what I would like advice on:

1. Does my budget sound okay? Should I save less and put that on credit card payment instead?
2. What would be the ideal target date to clear off all this debt? At current rate, I can be debt free in 15 months. (This is assuming my income does not change due to promotion, raise, job change, etc)
3. I feel so guilty of spending money on swim lessons but this has been something I have always wanted to do (I couldn't swim and I've improved a lot with these personal lessons), and is a big help in relieving stress. Should I cut it out in order to route this money to debt payment?
4. I'm really stressed out about having this debt and can't believe I made this mistake. I'm really weary of using credit card now \- is it a good idea to just stop using credit cards all together?
5. Is it ridiculous hoping to go on a vacation (cheap place like Thailand?) while paying off debt?

Some of these questions might sound stupid and naive, but I'm really ashamed that I made this mistake, and want to do everything in my power to fix this ASAP. I would appreciate honest opinions. Thank you!",finance

personalfinance,How can I legally shield myself from income/capital gains taxes in an optimal way?,"early 20's techie living in the bay area, CA. I was apart of an IPO (and have RSU's). Here's my current budget overview...

40&amp;#37; \- Brokerage for stock, mutual funds, etc

32&amp;#37; \- expenses (rent, food, drinks, etc)

8&amp;#37; \- Roth IRA (estimated &amp;#37; per paycheck to hit the cap for the year)

company 401(k): 6&amp;#37;

?&amp;#37; \- Any excess not spent from expenses goes into Robinhood

\~15,000 in student loan debt, 4&amp;#37; interest rate. Paying off gradually. No credit card debt. 

Issues

1. When I hit my RSU cliff in 2019, my salary for the year will probably exceed the max for Roth IRA. Backdoor IRA?
2. If I choose to exercise them, I will undoubtably have to pay about half of them in taxes. Is there anything I can do now to prepare for this?

My thoughts... can/should I begin to increase or max out my 401(k) to account for this event? Given rules/regs around home ownership (you can pull from 401(k) for first home), should I consider purchasing a home before my cliff?

personalfinance,How Do I Achieve A Perfect Credit Score?,"Hello.

I'm 35. I live in Philadelphia. Divorced. My credit score is 768. I'd like to try to get that as close to 860 as I can in the next year or two because I'm looking to buy a home in the next few years as I save up my down payment.

Personal Finance Details:

I've been successfully self employed illustrator/designer/creative type for about 12 years. In 2017 I made $80k. This year I'm on track to make $120k or more. I've saved about 85k for retirement, in a Fidelity Traditional IRA. I pay about $1500/mo in rent (1000) and living expenses (500\+/\-) give or take depending on gas and electric usage.

Personal Credit Details:

I have one open line of credit \- a Chase credit card that I use about 1/3 to 1/2 of the $3200 limit on at any given time, then pay off in full once the transactions post. I've never been late on a payment. I own my car, it was financed for 12k in 2007 and paid off in full in about 4 years. My Student loan was the only other line of credit which I paid off 6 years after graduating in one lump sum check. Both loans were always paid on time as well. I've closed one credit card through TD bank, about 8 years ago. It was always paid on time and rarely used. I closed it because it had steep annual service fees and a high interest rate.   


What can I do to increase my score? Should I open another credit card? Two? Should I get a new car (loan) to pay off to build credit? What are my other options?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I'm happy to update with more info if I'm leaving anything out. Thank you for reading!",finance

I have fewer financial responsibilities, so I'm trying to figure out what the best plan of attack is for my financial future. 

The cresit card debt is split between two cards, both with a 0% interest rate. The introductory interest rates are set to expire this December and early next year. I'm currently paying slightly more than the minimum payments necessary to pay them off before their respective promotional interest rate expiration dates.

My student loan debt... 50k ugh. I'm currently on an IBR plan, that is at a $0 monthly minimum payment through December. There are multiple individual loans with varying interest rates -- anywhere from 3-8%. The loans with the lowest interest rates have the smallest balances (starting with a principal balance of a couple hundred dollars). The majority of the loans have a principal balance of a few thousand dollars with the higher interest rates. I have still been making small monthly auto-payments for the break in interest they gave me for signing up for the auto-pay feature, but am just now in a position where I can pay more on them. 

I have enough liquid assets to completely pay off the credit card debt, but life could get sticky if any major emergencies occurred. I was also considering using some of those funds to pay off  a few of the smaller student loans, but I'm  hesitant to do that. I'm also considering consolidating the loans to try and get a better interest rate, and don't know how paying off those lower interest loans might impact the consolidated interest rate...

I am a bit financially illiterate, but trying to break free of it as I'm now self-employed and have $11,000 from my dad's retirement after his passing. My primary goal is paying off my student loans - I owe a little over $46,000 in Sallie Mae and federal loans. I plan on using the debt avalanche method and attacking the highest interest rates first.

personalfinance,Student Loan Refinance or Consolidation?,"Hi all,

I have just graduated this past May, and I start my career next Monday, and I'm super excited. With my income going from 0 to 45k a year, I am looking to pay off my student loans very quickly (hopefully 5\-8 years). I have an agreement with my parents (cosigner) to split the monthly minimum 50/50, and then I will be making additional payments, as much as I can while still enjoying my 20's (although I'm typically frugal) and 20&amp;#37; of my income.

I'm looking for some help with my situation. Currently I have 4 different private loans with the same company (Discover). They vary slightly in balance, between 15k and 20k. The interest rates also vary, 2 of them being at 8.9&amp;#37;, one at 8.49&amp;#37;, and one at 5.49&amp;#37;. In total I owe 77k in student loans. Using the calculator for minimum monthly payments, it estimates, in total (for all 4 loans), I will owe slight over $1,000 a month, minimum. Does this sound right?

I'm wondering if I could consolidate them, how does this work, would this bring my monthly payment down?

How about refinancing? I realize these loans have high interest rates, especially compared to the national average. Where can I look to refinance and consolidate these loans? Could someone enlighten me on my situation. I am new to this and want to get a head start in paying these down in the most strategic way. Thanks!

EDIT: I should add that I believe I have some federal loans on top of these, but I have no information on them. I will have to wait for my parents to get home to discuss this further. Sorry!",finance
personalfinance,"Bank overcharged me $14,000.","(Canada) I took out a student loan in 2001 and I've been making payments on it ever since. I got a call from the lender (TD Canada Trust) last week informing me that I'd been paying borrower's insurance on my dad (a co-signer) but that they had screwed up and never officially added him as a co-borrower on the loan. They told me that they'd be returning the $14,000 they'd charged in error over the past 17 years. Good news, right?

I asked if I'd be getting a cheque, and they said they were applying it to the balance of the loan.

Here's the problem: the interest rate on the loan is prime + 1.5. I have a credit card with a much higher interest rate I'd prefer to pay off instead. When I signed the loan contract 17 years ago, I agreed to a specific payment schedule, and I believe this falls outside of terms of the loan agreement. Charging me for a service that was never rendered, then using that amount to accelerate the repayment of the loan doesn't pass the smell test for me. Anyone else?

personalfinance,How will a sudden jump in income ($20k) affect my public assistance?,"Hi, Reddit. I hope I can get some help here.
I recently scratched off a $2 ticket to find I won $20,000. Which is insane to me, but I downloaded the official New Jersey Lottery app and verified it's indeed a winning ticket.

Now, I looked up to find that after the 24% federal and 5% state tax, it would be $14,200. 
Which is amazing; but I have also been living on $0 income for a few months now, and I currently live in 'supportive housing', which technically is NOT Section 8 housing, but to the same effect, is income-based (30% of my income goes towards rent, whatever that may be). I have not applied for food stamps or any other form of public assistance yet, as I was hoping to get help soon finding a good job (I got approved for DVR help, the Division of Vocational Rehabilitation, as I have a disability on file, and I just moved into this housing a few months ago, so they're transferring the case to this new county still). I also have Medicaid.

I'm concerned that when I cash this lottery ticket in, I could lose my public assistance, which honestly took a good long time for me to get. I'm very lucky to not be homeless. 

I worked out a preliminary budget plan for what I would even do with $14,200; $5000 would go towards my little 9-year-old brother's savings account so maybe when he's 18 he has a good chunk of money to work with for college or a car, $2000 to his adoptive mom and dad (total), $4000 towards getting a car (and $1000 on top of that to pre-pay for car insurance, which would cover a bit over two years, with the NJ dollar-a-day car insurance, as well as another $500 towards gas money), $1000 would go into an emergency fund for me, $200 for immediate expenses such as food and toiletries, and the last $500 would be wiggle room for things such as a gym membership and a personal freezer (I don't have access currently to a freezer in my apartment, and it would help to store food).

I like the plan I have set up; getting a car would be INSANE, on top of everything else, and I'd love to help out my little brother and his family. I only just met them about a year ago now, as I aged out of foster care a little bit ago, and didn't know about him until recently. They've been an amazing support since then.

I really don't know that much about New Jersey laws regarding people of my income bracket who are receiving public assistance, who win the lottery, though. I don't know how that will impact me in the near future, or if there's some other plan I should take.

I also don't know what ""putting $5000 away for my little brother"" entails, where I would invest or anything.

One thing I'm thinking about as well, is that the hard '30% of income equals monthly rent' rule might get...weird if 30% would exceed the total calculated monthly cost of the apartment, which I'm sure is around $1500. Usually, whatever the 30% I pay doesn't cover in that cost is picked up by the housing voucher, but I don't actually know what happens if 30% translates to that much.

On both of these the interest increases depending on the balance.

(I live in Iceland, so i'm gonna translate it and convert to USD)

So the first account is called ""interest account - Premium rate account""

The Interest account - premium rate account is not inflation-indexed, deposit for a shorter or longer period without a long-term commitment.

This one offers monthly interest payments of: 

$0 - $2000 @ 1.54%

$2000 - $10.000 @ 1.54%

$10.000 - $50.000 @ 2.28%

$50.000 - $200k @ 2.57%

Anything over $200k @ 3.15% 

-
The next one is called ""Interest account 30""
Here is a text from the bank website about this account:

Interest account 30 is a non-indexed savings account where the interest rate rises in increments, depending on the account balance.

The entire balance on the account is locked-in with no fixed final date. Withdrawals may be made 31 days after submitting a withdrawal request, i.e. 30 days must elapse between the date the request is made and the date the funds will be available. When requesting a withdrawal the customer states the account to which the funds are to be paid.

Interest account 30 is suitable for individuals who can wait 30 days for funds to be available after a request for withdrawal is made.

This one offers annual interest payments of:

$0 - $10.000 @ 2.60%

$10.000 - $50.000 @ 3.15%

$50.000 - $200k @ 3.45%

$200k - $600k @ 3.75%

Anything over $600k @ 4%

I hope someone can help me with understanding how these accounts work. I basically need a ELI5 on this subject. I am just getting into finance (as a hobby/personal interest. Not a career) And just trying to learn all i can.
And hopefully after this i will be able to confidently pick a savings account to go with.",finance

Forex,Le Intro,"Hi y'all!

I feel like it's time to become active here. Time to add some value here.

I started out in my lovely currency speculation journey at the end of January this year.

In the time up to this moment, I joined a ""training company"" (ended up being another scam network marketing scheme), paid an amount to learn a sub-standard strategy from a crooked ""guru"" (the experience opened doors for me though), basically locked myself indoors doing some RIGOROUS studying, and made a lot of useful connections via the Telegram app.

Oh, and I also dumped HotForex for Tickmill. Totally love their spreads.

At this point, I'm quite comfortable with my trading abilities. I learnt a WHOLE LOT about fundamentals. The strategy I'm employing is strictly technical, but I love keeping abreast with the macroeconomic and political bits that actually result in price momentum.

Fundies are fun!

Speaking of my strategy, I'm really into moving averages: simple, exponential, weighted, etc. Plug in Bollinger Bands aaaaaaaaaand it's a perfect match. It's worth remembering that the Bollinger mid-line is actually a simple moving average set to Period 20 on default settings.

I use one type of entry/exit strategy based on the MAs. There's another but it's still being backtested by me. Of course, there's the sub-standard strategy (also based on MAs) taught to me by the ""guru"". I don't use it anymore, but I still have that SMA80 on my charts just because. 😊 

I'm also developing a strategy for trading fundies, but it's still in alpha. Sentimental analysis is a bugger as investors can be very dissociative often, so I'm not keen on trading fundies. I used to ride volatility spikes back in the day, but I've gone beyond that phase. 

Consistency is the foundation of my trading style.

That's about it. I was going to get back into the market, but it's almost close of trading AKA those few hours when the bid-ask spreads go crazy.

Forgot to add. My style is scalping, but it's sensible scalping. My strategy isn't suited for intraday trading, though I hold some positions for as long as 3 hours until they hit TP. Swinging and position trades are not my thing, though I'll likely dabble in them in the future.

Sooooooooooooooooooo that's it. Remember, there's action from the Fed, ECB, and BoJ ahead this week. The G7 brouhaha and the Trump/Kim summit barely rattled the market, but when central banks cough, you totally want to pay attention.

personalfinance,Student considering personal loan to cover first few months of rent,"So...I'm starting grad school this fall and plan to take out student loans to cover housing/whatever tuition isn't cover by my financial aid package + federal loans. I did the calculations and I'll likely be borrowing less than 10k in private loans. 

The catch is that my school's financial aid office doesn't disburse my refund check with my loan money until mid to late September, and my lease for my new apartment starts July 1st.  

I need $1385 up front (first and last months rent plus security deposit), and then rent for August and September ($450 per month).

Is it wise to take out a small personal loan of ~$2300 to cover rent?

I don't know how much food I share with my girlfriend and how much is just for me. I have just spent some time at sea and will have a check coming in for about $2,000. My question is, what to do with this check and how to manage my loans further? I was thinking of throwing 1,000 at Loan 1 and 500 at my credit card. Going forward how much should I be putting towards my loans a month and should I focus on one (Loan 1) and leave the others?

personalfinance,[US]Is there any way for me to afford to work less while still in school?,"Hi PF, just wanted to get your guys’ opinions and advice on my current financial situation. I’m 25 living in Florida, have been attending college on-and-off for 5 years due to personal struggles and helping out my parents who were in poor health. Their health improved greatly, and I just recently moved out, and now I really want to be able to focus on school and finish off my B.S. in Cybersecurity. I’ve worked full time+ for the last 7 years and am trying to figure out a way to be able to cut my work hours dramatically in order to focus on school/certifications and take a heavier course load. I don’t mind creating manageable debt, I believe that once I find employment in my field I will be able to pay off my debts with relative “ease.”

My current financial situation:

**Income/Savings:**

*	$13.50/hour income, very flexible hours

*	$3,000 in savings

*	$2,070 in Pell Grant per semester for upcoming Fall/Spring/Summer semesters, probably more for the 2020 school year

*	$0-x,xxx in scholarships/other grants if/when awarded


**Expenses/Loans:**

*	$525 monthly rent + all utilities

*	$220 monthly car

*	$92 monthly insurance

*	$86 monthly phone

*	$37 other monthly subscriptions

*	$80 monthly gas

*	~$400 monthly food/entertainment(this can be cut down a bit)

*	~$9,000 in tuition/books left to complete my degree, should be finished Summer 2020

*	$5,000 left to pay on auto loan(1.8% interest rate if I remember correctly)

*	$9,200 in deferred student loans, I know I am paying some % interest on these but I do not have the loan structure in front of me

Ideally I would work 2 days/20 hours a week, but realistically I know I’ll probably have to do 3/30. 30 hours a week puts me at ~$1,375 take home monthly, which puts me at around a $100/month deficit before college expenses are calculated. The next three semesters I plan on taking 15 classes which will cost ~$6,000, so the Pell Grant I received will cover that, and hopefully future grants cover future tuition. 

There is obviously risk involved in creating any kind of debt, but is it feasible for me to be able to do this? I’m single and see no kids/large purchases any time in the foreseeable future, I just want to be able to finally focus on school, get in to my industry and get the hell out of food service. My credit scores are 706 via Transunion and 655 via Equifax, are there options available for me to be able to work fewer hours that aren’t incredibly expensive and risky? Am I just a baby who needs to suck it up and work harder? I feel like being able to succeed in school and get in to my career field quicker is worth taking out loans, but I do not know what my options are or if the risks involved outweigh the benefits. 

Thank you.",finance
personalfinance,Can I refinance (student) government loans or pay them off using private loans?,"Just looked at my statements and realized that my private loans are at least half as high of an interest rate as my government ones, so I'm getting boned on those. Bonus points because my govt loans are at 55k and my private ones are at 32k, so I'm getting boned FAST. I incur $310 in interest on my govt loans while my monthly payment is $325, so I'll be at that until I die. Meanwhile, my private loans are at only 4.35% average and my govt loans are at 5.64% average (with some as high as 7.5%). My credit score is very good, but the govt loans aren't in my name, so I'm getting 0 benefits from those.

Just assume I'm paying them, hell I'd love to move them into my name to make it easier and get benefits from it) to make the interest rate lower so I can actually start paying it off.

personalfinance,Looking for opinions on a couple options for the future,"Background:

* I'm in the middle of a divorce, expecting to finalize everything early 2019
* I finish my degree at the end of this year and expect to receive a $10k raise at that time
* I own my house and currently rent it out for less than my mortgage payment
* I live with my parents, rent free, but continue to pay my other bills myself. 
   * They are planning to move halfway across the country (US) some time next year to be closer to my mom's family

My issue:

* Per the draft divorce agreement,  I will have 1\-year from the date of the divorce to either sell or refinance the house
   * The house is roughly $10k underwater (purchased in '07, lost half its value, has not recovered, and there have been 2 refinances since then)
   * To refinance it as an investment property, I need roughly $45k in the next 18 months to get the equity to where the bank is comfortable with it
* Comps say I should be able to rent my house out for about $200 more than what I'm currently charging. However, I'm seeing a lot of units sit for a few months before they're pulled from the market (no idea if they're actually leased or just pulled)
   * This would bump rent above the mortgage payment, but my cash flow would still be negative, once insurance, HOA, and property management fees are factored in
* I would like to purchase a new home for myself in a different area in the near future
   * I do not have the cash for a down payment at this time

My options:

* Short sale at the end of my post\-divorce year, take the hit on my credit and hope someone will be willing to rent to me in the neighborhood I want
   * Alternatively, try to buy a house with little to no down payment before the post\-divorce year is up, and go through with the short sale afterwards
* My tenants have indicated they're interested in buying a house at the end of their current lease, March 2019
   * Offer them a 3 year rent\-to\-own option and try to renegotiate the terms of my divorce agreement (assuming they accept)
* Continue renting the house for another year and pay an additional $300\-$400 towards the principle and hope it's enough to avoid a short sale at the end of the year 
   * This assumes I can afford this in addition to rent after my parents move
   * Also assumes the house doesn't sit vacant at all during that time
* Move back into the house for a year so I can call it my primary residence and refinance without hassle over the equity. 
   * Based on today's interest rates, it will raise the mortgage payment by about $200\-$300
   * I'll probably try to get a roommate
   * Sell or rent it out again whenever I'm ready to make a down payment on a new house

I have an appointment next week to talk to a financial adviser and another to talk to my realtor, but I'd like some outside opinions. Pros and cons of my options? Is there a 5th option I haven't considered? Is there a glaring hole anywhere in my logic? 

tl:dr \- Divorce sucks and I'm stuck with an underwater house and I don't know what to do with it. Halp!",finance
Bitcoin,"We are living in the currency dark ages. The movement away from the gold standard has been a set back for the human race in general. An exceprt from ""The Bitcoin Standard"" by Safiedean Ammous.","""It is an astonishing fact of modern life that an entrepreneur in the year 1900 could make global economic plans and calculations all denominated in any international currency, with no thought whatsoever given to exchange rate fluctuations. A century later, the equivalent entrepreneur trying to make an economic plan across borders faces an array of highly volatile exchange rates that might make him think he has walked into a Salvador Dali painting. Any sane analyst looking at this mess would conclude it would be best to just tie the value of money to gold again and be rid of this juggling act, thus solving the Impossible Trinity by eliminating the need for government‐controlled monetary policy, and having free capital movement and free trade. This would at once create economic stability and free up a large amount of capital and resources to the production of valuable goods and services, rather than speculation on complex exchange rate oscillations.""",cryptocurrency

gaming,Fallout: The Burger Joint,"So there’s this burger joint called Fallout. When you really think about it it’s not the best name for a place where you want to relax have a few suds and down some awesome grass fed beef but hey….to each his own right? Anyway you’ve been a Fallout fan since the beginning, you remember right? Back when they were just Burgers and fries, maybe topped with a good ole slice of American Cheese. I mean their menu didn’t have a lot but what it did have was damn good. 

Well eventually that little Burger shack grew. The next thing you heard about was their new burger, a Bourbon Barbecue Sauce burger. Half pound of meat, tangy house made Bourbon barbecue sauce, lettuce tomato cheddar cheese and crispy bacon. Holy hell that thing was good. Now when you showed up at that little shack off of Route 5 there was a line…like EVERY time you went. A few months later you find out that the little shack is moving to a bigger building downtown and their planning to build two more in the greater metropolitan area, which is great for you because you’re hooked.

A year later they drop a new burger on you. This ones called the Decadent Chedder Cheeseburger. Garlicky whole beef patties, braised shallots, fresh arugula and their special made Smokey mayonnaise. You never thought they could do better than the Bourbon burger but MY GOD this thing melted in your mouth. And again the little burger joint that started in the little red shack on route 5 called Fallout exploded. Now they went nationwide, everyone raved about it celebrity’s and sports stars starred in witty and funny commercials that were seen everywhere on every channel. The nation was hooked!

A year later they announce a new burger. This ones is a Hawaiian burger. You’re like ok, ok it’s a little weird. Pineapple on a burger, teriyaki sauce. But you gingerly try it and you well up with TEARS on how good this burger was….screw the other three burgers THIS one is AMAZING!! 

Now Fallout is worldwide, Germany, Japan, Russia EVERYONE is getting a taste of what started in that little rickety red shack on route 5 called Fallout the burger joint….

A couple years pass….

A stray announcement shows up on the television. There are no pictures just a black screen and words…

Crispy lettuce, succulent tomatoes, decadent private stock aged cheese, Juicy pure 100&amp;#37; ground beef from the best cows in the country…..then the screen goes black and a date appears. The date is in two months.

You find yourself salivating and go to bed stomach growling. The next few weeks are excruciating, you keep going back to your favorite burger joint and getting your favorite burgers. In fact you go back and try all of them back to their original one just for the nostalgic feeling. You even try to press the employees for more information on this brand new burger that’s coming but their super vague, you begin to think they are left in the dark as well.

You can’t concentrate at work, everytime Jerry from accounting asks everyone to go out to lunch you snap to the calendar hoping it shows you that it’s THAT day…new burger day. The day your life and pallet will change…but alas the date is still a few weeks away. 

As the date grows closer its all you can think about. You search google and reddit for hints and fan theory’s (and everyone seems to have one) A few claim to know exactly what it is but you’re sure that it’s just hooey. 

Finally the day arrives. Fallout opens at 11 and when you arrive in the parking lot you find that there are no spots left, so you double park in front of a Prius in the corner (not like a guy driving a PRIUS could kick your ass right?)

You get in line at the door, everyone is standing there and a nervous tension covers the crowd. Everyone is whispering in hushed tones to each other speculating how good this burger is going to be. You hear a guy 4 up from you claim that he already had one and it was AMAZING. His friends look upon him with Godlike reverence.

Finally the clock strikes 11 and the doors swing open. The crowd rushes forward madly, the line dissolves into a cacophony of bodies each pushing forward to be the first person to try this wondrous new concoction that Fallout has produced. 

“I WANT THE NEW THING!” you scream at the waitress even before she had a chance to reach your table. She nods scribbles something down on her pad and heads in the back. A few moments later she returns plate in hand. You can feel the drool running down your muzzle. She puts it down in front of you and….

Its Tacos…

Tacos?

Tacos…

Wait what?

I mean I like Tacos…they’re great… I mean who doesn’t like Tacos? But this is the best burger joint out there…and their new product is Tacos? I mean people made Fallout the place that it was because of their awesome burgers. In fact Fallout is what it is because of the peoples love of burgers.

And they made tacos…

As the waitress walks away she looks over her shoulder and says.

“Oh by the way their community tacos too, I mean you can definitely eat them on your own, but people will try to steal them and it’s more fun with friends.”

Tacos… 

I mean you're kinda happy about this new thing...but man...if it was a new burger that would've been great...

TL:DR The E3 Fallout 76 Announcement (to me) was like being served Tacos at the best burger joint in the nation",technology

Does it ever make sense to cash out a 401k to tackle credit card debt?   I have a friend with $22k of credit card debt at a blended interest rate of 22&amp;#37;.  My friend also has $14k in a 401k.  

Although the general logic is that it  doesn't usually make sense to cash out a 401k prematurely, I think this circumstance may go against that.  My friend is paying out $400 a month in credit card interest (about $650 in total debt service if you include principal).  To me, it makes sense to pay down a chunk of the credit cards with the 401k (despite paying taxes and the 10&amp;#37; penalty), and with the monthly savings in debt service, continue paying down the credit cards (""Snowball method"").

Once the credit cards are paid off, my friend could contribute that $650 a month back to a 401k, and likely catch up/exceed the current pace of his 401k's compounding interest.  

Any thoughts?  Supporting math would be helpful as well.  Thanks!",finance
IOT,Importance of IoT Security Compliance,"**What is Internet of Things IoT?**
  
Internet of things or IoT is possibly the next step in the evolution of the internet. IoT refers to the hundreds of physical devices that are connected to exchange data with each other over a network. It reduces human intervention in everyday activities. It can be any device ranging from personal computers, phones, and routers to baby monitors, Bluetooth locking systems, autonomous and IoT connected vehicles and more. Such devices, when connected to a network, perform functions that make life easier in general. Our Bluetooth devices, home assistants, security cameras, printers, refrigerators, smart home and office solutions and other connected devices are all basic examples of IoT Devices.

**So what is the importance of IoT security Compliance?**

**Security and Privacy:**

70% of IoT devices have a significant security vulnerability. When there are so many devices that are connected to each other over nonsecure platforms the possibility of data security and cyber security being compromised are incredibly high. For instance, Chevrolet reported an increase in data usage by 200% for its internet-connected vehicles. In spite of its advantages, this also exposes vehicles to possibilities of a security breach. As expected hackers were able to remotely control the brakes and steering of one of their vehicles. The impact of such hacking into any physical product is immense. Apart from the loss of brand loyalty, payment of claims, product recall; such security compromises can also lead to loss of life and property. To cite another instance, there have been studies where doctors have been handed hacked devices which have led to the death of simulated patients.It is horrifying to consider the real life implications.


Security Breach cases related to IoT Devices are in fact innumerable:

Fiat Chrysler recalled 8000 jeeps over wireless hacking.
A hacker took control of a couples baby monitor in Ohio.
J&amp;J Warned Diabetic patients that Insulin pumps are vulnerable to hacking.
Notice that we have still not even begun talking about the vulnerability of corporate and personal data and the consequences of data theft. The result of such noncompliance can be catastrophic for safety and privacy of businesses, networks, individuals in particular and the society in general.

In Spite of such dire consequences, most manufacturing companies do not abide by any IoT security measures. This is mostly due to lack of scalable security standards which can be easily implemented.

However, in the face of such potential danger from insecure IoT systems, it is imperative that Manufacturing Companies take IoT Security Compliance seriously, to avoid market backlash.

**Security Policies:**

Security Policies are on their way, and the sooner most companies implement IoT security compliance measure, the better prepared they shall be to meet such policies and prevent disruption of operations. In fact, The Internet of Things (IoT) Cybersecurity Improvement Act of 2017 is a bill pending before the US Senate which seeks to put in place a basic level of security that all IoT devices sold to the US Federal Government must comply with. Once passed it is expected that a similar guideline for manufacturers to provide the same level of security to consumer grade products will follow.

There are some industry-specific standards too such as NERC-CIP which was developed specifically for the electric utility industry. NIST Cybersecurity Framework applies to the energy, financial, healthcare systems, and was developed to help these industries protect information and physical assets from DDoS attack.

Even though a more all-encompassing IoT security policy is awaited, service providers and manufacturers of IoT devices must not wait to start adopting security policies. Rather companies must be enthusiastic about setting standards of market security and IoT compliance. This will help them build brand reputation, ensure consumer safety as well as align product development with emerging standards and get a head start as security standards are implemented.

**How to ensure IoT Security Compliance?**
Given the above scenario, many organizations want to implement IoT security standards. In fact studies suggest that, “security and LoB leaders are experiencing high levels of anxiety due to IoT/OT security concerns, largely due to the negative business ramifications a security failure can have on critical business operations.”. As a result several organisations prefer to outsource their IoT Security Compliance framework to third-party organisations which work to ensure that a business is compliant with necessary security measures. A well developed IoT Security compliance framework helps a company to ensure that all their IoT devices, products, and services are protected from security threats.

While choosing a Security Compliance Framework organizations must ensure that it boasts of the following features:


It is important that any IoT Security Framework comprise of the above features in order to ensure blanket security of physical products as well as data. Such features will mitigate the threat potential of IoT Networks to ensure:

Sallie Mae and my fed loans put me on a payment plan eventually and everything has been great! I've been making payments over the last 4 years and starting to make progress.  


I thought that Wells Fargo was working with me \- but actually ended up hurting me more than I thought. I've been paying Wells Fargo $50/mo for the past 4 years. I recently used Credit Karma to get an overview of my situation. Turns out that Wells Fargo charged off my loans ($26k) 4 years ago \- and my $50/mo is not really helping.  At this point, I just want to get this 26k charge off my credit report.   


What would be my best option? Since the loan is already charged off \- the damage is already done on my credit, correct? Should I just stop paying the $50/mo  \- start saving with that, tax return and bonus and try to have them settle for 40&amp;#37; of what I owe? Any suggestions would be great.

After that I will be going back to university for the year. My parents thankfully are paying my tuition, but there is the possibility I may have to pay 1 years tuition out of pocket, which amount to about 10k, but that would be in a year or 2.  
  
My question is how and where should I start saving my money? I have half my money in a tax-free savings account, and the other half in a high interest savings account with a different bank. Should I move most of it into my TFSA? I was speaking with my boss and he said I could also invest it into a mutual fund or index fund to try and earn capital with that money since I know for sure it is $10,000 I wont be spending for the time being. I may not even need it to pay my tuition, and I'd like to start saving and maybe investing so that in 10-15 years I have some decent returns on that money.  

 Currently my TFSA boasts a .8% interest rate, and my High interest account has a .83% rate (not much but hey). I was also thinking of maybe switching banks to one with better rates  but at the end of the day the interest I'd be earning would be in the ones of dollars, so it doesn't seem like theres much of a point.

I also plan on working the following summer, So I think that maybe investing now would be a good idea? I don't know much about finances other than: Don't spend all you're money, don't go in debt.

worldpolitics,German chemical company that helped Saddam gas Kurds now operating in Iraq,"""Visions of Iran"": the Iranian Film Festival in Cologne

**Halabja – casting a long shadow**


The First Gulf War, the chemical attack on the Iraqi village of Halabja in 1988 and the role played by foreign companies in the build-up of chemical weapons in the region were the main topics at the most recent ""Visions of Iran"" film festival in Cologne. By Bernd G. Schmitz

...""Today, it is known that Singapore, the Netherlands, Egypt, India, Germany, Luxembourg and Brazil provided possible basic substances. The equipment needed for production came from Spain, Austria and France. **The lion's share, however, (52 percent) came from Germany**. In this context, the name of the laboratory equipment manufacturer **Karl Kolb of Dreieich near Frankfurt** is often mentioned. The German news weekly Der Spiegel has often reported on the role played by this company and its now defunct subsidiary, Pilot Plant, in the production of Iraqi poison gas. German courts never felt there was enough evidence for a conviction, as there was in the case of the Dutch entrepreneur Frans van Anraat.. 

The [company website] section on the company's history describes how Karl Kolb received the Order of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1983, but makes no mention of his business links to Saddam Hussein's Iraq.

...The company opened an office in the Iraqi city of Basra in 2010 and even sent a company representative to a scientific conference in Tehran in 2017. ""It is,"" she said, ""as if the war, the poison gas and the business deals never happened.""

personalfinance,What bank is right for me?,"I know people on here advocate credit unions, but I don't think I'll be taking advantage of their benefits (more favorable interest rates).  To start, I'll give a brief overview of how I'm laying out finances.  I want to do a checking account that I'll deposit paychecks into and use for misc smaller fees.  I plan to have a savings account at one of the ~1.7% interest online-only banks for my emergency fund.  I'll have a credit card that I put most things on and pay off before each pay period ends (current score is 660).  Once that's going, I'm going to have a series of down payments which need to be made over the years

I can handle the selection of the interest-only online bank.  I'm wondering how to choose a bank with good credit card/checking account perks and/or convenient apps/network.  I'm a STEM PhD student with a 30k yearly stipend.  I won't have massive costs (low CoL area), but I won't have thousands and thousands of dollars sitting in the bank accruing interest either.  It's for that reason that I'm thinking a bank might be a better choice for me than a credit union.  

Should I look for a bank that has both a good checkings/credit combination, or is there no reason to worry about keeping those two things under one umbrella?  My town has about 10 locations, half local and half national, larger banks.  Is there any trend I should be aware of between local and national banks?

I have the luxury of opening these 3 accounts now, so I'd like to get it right and avoid coming across reasons that drive me to switch down the road.

In 2017, our AGI was 197k and with $34,600 as our total federal tax liability.  We had withheld $25,800 (both filing single, 0 exemptions), but also made estimated payments of $6000 so we owed around $2800.  Still, for some reason, Turbotax determined that we should make $3100 in quarterly estimated tax payments \- total of $12400, which didn't make sense to me.  Thats $3600 more than we owed from 2017.

Now on to 2018 and I expect our AGI to grow to about 217k due to raises we've received and me working a little overtime.  In April, I decided to make a $2100 1st quarter estimated payment (instead of $3100 as turbotax wanted).  But I am also in the process of purchasing an electric vehicle \- which comes with a *$7500 federal tax credit*.

personalfinance,"I am considering a private loan for a programming bootcamp (General Assembly - Data Science Immersive), and I'd like some advice to make sure I have planned appropriately.","I was recently accepted to General Assembly's Data Science Immersive. I am really excited about this opportunity, but I'm a bit scared about financing this endeavor. Losing my job was the impetus for improving myself and applying to this program, but it also means that I have limited options to pay for this course. I applied for a loan through GA's financing partner, Climb. Initially, I thought my dad would be able to be my co-borrower for this loan, but after discussing it with him, he vehemently disagreed and refused to be my co-borrower. He was concerned that my previous student loans would be too much of a burden for me to carry when the repayment period for the Climb loan switches from interest only payments to full repayment. 

His suggestion was to sell some things around the house. The program starts in a couple months, and I'm just not sure this is a feasible alternative. We did create an inventory of about 60 items that could be sold, and according to his estimated value these items do add up to the cost of tuition. However, he does have a tendency to overestimate these things sometimes, and I've begun looking at comps to evaluate his assumptions. While I do agree with him to a certain degree, I've done a fair bit of research, I'm fairly certain I would be able to repay this loan quickly. Also, this loan has no prepayment penalty, so I could accept the loan and sell some of my dad's things to offset the total amount of the loan.

Here's what I've come up with so far:

**Current Student Debt** 

Loan Type  | Amount | Interest Rate | Minimum Payment (Standard)
-------------|----------|----------------|---------------------
Direct Subsidized 1-01 |$896.92|3.400%|$8.83 
Direct Subsidized 1-04 |$3,650.43|4.660%| $38.14 
Direct Unsubsidized 1-02|$6,163.57|6.800%| $70.94
Direct Unsubsidized 1-03|$7,441.73|3.860%| $74.86 
Direct Unsubsidized 1-05|$4,340.85|4.660%| $45.33 
Direct Unsubsidized 1-06|$4,040.86|4.290%| $41.48 
Wells Fargo Student Loan|$1,796.31|7.990%| $50.18 
**Totals**|**$28,330.67**|**5.094%**|**$329.76** *
\* The minimum payments listed for the Direct Loans are calculated using the standard 10 year repayment plan. I am currently in Income Based Deferment under the Income Based Repayment plan, and I am not required to make payments on the Direct Loans at this time. 

Tuition Cost: **$15950**

Climb Loan Amount: **$16,700** (I've already payed $250, and I requested some money for living expenses)

Total Amount After Origination Fee: **$17,535.00**

Climb Interest Rate: **9.39%**

APR: **12%**

Using this [site](https://blog.climbcredit.com/student-loans/how-to-calculate-monthly-loan-payments) I was able to calculate the following payments:

* Interest Only Payments (first six months): **$137.15** 
* Full Monthly Payments: **$560.76**

I know General Assembly has a placement rate of 94.1% within six months, and I think three month placement rate is closer to 88%. The average salary for a Data Scientist in my area is $115,000 - $125,000 but that almost seems unreal, and I don't expect to land one of those six figure positions for many years. I looked at a whole assortment of positions in this field such as ""Junior Data Analyst"", ""Junior Business Analyst"", ""Entry Level Business Intelligence"", and ""Junior Database Administrator"". The salary range for most of these positions appears to be $40,000 - $75,000 and the absolute lowest reported salary I saw was $37,000. Using this information, I tried to come up with a potential budget for the lowest observed salary.


Salary |  $37,000.00
--------|--------------
Cost of Benefits | $3,000.00
Net Income after Taxes and Benefits |$31,190.5
Income per Month | $2,599.21
Income after Rent ($800) | $1799.21
Income after Bills and Groceries ($600)| $1199.21
Income after Student Loans ($329.76)|$869.45
Income after Climb Payment ($560.76)|$308.69

Since this salary is on the edge of a tax bracket I developed an additional scenario in case I were to land a job with a salary in the next tax bracket.

Salary |  $40,000.00
--------|--------------
Cost of Benefits | $3,000.00
Net Income after Taxes and Benefits | $33,830.00
Income per Month | $2,819.17
Income after Rent ($800) | $2019.17
Income after Bills and Groceries ($600)|$1419.17
Income after Student Loans ($329.76)|$1089.41
Income after Climb Payment ($560.76)|$528.65

So, to me it seems that if I were to accept this loan from Climb, I would still be able to make those payments if I land a job even remotely close to the estimated salaries for these positions. I would certainly be cutting it close for a while, but it seems doable. That being said, I would like to get some feedback on whether I've been too conservative or too greedy in certain areas, if my dad's concerns are valid, or if this loan would be a wise investment in my future. Thanks in advance for any input.

While paying off all consumer and private education loans (roughly $75k) over the last eight years, I decided not to tackle a federal student loan. The interest rate was low, 2.85&amp;#37;, and the payment is $280/mo with a remaining balance of $26k. 

Instead of paying it, I skipped to fully funding an emergency account that currently has three months of my wife and I's take home pay (after all paycheck deductions).

So I moved to Step 4 and have funded both our retirement accounts. We are contributing 10&amp;#37; of our pretax income into Roth 401ks. 

Additional info:

Home Loan: Two liens. Second lien is a 15yr with 13.5 years remaining at a 5.75&amp;#37; interest rate. I used two liens to avoid Jumbo rules.

Vehicles: One car that is paid in full. Will likely need to purchase a second car by the end of the year.

Family: Second child on the way \- hence needing the second vehicle.

Liquidity: \~$45k including emergency fund.

I've come to a decision point where I'd like some advice on what to do with the $45k.

A: Use cash to pay down the federal student loan or keep it due to low interest rate (interest is $800 annually)

B: Use cash to initially fund a college savings 529.

C: Use cash to start paying down the second lien and start saving lots in interest over the term.

D: Use cash to buy second vehicle at the end of the year.

E: Any scenario I may have missed.

personalfinance,"20 YO College Student with large lump sum, no debt, looking for opinions","Hello r/personalfinance, first post here.

I'm a college student in the US. I've accumulated a sizeable amount of money in my savings account while working part\-time throughout my education (like since early high school). I was wondering what are some opinions on my situation and my presented options.

So first, some background about me and my finances, feel free to ask more questions.

1.) I have 13K in a savings account a local CU that's been sitting there for awhile. Interest rate is low. This is the subject of this post.

2.) I have a sizeable Roth\-IRA account, maxing out yearly $5,500 contribution for the past few years.

3.) I have 2K set aside to use in emergencies. Set it aside when I opened my first CC and I haven't touched it.

4.) I have 1K I've been playing around with in investments

5.) No debt whatsoever, parents will cover tuition

6.) Car is fully paid for

7.) No upcoming costs that need to be accounted for

8.) Not really a spender either

So with that 13K leftover, I've been wondering what I should do with it. I don't need it for another 2 years or so until I finish college and like I said there's no costs that are going to come my way that I wouldn't be able to take care of. From this 13K I want to subtract $5,500 for my IRA so basically 8K is useable for anything.

So here are my personal ideas:

1.) Open a high\-interest savings account and relocate 13K

2.) Invest in CDs. I have really been considering this option. I would ladder them so every quarter or so I would open a new CD since interest rates are due to rise.

3.) I could open another form of investment or add another amount to my current 1K I've been messing with.

4.) Continue as before and just save up in the savings at the credit union.

I appreciate any and all ideas and feedback. Like I said ask me more questions. Just looking for some good ideas from the ever so knowledgeable r/personalfinance.

TL;DR College student has 13K sitting around, no debt, no big costs, looking for opinions.",finance
personalfinance,Mortgage interest or student debt interest - Which to leverage first for tax deduction purposes?,"Title says it all really. I'm looking to get the most out of tax deductions.

Or should I put everything into the mortgage (note that this would also help me get to 20% faster and get rid of PMI).

My understanding is that the student loan interest deduction is a better deduction since it is an above the line adjustment. So correct me if I'm wrong, but pay off $2500 of student debt interest and then the rest towards the mortgage, right?

(The interest rates are effectively the same, so you can ignore that variable. Mortgage is 5.50%, largest student loan is 5.59%. Both are too large to pay off in a single year).",finance

OPTION 2:

I can put $1500 a month (14 mos) towards the loan per month, and have $1500 going to savings. Around $700 total in interest (over loan's lifetime).

I'm flexible to pay anywhere between $700 (minimum) to $3000 per month towards the loan. However, I'm lost on whether I should save some money slowly, and save hundreds in interest. I know that cash on hand is very important, but if I get rid of the loan first, can't i save a lot of that money more quickly after 7 months of paying it? Or is that dangerous to be without any money for so long \- I DO have the support of my family, fortunately \- I will not be homeless if something happens.

I may however, miss opportunities such as investing \- given that a golden ticket is placed in front of me.

**It appears that Navy Federal is currently only performing a soft pull on your credit when you join and open an account.** Applying for CCs or loans etc. would of course require a hard pull, though.

If you are interested in joining, I would call and ask them just to confirm. Hold time was less than a minute.",finance

personalfinance,Federal vs. Credit Union for Student Loans?,"Hey! I'm planning to start my MBA part-time in the fall and will need to take out a loan to cover some of that cost. I was very lucky in that I didn't have to take out loans for undergrad, but that means this process is totally new!


COSTS:
I'm estimating that my total program cost will be about 60k.
Through work benefits, my employer should cover about 20k. 
I'm estimating that I should be able to contribute at least $10k out of pocket throughout the program (based upon my current budget—though a pay raise might come my way and I don't expect my living expenses to change much.) Right now I'm contributing enough to get my employer's 401k match and have a safety net for a few months' worth of income if things hit the fan!
So, I'm expecting to have to borrow about 30k to get through the program.
Further, I expect to be able to pay about $5k/year after graduation to more aggressively pay down those loans (another employer benefit/incentive to stay at the company).


I completed the FAFSA and my EFC was $15k.
They also said I qualified for a Direct Stafford Loan estimated at $20k, which has a current interest rate of 6%.
I'm a little thrown off because my credit union offers student loans starting at 4.75%—I know they might quote me at a slightly higher rate, but my credit score is 730+ and I have no marks against me.


So, questions:
What are the pros/cons of using the federal loan program? 
Is the federal loan worth the 6% interest rate if I can get 5% somewhere else?
What things (fees, etc) should I look out for if I apply for a loan from the credit union?

personalfinance,Traditional vs. Roth (TSP),"**Note I know the difference between the two, my question is more related to the nuances of federal retirement and the matching contributions**

**Background:** I'm a 28 year old federal employee who has been contributing 5% to TSP traditional. I am currently GS-9 Step 10 ($73K) which a clear path to up to GS-13 within next few years (~100K). For some that don't know, TSP is effectively the government's retirement plan with both Traditional and IRA contribution options. The government has a 5% matching policy and will put the matching contributions into the Traditional account. Federal retirement effectively has three parts: (1) Social Security; (2) Retirement Contributions (TSP withdrawals); (3) Annuity (1.1% of the average of three highest salary times the years of service). As far as I know these are taxable and I personally cannot see the combined income of the three being higher than my three highest salaries, hence why I think Roth TSP is more beneficial.

**My Question:** Is it a fair assumption to say that the Roth TSP is better for me? Some people have been saying that the advice to go with Roth TSP is really for people at lower income levels/tax brackets (under what I make) and that with my career trajectory and current salary, it makes more sense to stick to Traditional.",finance

personalfinance,Etiquette around submitting two weeks notice while boss is out of the office?,"Brief background: I've been at my current company for about two years. I like and respect the people I work with a tremendous amount, but the pay and potential for growth are not in line with what I'm looking for. Over the past few months, our team has been impacted by some lay\-offs and reorganizations to the point where we would definitely be considered under\-staffed (10 people designing, engineering, and administering tech infrastructure for a large global fortune 200 corporation). The only reason I bring up the aforementioned is out of a feeling of guilt for the unfortunate position I know I'll leave my colleagues in when I depart.

I was recently offered a position at another company in the same city that comes along with significantly more responsibility and money. I plan to take the offer (regardless of counter\-offers) and I want to submit my two weeks notice on Friday in order to start on July 2nd. Problem is, my boss is out of the office this week and will not return until Monday.

So what I'm wondering is: would it be more professional and appropriate to wait until his return on Monday to give notice (with my last day still being the same, Friday June 29th, so just under two weeks notice) or would it be better to give notice on Friday to his boss, whom I also have a relationship with? For context: my boss is at the director level and his boss is at the AVP level, the AVP in question oversees my group and two other groups within infrastructure. I don't know if it would be considered unprofessional to ""go over his head"" and speak to her directly about this on Friday, or if it would be proper to wait until he returns Monday and give a notice that is just shy of two weeks.

I'm likely analyzing this too deeply and it doesn't really matter either way, but again the guilt I'm feeling in leaving my colleagues during a tumultuous period has me overthinking this. This is also my first time leaving a job as this is the company I've been with since graduating college, so there is some anxiety involved regardless of other factors.

Any advice is much appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,French bank is charging me insane comission amounts without explaining me the terms - how to reclaim?,"Hello!

Last year I was an exchange student in France and went very much overdraft (\-500 euros) for about a month. I was regularly going to my bank brunch explaining that I will be positive when my deposit for my flat comes back and the stuff member kindly told me that's fine and there is not going to be interest rate since I have a student account.

Also they charged me 80 euros for four letters they sent me and some other fees that I still did not understand because of the language barrier. Overall they charged me 260 euros.

personalfinance,(CAN) Should I go for a fixed or variable rate mortgage given the recent interest rate trend?,"I am looking to purchase a house in the near future. I have been pre-approved for a $400,000 mortgage. I have shopped around for rates quite a bit and the best ones on a 5 year term are 2.45% (variable; prime minus 1) or 3.34% (fixed).

Canadian prime rates have been pretty consistent over the last decade but have risen recently and are expected to be on an upward trend. 

More info here: https://www.ratehub.ca/prime-rate

I have considered pros and cons for both options. The fixed rate gives us peace of mind and a stable regular payment every month. The variable rate saves us interest and would need to rise up to 4.34% to be equal to the fixed rate being offered right now.

personalfinance,Dad asked me to temporarily buy his apartment building,"So my dad is a landlord of a 10 unit apartment building. Due to legal stuff with the previous owner, he owes 450k or something on it. He has a few options:
- Sell it outright and walk away with about 50 - 90k
- Refinance but would have to come up with 50k to pay off the rest of the debt, which he doesn’t have a way to come up with the 50k
- File for bankruptcy
- Or sell it to me for 500k, and he said I would then resell it back to him in 6-12 months for 550k, and I get the 50k profit. 

The building needs some work done but when that’s said and done the property would be worth a bit more than its current appraisal. The reason he wants to do this is allow his credit score (~650) to improve so he can later refinance again I believe at a lower rate. My interest rate is is around 730 which is why he wants to sell to me. 

Also if it matters, I’m 24, make 65k, and 25k in student loans. 

My gut is telling me not to do it.. help me internet! 

Edit: The property was appraised for 750k. He said with that I could get 75% of that as a loan to pay for it. 

Edit 2: I believe the property is about to go into foreclosure due to the legal issues with previous owner he bought it from.

I asked my realtor if we could add a time is of the essence clause, up the deposit and add a bonus to the agent who brought A buyer.  She said no to all three. I had originally stuck with this agent because my fiancé insisted on using her. He’s pretty mad that I’ve cut ties with her and that’s a new dynamic that I don’t quite understand.

 I got a final offer on my house that was really low, so low that I was only going to break even on it.  I accepted and the buyers backed out 5 days later and the reason they gave was that they couldn’t afford the payment. Because buyers in California have 17 days to back out I don’t receive any earnest money.  I’ve taken my house off the market and severed ties with my agent.

  It’s been almost three months since I’ve put my house on the market. A house similar size as mine but without an updated kitchen (it has a white porcelain counter and I have granite) was just listed 40k higher than mine and after talking to the buyer they’ve received a nearly full price offer. I’m thinking my house probably looks like something is wrong with it due to it being on the market so long.   I guess I’ll hold on to it for another year or so and try again. 

Thanks for reading this novel and for all the advice :)

Original post:

So as stated, I can’t sell my house.  The house was built in 2011. I bought it dec 2014 for 255k.  I am in the Central Valley of California.  My house is part of a planned community that was half built when I bought my house.  The houses built after I bought my house are roughly 1000 square foot larger and cost about 100k more.  The house has granite, wood floors, new carpet (2017) and has been painted with a fresh coat of paint.  It is in a gated complex with access to a pool, water park and playground.

I am getting married in 26 days and my fiancé’s house is a bit bigger and better equipped for a growing family.  We listed my house 2 months ago for 279,900. Right off the bat we got an offer for 274,000. We talked them up to 275,000 and accepted the offer. Two days later they’ve backed out, saying they were going with new construction instead. We have had 8 offers on the house and have accepted 6.  All of the buyers backed out within 24 hours. Some have given reasons for backing out such as they found out they were relocating the next day or They found out their interest rates would be 8%.

This past Saturday we accepted an all cash offer of 267 and said she could close in 12 days.  This woman had previously offered 240 and we told her no. We accepted the offer of 267 on Saturday. Sunday morning, our realtor called us and said the woman backed out because she was driving Through the neighbor hood and saw a do not dig sign placed there because of a high pressure gas line. Apparently this freaked her out and she backed out.  We lowered our asking price to 269,900, but I’m not sure that was the right thing to do since we have had no trouble getting offers at the higher price.

We are not in financial trouble and can afford to make mortgage payments on both houses, but would obviously rather only have one house. We have considered renting but due to the strict hoa rules have decided that it’s not a great option with this house.

Does anyone know what the issue is here?  Any advice?  Do we need a new realtor?

I (23F) am a graduate public health student entering my second year with a remainder of 16 credits in my program (4 classes). 

Last semester the stress of school caused me to struggle with extreme mental health issues that led to two incomplete grades. I decided to go a different route next year to avoid any complications and take one class per semester. 

I called my financial aid office today to discuss applying for aid and they informed me that I am ineligible for federal aid (direct and grad PLUS loans) because I need 6 credits. Taking 4 credits means I am considered “non-degree seeking,” which makes no sense because I am in fact seeking a degree. I have never heard of this, and I can’t seem to find anything like this on the school website or anywhere online.

I have a job lined up for the fall semester and a schedule that would make it extremely difficult to add another course, not to mention most courses do not interest me and are closed. I can not afford my education but want to avoid a private loan - the payoff for an MPH is not worth the added debt or emotional turmoil. I am currently $60k in student loan debt on a $0 IDR plan.

I’m not sure what the best course of action is, as adding a class and private loans are poor options. If anyone has been in a similar situation and can offer advice it would be much appreciated.

Or pay the estimated taxes knowing taxes will be taken from a salary soon. I know if she chooses the latter, she'll get the excess back when she does her taxes but that feels like a waste of money. What is the penalty for not paying estimated taxes on time? Her CA quarterly payment is about $1000, her federal quarterly payment is about $5500.

Hope that's clear - I can clarify if not. Any help would be much appreciated!",finance

I currently have student loan of $14,600 and credit card debt of $490. My credit card interest rate is 18%. My credit score was 280 (i think, it was the number that was in the letter from my bank).

I have been trying really hard with landing a job in IT desk support/ Help Desk, but have been unsuccessful due to bad interview skills, lack of experience, and/or lack of certifications.

I normally would be laid back and wouldnt care much about finance, but over the past year, I have been punishing myself for not being the best that I could be. I fear I am getting too old, with nowhere to go, and will not be accepted anywhere. I took so much for granted and now I feel like im stuck in a deep hole. I want to be able to support my family the way they supported me. 

I want to know how I can start a savings account, build my credit, simple skills to improve my chances with landing a job within IT. I am done being chill, and having no worries. I want to build my future, I just dont know how to start.",finance

personalfinance,About to give up on credit as it seems just about everywhere rejects my application for a loan. Building credit. 100% on time payments. Money’s tight and a loan would help me get out of debt and ahead. Advice and suggestions is all I’m asking.,"To start this off I just turned 21. I would say my heads on my shoulders pretty good but  I just moved about two months back and it was a rough move. I had to move towns and couldn’t switch jobs right away so money got tight and my car is falling apart left and right. I was late on my second months rent. I feel like everything that could go wrong went wrong and made everything twice as hard. My spouse hasn’t switched jobs quite yet either so I’m one person paying all the bills while trying to afford unseen expenses.  The reason for this post is I went online and got two small loans and didn’t realize the interest rate and that I had gotten them through a tribe that doesn’t have to follow federal rules. The first one is from American Web Loan for 1500. 12 months biweekly payments of roughly 250 for a year do the math. The other one is through sierra lending for 700. With 200 dollar payments.  The payments are gonna suck me dry. I really thought I was smarter then this and beating myself up over it. If I don’t figure something out soon I’ll end up being homeless and broke or just really stressed out for the next year. I really should have paid more attention to the details they told me and been more clear about it. Also if I would’ve looked up reviews I would have never got myself into this mess. Today’s my last effort to try and get a loan for roughly 5k to pay my loans and debts and get ahead just a bit. I’ve tried numerous online companies and been to my personal bank and been denied. Also switched banks and built history and tried again and still nothing. Before I got these loans right after I moved I was gonna post to r/borrow but even though I’ve been on reddit for awhile I didn’t have enough karma and after failed attempts to gain enough I just gave up and figured it never work out or I’d never get anywhere. On top of everything. I start my new job Monday and don’t have money for work boots or work clothes. This whole paycheck is gone to loans and utilities.

Forex,Hi guys - a piece I wrote about the Forex Market Price Movement vs FED Rate Hike Policy - happy to hear your thoughts!,,finance
Forex,The FEDS Hawkish Dovish statement,"Or was it dovishly hawkish? If you are asking yourself wtf does that even mean then you need to brush up on *fundamentals*. Anyway I wanted to post this because I had a good discussion with a knowledgeable trader on this forum about fundamentals and made the statement that it isn't about knowing something others don't or knowing before they do, it is about knowing how the known facts will affect price. This is very difficult and ambiguous and some would even say foolish. I think fundamentals are important but can understand why other traders feel differently.  

So what happened and what am I even talking about? Well, the FED raised rates as we all know **and even signaled they will be hiking again this year, according to the dots that is**. (Again, if you don't understand what dots im talking about google fed dot plot and read) That was unambiguously hawkish and the dollar shot up on the news. Now things get tricky, price reversed its initial move (as is not uncommon during high vol news) This is being attributed to headlines about tariffs.  

So both things that happened today, the FED raising and sending a hawkish signal and the news about tariffs, the market already knows. You could argue that signaling a fourth hike was somewhat a surprise but the majority opinion on 3 vs 4 was only one vote and it was well understood that the one vote could go for 4 this year instead of 3. So there are two points I want to make as advice/help/opinion about fundamental analysis. 

The first point is that if you mostly disregard fundamentals and let technicals dictate your trading nothing that happened today was unusual. Yes there was more volatility but if you look at USD price action after a strong rally the last two months it has tested and held support in AUD,EUR,NZD and started a small decline. After such strong rallies you can easily see consolidation/retracement before strong continuation, and today could just be a really noisy day in the process. 

The second thing I want to say is for those of you looking to sharpen or get another opinion on fundamental analysis. So if you were going into today with the thought of a USD rate rise being bullish for the USD, you are behind the market because the market has known this for months. The logic of a rate rise today being bullish USD has been realized by the market long ago, and as I discussed above, so was the additional rate increase. Seeing the price action today you can see that this was largely what the market gave us. Now for the fundamental analysis of what happened today (the new information the fed gave us). This is more difficult but I will attempt to portray my understanding of it here. If you look at the overall state of the financial markets, you see bond yields at respectable levels in the US, extremely over valued US stocks, and an economy about to experience the first meaningful rise in interest rates in 10 years. While I am not a stock trader or economist and in no way can predict what will happen when in those areas, **it is clear the cycle is mature and will probably be ending with these FED increases** Today on Bloomberg someone said bull markets dont die of old age, the fed takes them out behind the shed and shoots them in the back of the head. So to put this as short as I can because I am dragging on here now, **the market thinks the FED is closer to the end of the tightening cycle than the FED itself.** The bond markets think they are close to fully pricing in the tightening cycle by the FED. The FED removal of the sentence about rates staying below longer run averages for sometime can be read into as them acknowledging the reality of the situation we are in as rates have risen closer to longer run averages, it could also be read as the FED believes the longer run average of the fed funds rate is lower. This is extremely nuanced fundamental analysis **but the removal of that sentence can be seen as dovish. Thus the hawkish dovish statement.**  

I can't tell you what trades to make from this fundamental analysis, I think of it as more of a guide to interpreting the rest of my strategy, but as for price action, a liquidity event/market sell off would probably be bullish USD so it is hard for me to give up being a dollar bull until we get that, and with rates near  priced in that would probably mark a top in the dollar. Like I said fundamental are hard to interpret and nothing I said is a holy grail or makes making trades that much clearer, but we could see a very volatile/profitable market the next 6-18 months. Be careful and use your risk management. Hoped this helped,  

Good luck",finance

crypto_currency,VERASITY - Next YouTube Based on Blockchain,"Verasity describes their platform as a “next-generation video sharing platform designed to liberate creators and benefit viewers.” To do this, they have created new blockchain-based platform that aims to reward all levels of users, from viewers to content creators to advertisers, with its own token.

Verasity has created a safe and democratic space for creators to generate the content relevant to their audience, regardless of their identities. By allowing viewers the opportunity to vote with their views and their tokens.

Verasity, which offers a next-generation video sharing platform, launched the blockchain-based video player “VeraPlayer”.

With Vera Player, viewers can watch videos on a variety of mobile and desktop browsers without having to download or install separate plug-ins or software.

The patent-pending “Proof of View (PoV)” is a technology that guarantees accurate viewing frequency and viewing pattern of content through blockchain-based technology. By using this technology, it is possible to evaluate the true value of content by making it impossible to manipulate the number of hits using the bots, and to prevent unnecessary network load. In addition, Verasity’s video storage and operations use Akamai’s cloud services, providing the same viewing experience from anywhere in the world.

According to a recent report from Cisco, there are predictions that by 2021, 82 % of consumer Internet traffic will be based on video consumption. Verasity’s platform is designed to allow creators and viewers to see greater benefits in the production and consumption of the ecosystem and will create a virtuous cycle structure that will produce better quality content through the ecosystem.

Their version of an internal centralized bank controls the currency being used across the platform and draws upon tools from both fiscal policy and monetary policy to control their platform’s economy. The goal of the foundation is to stabilize it for all users.

The platform’s token is called VERA, and will be the medium of exchange and reward for video creation, sharing and viewing across the platform. Through different methods of earning VERA for each type of user — viewers, content creators, advertisers and sponsors — Verasity hopes to further entice people to use the platform and contribute to its economy.

It is easy to say that it is a YouTube based on a blockchain. But Veracity is showing a blueprint that viewers who see the ad can also make a profit by receiving the token. On the Veracity platform, creators, viewers, and advertisers can use the token Vera to conduct a variety of transactions. Vera is available for purchase or purchase in exchange for viewing or sharing videos. Creators can use Vera to generate revenue directly from viewers who view, subscribe or donate their videos, and they can make a variety of profits through their own channels, such as sharing additional revenue generated by the video. By eliminating intermediaries through smart contracts, creators can make more money and create better content. In addition, advertisers and media agencies can effectively purchase media based on accurate data without hits manipulation, enabling them to more effectively enforce advertising costs.

Between their founders and development team, Verasity already employs 17 people, many of them full-time. The team is highly experienced, with decades of collective experience in finance and software development. The company has also partnered with several prominent investment firms and technology startups to help strengthen every dimension of its business.

A total of 12,491,500,000 ERC-20 tokens will be created; 12% will be sold during the pre-sale for $0.00750 apiece, and 10% will be sold during the public sale for $0.001.

If you’re interested in learning more about how Verasity is bringing back democratic creation to online video platforms, you can check their whitepaper, website www.verasity.io and join their social media (facebook, twitter, telegram).

Ultimately, Verasity’s idea of a stable economic ecosystem aims to give the power back into the hands of the users and content creators by forging a better system for all. Their goal is to be one of the first blockchain-based platforms to offer a stable economy for its users. Based on their successful economic simulations and the support they’ve received from crypto-economic professors so far, it seems they are poised to be well on their way.

personalfinance,First financial road map and would love opinions on it (lengthy),"I finally got an I.T. job in Chicago and, for the first time ever, my future feels like more than just retail and warehouses. I just turned 25 and am doing this later than I wanted to, but I'm creating a financial road map and would highly appreciate some peer reviewing.

**1)** Create a budget

- **Income**: 27.5 hr/week @ $14/hr (6-12 months until full-time + at least one pay raise)
- rent: $200/mth
- groceries: $150/mth (rough estimate)
- public transportation: $105 per 30d (will ask work if they have commuter benefits)
- dog food: $80/mth
- Internet: $50/mth
- laundry: $12/mth
- Office 365: $10/mth
- Costco: $5/mth
- student loans: $0/mth for a year (should I at least pay the interest off per month? will this increase my credit score?)

That leaves me with ~$620 per month to save [will adjust as miscellaneous expenses pop up (e.g. beer with a friend)]

**2)** Open two new checking accounts

- I'll keep Chase and just replace my current student account (which they never charged me $6/month for like the terms said, yay). The $200 bonus is a decent amount of cash right now and I'll get to keep Quick Pay because I'm not sure how Alliant handles P2P money transfers. I'll also get to help a buddy out who works there because of commission. Win-win.

- The second checking account will be with NBKC (they seem solid) and will *only* be used for bills. I can connect it to my Chase account, set up auto-withdrawal, have it hit $0 without fees, and know that extra money couldn't be taken out due to computer/human error.

**3)** Open two new savings account

- Should I use Synchrony for both because of the 1.75% APY? The negative reviews all seem to revolve around credit cards.

- The first account will be my primary savings account until I know how best to divvy it up (used car, first, then a better place to live for my mom and I, then retirement, then investing).

- The second account will be for my new emergency fund, but I'm unsure of how much to put in here per paycheck. I'd like to have at least 3 months of ""personal insurance"" until I can afford a 6-8 month buffer. The used car needs to come first, though.

**4)** Get a credit card

- I have next to no credit, but a score of ~670. Would the Capital One QuicksilverOne Cash Rewards card be my best bet? 1.5% cash back means groceries and dog food would cover the $39/yr fee. Plus, 5 months of on-time payments mean a possible credit line extension.

**5)** Ask new employer about offered retirement plan, rolling over ones from previous places of employment (how would I check if I had them before?), and increasing allowances on federal and state W-4 forms (the guidelines made it seem like I couldn't add more than two and one allowance, respectively, but I need the fatter paychecks).

**6)** Find another part-time or weekend job for side income (computer repair maybe, but I'll check out that side income wiki link).

**7)** Get car and new housing situated, then focus on student loan principle and saving for retirement (will read more on that later).

Any thoughts on this would be extremely helpful!",finance
personalfinance,Looking to pay down debts,"Hi everyone,

I'm at a point in life where I can finally start tackling some of my major debts.  I'm looking to target my student loans first, but wanted some advice on my roadmap.  Here's a brief overview of my current situation:

Age:
Turn 29 this month

Income:
$8,800/mo gross ($5,500 net)

Expenses:
$650/mo | rent/utilities

$601.59/mo | car (39k at 3.75%)

$271.86/mo | student loans (101k at 5.75%)

$97.97/mo | phone

$80/mo | car insurance

$50/mo | gas

$1,000/mo | food/entertainment/anything else (maintenance, haircuts, unforeseen expenses, etc)

Investments:
10% into 401k with 4% match (~15k total in account)

Maxed Roth IRA for wife and I (~12k total over 2 accounts)

Stocks (~1k total)

Savings (~6k total)


Some notes:


-Salary.  I just came into this salary after hitting the reset button on my career a few years ago.  I've gone from $50k/year to where I'm at now.  It has been a grind, but I'm finally stable and putting away a good chunk of my paycheck.  I've got quite a bit of catching up to do on investing.


-Car payment is awful.  I bought a used car a few years back that was a lemon and had to roll that debt into a new car.  I've thought about selling the car and paying off the negative equity to buy a used car, but the math doesn't make sense.  I plan to just use this one as a life lesson and keep this car until it dies.  It only has 38k miles on it and I work from home, so I drive maybe 300 miles/month + do my own maintenance.


-Student loans.  I've been on IBR for a few years, which is why my payment is so low.  The payment will rise this year to ~$450 at some point and likely closer to $700 the following year with my new salary.  Currently, I am paying less than the interest accrued.  I just left a government job, so my strategy at the time was PSLF, but with my new salary, I just want to pay this off ASAP.


-Upcoming expenses.  I will be moving across the country soon for work.  My wife will be leaving her job (~50k/year) and we will temporarily be cash strapped as I will be taking over her car payments + her half of rent/utilities until she finds a new job.  The COLA is about the same, but rent is going to be a little higher as we are going from owning to renting (we want to get a feel for the new location before buying).


-Savings.  I know this seems low (~2 months worth), but I work in a field where there is a massive shortage and will be for some time.  I do not foresee ever being laid off or having difficulty finding a job in the near future.  I also have the 11k in Roth funds as a backup if something major was to happen and savings were depleted.


Strategy:


I've gone back and forth on snowballing vs paying down the student loans.  Part of me likes being able to just pay off my car quickly and apply the extra $600/mo to student loans.  At the same time, I know the best idea is to pay off the higher interest rate first.  So, I think the best plan is to dump as much money as I can into my student loans, but am open to ideas.


My other idea is to scale back my 401k contribution.  I'm putting in 10%, but only need to contribute 5% to receive the full match.  I can use the extra money to pay down debts as well.  I'm unsure if I would make &gt;5.75% on that extra 5%, so it doesn't seem like a terrible idea to scale back.  Of course, my plan is still to max both Roths again next year.


Conclusion:


Cut back on 401k to meet employer match and dump as much money into student loans as possible.

We thought it stemmed from a seizure she had as a baby, but her most recent neurologist suspects it's genetic and she may have a mild form of Down's Syndrome. The testing for that is pricey and the neurologist didn't recommend even having it done, so that diagnosis isn't ""official"". He did do the IQ testing and she falls between a 69\-71. The only work she has been able to perform successfully is housekeeping and she has worked full\-time as a janitor since she was 16. She still lives with my mom and will eventually live with me. She doesn’t earn very much ($12 p/h) and she would never have the mental capacity to live on her own.   
In the past few years, the work has been very difficult for her physically. She works in a hospital that is understaffed and they run her ragged. She has some motor skill issues and over time developed severe plantar fasciitis in both feet that require surgery. After the surgery in her first leg, she had a stroke during her recovery. We thought it might be a clot, but it turns out she has a rare, progressive brain disorder called Moyamoya. She didn't have a lot of stroke side effects like paralysis, fortunately. She just has some pulsatile tinnitus and a lot of fatigue and forgetfulness. The doctors are monitoring her and have her on blood thinners and cholesterol meds as preventatives for future strokes, but she will probably eventually need specialized surgery.  
My sister has returned to work this week, but has found it very stressful. With her fatigue caused by lower blood flow to her brain, I am afraid she is setting herself up for a worse stroke since her disease is progressive. Her doctor thinks she should apply for SSDI, but we went to the SSA office and they say that since she is still working, they don't even want to hear about it. My sister still needs one more surgery on her other leg, a follow\-up MRA on her brain and she has met her insurance deductible for the year, so we were hoping to get these procedures done while she still had health insurance. A family friend said that the SSA will only consider medical information from AFTER she has quit working, so by her trying to suck it up and do the best she can to keep her insurance for a while longer actually setting her up for failure?  
I am sorry if I am rambling. This whole system is SO confusing. We even consulted a law firm but they want her to be denied for SSDI before they'll take her case. Ah!   


Should my sister just go ahead and quit and apply for SSDI or try to hang on to her health insurance even if she is struggling since she needs more treatments and ongoing medications that would be very expensive out of pocket? The SSA said she can only get Medicaid AFTER she is approved for SSDI.

China’s economy fell short of expectations and its central bank chose not to follow the Federal Reserve in raising borrowing costs, adding fresh caution on the outlook for global growth as trade tensions with the U.S. escalate.

With President Donald Trump renewing threats to impose tariffs on the world’s second\-largest economy, May data for industrial output, retail sales and investment all came in beneath economist forecasts on Thursday. The People’s Bank of China kept the cost of reverse\-repurchase agreements steady, defying predictions it would track the Fed’s hike of Wednesday.

Investors now face greater uncertainty over what had been the strongest global upswing since 2011. That doubt is set to fester after Trump said on Wednesday that he’ll confront China ""very strongly"" over commerce in coming weeks. His administration is scheduled to announce a new list of duties on Friday.

""A slowing China will add to the challenges for the global economy,"" said Louis Kuijs, chief Asia economist at Oxford Economics in Hong Kong and a former International Monetary Fund researcher. ""Until recently, the resilience of growth in China was an important buffer for the global economy in the face of headwinds from trade friction, slower growth in Europe, higher oil prices and issues in various emerging markets.""

Both industrial output and retail sales rose less than expected in May compared to a year ago. Fixed\-asset investment growth in the first five months was the slowest since the data began in 1999, as was the investment in the services sector. The decade\-long decline in investment has intensified this year, as policy\-makers act to reduce leverage at state\-owned companies and local governments. While that’s a deliberate policy, officials risk a worse\-than\-desired deceleration in growth.

### Tit-For-Tat

China’s weaker performance comes amid a slew of mixed signals for the global economy. While the IMF sees robust global expansion of 3.9 percent this year and next, Managing Director Christine Lagarde last week warned that clouds on the horizon are getting [darker](https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2018-06-11/lagarde-says-clouds-over-global-economy-are-darker-by-the-day) by the day. Topping the worry list are ongoing fears of protracted trade disputes between the U.S. and China, the European Union, Canada and Mexico.

China has promised to retaliate if the U.S. pushes ahead with plans to levy tariffs on $50 billion in imports, threatening an escalating, tit\-for\-tat trade war. At the same time, rising interest rates have jolted emerging markets, while fears of an Italian debt crisis have returned, along with worries over higher oil prices. A gauge of world trade devised by Oxford Economics Ltd. fell in May to its lowest level since early 2017.

China, which is the world’s second\-largest economy, is already slowing after a stronger\-than expected start to 2018, even before any new U.S. tariffs on its exports.

Economists surveyed by Bloomberg see a 6.5 percent expansion this year after 6.9 percent in 2017, in line with the government’s own target. A gauge of early indicators developed by Bloomberg Economics in May showed some sectors of the economy slowing while others, buoyed by global trade, held up.",finance

personalfinance,Buying a Home with Prospect of Long Term Cash Incentive,"I've been working at my current job for 3 years and currently gross $92k annually. I've been in the market for a home in a hot market for about a year but have never stashed away enough cash to put down a down payment I am comfortable with. Last month my employer offered me, in writing, a Long Term cash incentive of $40k cash over 2 years effectively raising my cash compensation to $112k before taxes, the incentive is contingent upon not leaving the company or not getting fired due to malicious circumstances (Stealing from company, giving out company secrets, etc) . If I am to get laid off the cash incentive would be paid in full along with my severance additionally, half of the incentive is to paid in cash 11 months from now.

The range in my area for a single family home is $330\-$400k. I have excellent credit and no debt and have previously been pre\-approved by mortgage lenders at great interest rates, I also plan to put 10&amp;#37; down on a home.

Would considering a home purchase be foolish with my current compensation and financial standing? My main worry is that mortgage payments would eat just under half my monthly income when including PMI, taxes, and home insurance **prior** to getting the cash incentive next year. I am also gambling on the fact that after the long term incentive is fully paid my base salary and savings would have increased to a range that can easily afford home payments.

personalfinance,Car Refi now or later?,"So I declared bankruptcy last year and got a car loan in January for a used car at 16% which was to be expected.  My credit score at the time was 580. It is now 670 so I thought it would be a good time to refinance. I'm getting some real shit offers though at like 15.49% and such nonsense. One even offered a higher interest rate at 17%. I think this is because i accidentally used some of those ""auto loan brokers"" rather than applying with an actual lender. Anyway my best offer so far was 13.9% but I still think this is too high. I had a car loan 10 years ago with a 680 score and my interest rate was 8%. 

Should I take whatever offer I can get right now? Does that hurt my chances of refinancing AGAIN in another few months as my score continues to improve? Or should I just hold off on everything and give it another few months and restart the process so I dont have a string of closed lender accounts on my history?
.


.

.


**UPDATE**: Ok I think I found out the real culprit here; my credit score is actually around 550 and not 670. The 670 score came from 2 places - my subprime auto lender actually provides it for free as a tool for people trying to rebuild credit, and one of the refi offers I got stated it as such claiming it came from Equifax. Then I noticed a little subtext that said ""Calculated via Vantage Score 3.0"" which I believe is one of those phony credit score guesstimates and not ""the real thing"" the way it would be if you went straight to equifax or myfico and paid for the score outright. 

I decided to start applying for loans directly from banks and BofA came back with a decline stating my score was 555 which makes much more sense given a bankruptcy less than 12 months old. So I'm just going to hold off on any refi attempts until next year. I went ahead and got approved for an unsecured credit card with a $500 limit and 24% APR just to begin rebuilding and will pay it off after every purchase treating it like my debit card. 

While my goal isnt to get in debt again I think most of you would agree that having good credit is an advantage in a number of areas and something you should just have available. Plus it's a great way to secure your cash in the event your credit card gets stolen, since you can more easily dispute charges than you can with a debit card where the money is 100% gone.",finance
personalfinance,Optimizing Student Loan payments,"I have just noticed that between Jan and Feb, my monthly student loan payment of $250 (overpaying) the amount going to interest has always been about $50, and it suddenly dropped to about $15, which seems like a good thing for me (?)

My loan is in two groups, A and B, with the same interest rate but different balances. 

I asked support why the change to the payment breakdown occurred:

""Starting in February our payment allocation policy has changed. Now anytime an extra payment is received the payment is automatically applied to the unsubsidized loan with the highest interest rate. Since your account is paid ahead the payments started going just to Group B, so less of the payment was going to interest because the payments are only on Group B rather than both groups. 10:18 AM""

I asked dont they have the same interest:

""Yes the have the same interest rates, but the payment is going to the unsubsidized loan rather than the subsidized loan. The reasoning behind that is if you were to go into a deferment in the future less interest would accrue during the deferment because interest only accrues on the unsubsidized loan during any deferment. 10:21 AM""

I dont totally follow this - my questions for the group are: 
Is there something I could have done in advance to set this up to my advantage?

All payments are going to group B now, Group A hasnt had any money put into it since January, it said the accrued interest is $120, is that building up something to be worried about?

thanks for any advice!

Edit: so to summarize the answer in case anyone ends up here: It doesnt make a difference in the long run. I am paying more principal on one portion of the loan, while interest builds on on the other portion of the loan.",finance

personalfinance,To refi or not to refi?,"Our house value shot up recently. We originally financed a 7 year ARM with 10% down last year and got the house of our dreams. We've been paying extra toward the principle. Everything seems on track. 

We wanna stay there a long time. We are unhappy with the threat of variable interest making the mortgage too high in 7 years' time. Our lender called and mentioned a refi option to a 30 year fixed since we now own 20% of the value. However, the interest rates are higher. The end payment is no better ($70 more in fact) and the costs to close seem awfully high.

Is it okay to keep paying extra toward principle in the hope that at the time the fixed interest period ends we can refinance to a fixed rate with a much lower principle and hence payment? My hope is that regulations and the economy will keep rates in check.",finance

personalfinance,1-month Libor vs Prime,"So with the recent increase in the federal rate it looks like the prime rate will be at 5% with the future likely leading to two more increases this year.

My other student loan is currently sitting at 10.625% and I'm unsure how much this one will go up due to it being based on the 1-month libor rate.

So my question: Is one rate more safe than the other at the moment? My goal was to put the money I'm earning at work towards the bigger loan but I was unsure if the prime will overtake it or not. I know it's close to impossible to guess but I was hoping for some feedback. Should I continue to put my money towards the higher libor rate or towards the lower prime rate in the chance it might overtake it? Thank you for the help!

personalfinance,Extra cash at end of month. Pay off mortgage principal or pay more into retirement as long-term strategy?,"First time posting to this sub. About me... 36 yo, stable job. I recently bought a home and monthly mortgage payments on a 30-year fixed (including taxes/insurance) are $1,400 per month. My interest rate is 4.49%. I work for a smaller digital marketing agency who contributes to a 401k each year depending on how well the company does (averages out to about 2 or 3% of my salary every year). Prior to starting with current company, I rolled my old 401k into a Traditional IRA and at the same time opened up a Roth with the same firm.  I am currently maxing out the Roth each year, but that is all I am contributing to myself at this point. 

My question is ultimately two-part. First, I have a few hundred extra each month after all bills are paid, etc. Does it make sense to use that to pay more toward principal of my mortgage or would I be better off adding more to one of my retirement accounts?  I should also note that our plan is to sell our house in about 15 years after our kids are out, so we won't accrue the entirety of the mortgage's interest.  The second question I have is, are there any advantages to distributing some/all of my monthly retirement contributions to either the Traditional IRA or 401k?

personalfinance,Buying a house with less than 20% down payment in a hot housing market?,"I have had several people tell me that in my area, it’s better to buy a house sooner rather than later.

Mortgage rates around 4-4.5%. I am only interested in smallish homes (less than 1700 sq ft) and smallish lots (1/4 acre). This puts me in a buying category unlike others in my age bracket (late 20s) who are buying bigger homes for kids. I will not have kids so in terms of home buying am more like someone who is downsizing. Budget is $200k max.

All of that is to say that i am aggressively paying off student loan debt scheduled to be paid off early next year. I had planned to save up a 20% down payment to avoid PMI and provide reassurance in case unexpected costs come up. That would take about a year to accomplish. Several people have mentioned that waiting more than a year to buy may cancel out any savings on PMI as housing prices and interest rates increase. I could buy as soon as next fall (or ASAP if i used 2/3 of my emergency fund—NOT likely) with a 5% down payment on a $200k loan / $10k cash.

financialindependence,Ducks in a row... now what?,"Hi Y'all,

**Summary:**

* 30/31 years old, married, both professionals, no kids (yet).
* Maxing out two 401k's and Roth IRA's and 1 HSA.
* Making 2x required payment on the house. (6 1/2 years to paid off)
* Got a 6 month emergency fund. (1.75&amp;#37; rate)

So now I'm finding myself every other month or so with more money than I really know what to do with in the checking account. And at the same time, every day I hate my job a little more than the one before. :P The current goals (having kids in the next couple years) / expected ROI have me on track for FIRE at 40. (It still amazes me how some people get there by low 30's). The FIRE dream for me would be something like[ this couple did.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfmDZqPK6Wg) (Still gotta sell the wife on it :P). At least until the inevitable taking care of parents and mother-in-law come in to play down the road.

But until the family starting part, I'm trying to figure out what to do with the extra cash. Our 401ks are entirely in the S&amp;P 500. Our IRA's and one extra account are in P2P lending. Any more in P2P outside the IRA's turns into tax rip offs. The mortgage is at a whopping 3.5&amp;#37;. I tried the house flipping / landlord thing, that isn't for me. And doubling up our emergency fund would only kick this can down the road a few more months. Solar panels for the house, a few more. But then what? (Plus I'm not entirely sure I want to do either of those.)

So I'm left feeling like I need another investment direction (diversification) for the extra income. The only one I'm aware of that I'm not particularly exposed to is REIT's, but everything I read about the Fed's interest rate hikes is that those can only go down with the hikes this year and next.

Edit: I do already have some extra investments in S&amp;P 500 / Nasdaq 100 via Robinhood. But I've found that I'm really wanting to put that somewhere else for diversification.

So what are you all doing when you get here?

What other investment opportunities am I missing?

Should I say screw it and throw the extra money at the mortgage?

Should I just be happy to pile it into the emergency fund and wait for the next big investment opportunity (stock market crash)?

There's some ambiguity about how much I'll receive, but we'll call it $80k.  I am self employed as a bookkeeper.  Ideally, I would like equity or some form of passive income to be generated. Here are my thoughts on how I can spend the money, any advice would be appreciated:

1. Buy a new place - in the area I need to live in (due to my kids) it would cover a down payment on a condo, which would leave me with a mortgage payment very close to my current rent.  However, it would be a two bedroom place and eventually I need a 3 bedroom place so my kids can have their own room.
2. I have a friend who will match my down payment for an income property.  Best case would be a multi unit property where I would be able to live and manage the property for a discount on rent.  We could also buy an independent property and I could continue renting.
3. I could pay down $40k in student loans (currently costing me $350 a month).  The interest rate is about 4&amp;#37;.  I would then save the remainder or find another way to invest.  Currently on a monthly basis I'm break even on my cash flow, with no money going into my retirement.

A few notes: The reason our car payment is so high is because we are trying to pay it off so we can start saving for a down payment on a house. We also have a 1 month emergency fund. Our savings strategy and retirement are being funded as well. I'm mainly looking for some tweaks and to see what we can improve on (probably food/entertainment?). 

Also, please don't get upset that we are tithing. We are believers and won't alter that stance :)

personalfinance,What will my taxes be for 2018 in PA? Very easy,"Ok. Simple. I'm in my twenties, file single, contribute to a trad. 401(k), rent, and don't have any non-retirement investments outside a decently sized savings account (good for emergencies etc). I don't pay for my own healthcare (that's my parents' volunteering). I'm not asking for tax advice, or personal finance advice - I'm pretty good at the latter. I just am not good at figuring out taxes.

Salary: $41100.00 this year
Company Bonus: $2284.53 this year
Get about $500 in ""taxable"" company-based biometrics benefits for not being unhealthy
Roth IRA contribution is irrelevant ($3000/year)
401(k) is traditional and I put in about $3500/year rn (I know it would be a good idea for Roth 401(k) = I get it)
No debt, no kids, nothing special - again very very simple.

All in all, I think I'll have pretax around $46,000.00 (sometimes I get some overtime) coming my way by the end of the year, and will expect approx. ~$7500 will be taken out for federal, FICA, all that stuff, and the standard 3.07% for state income tax (easy in PA as it's a flat tax) ~$1400 in state income taxes.

A.) What should I expect to pay to the federal government (federal income tax, FICA, everything) at tax time next year? I'm trying to figure this out but I've found some differing opinions from different websites:

https://www.ameripriseadvisors.com/assets/calculators/Tax1040.html (#1)

https://smartasset.com/taxes/income-taxes (#2)

The biggest difference between the two seems to be that the 1040 tax calculator (#1) seems to ignore FICA, and SmartAsset (#2) makes me feel much more heavily taxed given how large the liability they think I owe the government compared to (#1).

I also hate the fact that huge refunds means the government is getting interest free loans of MY money. 

B.) Also, are company bonuses ""just like any other dollar on a W-2"" but ""have to get withheld at a higher rate bc the IRS doesn't want you to have all that ca$hola just yet."" They withhold about 32% on the bonus.

Much appreciated, thank you!

personalfinance,"Wanting to move to a mobile/manufactured home, what are your opinions on my financing options?","The situation: We are purchasing a single-wide trailer in a mobile home park for ~30k, putting 10% down. This particular mobile home park is right next to a university and all the trailers are very well-maintained, despite the vast majority being built in the 1970's. Our trailer is one of those (1974), and everyone we talked to in this community said they had essentially no depreciation in value - some even make money because demand is so high in the area. The lot rent is $300/month, and we can afford to pay another $400/month on top of that with a trailer. This is still cheaper combined than what my wife and I are currently paying for an apartment with no resale value. I should mention we are both currently some form of student, so we can't afford to actually invest in a home right now. 

My question is about the loan component. We are not able to get any traditional mortgage because we don't own the land underneath the home. Our annual income is ~40k and we maintain a good emergency fund and have good credit, and a small car loan (~6k left on it). I looked into a 21stmortgage.com at the recommendation of my bank, and the interest rate was 12%, which seems high. 

I did some calculations, and it won't be hard to keep the payment under the $400/month I mentioned (even at 12%), but we'd really like to get a better rate (~5%). Does anyone have any experience with this, or any advice what to look into? Right now, I feel like asking one of our parents for help with a home equity loan will be the best option. 

Edit: thank you everyone for the feedback, but I would like to remind everyone the question is about loans, not the viability of living in a trailer park.",finance

personalfinance,Our Federal &amp; State Returns was used to offset a student loan in my husbands name and he claims he didn't make. Is this a possible identity theft or is husband lying?,"Hello, Reddit,

I hope you can enlighten me here. Husband (66) and I are married for 8 years now. We just moved back from overseas and have been here in the US for two years. I'm working full-time now for two years while he stays at home taking care of our children. Last year I filed taxes separately and got our return (about 3K+) without delay because I filed as the head of household.

This year however, I filed as married filing jointly and got delayed because husband allegedly has a debt to IRS. It turns out after further investigation that the company he used to file his taxes in 2012 while we were abroad didn’t file his taxes. He claims he does not owe anything to IRS as it was a foreign income and not a US related company. So he contacted the office that made that mistake and they said they’ll fix it and we paid them 200$.

After two months of waiting I check my tax return (7k+) online again and I was so happy that it has been approved and it was scheduled to be deposited to my bank on June 13. I am so excited because I wanted to pay my cc cards, car loan and student loan. However, that money wasn’t deposited yesterday, so I checked online again today and it says, it was applied to a past due obligation.

I called the Bureau of the Fiscal Services and they don’t have the details but said to contact the department of education and gave me the contact number. So I called today to investigate. The rep said my husband has a 41K student loan and that’s why our tax return was intercepted. I was shocked, I told her it it must be a mistake because my husband never mentioned it to me and he said he was working while in college. The rep said, he must be aware of it because he’s been paying it since 1989! I asked my husband about it and he said no that’s not true. I gave him the phone and he asked the rep which school the loan was made and the rep said the name of the two schools where I know for sure my husband went to.

He did say he had a grant while in college but that is totally different from a student loan. My husband has no credit history and no mortgage as we’re just renting right now. All credit cards are in my name including our car loan. He kept postponing applying for Social Security saying if he applies for it, we might not qualify for a cheaper housing opportunity in case we move. I asked if he has a 401K but he said no because he was working abroad. Both of us were never been married before and no children other than the two we have now. So I don’t think he’s been paying for child support. The thing that bothers me is that he doesn’t seemed to be bothered by this while I am the one who is so stressed out trying to make both ends meet to feed the family of 4 with my meager 40K annual salary.

I am so disappointed since I was looking forward to pay off credit card debt but instead kept being delayed. What’s the chances that his identity have been stolen? If so what’s the best thing we should do first? Is he lying to me to save face? I told him if it is indeed his student loan then we’ll just have to pay for it but he said no. What else should I do or ask him about?",finance

One of the salespeople I spoke with over the phone asked how I intended to pay and I said cash, to which he replied, in a car salesy way:

""Let me put it to you this way... informed car buyers always finance because it's a better deal.  The prices advertised on our website are based on buyers who get financing, if you pay in cash the price is $500 - $1500 higher.  What informed buyers do is take the financing and pay one month, then pay the rest of the balance off after that.  You pay less in the end!

Now, let me put it to you this way... if you want a REAL deal you'll stop by our showroom TODAY... etc.""

I've heard the pros and cons of both buying in cash and financing, and am not here to get into the hypothetical rates of return on invested savings vs. the interest rates on financing.  And I will definitely NOT use financing as a way to put a down payment on a nicer car... I'm not going to be working for the next two years and have a set amount I'm willing to spend now.

My question is this: are there any situations where dealer incentives allow me to finance a car and pay less in total than if I were to pay in cash?

Bitcoin Sees Wall Street Warm to Trading Virtual Currency
By Nathaniel Popper
May 7, 2018

SAN FRANCISCO — Some of the biggest names on Wall Street are warming up to Bitcoin, a virtual currency that for nearly a decade has been consigned to the unregulated fringes of the financial world.

The parent company of the New York Stock Exchange has been working on an online trading platform that would allow large investors to buy and hold Bitcoin, according to emails and documents viewed by The New York Times and four people briefed on the effort who asked to remain anonymous because the plans were still confidential.

The news of the virtual exchange, which has not been reported before, came after Goldman Sachs went public with its intention to open a Bitcoin trading unit — most likely the first of its kind at a Wall Street bank.

The moves by Goldman and Intercontinental Exchange, or ICE, the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, mark a dramatic shift toward the mainstream for a digital token that has been known primarily for its underworld associations and status as a high-risk, speculative investment.

The new interest among Wall Street power brokers also represents a surprising new chapter in the renegade history of Bitcoin.

The virtual currency was created after the 2008 global financial crisis by a still-anonymous programmer who used the name Satoshi Nakamoto. The idea was to replace the existing banking structure with an online alternative that couldn’t be controlled by a handful of powerful organizations.

But instead of being replaced, the old banks are beginning to assert their own role in the unorthodox financial world of virtual currency, sometimes called cryptocurrencies.

While Bitcoin was originally intended to be used by consumers for all sorts of transactions — without any financial institutions getting involved — it has mostly become a virtual investment, stored in digital wallets and traded on mostly unregulated exchanges around the world. People buy Bitcoin in the hope that its value will go up, similar to the way they purchase gold or silver.

Details of the platform that Intercontinental Exchange is working on have not been finalized and the project could still fall apart, given the hesitancy among big Wall Street institutions to be closely associated with the Wild West of virtual currencies. A spokesman said that the company had no comment.

Many corporations and governments have expressed interest in the technology that Bitcoin introduced, particularly a form of database known as the blockchain.

Some large financial exchanges, including the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, have already created financial products linked to the price of Bitcoin, known as futures. But the new operation at ICE would provide more direct access to Bitcoin by putting the actual tokens in the customer’s account at the end of the trade.

ICE has had conversations with other financial institutions about setting up a new operation through which banks can buy a contract, known as a swap, that will end with the customer owning Bitcoin the next day — with the backing and security of the exchange, according to the people familiar with the project.

The swap contract is more complicated than an immediate trade of dollars for Bitcoin, even if the end result is still ownership of a certain amount of Bitcoin. But a swap contract allows the trading to come under the regulation of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and to operate clearly under existing laws — something today’s Bitcoin exchanges have struggled to do.

The chief executive of Nasdaq, Adena Friedman, recently said her company could also create a virtual-currency exchange if regulatory issues are ironed out. While several hedge funds have been buying and selling Bitcoin, most large institutional investors, such as mutual funds and pensions, have avoided it largely as a result of similar regulatory concerns.

Bitcoin still faces plenty of skepticism in the mainstream financial world. Over the weekend, Warren E. Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway, who has long been critical of virtual currencies, said Bitcoin was “probably rat poison squared” in an interview with CNBC. The Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates added his own skepticism, saying he’d “short” Bitcoin if he could.

And the new efforts to trade Bitcoin don’t help answer basic questions about what makes the virtual currency useful in the real world. Most attempts to use Bitcoin for everyday commerce haven’t gained traction, and investors have treated it as a speculative commodity like gold or silver.

Some Bitcoin enthusiasts have said that its increasing integration into the existing financial system has pulled it away from its founding ideals. Paul Chou, a former trader at Goldman Sachs who set up LedgerX, a regulated Bitcoin exchange that would compete with Intercontinental Exchange, said his company has made a point of focusing on large Bitcoin holders, rather than financial institutions.

“The reason we got into crypto was not to partner with a bank, but to replace them,” Mr. Chou said, using the shorthand for cryptocurrencies. “We deal with crypto holders directly in a way that really takes advantage of Bitcoin’s strengths, while avoiding brokers, banks and other institutions that take multiple cuts of the transaction.”

Goldman will initially only be trading futures contracts linked to Bitcoin’s price. But Goldman executives said they were looking at moving in the direction of buying and selling actual Bitcoins.

Intercontinental Exchange’s effort, if it pans out, could make Bitcoin available to a much wider and more influential customer base, including other financial firms.

Several big corporate names, including the giant technology investor SoftBank, which has stakes in Sprint and Uber, have been in discussions about being involved with the exchange in some way, the people familiar with the project said. But a spokesman for SoftBank said this week that it was no longer involved.

LedgerX, the exchange founded by Mr. Chou, is the only exchange that now offers the kind of swaps that ICE has discussed. LedgerX has experienced increasing trading volume in recent months, but ICE would start with an edge because essentially every large financial institution is already hooked into it.

The interest in Bitcoin trading illustrates how the reputation of the virtual currency has, after a rocky start, improved.

Regulators are currently looking at whether many virtual currencies, including the second most widely used digital token, Ether, have been issued and traded in violation of securities regulations. Institutional investors believe that because of the way Bitcoin was created and structured — without any one company or organization behind it — it would be on safer ground with regulators.

ICE was considering launching a swap contract linked to Ether, but backed away from that because of regulatory uncertainty, the people briefed on the effort said.

Mr. Chou, at LedgerX, said he made a similar decision and has delayed creating any products linked to Ether.

With Bitcoin, on the other hand, Mr. Chou said that road seems to be clear for big institutions to get involved.

“The industry is seeing unprecedented institutional interest for the first time in Bitcoin’s history,” he said. “I’ve been amazed that the strongest believers in cryptocurrency often start out the most skeptical. It’s a healthy skepticism. But at some point the perception shifts, and for many institutions — I think we’re finally there.”",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Plan for repaying debt (what to pay first),"I recently signed up for a program through my employer that is going to wipe out a large portion of my student loans.  With this big, unexpected change, I am needing to reevaluate what my approach should be to saving/paying off the remainder of my debt. Here are the numbers:

Income

Monthly Net Income: $4700

Savings

Savings Account: $7,000
Retirement Account: $4,000 (contributing 5% pay and receiving 5% match, which is the max match)

Debt/Expenses

Private Student Loan: $450 fixed payment ($16,725 @ 2.99%)
Car Loan: $200 ($10,400 @ 3.49%)
Rent + Utilities: $1,100

I also have ~$10,000 left on my federal student loans (they withheld this amount for taxes when they made the first payment as part of the loan repayment program), but they will be making another payment next year that will wipe out nearly the rest of this balance.

I have been saving anywhere from $500-$1,000 a month since completely paying off a credit card I had. 

My question is, what should I pay off first?  My private loan is a fixed payment (@ $450 a month), and I have 3 years left on it if I just keep paying it off at that set rate.

I currently have \~$120k in student loan principal balance remaining, after having paid my minimum payments for 3 years. It sucks, but I made that choice when I chose to go to school out of state and pursue a high risk / high reward career path. Regardless of my choices, the past is the past and I owe money to creditors.  


I currently allocate about 8&amp;#37; of my income to a 401k, with my employer matching 6&amp;#37;. Thus far, over 3 years of investment, I've seen about a 13&amp;#37; return on my accounts. Granted, this is during a significant growth period in the market, and my fund managers haven't been completely asleep at the wheel or otherwise irresponsible. I also allocate another 2&amp;#37; or so to a mutual fund account, as a means of hedging against my 401k. My mutual funds have shown about a 11&amp;#37; return, year over year.  


On the contrast, I've been paying student loans for the same duration, with an average interest rate on principal owed at roughly 9&amp;#37;. Some are lower, some are higher, but by weighted average I'd guestimate that 9&amp;#37; is about on par. It seems like I've been mostly making payments on interest (which I probably have) as compared to actually reducing the principal on the outstanding loan amounts. Overall, this comes out to about 20&amp;#37; or so of my annual income, allocated solely to paying minimum payments on debt. It is disheartening to see how much I pay in interest every year, but I always feel like that's most I can do without sacrificing my standard of living (which is not lavish or extravagant by any means), without reducing retirement allocation.  


I've heard rhetoric from both sides indicating I should be paying off solely student debt vs. spreading out to both retirement and debt. By a game of interest, I would think that investing in something returning 13&amp;#37; is better than paying on something that is costing 9&amp;#37;. But I could be wrong. I have a friend that has completely stopped putting money in retirement in order to only pay off debt. To me that sounds crazy, as I know he's only hurting/prolonging his retirement.  


Does anybody have any insight on this? Without running some complex market sensitivity analysis with respect to my personal allocations, is there any rule of thumb that should be followed? Should I be aggressive towards my 401k and retirement during strong market performance and aggressive towards loans during weak market performance? Is there a better balance?   


Any input is appreciated. I'm only 25, but the debt is overwhelming and aggravating. I want to knock down my debt as fast as possible without sacrificing long term wealth. While doing everything I can (within reason) to reduce my monthly expenditures (rent, groceries, entertainment, etc.), I still want to maintain a quality of life and not have to eat ramen and read by candlelight.

5. Tax/Legal services (Amazon will never kill in the next decade).

Here is what are the important facts Amazon has done between 1994-2011 in the eyes of a B&amp;M:

**A**. They forced FedEx/UPS/USPS to drastically **increase** the price of B2C fast shipping by leveraging their huge volume of low weight items [NOTE: take a look for yourself at first class and priority mail](https://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/rates-historical-statistics.htm).

**B**. They have built lots of big servers hosting online advertising content to the internet.

**C**. They have allowed Distributors/Third-Party Sellers to sell huge volumes at **lower than market price**.

These three are important facts that have existed between 2012-Present and show **how Amazon kills out B&amp;M**.

1. Small or large B&amp;M businesses can't compete at all from fact **A** and **B** if they do not have niches Amazon/people in **C** can't replicate.

2. Brand Owners/Suppliers/Manufactures out of the necessity to survive are vertically integrating towards online to protect/expand their bottom line.

3. Retail outlet owners are seeing their revenue shrink because retail businesses must close when fact 1+ 2 happen, seeing how the property owners want to keep their bottom line or must keep the revenue the same, they increase the rent on current/new tenants.

And here is where I am fearful as someone who has to expect this for another 60 years and why it is not okay to just accept the precedent.

I believe the only reason the US economy exists as it is today is because people who get paychecks spend a portion of their paychecks. For this to be something I believe, I make one huge assumption, how many people getting a paycheck matters more than how much is printed on that paycheck across the entire economy.

The interest rates are 3.4, 3.4, 3.86 and 4.66
The weighted average is 3.85%

Right now if I enter each of the loans individually into loan calculators along with my payment I get a pay off date for the loans. But if I enter the entire balance with the weighted interest rate average with the same payment I get a different date that is sooner.

It’s all really confusing and I’m not sure if I’m explaining it correctly but if anyone can help I would really appreciate it.",finance
Bitcoin,"""Money just wants to be one""","Since when has 200 different national currencies been good for global trade, forex risk, fair global competition between businesses etc. 

How efficient is a business when you need to waste time and resources dedicating effort to following the forex market instead of focusing on your product. What if you dedicate 30 years to building a competative advantage only to see that advantage wiped out in 1 month because your nations currency rises against other currencies.

The whole point of inventing ""money"" was to do away with barter because barter is inefficient. In fact the ""invention"" of money was just people deciding to use one single store of value for trade within a community to maximize efficiency of trade instead of using many different mediums (barter).

We now live in one globalized community so we should logically use one globalized currency to make trade more efficient and fair.

When you think about it we literally have a system of inefficient barter today trying to trade global currencies with eachother. Forex is currency barter!

""Money just wants to be one"" - Saifedean Ammous

Even over the last 50 years we saw the world trending towards a system of one global reserve currency (USD) where it was permitted. Not that it will last because it gives one countries government the ability to export inflation to the detriment of other countries economies, which will not last over the long term. Infact the dollar standard is crumbling as we speak because it gives advantage to the US over other countries. 

We need a politically neutral global currency not controlled by any one government.

Bitcoin will be the one global store of value used as money, all other cryptos will be pay-per-use, where if you want to use a dapp for example your smart wallet ""atomically"" swaps into other cryptos by the second to pay for it.

It is fine to have one global currency when that currency is politically neutral and not forced on the world but is instead voluntarily adopted. Infact it is the only logical way forward for humanity.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Trying to plan for the future,"My grandma passed away at the end of 2015, leaving a large sum of money for my mom, her only child. That money is already in accounts that we won’t touch. My mom has now said that when the market is better in the area where my Grandma’s house is, she’s going to sell and split the money between my brother and myself. It’s been stated that she wants to sell when she can get $500,000 for the house. For now, my brother is living in the house but he’s also been talking about leaving the state. 

I’m not sure what the right thing to do would be with the inheritance. Currently, my husband and I have been in our house (home is in my name) for just over one year. The home was valued at $215,000 and we are making improvements which should increase the value of the home (adding egress windows to the basement, essentially turning our 3 bed, 1.5 bath to a 5 bed) this summer. Our mortgage payment is $1413/month and we owe $200,700. We also have a car payment $500/month (owe $25,000 which is less than the value of the car ~$32,000 and we really don’t want to get rid of it) lastly, I have about $15,000 in student loan debt. Payments are around $300/month but 6.8%+ interest rates. 

In the event that my parents sell and split the proceeds (no mortgage on the house being sold), should I pay off my house &amp; loans and invest the money that I would pay every month on the mortgage into some type of savings and rebuild that $250,000 over many years, or refinance the house and put some inheritance into a retirement fund? The student loans have got to go, they have the highest interest rate. Our car is around 4% and the house is just over 4% as well.  

I should also note that I make $57,000 and my husband’s salary varies depending on the year between $85,000-100,000+",finance

personalfinance,Good financial situation but not sure what to do next.,"About a year ago I started to follow Dave Ramsey's Baby Steps. I had a few thousand dollars in credit card debt and a car loan. Today, I am happy to say that I am debt free. Here's my situation. I turn 29 next month. Live with my girlfriend who is a teacher. I'm leaving my job next week and starting a new one in July. $155K base salary with 20%+ bonus target. We live in a house that we own. Owe $255K on the mortgage. Payments are $2150-$2200 each month. That's all in and includes taxes which are high where we are; $12K per year. We have no kids. We have no debt. I have an emergency fund of $17K which would cover 4 months of expenses for both of us. Mortgage + Utilities + Food + Gas. We each contribute 15%+ to retirement. I'll max out my 401K benefit this year; federal limit of $18,500. I plan to increase my emergency fund to $25K by the end of the year. I'm planning to save about $10K for an engagement ring which I'd like to buy around/before November. So... what's next? I feel like I'm in this spot where the next 10 years of my life are all about paying off the house. Realistically, we'd like to move to a town with better schools. Should I be saving for the next downpayment instead? Move as soon as possible? Should I just sock more money away toward retirement? Start a 529 now and save some money for the kids we don't yet have? What do y'all think?",finance
personalfinance,Should I pay off my mortgage? Plan to live in the property 4 more years max,"I've recently enjoyed a nice windfall from stock options.  Nowhere near life changing amounts, but enough to fund my kids college and pay off a $190k mortgage on the condo I live in.  I only plan to live here another 4 years, max.  Would paying off my mortgage be my best move?  FWIW the property is highly desirable in my area and has appreciated at a satisfactory pace.  It's also highly rentable, so that might be an option after I move out.  I've owned rental properties in my area in the past so I'm familiar with the practical challenges involved. Renting it would gross about $1200/month, before taking a contingency reserve and income taxes into account.   I have no other debt besides the mortgage.

Interest rate is 3.75%, variable, slated to start adjusting around the time I plan on moving. I currently have about 10% equity in the property (used minimal down payment).

personalfinance,Company overpaid me and wants me to repay them more than what I received.,"My company overpaid me ~$13,000 last year. They noticed their error before I did and have asked me to pay back the amount they overpaid. I'm fine with this. However, the amount they are asking me to repay is larger than the amount that was direct deposited into my bank account. As an example, if they overpaid me $1000 but $100 was taken out for federal/state tax and I only received $900, they're still requesting that I pay back $1000. Is that right? What should I do? My 2017 taxes that I already filed included the amount overpaid since it was included in the amount on my W2. Do I need to file an amended return? Is the IRS going to give me back the amount that was automatically taken out of my paychecks? What's the best way to handle this?

personalfinance,When would refinancing home mortgage?,"Edit: *When should I refinance a home mortgage?

I bought my first house in late 2015 (FHA loan, 5% down payment, 3.875% interest rate). From my own research before I bought the house, I knew I would be paying PMI until I got to less than 80% loan principal versus the value of the house. I'm very near that mark this year, so I contacted my mortgage company and requested information for when I am eligible to remove PMI from my mortgage. Turns out, I didn't do enough research on FHA vs Conventional type loans and I'm stuck with my PMI for the lifetime of my loan. 

I think I have two options here:
1. Refinance to a conventional loan, which will likely be at a higher interest rate. From the Federal Reserve Board website, this will cost me between 3-6% of the principal to do (or $5-10k for my $161k principal).
2. Do nothing and keep paying the PMI ($120/mo) until I move or the mortgage is paid off. I plan on moving within the next 3-5 years once I have my student loans and car paid off.

Since I don't plan to stay here for too much longer, would it even be worth it to refinance? My own math puts me at ~$5k to refinance plus ~$2.5k in additional interest if I get a 5% interest rate. Versus $3.6k ($120/mo for three years) if I just do nothing and pay the PMI. 

Is refinancing a mortgage usually only wise to do if you plan on staying in a home long term? Are there any other benefits to refinance that I'm missing?",finance

* Loan 1 - Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan - $22.3k @ 6.21&amp;#37;
* Loan 2 - Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan - $22.7k @ 5.84&amp;#37;
* Loan 3 - Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan - $21.4k @ 5.31&amp;#37;
* Loan 4 - ""Institutional""/Private Loan -              $31.8k @ 6.0&amp;#37;
* Loan 5 - ""Institutional""/Private Loan -              $21.7k @ 6.0&amp;#37;

Fortunately, we'll have a combined income of around $240k once she starts working.  Our plan is to pay $4.5k per month (putting the extra amount towards the loan with the highest rate) and if we are able to stay the course, we will have them paid off in \~2.5 years, having paid $9k in interest.  

However, I'm thinking about refinancing them (going with a 5-year term to get lowest possible rate).  I know that we potentially stand to lose some benefits of the federal loans (forgiveness, income based repayment options, deferment/forbearance, loan cancelling upon death) and that I may have to co-sign, but I don't think we'll need to utilize any of these benefits.  Is there anything I'm missing? 

The other question is fixed vs variable rate.  Knowing that our intended payoff plan is 2.5 years, would it be crazy to consider a variable rate loan?  Supposedly some of the big names in refinancing (Sofi, Laurel Road, Earnest, Lendkey) have variable rates at or even under 3&amp;#37; (this would save us \~$4.5k in interest if it stayed around 3&amp;#37; the entire duration).  I expect rates to increase, but surely they won't skyrocket overnight and even if they did increase, it would probably be a steady climb and most lenders have a cap on how high variable rates will go (Laurel Road caps them at 9&amp;#37; for 5 year loan).  

Finally, anyone have recommendations for which refinancing company to go with?  Thanks!",finance

Late last year I was unexpectedly let go leading me into a situation of several months where I could not afford my loan payments. My credit score is full of holes and stranded on the bottom of the financial ocean and I’ve largely come to acceptance of that. But, I have some capability, finally, to at least improve my situation a little and cut into what I owe. I could use a heap of advice on the best way forward:

Financial situation –I’m currently I’m starting over from scratch. I’ll have a $930 check coming in every two weeks. Therefore, my account currently has $930 in it. I may be bumped up to somewhere around 30K/a year within the next few months. Which will make that paycheck go up some a month. I can’t do math. 

**Loan #1** – *The one that might be okay*: Federal student loan. I owe $6,564.33 total, and am currently past-due $730.19. Not yet defaulted.  I imagine the Feds will let me work out some kind of payment plan that will still allow me to eat and pay rent. 

**Loan #2** – *The one that is definitely not okay*: Private loan with Upstart I took out for car repairs – I owe $3,639. Three months ago the loan defaulted and was sent to collections. I’d like not to have my wages garnished and definitely can’t have my car repossessed – if only because of the cruel irony. If there’s any way to begin paying this off again in a reasonable manner, I’d like nothing more.

It’d be a big load off my back to stop looking the other way when it comes to these loans, but damn it, I’m dreading what addressing these again is going to look like.

personalfinance,Hike in my Social Security and Medicare Tax.,"So I was checking my bank statement to ensure my direct deposit went through today. As I was checking, I noticed the amount was less than it should have been. Upon further analysis, I found that I was paid this week significantly less than normal.

Upon closer inspection of my pay statement, I found that the difference can be attributed to a rise in my Social Security and Medicare Tax equaling about $316.

I have minimal expenses (Basically can get by each month with just the cash in my wallet) and have saved up a total of $1700 in my savings account. I've heard that in savings accounts you're basically losing money because inflation is greater than the interest rate, so I've been thinking about investing. My big problem is I don't know where to start, I tried asking my parents but neither of them have done any investing beyond basic retirement plans. So, what should I do?

personalfinance,"Loan at 9.99%, best way to go about paying the off?","Last summer I had my windows in my townhouse replaced, attic insulation, and entry door redone.  The total damage was about $18k.  

With the payments coming due for the windows and being in striking distance, I paid off my student loans and my car.  Now I have the windows to pay for. I financed through the company that did the work. The loan is at 9.99% which is rediculous. Payments are ~$238/mo. 

I am paying $500/mo to the windows loan.  Have about $16.4k remaining. 

 I also have a minivan I'm paying for.  $15.5k left at 3.95%. This I pay the minimum until I can get the windows paid off. ($286/mo)


Main question: What's the best way to go about paying this off as soon as possible? Should I shop around for a personal loan at a lower interest rate?


The main reason I want to get this paid off as soon as possible is to free up some cash to begin adding to investments.  Still saving a bit each month, but it'd be nice to be debt free. Due to our growing family, as soon as I paid off my debts (student loans, car) I jumped into other debts. Had to have a minivan as one car no longer worked for the family and we had a third child in the way.  Also wanted to make an improvement on the home and gotta admit, attic insulation and windows have made the house 10x more comfortable, especially in the summer! Not to mention the bills have dropped a little bit. Not huge but a bit due to less hearing/AC.

personalfinance,Advice regarding refinancing student loans (Stafford - Unsubsidized),"I am seeking the advice of r/personalfinance to make sure my thinking regarding refinancing my old student loan debt makes sense.

I currently work as an assistant professor at a small state school and make $56,000 a year.  I live in Virginia with My wife who is currently staying at home with our 2 year old daughter (my wife has paid off her student debt).

I currently have the following student loans through Navient (current balance and interest % of each loan):
Stafford - Unsubsidized    $1,289.02 	3.280% 	estimated repayment 08/19/2020 
Stafford - Unsubsidized    $3,983.31 	6.800% 	estimated repayment 09/19/2026 
Stafford - Unsubsidized    $6,259.25 	6.800% 	estimated repayment 09/19/2026 

I was recently received an email from the navi-refi program that appears to be a naveint base refinance program advertising interests rates fixed at 3.5%.  This prompted me research other possible companies, all of which all seem to offer fixed rates near that.  I was planning on paying off the smaller loan and then trying to refinance the two larger loans to get a better interest rate. I can comfortably pay off the smaller loan now.  I currently have a credit score of 783.

My main hesitation is the fact that my loans lose their federal status if I refinance... and while I have done some research regarding federal loan forgiveness programs (none of them seem to apply) I am uncertain if losing federal loan status is a bad thing for me.  There is also the whole legal action against Navient that I don't understand.

So what do you think?  I generally just want some advice regrading whether it would be a good idea to refinance my federal student debt. I realize i haven't discussed our families finances in depth but I figured this was enough information for now and I can provide more if needed.

# About me

-   I'm a college student living with my parents.
-   My credit report shows that I'm okay for everything I am affiliated with.
-   I currently have no student loans.
-   My parents basically cover for most of the utility bills and insurance.
-   I may have to pay for my car's insurance soon.
-   I do not have a job this summer, but I work on campus during the fall and
-   spring semesters.
-   My part-time school job pays between $2,000-$3,000 per school semester (or
    $4,000-$6000 per school year) excluding the summer and winter semesters
    depending on the number of hours I work. I plan to work the maximum number
    of hours.
-   Excluding any money that my parents have saved for me, I personally saved
    about $3,500. Figuratively speaking, the money is under my bed. I could
    probably ask for all the money to be put into my new checking/savings
    account(s), but I want to set things right with a smaller amount before
    making any major money transfers.
-   Because I don't travel outside the United States, foreign fees aren't the
    biggest issue for me.

# Approaches
Here are all the approaches I have considered doing. I would appreciate some
insight on which ones you think are better or worse.


Approach                      | Savings Account(s)   | Checking Account(s)
------------------------------|----------------------| -------------------|
Min-Max                       | Local Credit Union   | Local Credit Union (required for checking account, Marcus by Goldman Sachs
Mixed Institution (Variant 1) | Alliant Credit Union | Ally Bank

Same Instutions (Variant 1)   | Alliant Credit Union | Alliant Credit Union
Same Instutions (Variant 2)   | Ally Bank            | Ally Bank
Set and Forget                | Charles Schwab Bank  | Ally Bank

# Questions

### Same Institution vs Mixed Institution Approach
-   Is it worth to forego some convenience for better rates or to make it a
    little harder to access your emergency fund if you are a trigger-happy
    person?

### Student Credit Cards
-   If I want to build my credit, should i get one of these
    [student credit card](https://www.creditcards.com/student/)
    or should i get a credit card from one of the credit unions/banks above? Am
    I even able to apply for the credit card if I'm not even affiliated with the
    bank/credit union.

### Debit Card Usage
-   Excluding the usage requirements for my local credit union, is there any
    instances where I should consider using my debit card?

### Checking Account Rate Importance
-   Should I factor the checking account when choosing the checking account?

### Multiple Savings Accounts
-   Is it a good idea to have separate savings accounts for my emergency funds
    and college tuition? Which banks/ credit unions allow multiple savings
    accounts?

### Thoughts/Opinions on Consumers Credit Union and LMCU
-   LMCU and Consumers Credit Union provide higher rates to my local credit
    union and have slightly more flexible debit card usage requirements (no $5
    payment per transaction). Would you consider the convenience of a local
    credit union or the min-max potential of the extra 0.09% APY more
    beneficial?

### Pros/Cons to having physical credit union/bank.
-   How important is it to have a local credit union I can go to?

### To have or not to have a physical credit union as a backup.
-   If i don't plan on using my local credit union as my primary checking
    account, would it still be a good idea to open an account just for
    situations where I need money asap?


tldr: From the 6 approaches above, which do you think would be the best for me? If possible answering the other questions would be appreciated.

Edit: Added tldr.

personalfinance,About to cosign a designer bag to pay off or pay half of my CC which bill should it be?,"Alright so I purchased a designer bag back in October, at the time I could completely afford it and took up the offer of financing it on the credit card. I stayed on top of payments etc and over paid but found myself unable to do so January when my parents were out of work and I had to put more weight/drain my accounts to help support them. On top of that I acrued more cc debt from the ordeal, even though I will still have some debt to pay after selling the back I will get about 1170 in cash to do whatever I'd like with.

These are my debts

 $2,247.56  - Apple Barclay

4,795.78  - Over stock

 **$2,930.12** \- Barneys

I have 3 other smaller debts but I have a payment plan in place that will allow me to eliminate them rather quickly by the end of the year I'm more focused on these three. Two of which I know after all the debts are gone I will still be paying for but I will be able to aggressively focus on them because of my lack of debt.

I feel the Barclay one would be the smartest to drop my payments lower and ask for late fee waivers because I have not paid in quite awhlie. The others have gotten payments, but I am just wondering which is the best to go.

The overstock and Barneys card is in a financial hardship program so interest rates are extremely low.  Also the last two cards will have all late fees waived and I am getting insurance credits for the accounts that I have been over paying.

Hello, this is my first time posting here.

I’m looking for general advice. Hopefully you can help if I describe my situation further:

Just graduated in May. Accepted a position as an engineer (federal employment with federal benefits). For the first six months I will be at a salaried rate of 57k/yr. From six months to 1.5 years I will be at a salaried rate of 65k/yr. at 2.5 years I will complete training and will be salaried at 80k/yr. Start in July.

personalfinance,Refinancing My Moms House,"Hey PF, my family is in dire straits and we could really use some advice!  

I want to apologize in advance as this is all really new to me so if something doesn't make sense, let me know and I'll try to clarify.  Most of the info I'm going to put in this post is from what my older brother has explained to me but even he is not well versed in finance.  Most of this info is new to my brothers and I and we are frustrated and bummed out that all these years we've been giving money to our mom to handle the mortgage but we've really been flushing a significant part of our respective salaries down the drain.

Here's the quick run-down:

When my dad passed away(11 years ago), my brothers and I were in no position to handle the finances and it seems my mom made poor decisions and we've been paying for it since and now I'm looking at it and I want to see what can be done to fix it.  I believe Bank of America really took my mom for a ride and I'm afraid the same will happen to me.  I currently live out-of-state, but the house in question is located in New York where my brother and my mom live.  

My mom is not employed, we do not intend for her to be employed for the rest of her life and my two brothers and I split the mortgage 3 ways.  I believe the morgage has ~$180,000 left on it.  We pay $1400 in interest and $400 in principal with a interest rate at over 7%.  We also pay a $2500 school tax and a $2000 property tax every 6 months on top of that. 

For whatever reason that I cant seem to figure out, the mortgage is classified as a ""2nd mortgage"" per Bank of America despite the fact we don't have a first.  I'm not sure what happened to have caused this situation but to give you context, both of my older brothers were in college, I was in high school, my mom was panicking to pay medical bills, funeral bills and every other bill you can imagine and I believe she took this mortgage out in a panick in 2007, right around the housing crisis and literally days, if not weeks after my father had passed away so I don't think she was of clear mind and as far as I know, Bank of America could have done everything in their power to take advantage of the situation.  

So the two options we have to refinance, as far as I know at least, is to refinance under my mom(which I would prefer) or to refinance under my name.  My brother insists that he spoke to a mortgage broker that said we should not refinance under my moms name but I haven't heard from him yet as to why.  My brother says if we do the mortgage in my name, he will allow me to pay less of the monthly payment and he will pay more.  Both of my brothers do not wish to refinance under their name because they want to purchase homes in the near future for themselves.

My questions are:

1. Should I refinance the house in my name?  I live in a different state but our house is in New York.

2. Are there any reasonable options to refinance under my moms name?  She doesn't have any income and I don't believe her credit is nearly as good as mine.

3. Does my credit and my salary affect us positively or negatively if we try to refinance under my name?  I have a 750 credit score and I make $100,000 a year.  Do I have some sort of leverage?

4. If I go into  Bank of America to refinance, is there any negotiation on rates?  I don't feel well versed and I'm terrified of Bank of America taking me for all I'm worth and possibly locking me into something that I'll regret.

&gt; ""...most people found the change traumatic, the millennials fared best as they had little to begin with and adapted best to the new system. Older people with pensions and people who had become dependent on the state fared the worse, but generally except for the few who had made preparations life became much harder. 


 
&gt; The collapse began in early September 2018. Deutchbank was the first to go, after the ECB refused to guarantee its obligations to other banks, shortly after Barclays, HSBC and Santander. The contagion spread and eventually all banks, even Goldman Sachs collapsed too. The IMF and World Bank were overwhelmed, nothing could be done. Afterwards the true extent of their criminality became apparent. Many of the assets they said they had did not exist or been stolen and what assets they did have  were now worthless as the buyers (other banks) had all gone 
bankrupt too. Many bankers disappeared, lots were arrested and quite a few killed themselves.



&gt; Throughout the world governments had guaranteed most peoples savings, it very quickly became apparent that due to the size of the collapse this would not be possible. Instead the government issued savers with 'peoples saver bonds' which were to be held for 5 years and paid 8% interest. Initially these bonds traded at a premium due to the -2.5% interest rate set by the Bank Of England. However since the collapse most businesses  had closed and the economy was entirely government driven. Huge sums of money were created with the aim of kick starting the economy back to life. Inflation began to creep in, 10% then 20%, the peoples saver bonds began to trade at a discount 99p to the pound, 95p to the pound. Eventually as inflation hit 500% they were worthless. The government tried to stop inflation by reducing the supply of physical cash, first £50 note were no longer legal tender, then new £10 and £20 notes where issued with the old ones no longer to be used. This had the opposite effect, people no longer trusted that their cash had value so spent it as quick as possible driving up prices even more. Inflation peaked at 630% but by then the damage had been done. Throughout the world all government issued fiat was no longer trusted or accepted.



&gt; As the old currencies died so did the power once held by the governments that issued them, the USA fared the worse, no longer able to afford its armies it became a irrelevance. All countries suffered however those with natural resources, gold or crypto-reserves fared the best. 



&gt; In September as the collapse was underway attention turned to Bitcoin, they idea of being able to transfer value from A to B without the need for trusting a 3rd party i.e. a bank brought in many large businesses. Also a growing number of people whilst wary and skeptical of using bitcoin thought that their money would be safer in bitcoin than in a bank or held in cash. As the price of bitcoin became more and more expensive the trust in cash diminished. By December bitcoin was now over £1M, it could have been £10M or £100M, even £1B it was irrelevant now. As people frantically converted their life savings from pounds to Bitcoin, receiving a few thousand Satoshi's, the old system was now all but dead.


&gt; In a last ditch attempt to keep hold of some kind of power governments began to mine Bitcoin. For many people reality hit home to how severe the situation had become when during the winter of 2018 the country had rolling blackouts as power was diverted to mining operations. Many people died during a particularly harsh cold snap around Christmas. Whilst the government did mange to mine some bitcoin it was too little too late. As the government collapsed, in the chaos the bitcoins mined appear to have been stolen...""

I've read this on USNews :

""If the federal prime rate is 4.75 percent, that would equal an APR of 21.74 percent for any purchases not paid off by the end of the grace period.""

""You don’t have to pay any interest charges on purchases as long as you pay off the balance in full by your due date.""

Does that mean that as long as I pay back the money for the purchases I made in the given amount of time, I don't have to pay any extra money? 

For example, if I purchase a wireless mouse on Amazon for $20 using my credit card and pay this money back within, say, 2 days, do I have to pay only $20 without any extra fees? Would that fulfill my payment? Or should I keep using the credit card throughout the month and then pay the money after I get the bill? And if I do get a bill, will it have any added on interest rates? 

Also, is the cashback worth it? Would anyone be able to accumulate around $2000 in a year with the cashback?

personalfinance,Am I someone that would benefit more from a Traditional IRA as compared to a Roth?,"So, I'm still in the process of paying down some debt ($10,000 in CCs, $15,000 to the IRS, and a $16,000 personal loan to my parents), but I should have it all knocked out within the next 18-24 months at the rate I'm going. However, I have about $110,000 in federal student loans that I'll start paying on in 6 months. But I qualify for PSLF on **all** of the loans, and I'm not going to leave my tenured teaching job until I retire.

Now, I'm 33, married, and a public school teacher. Our AGI last year was about $105,000 I have a pension from work where I must contribute 9% every paycheck. When I retire I'll receive 75% of my salary for life... so it's probably the only real retirement I'll need. 

However, being the follower of this sub that I am, I'm not going to stop contributing to tax-sheltered retirement accounts! So, once I pay off all my debt with the exception of my student loans and mortgage, I'd like to start an IRA. Now, since I'm just now starting my 10-year PSLF, I'm thinking that doing a Traditional IRA would be the way to go, since it'll lower my AGI, and therefore, my PAYE payments will be lower on my student loans.

personalfinance,University Transfer Student in need of financial advice.,"Hello everyone,

I am a 19 year old student transferring to a university this fall, and I’m in need of some financial advice. 

First, my tuition + housing will total to about $21k for my first year (3 academic quarters. Tuition is roughly $15k while the housing is around $6k.

In terms of funding, I will have to resort to loans due to to my late filing of FAFSA. I am trying to take as many federal, subsidized loans as possible. But after some quick research, Federal loans can only cover about $6500. So I will probably have to resort to private loans for the remainder. My parents will provide me with about $700 a month when I’m at college, which i will save towards the debt. 

I plan on tanking most of the payments on the loans, and just saving whatever money I can towards paying off that debt. 

Now here are my concerns: 
- Should I make payments towards my debt while I’m still in school? Like I said, my parents will be sending me about $700 a month, which I plan to use for the housing. 

- Are there any type of loans out there I should avoid? Are there any I should go for?

    $200k in fed student loans, 
    $50k in private student loans. 
    $2,600 in credit cards

I spent the last 3 years building this house to start controlling my loans but the idea is to get an equity loan that consolidates the private debt and then pay monthly my public for say 25 years at IBR based on my income...

Which is okay i make $48.5k a year as a public servant web developer for my city. its 12k less than i am used to but it helps my city so Im all for it.

How can I get this loan to help me get out of water?

I'm looking to put that money to use for me. I have 8k in federally deferred loans right now and anticipate to take on another 12k in the next 3 semesters. I have a 750 credit score and about $7,500 saved up. This is my first real job and have never filed taxes before.

Afterwards I would love to turn this into an investment rental property. This is something I've had my mind set on for the last year but I'm now looking for guidance or advice on how to go about this

personalfinance,To consolidate or not....,"I'm relatively debt free and I'm looking to buy a house. I'm going to have $100k that I was going to use for a down payment on a house in the $300-400k price range. I'm getting quoted good VA mortgage rates at around 4&amp;#37;. I also have a month or two's pay as an emergency fund.

My only other debt is a mortgage on what is now a rental property where I owe $60k with a monthly payment of $560 at an interest rate of around 3.4&amp;#37; with 12 years left on the note and a car that I owe $23k on with an interest rate of 1.75&amp;#37; and a monthly payment of $575 with 3.5 years left on the note.

In lieu of the $100k down payment on the new house, I'm considering paying off my car and other house so I only have one payment/debt, my home mortgage. I can finance our home with 0&amp;#37; down on a VA loan but I would put some money down (probably around $20k). The interest rate on the other two are lower but it would also bring my monthly debts down by $600 (assuming a $400k house) which is nice since my budget will be tighter than normal with a change in job/location. In the long run this gives me more financial flexibility by having more available cash each month, and the ability to easily sell my other house or car no matter what the price for quick cash in a big pinch  without having to worry about paying off the loan. Selling the rental home alone would get me at least 4 years worth of mortgage payments.

In the long run I spend more on the house due to a higher interest rate but I also think if I'm doing ok financially I can throw any extra monthly income at my mortgage (which is now my only debt) and in the long run spend less money than continuing to make payments on all of them.

personalfinance,Maxing SEP and saving ~50k annually... no clue what to do with it,"Hey guys. Long time lurker posting on a throwaway.

Without going into specifics, I own a small business, earn ~250k annually (pre tax) and am lucky to be able to max my SEP (~54k) a year as well as save about 50k additional to that. I have 100k sitting in a capital one money market savings that is at 1.64% interest rate. 

My SEP is managed by my father who has been option trading for over 12 years with great success. After the initial investment of 8k during my first year and 54k last year the account is at 66k and giving the current market volatility (what I’ve read, I don’t really know lol) I’m pretty happy with that %.

You might ask why I don’t ask him for advice for the rest of my money, and the answer would be that I would love some outside input into how I should invest. I’d like to be armed with knowledge before asking him about these big life choices. I’m the type of person who over researches decisions - almost to a fault sometimes. The benefit is I’m pretty frugal and leave shit in my cart for a long time to figure out if I really need it. 

I would like to buy a house, however where I live the cost of living is nuts. My rent is currently 4k for my 2 bedroom. I live with my girlfriend and she pays 1500 while I pay 2500 a month. 

A 20% downpayment would typically be somewhere around 200k if I was lucky 🤣😭. I know there’s some first time home buyer stuff that could help me out but I would also like to not drain myself completely upon getting a home. I’ve ramped up my savings goals this year to try to have 300k in savings, while still contributing max to my SEP, in 4 years. Obviously this depends on how well business is but I have visibility through 2019.

Anyways, that’s a decent snap shot of my savings, retirement, and housing situation. Is my best option to just continue to research stocks and open a taxable account? Should I slap a fat amount of it into an ETF? Should I just keep hoarding it until I have enough to buy a house in my area? Halp.",finance

personalfinance,Accidentally Paid Off a Car Loan. Options?,"Not a throw away, because whatever.

Tl;dr Accidentally paid off auto loan. Lender now says in order to reopen account I'll be charged a late fee, sent to collections and have credit score dinged.

I recently sent a payment intended for my credit card provider to my auto loan provider by accident. The payment had the unintended consequence of paying off my auto loan in full, and then some.

The auto loan has a very reasonable interest rate, so while we can afford to pay it off, we can make more money simply by having that cash liquid. 

I called the loan provider (Nissan Motor Acceptance Corp) and explained my error. It took them a while to figure out how / if they would be able to reopen my account. Apparently this doesn't happen every day *shocker*.

In order to reopen my account under my old terms they asked for a copy of my bank statement showing the debit from my account for the amount of money that was sent to them in error. We had a brief chat about confidentiality and ultimately landed on the painful process of me having to redact every other debit / credit on the statement before sending to them.

As we were wrapping the call up, the NMAC rep mentioned they would be refunding me in full the amount of money I paid. I asked them to instead refund me the erroneous payment minus what was owed on the car that month. They stated they could not do that.

So I asked the obvious question; how would my payment not be considered late then? Their response - it would be considered late, late fees would be applied, my account would be sent to collections and my credit score would be negatively impacted by an undetermined amount.

As a loyal NMAC customer who has paid on time, every time for 3+ years, not exactly what I wanted to hear. For the privilege of having them reactivate my account I get:

* charged interest on the remaining balance until I pay it off in full
* charged a late fee even though the payment was not late
* sent to collections as if my payment was delinquent
* my credit score dinged

At this point, weighing whether to simply let them keep the cash and be done with it or deciding of the value of the cash on hand is worth items 1-4 above.

What I really want is for them to simply reopen my account, not charge me a late fee, not throw me to collections, not ding my credit score and I will happily pay interest on the remaining balance for the foreseeable future.  Too much to ask?",finance
personalfinance,Seeking Help for Paying Student Loans,"I've read a couple of the stories on here about this community helping out with student loans among other things. I'm coming in with a lot of questions because my first payment is coming up in about a month. I was only a part time student during my last semester of school so the grace period had already begun even though I was still paying for housing, school supplies, etc., so I haven't been able to save much. I live with my parents now so that helps, but I'm also working at a startup that doesn't pay too well and am also paying about $150 a month for a leased car.

I have about $30,000 in loans that range from 3.7&amp;#37; to 4.5&amp;#37; fixed interest rates. The standard plan is to pay about $300 a month for 10 years which would accrue about $7000 in interest.

I'm currently not able to make these payments unless I just don't eat or go out at all but I would go absolutely insane. My parents can help pay for the loans starting off, but I'm expected to take over eventually (sooner than later).

What are some strategies or tips that I should consider? Is it recommended to just go with the standard payment plan or is there a better way? If I somehow had the means to pay off the entire $30,000 in one payment, is that best or is it smarter to do monthly payments?

As above - I have a 10K Emergency fund that I want to keep liquid; accessible within a week to ten days (I do have cc's that I pay off every month or don't use frequently, to cover any immediate emergency expense, and want to be able to pay it off when the statement is available or earlier).

Reading through reddit - most posts suggest keeping in a High Yield Savings Account. I see high yield savings accounts being talked about here on Reddit (Ally, Amex and a few others) paying in the range of 1.6-1.8% APY. Most other savings accounts pay far less. I don't know if there's anything I'm missing - are there HYSA's paying upwards of 3-5%?

If not - I'm seeing specific checking accounts that pay a lot more; there are qualifying requirements, but I can handle those.

Lake Michigan Credit Union offers 3% on balances upto 15K

Blue Federal CU offers between 2% to 4% on balances upto 15K; unfortunately the higher rates require having many more services with them and a long history, so more likely to get 2%

Consumer CU offers 3.09% on balances upto 10K; you do have 2 higher tiers, but those need additional spend on their credit card, still working through the math (credit card rewards on other cards vs spending on this card).

So far that I've seen, I can manage the requirements for these (electronic statements ; login online; 10-15 debit card transactions.); so seems in my case, to be a better option than the HYSA.

What am I missing? Are there any gotchas? Or if there's a better option than one of these, would appreciate a heads up.

retirement,FOR BETTER OR WORSE,"As Buddha told us - “ Whatever you shall do, for good or evil, you shall inherit it”

Sounds much like “what goes around comes around,  you reap what you sow,  etc.

My retirement experience has not been smooth.   I am a professional, worked hard for 40+ years.  I happened (not by purpose) to always work in governmental posts, so while not reaping as large of financial rewards as other paths would offer I did secure lifetime full health coverage (me and spouse) and a decent fixed income (defined benefit) pension.   I receive SSI, plus three different government pensions, totaling about $130,000 per year.   An investment income of that amount would require almost $3,000,000 in account.  I am a lousy saver and never ever would have been able to accumulate that much.  So I am very lucky and grateful, and do not have to “die at my desk” or operating theatre.

But since I retired 5 years ago it has been a bit rough.   I spent 3 years fully expecting the phone to ring every day.  After all.  I was important (or so I thought).  How could “they” live without bringing me back to consult.  Turns out that I should have read “The Long Gray Line” and taken it to heart.

Next was arresting spending habits.  In the last 20 years of work never a year passed that I did not exceed $300,000 in annual income.   I love to travel, and maintained a home in California (with horses) and a home in Bangkok (my wife is a U.S citizen and Thai national).  My idea was (a) to slow down spending; (b) sell out in the U.S. and retire in Thailand.   I arrested spending (not nearly enough) and got a Thai retirement residency.  Then my plans unraveled.

The first “bomb” was State and Federal tax.  My income was always so high I never saved for taxes (other than deductions).  I had no deductions taken from my pensions.  Suddenly I owed about $20,000 in tax with no extra funds to cover.   Then inflation (gas prices, utilities, insurance premiums etc.) started to way outrun “inflation” increases to my pensions.  So now I am living “paycheck to paycheck) because I cannot get ahead of the curve.   And Thailand?   My wife’s mother and two sisters live in my house (ok with me -I like them and it is a big house!    But my wife decided she will live in the U.S only. Too much noise, traffic and hassle in Thailand.    I have not abandoned my desire to retire there, but hopes are dim.   Of course hanging out at the pubs with my Brit buddies in Bangkok did’t help my case.  Darts and women can cloud the picture.

* I like the idea of (quasi) passive income generation through rentals. If I bought, I would prefer a duplex, or triplex. I’d live in one unit, and rent out the other(s). However, duplexes and triplexes are rare in my area.

* Most single family houses that appeal to me are in the $250k-275k range (on Zillow). However, I would love to find something in the $175k-225k range.

* I’m interested in retiring early (age 55 or younger).

* Not married, but have a partner. No kids.

Currently renting a house for $1100/month. Buying a $250k house would be about $1200/month with 20% down (including taxes and insurance). Decent apartments are $900 – 1000/month.
I don’t know where I’ll be in five years. Either in my current city in the U.S. Or, living in a house my partner inherited in Europe. (Partner is EU citizen and currently living in EU; I’m U.S. We’d be married if I moved to Europe. Selling or renting out the house in Europe is not an option.) If I bought a house in the U.S., and later moved to Europe, I would plan on renting out the house. This would likely be done through a property manager.

Financially I can afford to buy a house. However, I’ve never had a strong desire to do so. I’ve heard that buying a house is generally a good idea if you are planning on retiring early. The reason being it can be hard to secure a mortgage if you’re not working. If I do retire early, my plan is to travel non-stop for a decade plus. So, I’m not tied down to anyone place and would be willing to live in low-cost areas.

At the risk of oversimplifying things I’d say that I view houses as depreciating assets, but the property the house is on can be an appreciating asset. However, I am starting to feel a bit of FOMO in not buying a house. Interest rates are low, and houses in Boise are relatively inexpensive compared to many other mountain towns with great access to the outdoors.

I don’t know where I’ll be in five years. Either in my current city in the U.S. Or, living in a house my partner inherited in Europe. (Partner is EU citizen and currently living in EU; I’m U.S. We’d be married if I moved to Europe. Selling or renting out the house in Europe is not an option.) If I bought a house in the U.S., and later moved to Europe, I would plan on renting out the house. This would likely be done through a property manager.

Financially I can afford to buy a house. However, I’ve never had a strong desire to do so. I’ve heard that buying a house is generally a good idea if you are planning on retiring early. The reason being it can be hard to secure a mortgage if you’re not working. If I do retire early, my plan is to travel non-stop for a decade plus. So, I’m not tied down to anyone place and would be willing to live in low-cost areas.

At the risk of oversimplifying things I’d say that I view houses as depreciating assets, but the property the house is on can be an appreciating asset. However, I am starting to feel a bit of FOMO in not buying a house. Interest rates are low, and houses in Boise are relatively inexpensive compared to many other mountain towns with great access to the outdoors.

I’m interested in reading any perspective, or insight you are willing to share.

Thank you.",finance
personalfinance,"26, high savings rate, how to invest?","I'm an expat living in Michigan, USA. My monthly take-home pay after taxes is $6,250. My essential expenses (rent, utilities, groceries, etc) are about $2,000/month - the weather probably is the biggest cause of any fluctuations since it affects my power and gas bills. As a result I'm able to save a ridiculously large portion of my take-home pay every month. 

I just discovered that I have managed to save about $63k over the last 12 months (including performance bonus and tax refund). I expect to hit at least $100k in savings by the middle of next year. At the same time, I also realize that leaving all this money in my BoA savings account with its pathetic interest rate is a dumb way to go. So I'm looking to start investing my savings ASAP.

I would like to have at least $40k in liquid cash readily accessible for a rainy day, while investing the rest. I am a total noob at stocks, mutual funds, etc - I do have a mutual fund in my home country with annual returns of 5-10% but that's it. 

Any advice on safe investments would be much appreciated. One important point is that these investments need to be easily accessible from outside the USA, as I plan to leave the country when my visa expires in 2020. Therefore things like 401ks are not ideal.",finance
personalfinance,Should I withdraw from my retirement to pay off credit card debt?,"I am 25 and have been steady at my current job for about 3 years now. I have about $12,000 in my retirement account. Thanks to some recent medical mishaps and lifestyle changes (kids), I have recently accumulated about $10k in credit card debt, and the payments are becoming too much of a monthly burden. I feel I am still young enough to take a hit on my retirement account in order to save myself the interest on these credit cards. I don't really want to wipe out my retirement, but at this point in my life it seems to make more sense than dealing with the high interest rates of a credit card.

financialindependence,Give up Canadian government job with a fat pension to move to the southern states for endless summer?,"I’m a 28yo duel US/CAN citizen living in Alberta, Canada. I’ve always lived in Canada. Recently, I’ve been having the urge to look into moving to the southern states. My father lives in Florida so this could be an option. 
 However, I’ve got myself a really promising career here making 86,000-100,000+ grand (Canadian) a year depending on OT. In addition to this I have a very good federal government pension and benefits. Currently I will be able to retire at age 52 with a full pension. In my mind at 52 you’re still a spring chicken! I really value this about my career. It provides a great peace of mind as does the fact that I’m in a position where I have literally 0 concerns about losing my job. 
However, as I said I’ve been really interested in moving south. Canadian winters are long and depressing. Not to mention the cost of living in Canada is getting more and more unreasonable for what you get in return. The dollar here continues to fall more and more. Taxes keep going up. I’m not here to shit on Canada but I’m a bit concerned about the future up here. That being said I have already looked into what I would make in the states in my field and it is considerably less, even when taking into account the exchange rate. 
I’m currently single with no kids. No idea if I even want a lifelong relationship or kids. In total I have about 40k invested in index funds. Beyond this I don’t own much but don’t owe either. 
I’ve made rash decisions in the past so I would like some other folks perspective. As much as I long for endless summer and to spend lazy days fishing in the sun down south, it is very difficult to think about giving up the career I’ve spend my entire 20s building towards. I COULD also always just be patient and wait until it’s time to retire to move south. 
Has anyone been in a similar position? How’d it go? Let me know what you think.

personalfinance,Using line of credit to assist in paying credit card debt,"Hi PF,

So I'm a new young doctor about to start residency.  My wife and I bought a house in our city, and the mortgage company offered me a $15,000 line of credit.  It has a low interest rate, around 4%.  My credit card has a 22% interest rate, for reference.

Applying to residency was expensive.  I had to fly all over the country, sometimes on short notice, and pay for hotels, food, uber/rental car etc.  Long story short, I amassed $10k in credit card debt during this process.  Luckily my credit score was strong enough for our house buying process, but it definitely took a hit.

The line of credit has a length of 5 years.  During the first three years I am required to only pay interest, which will come out to be about $60/month.  During the last two years the bank will split the remaining balance out to monthly payments.

So I intend to move all of my credit card debt over to this line of credit.  I will make $300 monthly payments on the line of credit which will eliminate the debt before the final two years.  There are no penalties for paying it off early.  **Doing this will save me roughly $2500 in credit card interest.**  I do not have enough liquid assets to pay off the debt and keep my emergency fund.

It seems safe and straight forward to me, but I have never done this before and am wondering if there are things I'm not considering.

Thanks guys.",finance

personalfinance,29 and unsure where to invest/harbor savings,"Hello everyone,

I would definitely appreciate any help and/or guidance.  I have frequented this subreddit and tried to do my own independent research, but I still feel very novice in terms of finances and I am concerned about making a poor financial move.

I am currently maxing out my annual 401k contributions as well as annual Roth IRA contributions.  After taxes and contributions to 401k/roth, I bring in just under $6k a month and usually have $3k left over after living expenses (rent, insurance, internet, food, gas, etc.).  I currently have around $75k in savings (Bofa) and have no debt.  Only large expense I anticipate within the near future would be purchasing a used car (possibly end of this year or early next year).  Otherwise, I hope to purchase a property (condo/house) within the next several years.

I feel as though I am losing money by letting my savings sit with Bofa due to the low interest rates.  So, I have considered options such as putting a portion of it into vanguard index funds (my roth is with vanguard), opening an ally savings account and transferring there, or opening a merrill edge account through Bofa.  My lack of knowledge in this area has me slightly concerned about how liquid my money would be and tax implications.

Any thoughts on how I should best utilize my existing/future savings?  Any help or recommended reading would be greatly appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,"Stressed out with questions about my current debt plan, any help welcome","Ok so a tiny bit of background: I manage my family's finances. I barely know what I'm doing but we're slowly climbing up.

We moved from Florida-TN last year, and have since paid off 3800$ of debt using a chunk of our tax return. We're almost out of medical debt and we own both cars. I've discovered the Snowball method of debt reduction and I want to give that a try so I've compiled all of our debt. A rough look is as follows:

I have 11k in student loans, we have 1 credit card (Just sent in the payment to finish off a closed card, yay!) one hospital bill and a remaining balance on our renters ins.

from lowest to highest:

Hospital- 70$

SL1- 128$

Renters- 224$

Credit Card-397$

SL2-622$

SL3-2177$

SL4-2200$

SL5-2800$

SL6-3521$

It is important to note that as of right now we're paying 0$/month on the loans, as per my IDR plan. Everything is current. We put out about 1039$/month in bills, as well as about 600$/month in food and an additional 200$+ for household stuff. Roughly 100 in gas every 2 weeks.

We've been doing pretty well, I've cut out every non essential bill, we don't eat out and we're on a keto diet so we are eating the healthiest we've ever ate. First year of marriage too lol.

If I follow the Snowball method we'd pay off the littlest bills first, I'd ignore the SL's except for the one we're working on. Renter's is a yearly bill that's only 2 months in so we'd have another 10 months until that bill came back around. Our goal is to buy a house in the next 2 years, so this debt has to go.

Concerns/Questions: If we pay money towards the SL's while my payment plan says 0 will it kick me off the plan? Does all of my money go to the amount owed or is interest still in play there?

SL 1-3 have an interest rate of 4.4&amp;#37;, 4-6 are 3.6&amp;#37;. I'm horrible at math so it's really a wonder I've made it this far. If i pay off the little ones first will I suffer later with the higher one's interest rates?

personalfinance,Advice Appreciated,"Good afternoon and Happy Father's Day,

I've been a member of /personalfinance for some time now and have enjoyed the insight gained from this community. I'm in my mid-20's and finally decided to get my shit together and start living like a responsible adult. Like many others on this forum, I made some poor financial decisions in my younger years that I'm just now stepping up to the plate to rectify.

Long-story short, I'm thinking about taking out a small loan $5,000 in total, to pay off several small debts and get back on track. I'm lucky enough to have a decent income ($2700/month) for my area however my finances are still tight. Due to the high interest rates on the credit cards and a couples accounts in collections, I'm hoping a lower-interest rate would help me get out of these debts and lower my monthly payments. I'm wondering if anyone in this community thinks this is seems like a good idea given the following expenses:

Rent: $550

Student Loan Payment: Remaining balance of $59k - monthly payments of $320 (currently behind 2 months)

Electric: $25 (average)

Internet: $20/mo

Car Insurance: $118/mo

Car Payment: $380/mo (remaining balance of $6800 - 1.5 years left on the loan) (yeah, this loan sucks, I know)

Cell Phone (\~140/month)

Credit Card #1: Remaining balance of $1053.00 (Making monthly payments of $98) at 18.3&amp;#37; APR

Credit Card #2: Remaining balance of \~$700 (making payments of $74/month) at 16.60&amp;#37; APR

~~Credit Card #3: Balance of $670~~ (Paid off)

Credit Card #4: Balance of $480 (monthly payments of $54)

Small Private Student Loan: Remaining balance of $4300 (monthly payments of $80)

Collection Account #1: Balance remaining $234.00 (monthly payments of $56 at 14.2&amp;#37; APR)

Collection Account #2: Balance remaining of $94

Essentially what I want to do is take out a small loan to pay off my Credit Card balances, both accounts in collections, and get caught back up on my student loans. This would reduce my monthly payments of around $300 to \~$152 with a $5k loan (the minimum with Citizens Bank) at an APR of 7.2&amp;#37; based on a three-year term. Would this be a good idea?

I want to stop the bleeding in my credit report and close out my accounts in collections so I can get caught back up on my bills and start to get ahead and rebuild my credit. I have already reduced much of my spending so nothing that is unnecessary is purchased other than gas and groceries. I have also just acquired a secured Credit Card with a limit of $200 and I keep that paid off every month to help with my credit utilization and timely payments.

 However, the last few months my expenses have exceeded my income and I can no longer afford to live paycheck-to-paycheck. Once my car is fully paid off next year I will have a lot more breathing room as well, however I have also considered refinancing my car loan as well.

I appreciate any and all advice in this forum, I realize my past decisions have kind of hindered my current status but I look forward to the day I can become fiscally independent and back on track.",finance

personalfinance,25 y/o from Argentina with $50k in savings. Looking for investment advice.,"I am looking for advice on what could be my best options for growing my assets.
My goal would be to 20 or 30 years in the future find myself with stable income. Assets shielded from inflation rates. A steady basic income from some rent, and be able to live and work in what I like. The equivalent to current day $2k/mo for rent would be more than adequate, but I don't think would be achievable (the goal of that rent would be to remove the burden of a single work-dependant household income)

A bit of boring context first:
I will write all money amounts in the equivalent US dollars for the sake of simplicity.
I live in Argentina, which has an insane and unpredictable inflation rate. Around 1% to 2% a month if you are lucky.
I am studying towards an engineering degree in a university, and I am also working. 

With tese next two things I wanted to explain why these usually important topics in most posts here, don't i fluence much in my case.
I have no debt and will finish university without debt - the ""best"" education is ""free"", tax-payed here - .
Good healthcare is also ""free"", but great healthcare can be cheap. In my particular case I have an unusually cheap healthcare and spend $30/mo, which covers for any likely thing that could happen to me health wise.

I bought some bitcoins a few years ago. Short version: I sold after the 20k ath. With that I bought a small old apartment at 70% of its real value which I partially restored mostly investing time and little to no money. I am renting this apartment, for which I get $250/mo . I bought the apartement for $40k, and I can sell it now for $60k if I wanted to.

A good big household for a middle class 4 person family is between $100k to $250k , rent of such a house could be around $700/mo. I live with my parents, we are middle class and they own their house.

If a middle class 4 people family owns their house and have no debts, they can live ok and still mostly have 40% of savings with $2k or $3k household income.

I work part-time - 80 hours a month - and get to save around $1.5k/mo after expenses (I spend at most $200/mo on myself even going out to dinner twice a week, and living with my parents is really cheap).
My savings are on the $50k mark and have no reference of what to do with it.

 I have part of that in physical us bills.

I own a small 10 years old car worth $5k here.

No, this is not a standard case for a middle class 25 male in Argentina. Most of my friends, with same backgrounds and education, get little savings and at most get 1k for a full-time job with a degree.
I realize I am extremely lucky and while my family is not wealthy, we are thankful for what we got. 

(End of boring context)

 I'd like to hear advice on how to make my assets grow in my particular circumstances. I don't have much knowledge about interest rates, and I know most of the stuff I saw recommended on this sub don't apply to my county or situation. Also, against what most countries experience, it's not that common for houses go down in value here.
The type of advice I get in my inner circles is people telling me to get a new car, which I don't see the worth doing yet. I would indulge in some travelling though.
Any advice on the matter or reading material you would recommend are welcomed. I am looking for places to learn how to make wise financial decisions as well.

Sorry for the -probably unnecessarily-  long post.

*Current Financial Situation*

* Age: 25
* Job: Systems Analyst for a tech company
* Income: 79k before taxes, ~54 after taxes, health insurance, and other 401k contributions
* Credit Score: 790
* Checking/Savings: ~12k split across the two accounts. 
* Debt: ~9.5k remaining in student loan debt (down from 33k when I graduated 2 years ago.) Currently paying off the minimum $150 each month as I'm only accumulating about $16 in interest in total each month. My highest interest rate loan is ~3.1% and it's got about 3.8k left on it
* Roth 401: ~24k (My employer matches 6% and I contribute 6% of my bi-weekly paycheck)
* IRA: $300 (I plan to contribute more in the future)

* Rent: I live by myself and pay $1400 for a 1 bedroom apartment in a Medium CoL city. Yes, I could be paying less, but I live 10 minutes walking from work and I don't own a car, so I figured I have some leeway here
* My only real expenses each month outside of Rent are food, utilities, and the upfront tuition I have to pay for my Master's Degre. I don't own or have the need for a car, have no major medical issues, and don't plan to move outside my current city in the next 3-5 years.

As mentioned above, I'm currently pursuing a Master's in Data Analytics that is being 80% reimbursed for by my employer. After all is said and done, I'll have paid ~7k for the program over the course of 2 1/2 years. This is my primary reason as to why I haven't used some of the 12k I have in checking/savings to pay down my remaining loans.

As for future plans, I have 0 desire to ever have kids (and before you mention that I may change my mind, I'm pretty set in stone in the fact that I never want to have a kid) but would love to travel more and eventually buy townhouse, condo, or house within the next 6ish years.

I’m currently working a full time job, 12/hr with paid life and health insurance. Most weeks I get a little overtime, and once harvest hits this fall I’ll be working close to 100-120 hours a week, so overtime will be awesome.

I am 18 don’t have much credit but I do have a way around that.

I’m currently living in a POS trailer house that is falling apart at the seams.

Considering I own a farm and this house is in the country and has some grain bins, I can count it as my farm’s “headquarters” and get a loan from the FSA (Farm service agency) with no down payment and an interest rate of around 4-4.5%.

I live in a very rural community in Kansas so my expenses aren’t a lot, except for my insurance because of my age and a couple speeding tickets (apparently needing to poop isn’t a valid excuse for going 90 in a 55).

personalfinance,Thoughts on securities-backed loans?,"I’ve got a big home remodel coming up and need to get some cash together. I can sell stock and cover the expenses, but a lot of those shares have been appreciating for a long time and there will be a big tax hit.  So I’m thinking of using cash and some stock but with a loan to carry most of the weight.  The standard route is a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC), but while searching for lenders, I came across the idea of a securities-backed loan. 

Securities-backed loans (SBL — *my abbreviation*) are loans offered by a brokerage with your investments as collateral. The risk is that if the value of your account drops substantially due to a large market downturn, your loan could get called in and you’d be forced to sell stock at a bad time. 

But if the terms for an SBL are substantially better than that for a HELOC, it seems to me to be a reasonable option.  In the worst case situation, if a significant market downturn happened, I could slow-play the remodel, cover the loan with some combination of stock and cash and maybe even a HELOC. 

What do people think?  Has anyone used an SBL?  Does anyone have an idea of how the interest rates compare between these and HELOCs?  Are any brokerages known for being better for these?

To put some numbers behind all this, my primary brokerage account is worth around $1 mil, the house is worth $1.5 mil, and the loan would be for about $300k.",finance

I wasnt taught much about money in high school). The issue is, my parents have pretty bad credit and were denied pretty much instantly as co signers. 

My college offers a loan program that the parents take and pay like 500 a month for. The problem is, is thats over one of my mothers pay checks, and I really really don't want to do that to her. She'd have to get a second job and she's just getting to old to do that. My father is on disability and takes care of my disabled brother as well, but they still need my mother at home. So this is kind of just a last resort.

Anyways

*I am not asking for a co signer* I just want to know, is there any other kind of loan or way I can get some money? I need a couple thousand, too much to earn by July 10th, which is our dead line for the parent loan signing thing through the college. 

We only checked out the one place for loans, and I'm sure there are millions more, are there any you guys recommend? I was going to look into another federal loan in the morning, but I'd like to know what other options I may have. I don't want to start paying these loans back until after I graduate so my parents don't have this burden on them. 

Thank you for your time and any help you may offer!


*Edit* 
Thank you guys for all your input, I've taken it all into thought these past couple sleepless nights but everything has been settled this morning without putting me in crippling debt. Any fellow college students reading this, my advice is have a almost hour long call with your admission councillor and apply for those 1,000 dollar scholarships, they save your ass more than you can image. My out of pocket cost has been reduced to barely 500, which my family can manage. Thank you guys for your time.",finance
personalfinance,Buying a condo in San Diego a worthwhile investment?,"I’m a military member moving to San Diego soon and was wondering if buying a condo is a worthwhile investment. All of the 1 bedroom condos that I’m interested in are priced around 400-450k. I have reservations simply because they are priced so high and I don’t want to be in a bad position if the condo is worth less and I need to sell when I transfer in a few years. I would be a first time buyer with an income of about 74k gross a year(2350$ a month BAH is non taxable) Also I would be using the VA loan with 5% down payment and 4.2% fixed interest rate.

investing,Investing using Edward jones vs. not investing at all,"I’m truly not interested in learning the stock market but was approached some time ago by an EJ rep. I had worked as an overnight janitor for an EJ office and loved how clean they were, the plants they kept, and this overall pleasant feeling the building offered I thought it would be a good idea. 

I’m auto-paying $50 per month right now so the account is worth about $1600 after 1.5 years. Again, I’m not interested in actually playing the stocks myself which is why I thought it could be a good idea to just let this guy who is in the stock profession work for me. 

Recently I learned how much money they actually take from you as far as fees and earnings percentages go and am not stoked on the idea anymore. 

Do I take my $1600 out and call it a good run in the market for the time being or try a different route?

Also note, still paying $12000 in college debt and $13500 on a personal loan (with 10% interest rate) that I got to pay off credit card debts.",finance

personalfinance,"Made Terrible Financial Decisions Moving Out of My Mother's House at 20. Now, I'm Overwhelmed By My Debt at 21","I'll start by saying I lived in an abusive household  for 20 years of my life. I was kicked out in April of 2017 along with my younger sibling. With the money I had saved up, I bought a car. Despite our better judgment, we moved back in with our mother after she both begged and threatened us to come back to the house. We promised each other save up and leave together by the end of the year.

My car died. Tensions got high and I absolutely to leave. My sibling did not save up as promised and I made the decision to get out last August.

I was afriad of having another car die on me and wanted to get something newer and from an established dealership. I took out a car loan from lending tree and used the part of what was left of my savings to put a down payment on a car. I now know that I essentially put down the car's blue book value, and I'm going to end up paying a lot more than what the car is worth. I didn't realize that the payments were going to be bi-monthly until we finally got to the paper work. I naively decided to sign anyway and thought that I would be okay. 

I signed a lease with 4 other people and moved into a house. At the time my math worked out. I would've been fine working 20 hours a week at 8.30/hr coupled with the money that I got back from financial aid. However, I allowed my bipolar, PTSD, and anxiety to go unchecked.

I've retroactively learned that my manic episodes manifest as spending sprees and periods in my life where I feel like I ""deserve"" a certain item or items and consistently ""treat"" myself. I would also spend money on my close friends--mostly on food/takeout. Most, if not all, of these purchases were made on my credit cards.

In addition to racking up my credit card I was spending money in my checking account recklessly.

By fall 2017 I was working 2 jobs to ensure that I was able to make my car payments. I severely neglected my school work. An incident involving my mother and younger sibling triggered my PTSD. I was hospitalized shortly after.

By this time I was living paycheck to paycheck as I had exhausted all of my funds through my reckless behavior/habits. I didn't work for nearly 2 weeks. It was a huge hit. Shortly after my release, I was fired from one of my jobs for inconsistent attendance over the past couple of months. That was a devastating hit. 

Going into the new year, I thought I would be able to make it until my financial reimbursement for the upcoming semester. Then I found out that my aid was suspended. I completely flunked my semester so I wasn't too surprised but it was still another blow.  I was given the chance to appeal, however, I sat on it and decided that I deserved this and that there would be no point in an appeal (very very poor mindset and decision making right here).

By this time my younger sibling was staying with me and my roommates, and I needed assistance  paying my rent and my car note. It was a low. In March of this year, I was able to get a second job. Additionally, I recieved my tax returns which went towards unpayed bills and paying back people for helping me out so that couldn't be saved up.

I owe my university more than 3,400 dollars due to my financial aid being suspended. I've also been notified that I will have to start paying back my aid being this September.

Here's my issue now:

I got fired from my new secondary job. I was only able to save 250 from close to 3 months working there. My roommates bailed on renewing our lease which is up July 31st. So, now I need to find housing. My only saving grace right now is that my younger sibling is willing to help me out financially and has agreed to find a place with me. 

I've been applying for jobs since I was fired in May with no luck. I was able to get my current job to give me more hours but it's 8.50/hr and just isn't enough to pay my bills and save. 

Car: 150 bi-weekly APR is 18% my down payment was 4,400. The total sale price is 15,863 on a 2006 honda (If I don't make my payments they can disable my car.)

Best Buy Visa: I got this card while I was still living with my mother. There was a promotion. We bought a household computer and I got a personal laptop. There would be no interest charged if the card was payed off my the following year. That did not happen. This March, I was about 100 dollars below the card's limit when I was hit with a 650 interest charge. Bringing my card balance to 4,500, and increasing my monthly minimum to 150

The APR is 26.74%

Lending Club: Loan of 4,200

Interest rate is 19.03% and ARP is 23.58%

My monthly payments are 154.02


Rent: 260

Utilities: 50 to 70

Car Insurance: 120.52 (this has since lapsed and I honestly can't afford to even renew it)

Water: 80 quarterly 

Target Card: 55 monthly, balance is 1,621
Interest rate is 20.9%

The bills that I've listed above total to almost 1000 a month. I'm not counting food, gas, ect

I JUST started working 35 hours a week 8.50/hr. But there is no guarentee that it will stay this way. I'm still hunting for another job that will hopefully get me up to 50 hours a week and pay slightly more. I've been able to hold on to my 250.

My credit score is 650 right now. However, I've received a collections notice on a medical bill and I skipped my Best Buy bill to pay for my car. I also have more medical bills that still need to be payed off but I've honestly been afraid to look at them. I have a feeling it's going to take a dive. 

I'm also apartment hunting in the midst of all of this. My sibling and I at this moment do not have enough money to pay first months rent plus a deposit let alone the 20 to 50 dollar application fee for more than one complex. On top of that, there are credit checks that I'm afraid I won't pass and I don't have anyone who could co-sign. 

I'm just lost. I've made so many mistakes and it feels like I'm being swallowed whole. I attempted suicide after the stress of losing my job and my mother showing up unannounced to my house and refusing to leave until my roommate threatened to call the police. I'm happy I still woke up the next morning. I realize that there is a small network of people who love me, and I love them. My problems are temporary.

I'm very new to reddit and this thread. I apologize if I overshared or if I'm leaving out vital information. I also understand treatment of my mental illness would help a lot. I was going stong after my release from the hospital but everything hit me at once. Plus I didn't and still do not have health insurance so I felt like I had to let that go. I've looked at insurance plans based off of my income and age but the premiums were almost 200 and I missed the deadline for Medicaid open enrollment.

I feel like I'm stuck between working enough hours to pay my bills and carving out time (and money) for doctor's visits and therapy. 


I want to be able to do at least 4 things within the next 2 years:

Receive treatment/therapy for my mental health 

Go back to school

Save 1,000+

Pay off my Target card, Best Buy Visa, or my Lending Club loan


I don't know if this is a reasonable goal but I hope I can achieve something.

At that time, I’ll have about $5,500 left on the loan. I have about $4,000 already allocated towards it, so meeting that early payoff goal shouldn’t be an issue. My question is - given that it’s 2 years until I will be making the payment, is this money better allocated in an investment account or left in my bank account?

Over 2 years, I’d likely just invest in the S&amp;P index or split it between a few blue chips with dividends. Just curious what others would do.

After spending 8 hours at the dealership I walked away with a car I didn't really want (but it was a running car, 2017, etc) and a hefty payment because my interest rate was 19%. To do this, I scraped up everything I could find to come up with a $2,000 down payment.

Fast forward to last Sunday, my car is totaled in an accident that was not my fault. Insurance will pay off the car, gap should cover the remainder, but I'm at a lost.

personalfinance,Grandpa left me American Bonds. How does this work?,"In the 1990's my grandpa left me a $250 United States Savings Bond for ""Series EE"".

I'm interested in cashing them in soon, but I don't know how the process works, and how much interest they have gained since the 90's.

I brought the coupon/bill things to my local bank, but they said that they have ""never seen this before"", and couldn't help me. It's a small bank, and they usually don't know what they are doing.  so I began doing my own research.

I checked [https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/products/prod\_eebonds\_glance.htm](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/products/prod_eebonds_glance.htm)

According to the site:

\&gt; Current rate: 0.10&amp;#37; for bonds issued May-October 2018&gt; Issue method: Electronic, in TreasuryDirect

So it gains 0.10&amp;#37; per year? Or does it fluctuate? Are we in a low, or in some sort of high for it?   It seems to me like 0.10&amp;#37; per year since the bonds were issues would only profit by $2 from the original value, despite inflation?  Is that correct?  Or is the interest rate as it was in the early 90's?

It doesn't say it anywhere on these coupon thingies, so how do I find out the interest rates?

Because these are physical bonds left over from the 90's, am I still able to cash them in, despite the issue method moving to Electronic?

Also, can I cash in an American bond if I am an American citizen currently living abroad?  Is it subject to federal income tax (and foreign income tax) even if I am a poor student with no income? How do I do that?

I'm still very new to all this, but I think it's really cool the one thing my grandfather wanted to teach before his passing was investing. Hopefully this isn't too complicated!

Through some unexpected turmoil in the last 3 years, my wife and I used our emergency funds, savings, sold off a bunch of our assets, and had to put too much stuff on our credit cards, more than either of us are comfortable with carrying.  The turmoil is all over now, (I had to make a few sudden cross country moves for my career, got married, and had a kid all in rapid succession but now I'm on a stable track) and I'm looking to put things back together.

We can pay our bills and have some left over, so I'm going to stay above water, thanks in no small part to advice I've gotten on this sub.  We're also setting money back into the emergency fund.  With everything else leftover, I want to knock our CC debt back down.  To that end, it occurred to me that consolidating that debt into a HELOC might be a good idea, if for no other reason because the interest rate would be substantially lower.

We've got 200k equity into our home, I'm 31, and have an extremely stable job (federal employee).  The CC debt is a little over 13k at about 16&amp;#37; APR.  Apart from our mortgage, we've got no other debts.  Is there anything I should be aware of or look out for?  Is there a better course of action than the HELOC?

personalfinance,"I cosigned, now should I sign the quit claim?","I helped cosign for a family friend’s mother so she could refinance two loans for two houses because she wanted to get her ex-husband off the loan. She has owned both houses for 15 years, there is $200k of equity in each of the houses. They have had renters in the homes for the past 15 years who pay the mortgage. I trust that they should be able to pay the mortgage because they have been doing so regularly for the past 15 years. I have put no money into the houses, and have no interest in getting any profit from it. I only received 2k from her for being a cosigner.  Initially when I cosigned back at the end of 2015 she said she can get me off of the loans in 2 years.

Now it’s been 2.5 years, she plans to have either her kids or new husband cosign a refinance with her, but at this time she doesn’t want to refinance because the interest rates are too high.  Now she is asking me to sign a quitclaim and promises to get me off the loans once the interest rates go down.

I am not worried about her not being able to pay the mortgage. I have also spoken with loan officers who stated that if she provides proof that she has been the only one paying the mortgage or if she provides the rental information that it shouldn’t affect my income-debt ratio when I plan to get my own loan. She does a lot of real estate with renting and flipping houses. She told me the loans should be good for my credit because it shows I have consistent payment on the loans.

When I told her I don’t feel comfortable signing it she got upset and said she will just refinance despite the high interest rate. She has a history of severe anxiety, so I don’t think she feels comfortable with me being on the title. I feel bad not signing it because now she feels the need to refinance, and this would negatively affect her. I also feel guilty because everyone keeps telling me it’s not harming me being on the loan, and that being on it would help my build my credit. I’m worried about how not signing it would negatively affect our relationship. Now I'm thinking about just signing it, she said she would give me another 2k to sign it. My question is if you would sign the quitclaim in this situation.

Edit: I told her I will sign the quit claim when she refiances to get me off the loans. She said she will refiance one of the loans, but plans to just pay off the second loan. She wants me to sign the quit claim for the second loan so she can just pay it off without having everything go through me.

stocks,Visualizing the longest bull markets of the modern era,"Graph of this issue:
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Df-Pag6W4AEj8Fi.jpg


During the longest bull market in modern history, the S&amp;P 500 surged a whopping 418% over the 9.5 years between November 1990 and March 2000.


This was during the famous economic expansion that took place during the Clinton era, in which job growth was robust, oil prices fell, stocks soared, and making money was as easy as throwing it in the stock market.


In mere months, this famed bull market may lose its title as the “longest” in the modern era.


That’s because, according to data and analysis from LDL Research, the current bull market will take over the claim to fame in late August 2018.

By looking at duration, total rate of return, and annualized rate of return, it really gives a sense of how these bull markets compare.

The current run, which will soon become the longest, didn’t have the same level of intensity as other high-ranking bull markets. Critics would say that it was artificially propped up by ultra-low rates, QE, and other government actions that will make the market ultimately less robust heading forward.

Regardless, the current run ranks in fourth place among the markets above in terms of annualized return.

What Ended Each Bull?

The market psychology behind bull and bear markets can be fascinating.

Below we look at the events credited with “ending” each bull market – though of course, it is actually the actions of investors (buying or selling) that ultimately dictates market direction.

1. The Great Expansion
The bull run lasted 9.5 years, ultimately capitulating when the Dotcom Bubble burst. From the span of June 1999 and May 2000, the Fed raised interest rates six times to try and get a “soft landing”. Market uncertainty was worsened by the 9/11 attacks that occurred the year after.

2. The Post-Crisis Bull Run
Still ongoing…

3. The Post-War Boom
This boom occurred after WWII, and it ended in 1956. Some of the sources we looked at credited the launch of Sputnik, Eisenhower’s heart attack, and the Hungarian Revolution as possible sources of market fear.

4. That ’70s Growth
The Iranian Revolution, the 1979 Energy Crisis, and the return of double-digit inflation were the factors blamed for the end of this bull.

5. Reagan Era
This bull market had the highest annualized return at 26.7%, but the party came to an end on Black Monday in 1987 – one of the most infamous market crashes ever. Some of the causes cited for the crash: program trading, overvaluation, illiquidity and market psychology.

6. The Hot Aughts
Stocks did decently well during the era of cheap credit and rising housing prices. However, the Financial Crisis put an end to this growth, and would cut the DJIA from 14,000 points to below 6,600 points.

The current run, which will soon become the longest, didn’t have the same level of intensity as other high-ranking bull markets. Critics would say that it was artificially propped up by ultra-low rates, QE, and other government actions that will make the market ultimately less robust heading forward.

Regardless, the current run ranks in fourth place among the markets above in terms of annualized return.

What Ended Each Bull?

The market psychology behind bull and bear markets can be fascinating.

Below we look at the events credited with “ending” each bull market – though of course, it is actually the actions of investors (buying or selling) that ultimately dictates market direction.

    The Great Expansion The bull run lasted 9.5 years, ultimately capitulating when the Dotcom Bubble burst. From the span of June 1999 and May 2000, the Fed raised interest rates six times to try and get a “soft landing”. Market uncertainty was worsened by the 9/11 attacks that occurred the year after.

    The Post-Crisis Bull Run Still ongoing…

    The Post-War Boom This boom occurred after WWII, and it ended in 1956. Some of the sources we looked at credited the launch of Sputnik, Eisenhower’s heart attack, and the Hungarian Revolution as possible sources of market fear.

    That ’70s Growth The Iranian Revolution, the 1979 Energy Crisis, and the return of double-digit inflation were the factors blamed for the end of this bull.

    Reagan Era This bull market had the highest annualized return at 26.7%, but the party came to an end on Black Monday in 1987 – one of the most infamous market crashes ever. Some of the causes cited for the crash: program trading, overvaluation, illiquidity and market psychology.

    The Hot Aughts Stocks did decently well during the era of cheap credit and rising housing prices. However, the Financial Crisis put an end to this growth, and would cut the DJIA from 14,000 points to below 6,600 points.

personalfinance,Co-signed for a car loan.,I was dating a girl that had kids. We lived an hour from the kids school and my schedule didn’t allow me to take them. I bought a used car with cash which broke down; I decided to co-sign on a loan with her for a used 2016 Jeep Patriot with an agreement that she would take over payments when she found a job. It is financed through capital one. Principal balance is 15K with a 12% interest rate. Payments are $300 a month. I’ve been paying on the loan for approximately a year and she has yet to find employment. We have recently broke up and she has the car in her possession. What are my options here? I have proof of every payment that I have made since the car was purchased and I will continue to make payments so that it doesn’t affect my credit. What are my options here?

personalfinance,Librarians don't make much money,"... well let me rephrase that. *Public Librarians* don't make much money. I know that, and yet this is my career and I'm happy here. With this in mind, I have to figure out how to make the little money I have work for me. 

I am a 29F Librarian in NYC. I make 58k in change annually, and I have an NY State pension. I also have City Employee Healthcare ($0 per month). I get paid every two weeks, with my after-tax pay \~$1300 and \~$1421 a month after union dues and pre-tax transit pass etc.

My rent is $2600 (split-two ways, so $1300) and my other recurring bills are about $200 a month. 

This traditionally leaves me with $1200 for food, leisure/variable expenditures. I have no CC debt and I have paid off my 70k in student loans, so all of the left over money goes right into my bank account.  


This year will be my 3rd year anniversary in America, which is to say I have saved up 10k in three years, as I moved here with $300. While I could keep on being frugal, I would much rather put some of that 10k to work *for* me, though I recognize that my ""nest egg"" or whatever is very small. I have it sitting in a TD Money Market account, since it was a step up from the regular savings account. The interest rates are negligible (0.15&amp;#37;) and it is getting me nowhere.   


I am new to American financial institutions and the best way to grow your savings here (/in general). In Canada, where I'm from, I put all my money in a high-interest Tax Free Savings Account before I left, and I'm curious to know if there's something similar here.

personalfinance,Should I stay or should I go?,"Background, I have one more year left of college, and with that I have what will be a little over 125k in student loan debt. Around 30k federal and 95k in private loans.  I'm working full time at a local company that pays decently for the area. (41k is very decent for the area I live in.) Using the payment calculators it appears I will have to make payments of 1300 a month to attempt at paying off my loans on time. My rent/utilities/car payments and other bills add up to 1,600, and I only pull in around 2,400 a month after taxes.

I have a couple options, one stay at where I am in hopes I will move up into a position more in my field once I graduate and make 60k+ or two, I relocate to an area with more jobs in my field and slightly higher cost of living but be sure I will make 60k+ a year starting out.

investing,Financial advisor of 20+ years suggesting whole life insurance,"I don't know what to make of this situation. On one hand, most of my research has said that whole life insurance is really not the best way to invest, at all. You're basically just paying a huge fee to have someone else invest your money. It's safe because you don't lose money (unless you can't pay the premium), but you don't make much either, due to enormous fees. On the other hand, I have also read that if you have a financial advisor that you trust (such as one who has been with the family for a long time, which ours has been), and have a large amount of money that you are initially putting into the policy (which we would be),  it could be good because the returns  pay for the premium and it could very well be a decent way to have passive income in 3-5 years. 

I am a total noob when it comes to handling large amounts of money, and know close to nothing about investing. Our financial advisor handled the family's money in such a way that my grandmother's end of life round the clock care (which ended up being for like 15 years) was completely taken care of, with quite a bit of money left over. I don't know how he did it, but I do know that she didn't start out with enough money to cover the exorbitant cost of round the clock care for 15 years. So he hasn't done anything to indicate that he is not trustworthy. But this insurance thing really just sounds too good to be true. 

So, opinions? Questions I should be asking? Other investment options I should bring up with him?

technology,Mergers are going to kill the Internet,"From FFTF: 

Comcast just announced a $65 billion bid to buy 21st Century Fox. This comes just days after a federal judge approved the mega-merger of AT&amp;T and Time Warner.1

This. Is. Terrifying. Two of the biggest and most powerful ISPs in the country will now own both content and the way we view that content.

And between the FCC’s repeal of net neutrality and the federal courts giving a green light to these kinds of mega-mergers, we can expect that this is only the beginning of an unprecedented corporate consolidation of the Internet.

The Internet has never been in such grave danger, and we need to redouble our efforts to convince Congress to overturn the FCC’s repeal of net neutrality. Will you chip in?

With the merger of AT&amp;T and Time Warner, a single mega-corporation now controls AT&amp;T’s massive ISP network, DirecTV, and all of Time Warner’s media companies, including HBO, TNT, CNN, and Warner Brothers.

AT&amp;T is one of the few broadband Internet providers in many areas, and without net neutrality in place, it will have the power to force millions of Americans to consume their content while small startups, grassroots voices, and corporate competitors can be throttled or blocked.

Here’s a peek into the future: Have AT&amp;T Internet and want to watch Netflix? Sorry, you can only watch HBO unless you want to pay more extra fees. And PBS is so slow to load that you may as well forget about it.

Comcast’s bid to buy 21st Century Fox will create another massive monopoly.2 Comcast subscribers who want to stream ESPN and Amazon Prime may soon be limited to Fox Sports and Hulu.

Without net neutrality, there’s nothing to prevent those kinds of abuses, and it’s only a matter of time before that’s what starts happening. We know that because these companies have a long track record of violating net neutrality. In fact, about one-third of America can only buy Internet service from Big Cable companies who have violated net neutrality.3

If we’re to have any defense against Big Cable’s takeover, it’s vital that we convince Congress to pass the CRA overturning the FCC’s repeal of net neutrality.

We’ve ramped up our Battle for the Net campaign to get the votes we need to pass the CRA in Congress. Will you chip in?

These mergers really illuminate the ways that your ISP can screw you over without net neutrality rules in place. But this isn’t just a consumer issue. A free and open Internet is essential for a functioning democracy.

There’s so much going on in the world right now, but every issue that we care about will be impacted by this fight over the future of the Internet.

So please, chip in to make sure we have the resources we need to win this fight.

For freedom,

-Evan at Fight for the Future

CryptoCurrency,How Ethereum Escaped the Definition of a Security,"The sale of unregistered securities can result in [crippling penalties](https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2016/01/24/calculating-sec-civil-money-penalties) which can be enforced internationally through [cooperative arrangements](https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/oia/oia_coopfactsheet.htm) and [enforcement assistance](https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/oia/oia_crossborder.shtml). How can a blockchain startup raise the initial funds necessary to build its vision while staying on the right side of the law?

There are three options: 

1. Register with the SEC (which is expensive and time consuming); 

2. Restrict the sale so it is exempt from registration (which may limit the amount of funds that can be raised and exclude many retail investors); or 

3. Make sure the tokens sold are not securities.

Because the third option may be the cheapest with the least red tape, most fledgling projects would like to take advantage of this option if possible. Chairman Clayton of the SEC has said many times, however, that the vast majority of ICOs are in fact sales of securities. This begs the question: **How can a startup structure a sale of tokens so it would *not* be deemed a security?**

----

**What is a security?**

----

The definition of a security under U.S. law was fleshed out in *SEC v. W.J. Howey Co.*, 328 U.S. 293 (1946), establishing the so-called *Howey* test. 

Something is an investment contract (and therefore a security) if it has all of these elements:

1. It is an investment of money (""money"" is construed broadly to include basically any asset, including cryptocurrencies);

2. There is an expectation of profits from the investment (but we're all ""in it for the tech,"" right?);

3. The investment of money is in a common enterprise (courts are split on whether commonality must be horizontal or vertical, and to what extent); and

4. Any profit comes from the efforts of a promoter or third party.

In explaining why he thinks neither Bitcoin nor Ether are securities, [SEC Director William Hinman](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/speech-hinman-061418) noted a token or coin may *not* be a security in cases where ""**there is no longer any central enterprise being invested in** or **where the digital asset is sold only to be used to purchase a good or service available through the network on which it was created**."" 

----

**Decentralization and the Role of Promoters Over Time**

----

According to Director Hinman:

&gt;The digital asset itself is simply code. But the way it is sold – as part of an investment; to non-users; by promoters to develop the enterprise – can be, and, in that context, most often is, a security – because it evidences an investment contract. 

The presence of centralized ""promoters"" weighs strongly in favor of a token being deemed a security. A promoter is a person or coordinated group working actively to develop or guide the development of the network. This is distinguished from a situation where multiple, independent actors work on the network but no individual actor’s or coordinated group of actors’ efforts are essential to the success of the enterprise. 

Where promoters sell tokens in order to fund blockchain network development, in most cases it's still substantially a sale of securities: tokens are sold to investors who rely on the promoters to build the network and increase the value of the token so the investors can later sell the token for a higher price than what they paid initially (*hopefully*). 

Bitcoin and Ethereum networks, however, run and have value because decentralized, uncoordinated actors do the necessary upkeep and development to keep the network running. 

&gt;If the network on which the token or coin is to function is sufficiently decentralized – where purchasers would no longer reasonably expect a person or group to carry out essential managerial or entrepreneurial efforts – the assets may not represent an investment contract. Moreover, when the efforts of the third party are no longer a key factor for determining the enterprise’s success, material information asymmetries recede. As a network becomes truly decentralized, the ability to identify an issuer or promoter to make the requisite disclosures becomes difficult, and less meaningful.

Director Hinman offered a non-exhaustive list of factors that go to whether a third-party drives the expectation of a return (see the link, above). How these factors apply to a particular blockchain startup may change over time, and thus the sale of tokens that was once a sale of a security may fall outside that definition at a later point:

&gt;[P]utting aside the fundraising that accompanied the creation of Ether, based on my understanding of the present state of Ether, the Ethereum network and its decentralized structure, current offers and sales of Ether are not securities transactions. And, as with Bitcoin, applying the disclosure regime of the federal securities laws to current transactions in Ether would seem to add little value. Over time, there may be other sufficiently decentralized networks and systems where regulating the tokens or coins that function on them as securities may not be required.

----

**True Utility Tokens**

----

An example of a true utility token that SEC Chairman Clayton often uses is a laundromat token--you buy one to use a washing machine or dryer, not to hold in the hope of earning profits by reselling it at a higher price at a later date. 

Director Hinman suggested that the sale of tokens for use on the network may require that the network is already up and running such that ""it is evident that purchasers are not making an investment in the *development* of the enterprise.""

Director Hinman also offered some questions that may help blockchain projects structure their tokens/coins so they function more like a consumer item and less like a security (see the link, above). 

----

**TL;DR - A token might not be deemed a security if:** 

**1. The founders/developers/promoters have taken a ""set it and forget it"" approach and the network is no longer centrally managed; or**

**2. The token is sold for use on an already-functioning network.**

personalfinance,"Submitting an offer for a house, is this a dumb idea?","So, my wife and I are planning on giving our offer for a house tomorrow. I’m not sure we’re being smart. I would like to run these numbers by you guys.

The offer is 625K. 525K of this would be in cash. I was overseas for a decade and have no credit built up (just for a couple months), so mortgage brokers are not going to give me a mortgage without a huge down payment, but this is also nice because it means we’re losing less in interest payments (though of course less to invest, assuming the stock market doesn’t drop hard).

At an estimated 4.617% interest rate for a 30 year loan, this would be $1079 per month for the mortgage, taxes, and insurance. Another option could be a 15 year loan at 4.01%, which would end up being $1327 again covering the mortgage, taxes, and insurance. EDIT: Because of some confusion I want to point out that I’m talking about mortgage, taxes, and insurance together for this price. Not just the mortgage).

I’ve read that a house costs ~1-2% of it’s value in maintenance each year, which would be ~$500-$1000. The house is very well maintained and built in ‘98. I don’t expect much major maintenance but I’m sure there will be some like with any house.

Utilities will probably run close to $400/month.

We have 2 cars, insurance on them will run ~230/month for both.

Health / dental insurance will run the entire family $107/month (Edit 2: I remembered this is twice a month, not once a month).

We have a 2 year old daughter, and hopefully will be pregnant again soon.

We have nothing substantial in any retirement fund, but it would leave us with ~$80k in cash here, ~€100k (=~$116K), and a portion of a different house that we’re estimating around ~$75K if it sells (might also be rented instead). 

I make $51K/year. This will increase ~2k/year. My wife will stop working in March, she currently makes ~$60K, though possibly she’ll work part time for the next 2 or 3 years. After that full time in about 4 years. Part time she would still make an estimated ~35k. I can take off up to $2600 pre taxes to put into an account for health care expenses.

All told, I think I’m looking at a low of ~$2250/month (30 year mortgage and low maintenance) to $3000/month (15 year mortgage and high maintenance). Then we have the ~$270K in cash reserves, though we’d prefer to leave the ~$116K of that in € and not touch it, if possible.

And we would have the home we would be living in.

Does this seem like a smart, neutral, or stupid move to be making on $51k/year, and possibly a part time job of ~$35k/year? Thank you in advance for all the help.",finance

personalfinance,Started a new job in the U.S and confused about taxes and take home pay.,"TL;DR at bottom.

I recently moved from Europe to NYC and started a new job in late May. In my new position, I am now earning $115,000 while my wife earns $76,000 gross each year. When I started my employer gave me a number of forms to fill out including state and federal tax forms. I don't have much experience with the U.S tax system but followed the instructions and submitted the forms. I indicated we were married, we would file taxes jointly and didn't have any children. I didn't choose any allowances as none seemed to apply, and I calculated a tax withholding of $560. 

After getting a small paycheck at the end of May, I recieved my first full bi-weekly payment on June 15th and I'm kind of shocked at home much of my paycheck is taxed... For the first two weeks I recieved $4,791 and payed $2055.74 in taxes leaving me with $2,706.51 take home pay. Over 40&amp;#37; in taxes before I take out 401k and any other savings. 

I now wonder if I messed up the tax forms or if it's just the cost of working in NYC. The tax calculators I used seemed to indicate that my take home pay would be closer to $3,400. As a non-american, is this a normal rate of tax in NY for our income or am I overpaying somewhere? I also don't fully understand the tax witholding charge and how that works, is it also federal income tax?

personalfinance,"[Advice] Sold my home in 2016, received a CP2000 form from the IRS with a very high adjustment.","Hi r/personalfinance, I'm freaking out and would love some guidance on what could be going on.

I filed my return in 2016, with a federal taxable income of around $43,000. I sold my house that year for $288,000, and made a profit of around $80,000. Lived there for three years, so I was told I wouldn't be paying Capital Gains tax on the sale. Now, I fucked up and didn't report the house sale on my return. I 100&amp;#37; own that mistake, I thought that the IRS already took their share when I sold it, yadayada, I'm an idiot.

A couple of months ago, I got a letter from the IRS about income I didn't report, and they included this house sale. I cooperated and checked the box saying that I sold the house for $288k, and sent it back. I expected to get a letter back from them with the difference I would owe, but I just received it (Form CP2000) and it's incredibly high - they're proposing that I owe \~$114,000 - which includes $90,000 of actual taxes, $18,000 for an under reporting penalty, and $5,500 in interest.

How can this be if I only made $80k from the home sale? Do they believe I made $288k from the sale? This seems to be the most likely explanation. I've called the number over and over and it's only automated. I will try the main IRS line in the morning to see if I can talk to someone in person.

personalfinance,Medical Emergency...Does it make sense to sell my car,"Hi all, thanks in advance...

 I bought a brand new Nissan Rogue in January 2017 for $30,000.

I've recently had a medical emergency that resulted in my license being suspended for 3 months. Towards the end of my 3 months I had another episode and doctors have suspended my license another 6 months. Which is making me wonder if I should sell my car and get out of the loan as I'm unsure if i will get back my license in 6 months or it will be delayed further. 

I got the car appraised and the dealer will buy it back for $19,000 and I have to $24,000 left on my loan...meaning i have to pay $5000 to get out of the loan. My monthly payments are $370 per month on a 7 year 0.99% interest rate. I have the money to pay the car off today and could save $3000 by the end of the 6 months my license is suspended for ($370 car payment + $130 insurance = $500 per month for 6 months). I understand it wasnt a good decision to buy new and will not be looking to do that again. In 6 months if I can get my license back I would look at buying a car for roughly $10,000 and getting it financed with an interest rate of 13%..give or take. 

Do you think it is financially sound to get out from under the car loan now and save money for the next 6 months while I assess my financial situation? Or has the car depreciated to the point where I am better off keeping it and simply making the payments and riding it out.",finance
personalfinance,Consolidating loans help plz!,"Hello! Early 30s here and deeply in debt. I have a couple of CCs that I keep just under the max allowed, have two months of rent weighting on me, misc doctors bills and 2 other lines of credit that I took out when my cat was sick and when I was sick. Oh and student loans. Duh.

Needless to say, the whole of it is overwhelming and exhausting and there are diff interest rates to keep up with and people to pay off.

My question is, how does one go about getting all of this consolidated? Is that what debt consolidation is for? I think it would be easier to pay everything off and worry about just one bill monthly that I can handle. Or should I just pay off each sep debt little by little?",finance

I'm currently tackling $20k in HIGH interest credit card debt 20-30% APR (due to my stupid overspending habits and not enough hours worked at my prev job). These collective monthly payments ballpark around $800.

My Student loan debt is between 4-11%, with the Feds providing the best interest, (Fed loans I'm going to tackle with 10 years of public service), but the private is killing me. ($750 monthly)

My goal: I just found out that going back to school half time (apparently 6 college credits) will kick my student loans into deferment. If I can kick it into deferment I can tackle almost ALL of my CC debt within 1.5-2 years, I understand that it will accrue interest but the CC debt interest is too high, and I believe I'll be able to refinance my student loans for a better rate once that is paid off. I also want to finish my college degree since I'm so close.

personalfinance,"Trying to rebuild credit and life, how to start? (Details in post)","Hi. I will be 29 in August and I have been extremely careless and have had a lot of problems in my adult life. However, I recently began working again (although not enough) and am looking for some guidance.

I only make $900 a month and as such, I live at home. I pay $320 a month for my car (but I only pay half right now), close to $300 in student loans (not even the federal, I'm not paying that right now), and I owe a couple hundred in credit card minimums per month. At the end of the month, and with what I have to put in to save due to my job not withholding taxes, I have nothing left over. 

I am on food/medical assistance as well. I feel so defeated in life. I had a significant brain injury last year and haven't been able to work in my field. I'm just not making enough money though.

A couple of questions I have:
-Is it better to pay smaller amounts on the credit cards (most likely the minimums) and then save larger amounts, so that in a few months I can put higher payments on them? Or is this pointless? (For example, if I intend to pay $200 for a card with a $100 minimum, is it better to pay 100 now and save 100 for later to make a larger payment, or better to just do the $200 at once?)

I can't get any more loans/credit cards and I want to raise my credit score. Other than paying them down, is there anything else I can do to get this score up faster?

I guess that's the main things on my mind now. I know I have to increase my income but I'm having a hard time figuring out how to do that right now. I've gotten deferments on my loans and I'm out of those for now. So that's not really an option either. I also asked for the lowest payments and this is what they gave me..

If anyone is curious: Credit score 493. 6k in credit card debt combined. 7,700k for what I owe on my car loan. and 100k in student loans though that does include the loans I'm not currently paying on. AM I totally screwed in life??",finance
personalfinance,Need advice on how to handle student loans while receiving medicaid,"Here's my situation:

* I'm a 31-year-old, self-employed piano teacher.
* My adjusted gross income has been roughly 16k for the last 3 years.
* I have a number of ongoing medical issues, and, thankfully, receive medicaid insurance.
* I have 23k in subsidized federal student loans, currently on Income Based repayment plan, with a monthly payment of zero.

My question is:

Should I try to increase my income to pay off my student loan as quickly as possible, or should I pay the minimum monthly payment for 25 years at which point my loans are forgiven?

Problems with paying off student loans:

1. I'd have to increase my monthly income which would make me ineligible for medicaid (16k is close to the upper limit).
2. If I become ineligible for medicaid, I'd have to buy my own medical insurance and pay significantly higher copays, which means I'd have to increase my monthly income significantly, because of the amount of medical care I receive.
3. **In short, I'd need a significant jump in income, without really increasing my quality of life or ability to save, since I'd be spending all of the extra income.**

Problems with NOT paying off student loans:

1. The interest will keep accruing so that if I decide to pay it off later, it'll be a larger amount.
2. I'll be making monthly payments for 25 years unless my income is always super low. 
3. If I ever do increase my income, my payments will increase, which gives me less of an incentive to make more money.

I use YNAB to budget and am good about living within my means. With my current income, I have enough to live on with a little left for savings (trying to save for a 3-month buffer). I am not making any loan payments, and I don't make enough to contribute to my IRA, so I worry about retirement with my current situation.

personalfinance,"Soon-to-be Licensed Pharmacist, $266k debt... Plan, advice, saving for retirement, etc","So I use Mint for tracking everything and I love it. So let me get started... a majority of the debt is student loans (mostly private)... Thru Sallie Mae most of the private loans are 8-9% (and that's WITH a cosigner...) for a total of about $179K and my federal loans through Nelnet are total of $72.2k, ranging from 3-6.8% but mostly around 4.5%.

I am paying off my car which has $9.5k left on it (9% APR)

I was forced to move so I have a lot of moving expenses. I've applied for credit cards and was denied (no history of late payments or anything... must be all the loans?) so luckily my mom has an extra credit card she's letting me use... She doesn't use it at all so it's all my responsibility to pay, but it's just under her name and yes, hurting her credit until I pay it back. But her credit is amazing, her score is 831. Mine is 665 under Transunion and around 694 under Experian. 



Anyways, I'm working 40 hours per week currently and making $29/hr in Minnesota. I'm 24 years old. Once I'm licensed I'll be working 40-50 hours/week making $58/hr. That will hopefully be mid-July, at the earliest. My rent is $1370 and I only have to pay for electric. I will be adopting a cat next week. I only just started this job about 3 weeks ago and currently have around $900 in the bank.


Here's my current plan (with help from my mom who is an avid Dave Ramsey listener)

1. Save $1000 for emergencies
2. Pay off debts-
2a. Pay off Mom's credit card first ASAP
2b. Pay off car ASAP
2c. Work on student loans- Mom recommends the snowball method, just pay off some of the smaller loans first. Not sure where I stand on this, I would be paying less money overall if I just pay on the highest- interest loans first. I plan on paying $3k per month on loans or as much as possible.
3. Save 6 months of living expenses
4. Save for retirement (I was contributing and getting a match for 6% for my 401k throughout school, I just lowered it to 2% since I have been a little strapped for money with moving expenses. I plan on moving it back up to 6% once I'm licensed and making more money)



[This](https://imgur.com/ymKVoPg) is a rough estimate of my current budget and budget once I'm licensed. I put the increased salary into the car but as I was saying I would want to pay off my mom's credit card first. 

Any ideas, tips, etc for what I'm doing? Is this a good plan? What can I do better? Yes, I know my situation is pretty messed up but at least I will have a pretty decent income here soon!",finance

financialindependence,"44/m US$1.5m Net Worth, Quitting work to let the universe blow me around for a few years","I've been aiming for this moment for 23 years, where I can board a flight with a one-way ticket and wander the world unburdened by goals or financial commitments. In August I'll finish up my contract, bid farewell to my colleagues and do just that.

I've managed to get myself into this position by following many of the strategies that you guys talk about on this forum. Starting out with nothing at the age of 21 myself and my wife have spent the last 23 years investing surplus savings and being careful with how we spend money whilst raising a family on a single income. I've been working in IT in New Zealand, Australia &amp; Europe for my entire career and most of that time our household income was around US$80,000/annum. It's been really interesting talking to other people who are the same age as I am, who're in the same industry, who've nearly always earned much more then I have yet who are often still deeply in debt and resigned that will need to keep working well into their 60s. I thought I'd share some of the behaviors and decisions that helped us get to where we are now:

1. Buying a cheap house early: We bought a pretty ordinary house in the late 90s for US$125k (in New Zealand) and paid it off in four years. For 15 subsequent years the money which we would have spent on the mortgage or rent was invested, giving us a huge head-start.

2. Tax planning via contracting: I've spent most of my career contracting as a Programmer, Project Manager, Business Analyst etc. Most contracts have been for 6 months on a higher daily rate than a permanent job. Contracting has meant that I've been plan my income across tax years to avoid drifting into high tax rate thresholds. i.e. for many years I'd stop work after 6 months and take the summer off till the next tax year started. Obviously, this isn't the best strategy for simply accumulating money, but it's been a nice lifestyle choice.

3. Buy and Hold. I've found my only investment regrets have come when I've sold and watched as the value of that investment continued to rise. There are lots of shares on the Australian and NZ share markets that pay higher dividends yields than bank interest rates, so it's pretty hard to lose money in the long-term. As I've grown older I've become much more comfortable with buying some ETF or share then forgetting about it and not stressing about whatever the share price is.

4. Start a business. I did this about 6 years ago. It wasn't particularly successful financially and had I just continued contracting it would have resulted in much the same return on investment. However, the personal development &amp; leadership opportunities and connections that I realized from being a business owner were life-changing. It's given me a ton of confidence in looking outside IT for whatever I do next.

So, in just over a month we'll be off to explore this planet with a curious mind and I'll keep myself open to whatever opportunities present themselves. I think that, at 44 years old, FIRE shouldn't be about playing golf or pottering around the home, but instead is an amazing opportunity to escape the daily grind and challenge yourself. Maybe even give back something to the world. We'll see...",finance

I own two residential properties, and have mortgages on both. I rent both of them out and moved in with my boyfriend a year ago. 

The first home, I owe $90k and it is worth around $250k in the current market. The interest rate for this mortgage is around 3%, as I purchased it after the housing bubble. On a cash basis, the rental income yields me about $400 a month. 

I owe $190k on the second home and it’s worth around $235k. The interest rate on the second home is higher at 4.25%. The rental income is enough to fully offset expenses for this home, but not by much.

I have been paying additional $1,000 a month on the first home mortgage to pay it off quicker. I started doing this a few years ago when I didn’t want to add more money into the stock market. My goal was to pay off my first house and use it as investment property. With the additional principle payment, this house should be paid off in 6 years.

In terms of debt I have a sofi student loan balance of 53k at 5.8% as well as a car that I have about 5.5 k at 3%. Now I am sooooo tempted to just bite the bullet and pay off my student loans in full so then I can just take the money that usually goes to the loan (900) and throw it into my savings to start saving for a house.

personalfinance,Paying off car loan vs investing. Is it as simple as comparing interest rate to return?,"I've got a fair chunk of money above my emergency fund that has been sitting in my savings earning an abysmal %.01. While it was comforting knowing I could cover a lot more 'oh shit' moments than I planned on, I am looking to move to something where it is doing more than losing value due to inflation. I was originally looking at a brokerage and moving from there with investments.

However this amount is also enough to pay off my car loan.

So is this question as simple as comparing the interest rate to the return rate? I'm at 2.4% APR for the loan, so it stands to reason to me that unless the investments offer more than 2.4% return I am losing money by continuing to borrow for the loan. This is aside from having the car payment amount free to move to investments following the payoff.

Does this make sense or am I overlooking something?",finance
personalfinance,Should I finance medical school with Federal or Private loans?,"I am eligible for $43k in Subsidized Stafford loans and $4k in long term loans from the school.

The interest rates for the unsubsidized Stafford and GradPLUS loans are 6% and 7% respectively. Would it be worth it to look into private loans with lower interest? What else do I need to look for besides interest rate and when I need to begin paying back?

I pointed this out to my lender, since I do know there are omissions (missing two accounts where 25% of my assets are), I feel I am unable to sign, or that I should not sign until they amend the document to provide accurate asset information. Also, since my assets are a factor for how the loan/interest is determined, shouldn’t it be as accurate as possible? Might I get a lower interest rate if my assets are higher?

personalfinance,Taken advantage of by a banker - any recourse?,"Hi, my girlfriend made some poor decisions with regards to debt, but I think she may have been taken advantage of by Wells.

So she originally bought a car with help from her mom using an auto loan (dealer finance) at 5.69% for about 10k in principal.  About 15 months later, she refinanced it in just her name at 11.5% using the bank.  

5 months later, she was called by a rep from the same bank, who offered to consolidate the outstanding debt with some credit card debt.  This is where I think things got predatory.  

This guy turned:
$7.1k at 11.69%; and
$3.1k at 13.5%

Into: $10.2k at 15.6% unsecured personal loan.  

Obviously, she signed everything which was a terrible move.  But, it seems absolutely predatory to call someone with limited financial education and consolidate their debt at a higher interest rate, while also not taking the car as collateral.  

So my question is, is there anything we can do or are we just shit outta luck here?  I feel like we should be able to complain that she was taken advantage of.  Thanks for any help.  I'm pretty blown away that they would do this.

personalfinance,Student Loan Deferment Dropped Credit Score,"I cross posted this on r/credit but it’s not getting much response. Thought I’d post here too. 

So, over the past few years I have been working on improving my credit score. I gradually worked my way up to a 712 from like a 500 over the past two years. My my credit cards are in good standing, I only have one negative remark that is almost five years old. My credit age is only 5 years and my usage is 37%. I don’t actively use my credit cards. I made some mistakes as a young adult and I’m paying them all back now. 

I did recently get a car loan with a good interest rate (2.79%) through a private credit union, I co-signed this with my finance. I do have student loans, I’m on an income based repayment plan and have been paying for two years. 

So the car loan had a  positive impact on my credit score. My score when from a 708 to a 712 during the month I got the loan. In May  I went back to college, all my student loans are through FedLoan and they are automatically put into deferment in June, however I am still paying on them. The day after my loans went into deferment, my score dropped to a 692. The only remark on my credit report for June is the deferment. 

What would cause this drop? Everything I found online says the deferment, due to going back to school, is not supposed to have an impact. However I did find multiple forums with people in similar situations with a drop in score. 

I plan on tackling my credit cards more intensely next month. I received a significant raise and paid some medical bills so I have more money to put towards them.

financialindependence,What should FI look like with a dual pension?,"Hi all,

Long time lurker.  I am currently in line to collect two pensions for retirement.  The first, my federal civilian pension, I can begin to collect at a minimum age of 57.  The second, a National Guard military pension, I can collect at 60.  I have two TSPs, and the federal civilian one is matched dollar for dollar for the first 3&amp;#37; and at half-rate for the remaining 2&amp;#37; (a total of 4&amp;#37; of my income if I contribute 5&amp;#37; of my pay).  I survived a short-notice divorce this year, so I'm currently only putting away 5&amp;#37; until I'm back above water in 2019.

However, what does the dual pension and TSP mean to me in terms of FI?  I see a lot of numbers and calculators, but with a dual pension...it MUST change the minimum I need!  I'm hoping to retire at 57, collect my first pension with small disbursements of my TSP to cover expenses, and add the second pension at 60.  My boss made a calculator that I've been using, and it's estimating that with my current contributions and an estimated 4&amp;#37; growth of my TSP annually, I should collect $77k pretax/year from 57-60, then $125k pretax/year at 60 if my military career continues on course.  The downside is that this calculator was made before the advent of the Roth TSP, and I currently put my 5&amp;#37; into the Roth, while the government contribution goes into Traditional TSP.  I'm hoping the balanced contributions to both will help in the long run.

What am I missing?  The age 57 TSP value is estimated to be over $500k...that seems low, but I'm dual pensioned...so I think I'll be MORE than ok.  Thoughts?  I'm currently 38.",finance

gaming,A Medieval Battle Royale game,"For most of 2017 and 2018 battle royale games have been dominating the game industry. Just like when Rust first came out and shortly after many other horribly optimized survival games followed in it's wake. The amount of new, horrible battle royale games is astounding and all of them bring nothing original or new to the table for the genre. I personally do not play BR games but can see why people think they are fun. Here is my idea for a cool concept for a new BR game.

So what do all BR games have in common? Guns and looting is the biggest thing in my opinion. Part of what makes me bored of BR games is the playstyle of hiding behind cover and peeking to shoot when it's safe. This playstyle bores me to tears and I don't have the patience for it I'm sorry. What I seek is full on action in a game. Melee combat is my answer to this. You cannot kill someone unless you engage them head on and if the game has good mechanics with sword play then the fight should be exciting. Also there is the factor that a 3rd person could arrive and join the fight for even more action. The type of combat I see would be something similar to Chivalry: Medieval Warfare.

Balance wise I could just see most weapons being relatively equal and having different perks (spears have range, swords are fast, maces hit hard etc.) Learning each weapons playstyle would be rewarding to the player. Also the map would be pretty compact so games could be faster paced and have less downtime.

I'm no game designer or artist but I play games and have some experience with BR over the years since H1Z1 came out in 2015. I just want to see what other people think of this type of BR game. It's a scuffed idea because it's literally only from my head but the thought of it sounds incredibly fun for me and probably anyone else who enjoy sword fighting type games.

So let me know what you guys think. Any criticism is welcome as I know this is just a random idea.",technology
personalfinance,First timer! Where to from here?,"Hi! Brand new to Reddit but you all were suggested to me by a friend! Apologies in advance for the long post and feel free to ask questions for further info if I miss something. Essentially I'm just trying to figure out the best direction for our funds and it's just too overwhelming for me to come up with every scenario and do the math on it all to see what's best.

Hubby and I make a decent living, but after just having a kid and purchasing a home that was a bit more expensive than I'd like, I'm looking for ways to primarily decrease our debt, increase our cash flow and put our money to work as efficiently as I can. I like to look for out of the box ways to leverage my money so suggestions there are welcome as well as any obvious ones I may be missing.

Current Debts (USD):

Credit Cards: $4,100 -set up with recurring bills so we pay enough to cover those them plus some interest, essentially we're making zero headway on these and the 4,100 stays the same each month

Automobile: $11,500 ($161/monthly - purchased in January 2018) I don't remember the Interest rate exactly but I believe it's about 3-4&amp;#37; as we have good credit

Student Loans: \~$9,000 ($204/monthly with &lt;2&amp;#37; interest rate)

Home: $215,000  ($1,293.07/monthly including principle/interest ($1,025), escrow and PMI) 5/1 ARM @ 3.99&amp;#37; (just purchased last month, first payment not due until next month, we plan to refinance in 5 years to get out of the mortgage insurance ($119) as we did not have a 20&amp;#37; down payment)

Current Assets:

\~$12,000 in a traditional IRA\~$10,000 in a \[ ROTH 401k \]

\~$500/monthly cash flow not dedicated to any expenses.

We have paired down our expenses as much as we can, our groceries are definitely on the higher end due to food allergies and therefore food has to be pretty brand specific, can't just buy a bag of beans or rice without first doing brand and production facility research. Would like to find some means to lower but not a priority at the moment.

I'm considering taking out the IRA funds to pay off the student loans as that seems to be the most efficient way to create the most cash flow with the least amount of upfront money ($9,000 gets me $204/monthly). No equity in the home or car at this time. I'm open to other lines of credit with initial 0&amp;#37; interest offers or other short term options. I can't find a credit card that offers free balance transfers, only ones with zero percent interest for some time which would be great if it wasn't for the fees.

What other options do I have, where else can I pull money from? Is this the best way due to the penalties and taxes? We will receive a child credit this year that we never have before so I'm essentially thinking that would just cancel out the taxes we'd incur from early distribution of IRA funds. I've looked into converting the Traditional to a Roth and distributing that way, but the IRS already appears to have picked up on that and still won't allow you to withdraw after conversion for 5 years without the penalty.

In 5 years we should be able to drop the mortgage insurance on the home, the car should be nearly paid off, kid will be starting school (ideally would like to afford some type of private/alternative schooling thus another reason for desiring extra cash flow) We will likely have gotten a different car by then as well so would like to have either more equity in that when the time comes

So how do I play this, what are my next moves (plural)? Getting rid of the student loans seems most efficient even though it has the lowest interest rate. Then perhaps the credit cards with the car being last? Or do I go ahead and try to knock out the car because it can at least create some equity for me.

I'd really love to get to the point where our extra cash flow is going toward our home as I know that's probably truly the best place for it. I just don't feel like we have enough cash flow at the moment to warrant putting it all in the house when we have so many other expenses. Maybe I'm wrong? It just seems like such a fine balancing act to figure out what's most efficient.

Is there any other way to leverage having good credit for short term payoff with 0&amp;#37; offers that I'd be able to payoff before the APR kicked in? If so what debts should I put in on those offers? Are there any assets I may not be thinking of? We're pretty minimal in terms of owning things and stuff and after having moved twice in the last year we're pretty purged.

Edit:  I should add that I am looking for advice followed by your calculations to substantiate the conclusions reached vs another option. 

Anyway, internet, do your thing! And thanks so much for any tips!",finance

CryptoMarkets,Distributed Credit Chain - Review,"DCC stands for Distributed Credit Chain. The platform which is based on blockchain technology aims to become a parallel banking channel rather than just the institutions which are currently controlling the entire finance industry. With the help of decentralized platform, banking services can be provided by the various different stakeholders rather than just the registered banks.

When you look at the services of the banks that is providing loans as well as allowing to invest in various assets and other avenues, hardly any other institution is able to provide the same range of services. This makes the banks create a monopoly. However, monopoly is bad for any kind of business. That is why this platform is trying to create an ecosystem for distributed banking. Only with the help of distributed banking, the competition will increase and the level of service which will be provided will be higher. This is one of the main reasons why distributed banking holds such a lot of promise.

This platform will actually create different stakeholders so that such services can be provided. It will also be identifying the individuals or the consumers with their real-world identities. As a result, fake accounts cannot be created. With the help of the real-world identities, ID will be provided to the consumers which will be known by the name of DCCID. With the help of this ID, the stakeholders will be able to decide whether the individual can be allowed to invest in different projects or whether the individual can be granted a loan. All of this information will be available to the stakeholders which are providing the services to the individual. The exact identity of the individual will not be revealed. Moreover, there will be a proper credit system for the stakeholders to decide whether the banking services can be provided or not.

Also, based on the cryptocurrency Holdings of the individuals, the loans can be provided as well. With the help of these collateralized loans, the interest rate which the individuals will be able to get will be on the lower side. Also, there will be proper tracking of the repayment capability. As a result, it will become easier for the stakeholders to grant bigger and bigger loans depending on the credit history.

Currently, the platform is coming out with an ICO.

**DCC ICO details:**

* Date of ICO: 28-05-2018 to 28-06-2018
* Platform: Ethereum
* Token acronym: DCC
* Price of token: 13,700 DCC = 1 ETH

As the platform is trying to provide services to the under-banked customers, it holds a lot of potential.

**Conclusion:**

Thus, if you believe in the amalgamation of the finance industry with the blockchain industry, you should definitely look at this platform. If indeed, it is able to provide such collateralized services to the consumers and also provides them with the normal banking products, the potential in this platform is immense. If you’re looking to invest in ICOs, this is one which you should definitely look at. You have to make sure that you can hold it for a longer period of time in order to generate any kind of returns from this ICO.

Yet decided that for the amount of loans I will take out compared to my income and declining saturated job market, it is probably not worth it.

I calculated with tuition, living and food expenses it will be under 50k for the whole program. I was able to receive a 25k of federal unsubsidized and subsidized loans from the school and will put in about 17k of my own money out of pocket, hopefully my parents can help me out with the rest during school. It is a 1 year program. So I figure compared to my other options is required the least amount of time and effort, plus least amount of loans compared to my other choices. 

Obviously I don't want to graduate jobless and make like 12 bucks a hour lol. So I am expecting an increase in salary, high demand, job versatility.

personalfinance,Retirement Aspirations: Am I in trouble or am I ok?,"I'm 37 years old.  


\- I make 140k/year (just recently got a raise so my 401k contribution jumped a good chunk recently)  
\- I have about 97k in my 401k with a 12&amp;#37; contribution (no company match unfortunately)  
\- My wife is a home maker.

\- I have 2 kids in private school at about $9k/year tuition for the both of them.

\- 2 cars, one paid off, one with 15k remaining (just under 4 more years to payoff)

\- Currently owe 192k on my house. 3.75&amp;#37; interest rate. Currently estimated value of 291k and rising (up &amp; coming area).

\- 30k in student loans at \~5&amp;#37; interest rate

\- About 22k in credit card debt that we're paying down after consolidating and have not been overspending on credit for a couple years now after racking up over 30k in CC debt earlier in our marriage

\- A few thousand in savings but not much to speak of because we're attempting to clear debt prior to starting to bulk up more savings  


I plan to retire at the standard age of mid-60's. (Ideally I'd love to retire early, around 60 but who knows)  


I'd also like a comfortable retirement where my wife and I can travel a bit, be ok with healthcare, eat out, etc. and not be too anxious financially.  
I figure my 401k and our house as the major assets (as I'm not planning for us to move prior to retirement if we're able to stay here and come close to paying this house off). I would love to start putting more cash into savings but with the kids eventually getting to college, the prospect of the daughter getting married, etc. who knows right?  


Living a minimalist life style isn't really in the cards as my wife and I are realistic and live a normal life. We try not to live beyond our means but we definitely don't have a problem with spending money here or there.  


The more I think about it, the more nervous I get with the prospect of retirement. I mean, it's over 20 years away but time can fly. I don't have a problem with a part time job putting a trade skill to work if I need to in my retirement years but if I can avoid it, that'd be great.",finance

 My parents are financially well-off but divorced. My mom and I have arranged for her to pay about $10k lump sum at beginning of each fall semester directly to the school, and some money on the side for rent throughout the year. 

My father, on the other hand, wants me to open a ROTH IRA to disburse tuition funds to me.

A few notes:
-He says he is using this method to pay for my toddler brothers' daycare 
-He would deposit $5,500 at the beginning of each fall semester.
-I would be paid $4,500 as a 1099 employee for his PLLC to cover his remaining offer (how is this related to ROTH?)

personalfinance,400K in Student Loans - Payoff in full vs. Forgiveness in future vs. Save for retirement (age 43),"What to do has been keeping me up at night. Hoping for some guidance, advice and/or other options. I'm going to spell out all the details so this is going to be a long post.

Obligatory background: Never been good with money and made some very poor financial decisions. Earlier this year I came into a modest windfall and was able to dig myself out of all high interest debt.

Current situation:
* Age 43
* Current annual income $117K + Bonuses (this is significantly higher than years past)
* Have a budget - YNAB
* Current living expenses: $55K/year (HCOL area but thanks to my budget it’s much lower than before)
* Have a 3-6 mo emergency fund. I work in a volatile industry so this is a necessity.
* Current value of retirement accounts: $30K. This includes $23K in an inherited IRA with the first distribution in 2019. Maxing out my 401k this year to reduce AGI, value by year end should be $45K.

Debt:
* Car loan: $28K, interest rate 3.98%, $10-12K upside down but do have gap insurance (I'll never buy a new car again)
* Federal student loans: $400K, consolidated interest rate 7.625%, 7 years in on a 25 year IBR plan (18 years remaining), approximately $50,000 paid so far.

I started to write an explanation of why my student loans were so high but they are what they are. The total includes some from undergrad, most from grad school and too much from accumulated interest. I also think the possibility of forbearance after 25 years was a false sense of security.

I've run the numbers on student loan payoff calculators and here are the details:

Repay in full over 10 years
* Minimum payment: $4365/mo
* Total amount paid: $648,000

Repay in full over 18 years (remaining life on IBR)
* Minimum payment: $3400/mo
* Total amount paid: $783,850

Pay IBR minimum over 18 years (remaining life on IBR) with forgiveness on balance owed
*Minimum payment: $550 - $2500/mo (based on current and potential future income/filing status)
* Taxes on amount forgiven ($657,000 @ 35% worse case): $230,000
* Total amount paid: $779,000

I think if throw all of my future bonuses and surplus income at the loan (including the inherited IRA) I could get it paid off within 10 years. This would save the most money in terms of total amount paid but my concern is that in 10 years I’ll be 53 and not have any significant retirement savings. I get that I’m already behind but I would like to at least be able to partially retire or work part time at some point in my 60’s.

Paying the calculated minimum for the next 18 years hardly sounds appealing time wise, but seems to offer a middle of the road approach. It would allow me to save for the potential tax hit, save for retirement and still make some repayment of my obligations. There is always the possibility that the forgiveness option will go away so that’s also something to consider.

I’ve also considered the idea of splitting extra money, half to the loan and half to retirement/investments. Or refinancing part; it’s split by subsidized and unsubsidized with the subsidized part at about $55K. I will also have the option of getting a side hustle in the near future (there’s a legitimate reason for not being able to do so now which I’d rather not go into) which could increase my extra income.

So my question is, what would you do in this situation? Or are there any other options I may not have considered? Thanks in advance.

Edit: Sorry for bad formatting. I tried!

Edit 2: Going with all advice to payoff as soon as possible. New question: Try to refinance any part of it for a lower interest rate?",finance

personalfinance,Trying to reduce my auto payment; does this make sense?,"Right now I have 2 vehicles merged into one loan with which I have 4 years left on the 5 year loan. I pay $621.27 biweekly with an interest rate of 4.72% ($531.71 I pay towards the truck, $89.56 for interest).

I am thinking about selling my truck and buying a new truck which would have 0% Financing for 72 months and my payments for that would be $379.53 biweekly after taxes and fees. 

I have a potential (serious since he has been asking to buy my truck for 3 months) which would leave just under $15k left to pay off. I would be able to redo the loan for 3 years for the current amount at the same interest rate making my payments $205.61. Both loans together would be $585.15

That reduces my payments by $72.26.

Insurance for the new truck is $5 lower, so that's nothing huge, but the fuel economy looks to be 2L/100 better (on the conservative) side. 

Does this make sense to do? I'd pay off one loan a year sooner, wouldn't be giving the bank extra  money for interest, saving money on fuel and have a new truck that I wouldn't have to spend money on for maintenance.

Thanks for any input.",finance
personalfinance,Coming into about $30k inheritance. What would be an ideal way to treat the money based on my financial situation?,"**Introduction**I'll be receiving roughly $30k (could be as low as $20k or as much as $35k depending on how it all shakes out, but we expect it to be closest to $30k.) I don't have to pay taxes after that. I just graduated college last year, and have been working full time for about a year. I don't expect to receive the check for another 6-8 months.

Here's my current financial landscape...

**Income**

\&gt; Earn $42,000 salary at my job. That's $2550 a month after tax and healthcare deductions. It's solid for entry level in my city and profession. I have job security and some room for growth at my company, but it's good experience that I could potentially leverage for a better salary/benefits at some point. I have a great resume otherwise and interview well.

\&gt; Earned $5,000 in freelance last year (pre-tax, but some of that is paid in cash.) I don't think I'll make quite that much this year since I don't have the same level of free time, but with better tools, I could have increased opportunity.

**Debt, Expenses &amp; Future Concerns**

\&gt; $22,000 of federal student loans with a weighted average 3.92 percent interest.

\&gt; $2,000 in high interest (8.4 percent) private loans. I had another $2,000 @ 11&amp;#37; that I just recently paid off. Currently paying $200/month on the private and $250 per month on the federal.

\&gt; My primary work tools are out-of-date and don't have a long lifespan left. An ideal setup for new tools would run about $5,000, but I could cut corners / delay some purchases and spend about $3,000.

\&gt; All of my bills and expenses total up to about $2,050 a month. (Everything from Spotify to rent to saving for emergency fund. My rent is $485 and I'm happy enough with my place.)

\&gt; I would like to move out of my medium sized city in a year or two. I'd choose a big city (Denver, Chicago, Austin, NYC) which means more expenses but I would have a lot more opportunities career wise. I feel confident that I could at least make an lateral career move.

\&gt; My employer does not currently offer a retirement match. There is a chance that could change by the time my inheritance arrives, as we have new ownership. I do not have a retirement account, but I would love to use this money to start protecting my future.

**Assets**

\&gt; FICO score of 677. Only based off of student loan payments - I have no credit card currently.

\&gt; Own a early 2000's Honda that's got 170k miles. I can feel the transmission starting to slip. It will probably need to be replaced in the next couple years for safety and peace of mind. I don't need something brand new, but would like to get something a bit newer. I value reliability and fuel efficiency, but I need a decently sized car since I'm very tall. I browsed cars recently and think a 2009ish CR-V or Subaru would suit my needs well and not be too expensive.

\&gt; $700 in my checking account.

\&gt; Saved about $500 for an emergency fund. I was pretty bad about saving up until recently, but I did have higher expenses before now. I'm going to start putting away $200 every 2 weeks towards the e-fund and spending less frivolously. I know this is top-priority.

\&gt; About $5,000 in low-liquid assets that I've already received from inheritance. That's the quoted price, but realistically I wouldn't be able to sell these assets easily or for that sum. I wouldn't sell them anyways.

**Putting It All Together**

I've read some different opinions about handling a windfall, but I wanted to see how you would recommend managing this based on my specific situation. I know things will change by the time it arrives. Hopefully for the better.

But looking at it now and assuming marginal changes, what would you do?",finance

economy,Do you think the tax cuts are helping economic growth? The NFIB survey shows small business profit growth is the highest ever. Also American GDP is expanding quickly while other advanced economies such as Germany are seeing weakness.,"If the tax cuts are stimulative because increases in capex and consumer spending drive growth, that will diminish over time. The U.S. economy is seeing improvement in Q2 while most other countries such as China, other emerging markets, and Europe are seeing weakness. However, if the tax cuts are allowing the Fed to raise rates quicker and that is pushing the dollar higher and emerging markets lower, does that count in favor of tax cuts helping U.S. growth outperform? You would think pushing down growth in other areas of the world wouldn’t count as out performance.

It’s genuinely difficult to understand the cyclical effects of the tax cuts because of how dynamic the economy is since there are always countervailing trends. For example, slowing Chinese growth could be hurting Europe as China is Germany’s largest trading partner while Germany is Europe’s largest economy. Germany’s largest export product is cars and Chinese car sales fell for the first time in 3 years in Q2 2018. If the U.S. is avoiding such trouble, that could be an explanation for why growth is outperforming, besides stating that this is all a result of US tax cuts.

Today I would like to introduce an amazing product [https://821.credit](https://821.credit) where we can issue credits in our own symbol and transfer the credits to our friends

Question: What is a Symbol?

A symbol is a unique Name that represents the issuer, say if US federal reserve in playing in [https://821.credit](https://821.credit) it will have symbol 'USD'. and 'USD' will be available on every credit  the federal reserve issues.

once signed in with Google, you will be assigned with a unique Symbol, eg 'EC781', it will be permanent with you

The Google signin serverice is leveraged to do the authentication work, let us not register another account, and keep us safe and easy.  [https://821.credit](https://821.credit) will not keep the players  google credential 

Question: Difference from blockchain

In blockchain,  transactions need to be packed in a block and then get settled. vs in [https://821.credit](https://821.credit) every transaction get settled by itself, no need to go together with other transactions.

here [https://821.credit](https://821.credit) mechanism ensures that once a valid signature is produced, and there would be no alternative signature produced.

And [https://821.credit](https://821.credit) is single credit based, the transaction logs are per single credit instead of the account. for every credit, its logs are available from the very beginning it is issued

Concept of Proposal and Verdict

Proposal: when player initiates a transaction, it is called a ""Proposal"",  A proposal could be either valid or invalid.  The invalid proposal will be dismissed. And the valid proposal would be reworked on , and will produce the verdict

Verdict: it is the final words of the transaction, indicating the finished state of the transaction,  based on the verdict, on transaction could be endorsed. The verification steps are all based on the verdict

In a pipeline's perspective, it is in this order: 'transaction statement'-&gt; proposal -&gt; verdict 

Fundamental Difference with bitcoin

bitcoin's collateral is nothing vs credits issued @ [https://821.credit](https://821.credit) , its collateral is issuer's credibility.  Issuer has the ability to issue whatever amount of credits as he/she wish, but is under the constraint of not producing the inflation

Well, that's pretty much about my product. hopefully it is useful to you.

investing,Buying bonds a small ammount of time before maturity,"I'm currently looking for buying bonds but I want to avoid  risk due to potential interest rate rise. 

One strategy I had in mind (I'm a complete beginner in investing) was to buy bonds which are close to maturity . 

I'm currently looking at a bond with fixed rate coupon which will end in July 2018. With a face value of 100 and a current trading price of 100.42, and a 4.10% interest rate, a bond purchased now at 100.42 should pay back 104.1 right? 

It seems fishy to me ad there is such small risk about this short term investment. Is it normal that accrued interest on next coupon is not contained in the current price?

personalfinance,"I'm obliged to finish $800 in payments to a company that promised to reduce interest rates on separate, unassociated lines of credit, to no avail.","I received what would prudently be described as a disingenuous offer from a company making cold calls from leads most probably sold to them by one of my many consumer creditors. They claimed that they could externally negotiate up to four separate lines of credit (all from different banks) down to an interest rate of 6% for each one. Seeing as I am still only able to make minimum payments on each line, accumulatively surpassing around $6000.00, it seemed like a great idea at the time...

They quickly aquainted me with a person who acquired my verbal consent to his fiduciary duty as my 'financial advisor'. We then proceded in conference to contact each bank, collecting basic information about the three accounts which I had desired to reconcile. 

One of these accounts, in particular was associated with a supplementary health care credit source, which bore the highest balance and an aggregious interest rate to boot. During contact with the representative of this bank, the 'advisor' would periodically mute our correspondance to the representative, entreating me to testify that my net income had been halved since my application for said credit and that it would take a substantial amount of time for me to recover from such dire straights. 

Foolish may I be, I complied with what was represented to be fiduciary council. Upon subsequent consideration of the matter, I believe this to be fraud. 

Due to this testament, the bank offered me a substantial reduction in minimum payment at 0% interest for 48 months. After this, they secured my verbal authorization of five monthly installments of $178.80, promising to eventually negotiate the promised interest rate of 6% to my other two lines of credit. 

Four months later, there is little evidence to be shown that any progress has been made to reduce the interest rates from the other two banks. They obtain payments through electronic check, which bears their company information and a number of contact. I have called this number several times inquiring aboit the status of their negotiatiation, only to be given a generic response, entailing no aspect of detail or certainty.

When I pressed them upon their progress yesterday, the foreign representative suggested that they would obtain reductions to the outstaning lines through the same methoud as the one already reduced. This seems like Horseshit, and they threatened me with legal action if I were to somehow block the process of my last payment, which will be applied automatically in a few days. 

Any advice would be appreciated!",finance

I own an apartment which pays for itself with tenants (place is to far from my current job, hence I’m renting a place of similar value closer by)

Details about bad expenses:
Mom:
I support my mom (she works full time) by giving her extra every month to make ends meet. We don’t have a good relationship, so this is a grudge expense to keep her from contacting me for help. It’s not sustainable though, as inflation will catch up, and will start asking for more. Retirement is 10 years away for her. She won’t have enough saved up. Also I have a half brother who will finish school in about 8 years, not sure what’s his future holds without money to study etc. His deadbeat dad is out of the picture and cannot financially contribute

Brother:
I cover my brother’s rent. We have a good relationship and he does his bit to keep his expenses to a minimum. He works for me in the sideline business and gets minimum wage although the  work he does is worth way more than that. He used to be in a really bad space in his life and employing him in the sideline business has given him purpose in life. He has no formal qualification. Although extremely loyal, he needs a lot of coaching and if it were anyone else, I’d would have fired the person him for certain negligence.

Sideline business:
A business partner and myself owns a little side line business. After 2 years, It’s not profit generating. We both pay 6000 per month to cover the deficit. I’d like to get rid of the business, but my brother works for us, and I’m not sure he’ll be able to hold a job. Apart from that, I will be liable for a 150 000 loan that will need to be settled if I close the Business. And potentially other expenses cancelling lease agreements, laying off staff etc.

What’s not on this list:
I just got approval for a loan on a second apartment (1100 000) which I will rent out (there is a tax clause that offers me a tax break if I rent it out) this kicks in on September. Repayments will be 9000 and I expect to get between 7500 - 8000 in rent

I have credit card debt
2credit cards totalling about 90 000
I pay 12 000 - 15 000 (more than the minimum) back each month, but end up spending it all again. Reason for the 2 credit cards is each have different benefits I use. Interest rates are quite high in my country.

My aspirations:
I want to buy a house in the next 2 years as primary residence long term. A fix upper as I love DIY. Place I stay is pretty nice but homes in the area go for about 3 000 000. I most probably would need to put down 1 000 000 for the Bank to approve such a big loan and repayments would then be 20 000 a month. I could most likely get a housemate to reduce the loan expense. But I need to prove to the bank that I can cover the bond myself. I get about 300 000 in bonuses after tax annually and hope to put this towards deposit 

I want to eliminate the bad expenses. How do I put the money to better use to make my mom independent 
What’s better? Closing the sideline business, supporting my brother for awhile until he is independent? Or putting more cash and effort into the business?

I would like to investment small amounts for medium term. What are good reading material to learn what is best short/medium long term investments? 

I go on holiday once a year and spend about 60 000. Ideally I’d like to save up during the year instead of maxing out my credit cards every time.

So how do I put my spare cash hard at work, what do I do to become more disciplined at saving?

My fear is I’ll wake up one day being 40, and still be financially illiterate, with lots of dreams and no way of making them come true.",finance
personalfinance,Paying off high-interest student loans vs. contributing to retirement,"First time posting and had a question regarding paying down student loans vs. contributing to 401k. I am 32 with a total retirement balance of $3,800.  Currently I have 3 student loans:

1) Private Loan ($37,548) @ 6.49% 
2) Private Loan (11,913) @7.99% 
3) Federal Loan (25,619) @ 3.76%

Currently, I am contributing 12% of my monthly income to my Vanguard retirement account (6% pre-tax to 401k and 6% after tax to Roth).  These are diversified across small and large-cap domestic and international stocks and a small percentage to bonds.  My company matches 1.5% as long as I contribute 4% so I’m already meeting their max matching requirements. 

My question is how much should I contribute to my student loan repayments as the grace period ends in less than a month.   

 I’ve done a lot of reading regarding this topic and I’ve seen many people suggest paying down any loans over 6% then returning back to retirement and paying monthly minimums on the other loans?  I know there are schools of thought involving the psychological benefit of paying off debt but also the benefits of compounding interest of retirement funds.  However, there is also the undisputed guaranteed savings of reducing overall accrued interest payments of paying ONLY monthly minimums. 

I am looking for some advice or direction from others who might be in similar financial situations I also have a car loan of $23,809 @ 2.99%

TLDR:  I have 3 student loans that are ending their grace period and I am wondering if I should reduce my 12% retirement allocation to temporarily to pay down my student loans(or maybe just the most expensive ones first) then return to my retirement investing.",finance
Banking,Cashing third party checks at Wells Fargo,"Hey, I'm a Romanian student who worked the summer in the US and just got a check with my state taxes. Since cashing checks is pretty much difficult and takes very long in Europe, I thought about cashing it on a friend's Wells Fargo account using the mobile app.

After searching the web, I found that third party checks/double endorsements checks are not accept anymore at Wells Fargo. And, this is what's written on their Wells Fargo Community website:

*Wells Fargo may refuse to accept any item for deposit unless we are able to verify that all of the necessary endorsements are present on the check. For example, we may require that all endorsers be present at the time that a check is presented at a bank teller for deposit.*

*We may send a check for collection instead of depositing it. This means we send the check to the issuer's bank for payment, and your account will be credited when we receive payment from that bank.*

That **may refuse** gave me some hopes. Anyway, in order to double endorse it, I have to write *pay to the order of My Friend's name* on the **Endorse Here** section. But, if I do this and Wells Fargo still refuses it, I may not be able to cash it through the traditional 45 days long process here in Romania, where I go to a bank and they send in back to the US for cashing before giving me the funds.

I don't know what to do, tbh.  And this is only the check for the state taxes, the federal ones will come on another check too.",finance

The US Consumer Product Safety Commission was bent on getting Zen Magnets and Neoballs off the market because they are a hazard to children, even though we never sold them as kids toys. We got sued for a mandatory recall, while at the same time the CPSC banned the entire product category nationwide for all ages. Every other US company settled or stopped selling, including the [Buckyballs](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/03/business/last-maker-of-strong-magnets-deemed-hazard-to-children-fights-safety-ban.html) company. 

As a rule of thumb, brawling a deep pocketed Federal Agency is an exercise in futility. ""Fuck it, we'll sleep with less regret,"" or so we thought. Because magnets are perfectly safe if not ingested, and the right to read warnings was worth standing up for. Oh, and the [CPSC lied](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLwR81UyceE) about the injury data.

We've had more success fighting the CPSC than any company in 33 years by a long shot, and have made it this far in no small part due to the redditors that have supported us financially and morally, for whom we feel *so much* appreciation.

personalfinance,Did I screw something up? Paying off student loan debt for almost 8 years and still have $40K-only paid off $8K in principal so far.,"Hi, PR. I understand having student loan debt is plaguing a lot of users in this sub. That said, am I missing something when it comes to mine? 

I graduated in 2008 (yay, recession) and had both private and government loans. The government loans are fine, all things considered. No issues there.

My private loans were first through Citi Assist, and then subsequently sold/bought by Wells Fargo. I did have a couple years of deferment. Again, recession and it was the only option considering I couldn't get a job right after college. 

Fast forward to present day, I've been consistently paying the loan, which has an 8.50% interest rate, and I'm constantly defeated that the balance is where it is. Because of my circumstances, I selected the 25-year term with that interest rate, and now I feel like I've really hurt myself financially. 

I know this one is kind of vague, but is there something I can do to lower this payment/term? I honestly don't know if I can afford a higher payment, however. Right now, I'm paying $360 per month, and with other payments, life, kids, etc., that's about what I can do.

I decided not to sign off on the new loan.  They blow my phone and email up trying to get me to sign. I don't want it.  Fast forward a month. What shows up on my credit report but a new loan for the original amount of the loan AND the original loan. I was 10 payments in. These clowns tried to get me to restart the loan. They started the process WITHOUT me signing off on anything. Can you imagine what could've happened if I didn't check my credit report at all? Absolute scum. I called them immediately. I told them I didn't want it. They say they're taking it off now. What can I do now? Can I go after them? It's shitty that they can do this to people.

For those that don't have subscription to the FT, the article describes that the yields on the JPMorgan short and intermediate term indices inverted for the first time since 2007. However, the yield curves for the underlying countries are still positive sloping. The inversion was largely to do rising treasury yield due to the fed rate hikes while the rest of the world kept rates steady on the long end. Also, the maturity composition of treasuries is heavily tilted towards the shorter end, so the fed rate hikes are more impactful.

IMO, its hard to say if this is an indication of an impending recession. I have read research that yield curves tend to only work for the U.S. and Germany.",finance

At first i thought we could do this, and we almost did, but then things snowballed out of control.

I need help on getting my mind around these expenses, i need a stern talking to about my decisions, because it constantly feels like i have to hide from the truth, and my family deserves a real good chance at a better life.

51,000 gross (i take home about 3050 monthly with maxed out allowances)

**Debt:** 

~37,000 between parent plus loan, federal sub and unsub

~2,800 credit

Did not finish school do to family locking me in a financial aid/class registering loophole. Now owe school for a semester before they release transcript thus cannot continue education and 5,000 is really steep for me now with the hole ive dug.

Im already risking my lease by having an occupancy over 5, but its temporary, which the landlord made clear was okay (visiting family etc). With 2 ac's and 3 tvs, plus my pc, which i use regularly (and should cut back on) i know itll hurt.

We are tight. Super tight. and I have my daughters bday coming up and a baby shower to plan.

The birthday decorations and plates, goodie bags + 1 gift so far has costed $400. And she plans on spending more for gifts, and then we have to buy food. Its tough. I try to just cut out the fat but its still expensive.

Whats worse is she cant help. Because of her lack of education, almost any jog she finds would just barely pay for the incoming costs of childcare. And now with one more kid on the way its even more economically advantageous to just keep her home.

personalfinance,How does PF feel about refinancing for a fresh start?,"My wife and I made the mistake of racking up some debt from our wedding, honeymoon, and birth of our first child. All of these were major life events that we do not anticipate occurring again. We are weighing the option of refinancing for a fresh start and wanted to see what PF thinks. Here's our current situation:

* 3.625% FHA mortgage with MIP for entire life - 3 years into the 30 - $195k balance. 

* Current zestimate = $325k.

* CC balance = $15k. 0% through Nov 2018. All other CCs paid in full monthly, this balance from those major life events only. (If we do nothing, we can transfer this balance to another CC for 3% fee and buy ourselves another year or so to pay off.)

* Emergency fund is deficient = $4.5k. 3 months coverage would be $15k.

* Monthly net income of $1,200 which comes out to roughly 2 years before paydown of CC and getting emergency fund to 3 months (assuming nothing unexpected occurs).

* We do not anticipate moving in the next 5 years and we consider our jobs to be as secure as they can get.

We are considering refinancing to a conventional 30 year mortgage to cash out $25k (would also consider a 5 or 7 year ARM if that would be better to keep a similar interest rate). Including an estimated $6k in closing costs our monthly payment would increase about $100 but we would lose MIP. We feel this would make us more comfortable with our current financial situation, and we could then use our monthly income going forward to continue saving, pay off student loans, make extra payments on new mortgage, etc. It seems like from other posts most PFers will think we're crazy, but isn't there some value to a fresh start and piece of mind instead of stressing for the next 2 years?",finance
personalfinance,Need advice on purchasing a car.,"I’m in the market to buy a vehicle. Currently driving a 2004 Hyundai Elantra (live in Canada, Ont.) And it is on it’s last legs. I could put some money into it and keep it going but I frankly just don’t want to and would like to buy a new car.

My question is, is it better to do the 0% financing over a period of 7 years with a low monthly payment under 300$ or would it be better for me to use a LOC that has a 4.5% interest rate monthly.

I do not have a set paycheque as I run my own business and the vehicle would be registered as a business vehicle. 

Because the money I earn comes in randomly and in fluctuating amounts I will be able to drop chunks of money on the LOC monthly and could probably pay the car off in less than 3 years. But would have the interest payment that way. 

I would only like to spend between 15,000 - 20,000 on the price of the vehicle not including the hst. 

So to sum up, what’s better. 7 year term 0% monthly payments. Or LOC with 4.5 interest and can put down as much as I am able to and pay off in about 3 years.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks",finance

CryptoCurrency,My prediction on the SEC’s outcome,"![](http:/i65.tinypic.com/21o1w83.jpg)
[Source](https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/sec-warns-crypto-investors.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200)

My prediction on the SEC's outcome

Recently the [SEC has cleared up a lot of confusion with Ethereum](https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/14/17464692/sec-ethereum-tokens-securities-ether-yahoo-finance-summit). A lot of crypto investors believe that Ethereum is a security because they crowdfunded. I have a bone to pick with that definition, but I'll discuss it later. I'll discuss what a security is and the different forms of securities.

The top dogs

The big coins currently are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and EOS. I know that Bitcoin Cash also exists but Roger Ver is an asshole and I don't feel like falling into that rabbit hole right now. Instead let's start with why Ethereum isn't a security.

A security has two different forms; equities and debt. There are hybrids of the two, but these are the most common. According to [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp) ""It represents an ownership position in a publicly-traded corporation (via stock), a creditor relationship with a governmental body or a corporation (represented by owning that entity's bond), or rights to ownership as represented by an option"".

Ethereum has neither of those qualities. A stock, or share in a company, gives the investor a percent ""share"" of ownership of the company. Whenever you hear about a stock taker over it means that an investor has purchased enough shares of ownership to start making big decisions. Ethereum is specifically designed to NOT allow that to happen. In fact, all cryptocurrency are designed to prevent that exact event from happening. We call it 51% attack.

Ethereum did crowdfund but it doesn't have expiring debt period. After a certain period, Ether doesn't burn and pay out a yield to the investor. Instead Ethereum works as a gas. Smart contracts require this gas in order to function. The more complicated the smart contract the more gas it requires to run. This leads me to believe that Ethereum will be classified as a commodity much like actual petroleum is.

So, what about bitcoin and Litecoin? Well the issue is a currency is a monetary unit that comes from Central Banks. I know that wasn't always the case, but the FIAT system of banking is the benchmark that I will be using. Instead bitcoin is also similar to a commodity, but more like Gold. So where does Litecoin stand? More like Silver. Bitcoin = digital gold. Litecoin = digital silver.

EOS is another interesting case because it doesn't burn every time it's used like Ethereum but has smart contract feature unlike Bitcoin and Silver. You use EOS coins to stake bandwidth in the network. Having EOS coins granted you access like a subscription and the delegates vote on how to control inflation usually through the process of burning. This is similar to a deed in real estate which is an intangible asset which grants the owner special privileges.

So far we have covered Commodities and Intangible Assets but which one is a currency? Isn't that the reason we call it a crypto-currency? Surprisingly the only legitimate form of currency we have so far is Tether, but I have no doubt we will see Central Banks come out with their own tokenized FIAT.

Initial Coin Offerings

This is where we actually start to discuss securities. When a company decides to raise capital, they can either talk with private Venture Capitalists or go public. Going public gives investors shares of the company and requires a lot more overhead, but it's also a really big deal. I would argue it is viewed as a rite of passage in America. A lot of crypto companies are speculative and go public right away, and they can get away with it because there is no legal obligation for the company to respect ownership or debt unless it's written into the algorithm.

*I would like to write a little side anecdote and warn companies that plan on going public. Giving your company over to investors reduces the sovereignty and control you have. A lot of times shareholders will tie your hands behind your backs when it comes to having a shareholder first approach to profit. Sometimes being profitable isn't always what's best for the company's vision, but sometimes you and your executives legally can't do anything about it. I might write another article on this issue later...*

So back on track traditionally companies are regulated to follow specific rules like respecting shareholder legal right to vote, disclosing where their money is going via income statements, go through regular audits, are FDIC insured to protect investors from bankruptcy, and other legal regulations before they are allowed to be listed on on-shore major exchanges such as NASDAQ, DOW JONES, S&amp;P 500, etc. Since crypto companies have not regulated I don't think we will see any crypto indexes, ETFs, or other derivative products meant to shield investors from market volatility. Simply this means that a majority of investors don't want to invest in crypto projects yet. Contrary to popular belief the reason crypto hasn't taken off this year isn't due to lack of scalability or mainstream adoption but rather big-time investors are simply waiting until they see the green light.

I expect that companies that are currently being developed or have already gone live will be grandfathered in with a period where they will register. There will be a new job market opening up that combines tech auditing, legal, and account counseling. Requiring a token to comply with a regulation might end up having one of the nerds go through the code and verifying that there is a mechanism for such events such as dividend payouts, financial statements, voting systems, etc. This will ultimately reduce overhead for companies and allow a direct and more efficient connection between investors and executives. I could spend all day discussing each individual nuance, but I'll just leave it abstract for now.

Utility Tokens

So, when I was at Consensus 2018 I actually watched the lecture with one of the guys from Gibraltar (I don't remember his name). What I did remember from my notes made a lot of sense. Utility tokens that are used for services such as Golem and Streamr, where the product is a service on the network, should actually go under the FTC umbrella. The reason is they are consumer products and services and less financial instruments that would be regulated by the SEC.

You could technically consider Proof of Ownership on the network such as EOS coin a product and fall under the FTC as well. This distinction will be interesting to see how the federal regulators handle it.

Another key lecture I caught the curtails of was one of the chairmen of the Federal Reserve giving a statement on the Fed's current progress in making their decision. The key thing he made clear was they are thinking about using a SSRO approach. A SSRO, aka Single Source Regulation Office, is a regulatory body responsible for a narrow focus regulatory system. In this case I can imagine we would see a federal regulatory SSRO branch become designated for crypto. It was also made clear that the SSRO would NOT be a lobbying organization nor do they handle anti-monopoly laws which is music to my ears.

My take on everything

I watched the lecture over the discussion of Bit license in New York. It was pretty interesting not knowing what Bit license was previously. More or less some guy decided to work with regulators in New York to create a ""moat"" which was intended to protect consumers from bad actors, but it was built a little too deep. Right after building the moat with regulators he left and decided to sell the ""bridges"" next. You can see why this would be pretty shady. He just secured a job stifling crypto growth in a city that needs it the most. So, it's a safe bet that the next crypto wall street won't be in New York. In fact, it was hinted that it might be in Wyoming, but I don't know if that was just used as an example.

Do I think we need all this regulation? Absolutely yes. Unbridled markets will only hurt crypto and every time we enter -60, 70, and 80% bear markets this becomes more and more clear. Adoption will come when the market becomes less volatile.

Do I think the fed is being lazy? Absolutely not. It is important to take time and make sure you get it right. I don't think they'll get it perfect right away, but it's significantly harder to fix errors than to address them right away especially when it comes to global finance.

TL;DR

I make a prediction that Ethereum is a commodity like gas, Bitcoin is a commodity like Gold, Litecoin is a commodity like silver, EOS is a intangible asset and/or product, ICO's are securities unless they are utility in which they will be viewed as commercial products which the FTC will handle.

A bunch of nerds in suits will write legal codes into documents, Roger Ver is still an asshole, and a lot of people on /r/Bitcoin will be pissed off because they are idiots.

If you feel like this is just a copied article that I posted from a blog you are correct. I am a writer and I am passionate about crypto, but I respect the rules of Reddit and I will not be a shameless spammer that posts links. If you wish to support me or my blog I ask that you message me personally. Namaste!",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,Someday in the future when Large Corporations and Central Banks put CRYPTO on their balance sheet?,"What are you price targets for BTC, BCH, ETH, and LTC?

There is no exit plan in such a scenario where there are multiple decentralized top cryptos for the people and maybe several fed coins let alone token coined assets as conduits to the big game/picture of asset flow. Your exit plan is just to spend the money eventually or leave to your kids. Keep it in the ecosystem in other words as other smart TRUE believers have always said from day 1!

This note here today is not to pump, hype, etc. It is to show new buyers we are no where close to the end game in these assets yet. It is more like the end of the beginning/introduction of a book. The incessant non stop crypto hate by big banks and media is for a reason and lots of it is contrived so they can get a position on for the inevitable:

Central Banks putting these big cap cryptos on their balance sheets would put the 100k, 250k btc easily into the picture no doubt and probably 500k - 1 million

1 million btc is seriously not out of the question when you figure central bank buying, government buying, private and public corporations of the world buying...and holding as an asset over years.

100k ETH?  yep, possible

Again, buyers of the future won't even be thinking in terms of price but in terms of their stash holdings, their position size to work and transact in the new blockchain/cyptoeconomy. Get your heads around that for a second

1 ETH will be 1 ETH in 2050",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Student Loan question,"Just helped my son take out a loan through SallieMae to offset costs beyond the 529 we started too late for him.  Ouch.  Made sure he was clear on the financing costs, but I want to make sure I'm correct.

Due to the volatility of the market, I encouraged him to go with a fixed rate rather than a variable rate.  I also chose to save 0.50&amp;#37; by choosing the $25/month while in school option (saved $5,000 overall based on their numbers as opposed to deferring it completely). 

I fully intend to have him consolidate his loans (he'll be a freshman this year, so this is only year one) via SoFI or someone similar upon graduation in order to cut his interest rates close to in half.  That said, is there any reason we shouldn't be paying $100/month rather than $25 if he/we can swing it?  Are there pre-payment penalties that I'm unaware of with SallieMae?

Also, let me just say that it's disgusting how they gouge these kids on loan rates.  Kids should certainly need to pay interest on money they're borrowing, don't get me wrong, but 10-12&amp;#37; is pretty disgusting when there aren't many other options out there beyond SallieMae.  We earn too much for him to qualify for Pell Grants or other similar monies, but we also have four children which FAFSA doesn't seem to take into account in a proportional way.  Fortunately, he has plenty of co-op opportunities which will greatly defray the cost of his next three years of tuition.",finance
personalfinance,Student Loan Plan: Is it good?,"Hello, FTPLTL here.

I'm approaching my final year in college, and believe I have decided on a plan which may help me long term with student loan repayment once out of school. Here is my situation:

Currently I have a few sub and unsub Stafford loans through the federal government, with an outstanding principal of around $29,000. Next year, I will likely have to take out an additional $3000 in loans to finance my final year of school (maybe less, I have to run a few more calculations). I intend to borrow with Citizens Bank for this, as the research I have done indicates they are among the best student lenders. I also have a $5000 Sallie Mae loan that is sitting at 9.5% interest. 

My intention is to consolidate all of my loans after school with Citizens Bank for a longer repayment period at a fixed rate (better than Sallie Mae, and the federal government), and then once I am in a better place financially (begun my career etc.) beat them down significantly faster than the repayment period may state. My reasoning stems from my current financial situation (car loan, credit card bills, and rent + COL expenses) and how much I currently make. I am worried, therefore, that once I graduate from school and begin repaying multiple different loan accounts I will be stretched far too thinly to pay my bills. A loan consolidation in this case seems to be my best option.

Can anyone share an insight into this, and whether this is a smart move? I think it may be but I am open to suggestions and better options.",finance
personalfinance,"23 years old, would like investing/saving help.","Hello, I’m 23 years old and working my first “real job” after graduating college, my salary is $40k/yr.

The only big debts I have is student loans ($20k) and I’m paying the minimum of $217/mo on it. The interest rate is 4.09%, should I be paying more on it? I have a car but it's already paid off so not worried there.

I also have a 401(k) with my company where I contribute 8% per check. My company does a partial match of 50% of the first 6% of contributions. Is my 8% contribution too much? I assume it is but would like insight here as well.

Any other ideas and/or general insight is greatly appreciated!

Update: Turns out my employer offers the 401(k) along with a Roth 401(k). I had the option to switch my 401(k) contribution amount, which I did. There was also a place for me to add a contribution amount for a Roth. I lowered the 8% to 6% for my 401(k) and added that 2% to the Roth.

btc,"The Lightning Network on top of Bitcoin is like a strangler fig tree. ""The Lightning system itself becomes the token, leaving Bitcoin, Litecoin and all Blockchains as dead and hollow ghosts of their former state.""","&gt; The last start of a system such as Lightning is the creation of a system that mirrors a Strangler fig. This is portrayed in the image below. The Lightning system itself becomes the token, leaving Bitcoin, Litecoin and all Blockchains as dead and hollow ghosts of their former state. The myth is that we need to have an underlying system such as Bitcoin. I say myth here as the truth is we live in a world where legal tender is no longer backed by sound monetary policy and is designed to support the goals of the state.

&gt; In time, if Lightning was to become a trusted medium of exchange, it leads to the perverse scenario where it no longer requires a commodity base to make it work. This leads to a system of State currency that eats cryptocurrency (such as Bitcoin) away leaving only the promise of what it was. Some will get rich from this, but the system will not be Bitcoin, it will be a form of government exchanges and banks that swap account balances.

&gt; You can be told how this will never occur, but there is no other end. Exchanges and Lightning hubs are already systems that come within the control of the legal system. Once the controls and requirements to alter balances are incorporated (and this path leads to a Proof of State system with a Ripple-like consensus), the system is just the shell of what created it.

&gt; Lightning becomes the system that enslaves, not the system that frees the world.

&gt; It has been (deceptively) argued that for Bitcoin to use Payment channels, a malleability fix is required. This was and never shall be the case. Payment channels have been a feature of Bitcoin since the initial release. It was later that many of the features that helped make this simpler have been disabled and removed.

&gt; The truth is one of bitcoin being stronger as an alloy. SegWit (Segregated Witness) was incorporated into bitcoin to remove a (disingenuously) created vulnerability that never existed. The argued reason was to allow Bitcoin to utilise payment channels [11]. The truth is payment channels do not require non-malleable transactions. The only requirement for removing Malleability is to allow Lightning to act as a promissory note over Bitcoin and other blockchains. That is, to allow it to consume Bitcoin and to remove the economic system that created bitcoin.

&gt; The Lighting System differs from anything that Bitcoin used. It is a system of punishment-based bi-directional payment channels. It uses negative inducements rather than positive economic incentives as would be the case in Bitcoin natively. Punishment based channels of the form implemented in Lightning require a malleability fix. Payment channels and even atomic swaps can be completed without a malleability fix. A non-issue.

&gt; A high-frequency system such as we see discussed above never required malleability to be removed. Malleability is of no concern to this system.

&gt; The thing that matters far more than any of the technical uses of Malleability[3] is what malleability breaks. It makes the creation of a parasitic overlay more difficult and economically less viable. Bitcoin is a system that is resilient in many ways. The central aspect of this is that in its true form, it can capture other systems while remaining challenging to capture itself. More than anything else, SegWit and related “fixes” remove this resilience.

&gt; Without some level of transaction Malleability, the system can easily fragment into many coins, and these can then be captured (and consumed) by a system that is a digital equivalent of the existing fiat system. If you want to create a system that replaces fiat with a system controlled by the banks and government but which is more insidious… then you should be supporting SegWit and Lightning.

&gt; A miner of Bitcoin Core (BTC) should be concerned. BTC Hodl’ers should be concerned. Lightning required that malleability be removed as this allows the system to move to long-term channels that with cross chain swaps can eventually remove the underlying commodity cryptocurrency. As noted above, this in all forms is a security and is in the range of systems that require registering and management under the various AML/CTF laws.

&gt; In any system where there are asymmetries, one side has an advantage. In Bitcoin, the network was incentivised asymmetrically to allow for the growth of a small world and eventually a near complete graph. In Lighting, this forms a loose mesh with a small number of centrally controlled choke points. The economics of each system are designed with distinctly separate goals in mind.

&gt; Removing transaction malleability does not make Bitcoin more secure, it allows for a system of off chain swaps. It makes the creation and integration of side-chains simpler and removes one of the critical aspects of Bitcoin, scarcity. When Lightning (or another system in a similar form) can set the terms of the settlement and, in time even alter settlement to remove the requirement to hold the currency, we end where we are now. A system that has and will be debased.

&gt; At least Bitcoin Cash (BCH) managed to avoid this trap.

gaming,A Little Honesty About Ubisoft,"I've had this game since around it's launch. I've bought every season pass and supported the devs and spoke out for it-even just last week-because it is a genuinely fun game when it works, but let's talk about the company behind it for a second. 

Rainbow Six Siege worked fine last week and then all of a sudden it broke and wouldn't update. It took me 3 hours of running back and forth and tinkering around until I finally found a way to fix it and even now instead of ""play"" it says ""update"" in UPlay but luckily it has been launching the game fine. I played for hours yesterday and it worked fine. Then I come back today and I'm being put into infinite matchmaking loops. I haven't hacked, the worst thing I've done in a long time was kill 2 people who killed me every round in casual and get kicked. 

But my problem isn't that this game is so full of bugs, or that UPlay is shit, or that matchmaking itself is garbage-it's how incredibly consistent it's been since the beginning. It's been years but there are still many bugs that should have been solved a long time ago. Matchmaking is still garbage, and even when it works, it pairs you up with people who 60&amp;#37; of the time will leave-even in ranked. New bugs that come out take weeks to fix if they get fixed at all. New operators are unbalanced and given to season pass owners 7 days early and have much better gadgets while old ones are rarely tuned up. 

It is now 4:40 pm and I've been trying to get into a game since 2:30 pm and honestly I'm fed up with this company. 

You know what I see when a company continuously makes new content for 2 and a half years without improving their game? That they don't care about the game or the people playing it. That they would rather make more money than to actually fix the damn game. I feel like not a single penny has been invested into servers since it came out because there is hardly any difference-and I'm in North America. I can't imagine what the rest of the world must be getting. I have spent more time trying to fix this game and deal with UPLAY then I have ANY other game-and I buy quite a few early access games. It's sad that a major company like Ubisoft can be so much shitier than new, tiny developers. 

So from this day on, I'm no longer going to speak out for Rainbow Six. This was the last game from Ubi I supported and from now on, I'd rather send my season pass money to Supercell instead-a fucking mobile game company. You are no better than EA ubi, instead of making great games that run well, you've chosen to focus on making hard cash instead and frankly-you're ruining some incredible franchises doing it.",technology

CryptoCurrency,"Tangle (DAG), The Phenomenal Solution Oriented Approach to all Blockchain Cryptocurrencies woes","https://i.redd.it/ij86oj9478511.png

Tangle (DAG) for some is a just a buzzword, while for others, it has become the best way of crypto financing or may be, a way of living. There are a number of different cryptocurrencies flourishing in the market such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, ETH, NEM, Ripple, IOTA and Litecoin etc. All these cryptocurrencies have multi-billion dollar worth in the financial market but still, there are some technology related shortcomings Let us first look at the evolution of Tangle (DAG), what it is actually and how it has become, what it is today.

**Evolution of Tangle (DAG):**

DAG in Tangle stands for Directed Acyclic Graph. So, it is a kind of a directed graph type which employs such data structure which brings into use the topological ordering as well. The system is designed in such a way that the sequence could only possibly move from the earlier to the later point and not otherwise. Briefly, it has application where there are issues related to the processing of data, looking for the optimized navigation path, scheduling and data compression. In order to understand the evolution of Tangle (DAG), we need to connect dots back in the year 2015, when the blockchain was the standalone ruling technology. Before this enormous popularity of blockchain was achieved, it was just known as a conventional data structure that is using the Bitcoin technology. So, the transition from just being an ordinary technology to a popular one helped it gain the title of Blockchain 1.0, the pioneer and the first of its kind. 

That was the time when Ethereum based model (also used by **CyBitTM**) was creating great waves in the crypto circle as a much loved decentralized platform which was preferred for running just as it is programmed. Soon, with time, Ethereum model became to be known as the Blockchain 2.0. This is the time when there are many speculations about what would become the Blockchain 3.0. This could probably be the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for a number of its good characteristics which might not be possessed by all of its predecessors or other related technologies.

**Bitcoin VS Tangle (DAG):**

**What is Bitcoin?**

Bitcoin is the pioneer in the decentralized digital currency, where their worldwide payment system is made to work without having any central authority, single administrator or a central bank. Unlike the fiat currencies, Bitcoin has got limited supply which is tightly scrutinized by the underlying algortithm.it is an open source platform whose code is readily available over the web in order to be manipulated by the project developers as per their needs in the projects.

**Pros:**

· It comes with a minimal transaction cost.

· The digital nature provides immense protection against possible payment fraud.

· Bitcoin just on its own made over $8 billion in transactions as compared to a total of $132 million done altogether by Fedwire, Bank of America, Western Union, PayPal and Automated Clearing House (ACH).

· Ensures direct transfer and eliminates any need for third party approval for payments.

· The technology protects your identity and other information over the public network.

**Cons:**

· Transactions carried through Bitcoin blockchain network are irreversible. It means if you make a transaction accidentally then your funds are lost forever. 

· Bitcoin has scalability issues as a block size limit of 1MB is still imposed.

· By nature, the Bitcoin network could be used for illicit funding and immoral activities.

**Comparison of Bitcoin VS Tangle (DAG):** 

· **Centralization –** We have seen earlier that small miners makes large groups for the sake of lessening the reward’s variation. This situation propels into the concentration of power going into the control of a handful of operators. It enables them to implement policies of wide spectrum, including postposing and filtering policies over a certain range of transactions. Although, no reporting of such incidents anytime in the past with the misuse of power but certainly there was the presence of such an opportunity. This is what Tangle is. Bitcoin, on the other hand is known for somewhat having a centralized control. Just imagine that there are 10 mining pools which accounts for 80 percent of the mined blocks over the past week and all exist Japan. This is an issue as just imagine a regulation change in Japan resulting in a large chunk Bitcoin hardware getting totally isolated from the other parts of the world.

· **Cryptography –** Tangle technology make use of the quantum resistant algorithms for cryptography which are immune to any kind of the brute force attack. Moreover, Tangle also diminishes any chances of having a Quantum consensus attack impact by a million times. This on the other side is an issue with Bitcoin, as that could be crippled with an instantaneous Quantum computers large scale deployment. 

· **Micropayments –** Bitcoin in its initial days had very low transaction fees and was the unique selling point of Bitcoin at that time. But, with time, the transaction fees went quite high. Tangle, has no transaction fees, whatsoever. You may send a token worth a fraction of dollar with no payment of any transaction fees.

· **Partition –** Bitcoin requires transactions to be fully relayed by the nodes that are hooked up with the network. There is no possibility of carrying out any transactions in an off-chain manner as the ledger update is constantly required in order to restrict ant double spends cases. The Tangle may operate without the need to be hooked up with the main Tangle. You may do so with the connection with ease and whenever you want. 

**Ethereum VS Tangle (DAG):**

**What is Ethereum?**

Ethereum is one of the finest and innovative open source blockchain technology offering distributed computer network. Ethereum by nature is very much similar to the Bitcoin technology discussed above but, there are some notable technology-based differences between the two. Their major difference is in their capability and purpose. With an Ethereum blockchain as the one entrusted by **CyBitTM**, the miners work for earning Ether, which is a particular type of a crypto token required for fueling the network, instead of mining bitcoin. Ether more so is also employed by the developers of the platform to pay the required transaction fees and for any of the services on the Ethereum network.

**Pros:**

· In an Ethereum network, no third party could ever make any possible change to the data.

· The Ethereum platform is totally corruption free as it is almost impossible to make any kind of censorship.

· Any app that is connected to Ethereum would hardly ever go down and this could never be shut down as well.

· Ethereum can largely be trusted for the fundraising campaigns by making use of the smart contracts.

· There is no set limit for the platform in Megabytes

· Ethereum, for mining the Ether tokens just takes about 14seconds, which is quick as compared to the bitcoin, that takes somewhere over 4 hours.

· The algorithm that the network uses for mining Ether tokens is known as “Proof of Work” and this is smart enough to restrict any kind of hacker attacks.

**Cons:**

· The smart contracts are programmed manually so there is an element of possible human error which could lead to code bugs and result in unintended actions to be taken.

· If there is any possible attack or exploitation in the network then only possible way to stop this is to rewrite the underlying code and go for a network consensus prior to that.

**Comparison of Ethereum VS Tangle (DAG):**

· **Mining –** Ethereum is totally dependent upon the miners to work for validating the carried transactions. Tangle on the other hand does not need miners to validate any transaction. Actually, every transacting device over the network of Tangle is required for validating transactions. 

· **Speed –** The transaction speed of Tangle is about double to that of the Ethereum. In actual comparison, Ethereum takes about 6 minutes for completing its transaction while Tangle takes just about 3 minutes for doing the same job. 

· **Transaction Speed -** As Tangle by nature has no miners at all in its network, so for carrying out any transactions, no transaction fees is required to be paid. On the flipside, Ethereum does require a transaction fee to be paid in order to complete it. 

· **Efficiency –** Tangle is far more efficient than the Ethereum as lack of mining means that not much energy is required for running the Tangle network. Ternary logic in place of the binary logic also makes Tangle network more efficient. Ethereum is still known for relying on mining and for this reason, it consumes a lot of energy.

· **Open Source –** Ethereum enjoys a completely open source platform, in contrast to the closed-nature platform of Tangle, which is highly criticized for such a structure.

· **Inflation –** IOTA, one of the application of Tangle is known to have all its tokens being already issues. On the other end, the supply for Ethereum would always be increasing. This scenario in other word means that Ethereum has a risk for inflation and Tangle doesn’t. 

**NEM VS Tangle (DAG):**

**What is NEM?**

NEM is a versatile open source natured blockchain platform which came into the crypto scene in January 2014. It is popular for meeting the requirements of the mainstream industry which are known to stretch far ahead in the clean crypto type applications. This incredible financial solution can be entrusted for the varying needs such as for making payments and ensuring settlement in a completely controlled and as well as private environments. NEMs private version is known as Mijin which is popularly used in Japan by 140 plus institutions. 

**Pros:**

· NEM is loved by most of the users for the fact that it has pure and a highly tried and tested application outside of the crypto. It is applicable for real world applications and can be used for settling any asset.

· NEM uses harvesting model instead of the conventional mining. Users are tempted to harvest more for the incentive or the reward they get for harvesting.

· Transaction fees is the lowest among many of the blockchain cryptocurrencies.

· NEM has the potential to verify a transaction just in a matter of little over a couple of minutes.

· NEM can be used for a lot more applications other than just the financial and monetary solutions. For example, theoretically, NEM can be used for storing any kind of official documents such as company shares or birth certificates etc.

**Cons:**

· Proof of work is used by the NEM model which in today’s time is just considered as a total waste of time, computing energy and other monetary resources.

· Scalability just like Bitcoin is an issue having a block size fixed at 1MB.

**Comparison of NEM VS Tangle (DAG):**

· **Public or Private –** The NEM technology has got the potential to impeccably interface between he private and public network chains. This enables you to transfer files, crypto tokens or currency from your internal private network to another company’s private network using the public blockchain. On the other hand, Tangle majorly is a public network.

· **Speed –** Speed is the best selling point of NEM. NEM is known for completing its transaction successfully in 3 seconds. This is quite low as compared to that of Tangle which is around 3 minutes. Although, 3 minutes for Tangle is still good as compared to several other blockchain based cryptocurrencies.

· **Transaction Fee –** NEM does have a transaction fee to be paid for every transaction carried, along with any additional fee if message is included. The Tangle on the other hand has absolutely no fee for carrying out transactions over its network. 

· **Fork –** NEM is an open source project and it’s codebase is available online so that any developer working on NEM project could download, modify and upload the code as per their project’s requirements. On the other end, Tangle is completely closed-end solution with no such flexibility available as compared to NEM or may be other blockchain technologies. 

· **Harvesting –** NEM employs the concept of harvesting instead of mining. In this case, approved users only with a certain number of XEM could only harvest. This makes absolutely no room for cheating or a scam to take place. The Tangle on the other end does not require mining for validating transactions, but nonetheless, it is also a secure model for users.

**Litecoin VS Tangle (DAG):**

**What is Litecoin?**

Litecoin, under the blockchain umbrella comes as one of the many online currencies of decentralized nature. The currency could be employed for performing online transactions and purchases, including website development, buying subscriptions or ordering things like jewelry online. Just like other blockchain based cryptocurrencies, it provide users with a very easy and quick method for accepting money online. The payment receiver has the potential for quick verification of the transaction made and this Litecoin platform is actually much quicker than Bitcoin and several other blockchain based technologies.

**Pros:**

· Litecoin in terms of completing a transaction is the fastest among many of the popular blockchain based cryptocurrencies.

· The transaction fee in this model is as good as zero as compared to Bitcoin.

· Mining is far easier in Litecoin as compared to other cryptocurrencies due to the inclusion of its innovative ‘Prove of Work’ algorithm.

· Litecoin has a very low market cap when compared with the other top of the line tokens in the crypto market of today.

· Security is impeccable which has grown in quality since its inception some 6 years ago.

**Cons:**

· Litecoin is touted as a kind of modified version of bitcoin and it lacks innovations of its own. It has got significant identity problem and it gets a kind of over-shadowed in the presence of Bitcoin crypto platform.

· Once the scalability issue of Bitcoin is resolved then Litecoin market would definitely be negatively impacted.

**Comparison of Litecoin VS Tangle (DAG):**

· **Speed –** In comparison to the 3 minutes speed of transaction completion for the Tangle platform, the speed for same for the Litecoin is 10 times than the Tangle. Yes, you read that right, transaction speed for Litecoin is 30 minutes. However, Litecoin transaction validation is very quick and is just a matter of seconds.

· **Transaction feed –** As stated above in comparison of multiple other blockchain platforms with Tangle, the later has got no transaction fees at all. In case of Litecoin, there is a transaction fee but that is too little.

· **Mining –** Litecoin like almost all other blockchain based cryptocurrencies rely over the mining mechanism for validating all the transactions carried on through its network. On the other hand, Tangle as mentioned above does not require mining at all.

· **Market Cap –** Litecoin is known to have a market cap which is even lower than that for NEM and ETC, which is required when the volumes are higher. On the other hand, Tangle is fully scalable and does not have any such market cap imposed.

**The Critical Tangle bug:**

As we have learned by now that the Tangle network has got the potential to validate transactions in quick time, which is all thanks to its graph structure. However, it has also been noticed that the current implementations in several crypto projects are seeing another big issue of synchronization. It is the need for the synchronization of the states in the network between the nodes. There are ICOs using such models who have multiple impractical solutions to these issues. Some are having a single node controller mechanism while some using a multi-node (as many as 12 nodes) controller. Such controllers are operated directly by the developer and this does not make it an ideal solution, mainly because of having immense human intervention, leading to many possible human errors. Furthermore, it is also not ideal because of having a single point of failure. 

**The Blockless Model Idea:**

Just as we write this, the IOTA, IoT Chain and Byteball are the major players in the crypto market that are categorized as the blockless projects. With the blockchain core cryptocurrencies, the main bottleneck is the limited creation speed. As far as bitcoin is concerned then it is known to generate a new block in every 10 minutes which is too long to manage a highly complex network. Ethereum on the other hand is much better, but still it takes some 20 seconds for the purpose of validating the block. Has anybody ever thought that why at all we need a block? If you understand the bitcoin network then it is seen that numerous transactions carried are actually mined into the form of block. At the same time, the sequence of transaction is recorded by the pre-hashes that exists between the blocks. So, how is that for an idea if we go on to combine the transactions and blocks together? In this situation, every transaction should be made involved directly in the maintenance of the sequences. So, once, any transaction is carried, there is a possibility for the mining process to be skipped. This all shapes up into an efficient, blockless model which will have the best of both the blockchain and Tangle technologies, thus giving us the most optimized and trusted solution.

**Final Word:**

In essence, blockchain is good with its data integrity features and in security and transactions handling features, Tangle has a definite edge over blockchain. At this point of time, it could be concluded that Tangle is better than blockchain, but at the same time, it doesn’t take much away from the credibility of the blockchain as the other is a novice technology and taking its stepping stones towards success. However, it can be safely said that tangle has got great potential for beating blockchain in the near future.

personalfinance,Best way to save for a down payment in 5 years?,"Hey everyone!

So, I live in the Bay Area where homes are impressively expensive. The good news is that I work at a big tech place with nice stock. Let's say I'm looking for a 1.5M home in 4 or 5 years and plan to sell off my stock when I'm ready to do that (since homes in SF are appreciating faster than my stock is). Let's assume my down payment safely be $350,000 and that my stock will give me $175,000 by that time. That means I need to make up a delta of \~$175,000.

Currently, I'm paying....

* $675 Car Payment
* $775 401(k) Pretax
* $400 Personal Savings

...each month.

What's the best way to turn that into $175k in 4 years? Do I stop contributing to my 401(k)? Do I use my bonus to pay off my car (2.9&amp;#37; interest rate, 2/3rds paid off) or throw it into down payment savings? Where do I save it?

Thank you!",finance
personalfinance,Car loan,"Hi guys. So I need to buy a car, and I haven’t decided yet whether I want a new car or a used car, but what I do know is that I don’t want a beater car as I’ll be using it to commute ~100 mi a day. I have about 10k in savings for a car but I know that just isn’t going to meet my needs. So basically I need a loan of about 5-7k and I really just have no idea how any of this works. I talked to my bank about a personal loan which quickly revealed that personal loans are a terrible idea because of the insanely high interest rate. I have very good credit and I’d like to pay as little interest as possible (i realize that’s probably a stupid thing to point out cause who wouldn’t? But I don’t know!). Can anyone point me in the right direction? Are there companies that are currently offering very good rates or something? Am I overthinking it and most companies pretty much offer the same rate? I just don’t want to make a huge costly mistake! Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Should I delete my highest interest loan and pay the rest off in 2 years or pay all of them off over 4 years?,"Hi, so I'm 22, just graduated college, and started my big boy job. I finished college in 3 years and co-oped for 1.5 years and interned for about a year across the summers so I've already paid off ~$25k in loans. I have $33k left, but it's eating away at me.

I finally received my tax return and it's enough to pay off my 12% loan which would free up at least 1.5 years for my loan repayment.

My two scenarios are as follows:




Interest Rate | Case 1 Payment | Case 2 Payment
---|---|----
11.5% | 500 | 0
6.0% | 350 | 500
4.7% | 250 | 350
4.5% | 200 | 350
4.3% | 200 | 300
Years until debt-free | 4 | 2

It actually should take slightly less time for both of them since I did this fairly quickly in excel and didn't vary the payments after each loan was paid off and didn't take into account raises or bonuses over the years. 

Is this a smart or stupid decision? I am also contributing 10% to my 401K, a decent amount to my HSA, and have accounted for all of my bills, insurance, and random shopping and car expenses. My car may die during this time as I commute 600 miles per week to work, but I have $300/mo allocated to my emergency fund and my emergency fund is currently at $10k.",finance

Bitcoin,"Bitcoin won't replace the dollar, the pound, the euro or yen...","...stablecoins will. It's my belief that stablecoins will slowly become the new medium of payment and we shouldn't be worried by that. It will get more and more people into crypto. 

Stablecoins will be pegged 1:1 with sovereign/national currencies. That means they'll still be subject to quantative easing etc, but they won't suffer from the same volatility as traditional cryptos like bitcoin and ethererum. 

As time goes on, consumers and merchants won't see the need to redeem their USDC for USD and therefore the adoption of USDC and other stablecoins increases, adding to the overall adoption of crypto. 

I believe that will be the time where Bitcoin's decentralised, immutable qualities will start to shine.

More and more people will get fed up of the constant increase in supply of USDC, GBPC, EURC etc and realise that their better off keeping their savings in BTC and only cashing out into the relevant stablecoin as and when they need to.

Disclaimer: I do not hold any responsibility towards investment loss from following this guide. Seek professional advice if needed.

Target audience: Beginners to stock trading (from never done it to less than 1 year experience)

\[Use google doc link for better formatting:[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D-dbYKQ0VsX4PRQ2lt4aabLmundYKZIJ7wHKeKOlrwA/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D-dbYKQ0VsX4PRQ2lt4aabLmundYKZIJ7wHKeKOlrwA/edit?usp=sharing)\]

**Four Steps Guideline:**

1. Determine how much money you can spare for investment
2. Buy an S&amp;P 500 index (S&amp;P 500  is “the market”) (for example: SPY, VOO, IVV)
3. Hold it for many years
4. Get a good return (10&amp;#37; per year on average) after years of not touching your investment. =)

The rest of the document discuss why the four steps guideline makes you a good investor. The four steps guideline is based upon four investment principles. I personally think they are the four most important ones.

**Four Key Investment Principles:**

1. Never think you can outrun the market
2. Returns always comes with risk. The higher the return the higher the risk.
3. Diversify
4. Only do long term investment

**Some Definitions to terms I’ll be using:**

market: the US stock market. By outrunning the market people usually means to have a higher return than the US stock market as a whole.index: index is a collection of stocks, hundreds of them. Index has the natural property of being diversified because of the quantity and variety of stocks it is composed of.S&amp;P 500: S&amp;P 500 is an index composed of all the big companies in US. Apple, Amazon, Coca-cola, Wellsfargo, you name it. S&amp;P 500 is a good proxy of how the “market” perform. In other words, to buy S&amp;P 500 means you are buying the “market” and performing just as well as the market.

**#1. Never think you can outrun the market**

There are always people who are smarter than you, have more resource into studying the market and trade advantage when it comes to buying and selling real time (I’m referring to the investment banks, hedge funds and high frequency trading institutions). To think that by studying the market personally you can know more than these institutions is naive.

Think of it this way: among the retail investors who do individual stock picking and trade frequently, only 20&amp;#37; of them can actually outrun the market while 80&amp;#37; of them do worse than the market and lose out on trading fee. The chances are, you’re among the 80&amp;#37; if you’re doing stock picking.Luckily, while outperforming the market rarely happens for retail investors, matching the market performance is very easy. We do that by buying the market (S&amp;P 500)

**Implications of #1:**

* Do not do stock picking (sayings like: “I know that Uber has a new invention/technology, the stock price will surely raise so let’s buy in” or “I have paid attention to the market trend a lot, I can forsee it going up soon so let’s buy in” are nonsense)
* Buy the market (S&amp;P 500) but not individual stock.

**#2. Returns always comes with risk. The higher the return the higher the risk.**

The only riskless investment is the US treasury bond, which gives you 0.5-2&amp;#37; interest annually. But as a riskless investment, it is nonetheless better than simply leaving it in the bank (which gives you like 0.01-0.5&amp;#37; interest annually). If you are worried about inflation (1-3&amp;#37; per year), you can consider TIPS, a US government bond whose face value rise with inflation, and it gives you about 1&amp;#37; interest after adjusting for inflation.Any investment that beats the treasury bond interest rates has risk that comes with it.

The US market historically has earned 15-20&amp;#37; annually when the economy is good and **lost 25-35\% annually when the economy is bad**. The good news is that good times happened more often than bad times (historically); so if you invest for long enough, you’ll probably go through more good times than bad times and have a net gain to your investment (roughly 10&amp;#37; a year on average)

**#3. Diversify**

While risks are a necessary component when it comes to investment, not all risk are born equal. There are risk that gives you higher return and risk that don’t. We call the ‘unnecessary’ risk idiosyncratic/non-systematic risk; and you can avoid ‘unnecessary’ risk simply by buying index but not individual stocks.**Implications of #3:**

* Buy index (for example, S&amp;P 500) but not individual stock.

**#4. Do long term investment**

By long term I mean at least 2 years; preferably 5+ years; the longer the better. To do a 5 years investment on index A means to buy index A then let it sit for 5 years. Whether the price go up or down today doesn’t matter to you. You simply let it sit for 5 years. Surprisingly, that’s the best thing you can do to avoid losing money unnecessarily.There are two reasons why you only want to do long term investment. First, as a retail investor, you essentially lose a small amount of fee  (trading commission, transaction cost)  every time you trade. Even through some places offers no commission trading, you still lose in the bid ask spread and the information disadvantage.

The second reason is more subtle, which I will illustrate in the appendix section. To summarize it in a simple way, holding an investment for a long horizon diversify your risk throughout the years. The longer you hold your investment, the less likely you’ll experience an overall loss. If you held the market for a 20 years horizon you average a 10&amp;#37; gain per year, even through financial crisis.

**Implications of #4:**

* Buy index and hold it for 2 year+, the longer the better.

Again, **the Four Steps Guideline**:

1. Determine how much money you can spare for investment; they should be spare money in the sense that even if you lost your investment you can still go on normal with your life. You shouldn’t have to cut your daily spending or alter your life plan because you realize a loss in your investment (not retirement fund, not education fund, not fund for purchasing a house, not fund for raising children, etc.)
2. Buy an S&amp;P 500 index (S&amp;P 500  is “the market”) (for example: SPY, VOO, IVV)
3. Hold it for many years
4. Get a good return (10&amp;#37; per year on average) after years of not touching your investment. =)

Return and risk to the Four Steps Guideline (buying S&amp;P 500 index and hold it for a long time):

Historically, you earn 15-20&amp;#37; annually when the economy is good and **lose 25\%-35\% annually when the economy is bad**. I performed a very basic analysis in appendix A on your prospects of gain and loss with buying S&amp;P 500.

If the thought of losing 25&amp;#37; on any year is unbearable for you, instead of buying S&amp;P 500 index only you should mix it with treasury bonds under a certain ratio. **By adjusting the ratio you can in turn scale down your risk**. (which of course scale down the return at the same time.

**Commonly asked Questions and Misconceptions**

**Can I get a higher return from the stock market if I hire an investment advisor/manager?**

**No.** In general, hiring an investment manager won’t give you better return. On average, investment fund manager has perform worse than the market. I haven’t even counted the managing fees in, which could cost up to 3&amp;#37; of your investment annually. If you can follow the 4 steps above, there are really no reason to hire an investment manager, unless you have a big enough amount of investment (like 500k+) (this guide doesn’t apply to you in that case) . Even then the chances for your manager to actually be able to beat the market is low.

\*If your investment has a special purpose, like doing a retirement fund, the Four Steps Guideline is not for you. Fund managers can help you, not in picking a better stock or outperforming the market, but in tailoring the investment and risk to your personal need.

**I’m worried about buying in when the market is about to go down. How can I avoid that? (Should I buy in when the market has gone down a little bit, hoping it would bounce back?)**

Remember principle #1, never think you can outrun the market. In reality, not even the experts or professionals can predict whether the market will go up or down tomorrow. So don’t worry about guessing when the market will go up.

Now there is actually a way to reduce your chance of going all in when the market is about to drop. The technique is called *Dollar-Cost Averaging*, essentially buying equal amounts of investments at regular intervals. Look it up online if this interest you.

**I paid attention to the Wall Street Journal and Yahoo! Finance News very often. Does that help in picking a better stock or predict when the market is going up better?**

Remember principle #1, never think you can outrun the market. Reading news in WSJ or Yahoo! Finance wouldn’t help because, there are always professionals who know about those news before you (Aside from millions of readers reading it before you). If there are any profit that anyone can exploit from those news, they would certainly have exploited them before you do. So no, reading WSJ or Yahoo! Finance wouldn’t help you outrun the market.

**Appendix A: Risk and Return prospects of Four Steps Guideline Method (buying S&amp;P 500 index and hold it for a long time)**

Table A listed the 1 year, 5 year, 10 year and 20 year average return of holding S&amp;P 500 since 1990. It also listed the average return per year for each horizon.

Table A

\[see google doc link for the table: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D-dbYKQ0VsX4PRQ2lt4aabLmundYKZIJ7wHKeKOlrwA/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D-dbYKQ0VsX4PRQ2lt4aabLmundYKZIJ7wHKeKOlrwA/edit?usp=sharing) \]

Our sample start from 1990. Let’s look at the likelihood for you to gain or loss in your investment for each horizon.

If you are doing a **1-year investment**, over the last 27 years

Prob. of above 10&amp;#37; return = P(x&gt;10&amp;#37;)= 16/27 = 59&amp;#37;

Prob. of a net positive return = P(x&gt;0&amp;#37;)= 22/27 = 81&amp;#37;

Prob. of below -10&amp;#37; return = P(x&lt;-10&amp;#37;)= 5/27=19&amp;#37;

If you are doing a **5-year investment**, over the last  27 years

Prob. of above 10&amp;#37; return per year = P(x&gt;10&amp;#37;)= 16/27 = 59&amp;#37;

Prob. of a net positive return per year= P(x&gt;0&amp;#37;)= 23/27 = 85&amp;#37;

Prob. of below -10&amp;#37; return per year = P(x&lt;-10&amp;#37;)= 4/27=15&amp;#37;

If you are doing a **20-year investment**, over the last  27 years

Prob. of above 10&amp;#37; return per year = P(x&gt;10&amp;#37;)= 19/27 = 70&amp;#37;

Prob. of a net positive return  per year= P(x&gt;0&amp;#37;)= 27/27 = 100&amp;#37;

Prob. of below -10&amp;#37; return per year = P(x&lt;-10&amp;#37;)= 0/27=0&amp;#37;

I hope that from the numbers above you see how making a **long term investment** helps you **reduce your risk** of losing money on average. If buying an index is a **diversification across different stocks** then long term investment would be a **diversification across time**.

**Appendix B: Some information to help you decide your index to treasury bond ratio.**

\*I gave exaggerated cases to illustrate the point.

**Case 1**

Risk tolerance: You have a steady job and you do not have any mortgage or loan. You now have $10000 that you don’t plan to use in the next five years. You want to put your money to investment. After evaluating your preference, you are okay with losing at most 25&amp;#37; of your investment in any year.

Action:

Put your $10000 in S&amp;P 500. Historically the most you could lose in a year can be **25-35\%** (during 2000 and 2008 crisis).  The historical average return would be roughly 10&amp;#37; per year. If you are committed to holding your investment for at least five year, you have a 85&amp;#37; change of earning a net positive return and 59&amp;#37; chance for earning over 10&amp;#37; return per year on average.

**Case 2**

Risk tolerance: you cannot bear any risk for investment; losing even 1&amp;#37; would give you a heart attack.

Action: put 100&amp;#37; of your money in US treasury bond. You’ll get 0.5-2&amp;#37; interest a year. Nonetheless better than letting the money sit in the bank.  If you are worried about inflation (1-3&amp;#37; per year), buy TIPS instead and get roughly 1&amp;#37; per year after inflation.

**Case 3**

Risk tolerance: you are a college student learning about investment the first time. You have a part time job and you do not have any mortgage or loan. You now have $10000 sitting in the bank, and you don’t need to use this $10000 in the next five years. You want to put your money to investment. After evaluating your preference, you decided you can bear at most 10&amp;#37; of loss in any year.

Action:

Target risk/ market risk= 10&amp;#37;/25&amp;#37; = 0.4

Therefore your Stock-to-Bond ratio should be 4:6.

Put $4000 of in S&amp;P 500 and the rest of $6000 in treasury bonds. The historical average return would be roughly 10&amp;#37;\*0.4+ 3&amp;#37;\*0.6=5.8&amp;#37; per year. Historically the most you could lose in a year is -35&amp;#37;\*0.4+ 3&amp;#37;\*0.6= -12&amp;#37; (during 2000 and 2008 crisis).

A careful reader at this point would ask: what if I’m okay losing more than 35&amp;#37; a year (say 50&amp;#37;), that I wanted to earn even higher return and bear more risk? I can’t put 200&amp;#37; of my money into buy S&amp;P500 can I?

The answer is, yes. That’s called leveraging your investment. That’s where derivatives and financial instruments step in. A beginner’s guide is not for these type of people. Derivatives and instruments are not for investing beginners. (and I would argue, not for most retail investors)

personalfinance,Separation Left me in Debt - Would love some Help,"Hey r/PersonalFinance \-

Due to a combination of factors (*Ex who couldn't manage money &amp;amp; spent money on my cards + lost his job 2x, moving to NYC and couldn't afford it, and some other items*) I went from being **$500 in Credit Card Debt**  to **$42,000 in credit card debt** in less than 2 years.

What I’ve done so far...

* I borrowed some money and amortized it out over 2018 ($250 / month) to be able to afford to pay my bills.
* I got a side job, dog walker pays like $100 a week (1099) + looking for a 3rd job.  Unfortunately, my day-job is so busy I can't find a legit side hustle like bartending so it's all App Economy stuff.  Also, I have a truck so anything driving related wouldn't be a net positive w/ gas + etc.
* Currently searching for a roommate, going to rent out the bedroom in my 1 Bedroom Apartment, and I'll sleep on the couch.
* I’m paying my minimums, IF I float my main credit card (I use it for daily purchases, and pay them off every day, don’t actually make a monthly payment on this card that way)
* I've done the research, can’t move back to Cleveland to live with my parents. Would have to make so much money to pay my minimums, I have to make a New York salary to pay them.  Couldn’t afford them on a Cleveland salary in my industry.

I updated my snowball calculator....won’t pay this debt off until August of 2030....I’ll be 43 at that point.

**I'd love any advice people have but specifically:**

* Should I be considering bankruptcy? All the advice I have so far is that if I can afford my minimums that it’s not worth it, but 12 years is a long time.  And I could just move home &amp;amp; file for bankruptcy, which allows me to escape my $2,000 a month apartment.
* Does it make sense to get a roommate, it would have to be a random person off craigslist and I'm a little bit afraid of the risks of them damaging the apartment, bailing on me before the lease is up, stealing things, etc.  + sleeping on the couch is going to be a pretty significant impact on my life.  All for \~ $700 per month net gain. (Goal of $1,000 per month income - $300 for Storage Unit)
* I have one balance transfer ($6,000) I have to pay off by December 1st to avoid paying interest on it, but I'm estimating I'll need \~ $5,000 in Move-In costs when my lease is up January 1st.  Should I give up on the balance transfer and focus on savings?  Then go back to credit card debt?
* Should I cash out my 401K + IRA? ($5,000 combined)

**EDIT**

Someone pointed out the importance of Income &amp;amp; Expenses:

===

**Income**:

===

$85,000 a year not including bonuses ($‎ 4,800 / month after taxes)

$3,000 in borrowed money amortized to supplement income ($250 / month)

* $50 Food + Treats for Dog
* $1,900 Housing
* $450 Utilities + Internet + Cell Phone Service

**CC Minimums - $700.00 or 14\%** *(Floated Card is $250.00 / month unpaid)*

**Savings - $0.00 or 0\%**

**Wants - $600 or 12\%**

* $15 Travel (Points Credit Cards Annual Fees)
* $80 / Week in Spending Money (Eating Out / Coffee / Social or mostly used to cover budget shortfalls)

personalfinance,Trying to Develop a Game Plan to Knock Out Student Loans.,"After about four and a half years of being idle, I think I am finally in a good place to turn my student loan burden into ""annoyance"" instead of ""ball and chain on my entire life"" 

I have a job that pays $41,000 a year (plus a vehicle with all expenses covered). I have $19,000~ cash on hand. I have an IRA through work and a life insurance plan, so I'm not ignoring retirement. 

My Stafford loans are at $19,000 ($330 per month 6.5% max interest, It's still a mix of subsidized and subsidized loans) and I also pay for the parent plus loan my parents took out for me which is at $52,000. ($850 a month, but I've paid $1,000 a month for most of my payments.) I still live with my parents so after the loans, the rest of my paychecks have been stashed. It also looks like I'll be getting several hours of overtime for the next two months or so, so I'll have more coming in. 

My job is fine, but I am very eager to make a change and move to a larger city and start building my own life. $1,300 a month payments keeps a lot of doors shut. 

I have enough, or close to enough to pay off all the loans in my name. I'd like to get more of a safety net of cash ($25,000?) before paying off those loans. But I can bide my time until then. Meanwhile, I'd be thrilled if there was a way I could take on the Parent Plus Loan, whether through some kind of personal loan or some other method, get it off of my parents name and formally into my name while reducing the monthly payment to something more manageable. Not only would I like to help out my parents credit wise, getting information about that loan is kind of like pulling teeth sometimes. (For instance, I'm not totally sure of the interest rate on that loan, but I believe it is 8% or 9%) It would be much better overall if I could directly manage that loan. Both loans have about five years left on them. 

Any suggestions on a gameplan going forward? It's not an urgent matter, in fact, I'm planning on studying for this certification which will take me several more months, possibly up to another year, to build up a warchest and keep making payments. I'd be happy to hear of any ideas, whether I'm on the right track, whether I should do something close, or if I'm off entirely.

They are 7 Direct Loans (4 Subsidized, 3 Unsubsidized). There used to be another Unsubsidized loan but I paid it off in full. The amounts and interest rates are as follows: 

Direct Loan - Subsidized

$2,637.55	         5.600%

Direct Loan - Subsidized

$3,342.63	         4.500%	

Direct Loan - Subsidized

I have the option to consolidate them into one loan of $19,599 with an interest rate of 4.875%. However, I'll be starting graduate school in August. I know this will freeze the loan and I'm also pretty sure the interest will keep accruing (I need to check on this with Navient though). I'll also be having to take out additional graduate loans while working on my Master's. Based on this info, does it seem like a good idea to consolidate? I feel like this is something I should've done a long time ago and I'm feeling kinda silly for not having done so. Regardless, help is appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,Where should I make my first investments?,"I'm 20 years old. 
I have about 7.000€ in a savings account at a very low interest rate (which I don't know for sure what is it.)

Basically, I want to know what I should do with this money. I was thinking about putting 1.000€ in something risk free like treasure certificates and about 500€ or more in big company stocks. I really don't know, and I am a bit scared about the world of investments really.

Also, is it a good idea to go to the bank and just tell them straight up ""I want my money to yield more than it does currently. What can I do?"" or will they try to trick me?

personalfinance,How do US I-Bonds collect interest?,"I started investing in I-Bonds last year as a vehicle for my emergency fund, and I'm curious exactly how the fund collects interest.

At first, I thought the interest rate was annual. To me, an annual interest rate (or APR, right?) means that interest on the principal is realized annually. So, for example, if I invest $10k at a 5% APR, then I will earn $500 in 1 year. Is this right?

Anyway, that's how I thought I-Bonds work. However, upon reading [this page](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ibonds/res_ibonds_iratesandterms.htm) it looks like they're compounded semi-annually? Does that mean that the full interest rate should be realized every six months? Because if so, that's currently not happening. [Here's an investment](https://i.imgur.com/M4HjYpc.png) I made last October. 2.48% of $8,000 is $198.40, and I haven't received that much yet. I haven't even received half of that, so if I'm wrong in reading their information page, and it's an annual return, then I should *still* have more in the account. I should have $8,099.20 not $8,064.

So what am I missing here? Where's my money Lebowski??? I know the whole ""government likes to screw you over..."" and ""can't trust the government..."" rhetoric, but this doesn't feel like something they would mess up on. So it has to be something I'm not understanding.",finance

personalfinance,Is Public Student loan forgiveness worth it for me?,"As of now I have $16,600 at 4.5% interest made of a mix of subsidized and unsubsidized student loans. Until December I will be paying $170.  I work for a ""non-profit"" and have made about 30-36 qualifying payments. (My job messed up the start date of my employment by several years, they will correct this.) So I have QUITE a bit of time left before I can have the loans forgiven.

Now here is where it gets interesting. The PSLF allows me to be income based. This past year however I have been working BONKERS overtime and am pulling in about $1,500.00-$1,600.00 a paycheck. It may not seem like much to many, but it allowed me to purchase a car when my old crapped the bed. I fully anticipate my student loan payment going up to around $300.00 monthly because of overtime and the fact that I get tuition reimbursement to the tune of 5k this year (not federally taxed but my home state taxes it.)

My question here is, would I actually save any money in waiting the 7 years or so for my loans to be forgiven? I'm TERRIBLE with math and interest rates and I've tried but I haven't been able to wrap my head around it.",finance

personalfinance,"Got my first out of college job, now what?","Hello. I'm 22 and I just got a new job located in Kentucky making 30,000 a year. This is my first full time job out of college. I am in the process of setting up retirement funds, getting my own health, dental, and vision insurance, and figuring out my budget. 

So there's a couple things that I'm looking at as far as my finances go. The first is that I have graduated school this may, however my girlfriend still has one year left in undergraduate school. She plans to head to graduate school, applying to go to the same college here in Kentucky, but also applying to go to grad school in Washington state or California. They have good programs for her major in these states and she is from California. She would find out if and where she is accepted next spring and would then start the following spring of 2020 if I understand correctly. This gives me about 6 months after she gets her acceptance to find a job where she is moving to if she is moving as we would plan to live together. 

The second thing I'm looking at is that I'm in the public sector, and the retirement options for the job I got are only transferable when staying in state government. It's a mandatory 6% of my paycheck pre tax retirement fund that my employer matches at approximately 48% of. This is not transferable outside of state government and I can only withdraw the amount that I contributed with heavy penalties from the IRS. My job depends on who is in office, so I have approximately a year and a half before the administration could possibly change. In theory, in the event of reelection, I could stay 4 more years after that. If my girlfriend moves to another state, ideally I'd be moving at the same time approximately 1.5 years from now anyways.

Starting July 15th, Ill be starting to get paid $1250 semi monthly (2500 a month or 30000 a year).
Heres a breakdown of my estimations of my monthly expenses after I move back in with my parents at the end of July.

6% mandatory retirement taken out= $150 pre tax
Healthcare Flexible Spending Account= $60 pretax(next year it will switch to $25)
Car Insurance=$140
Health Insurance=$90
Dental and Vision Insurance=$35
Gas=~$100
Food=~$100
Miscellaneous stuff=$200
Prescriptions=$25

I estimate that my take home pay after the retirement, healthcare flexible spending account, and taxes is around ~$1850. After all my expenses listed that leaves me with ~$1160 each month.

Other things to note are I have are $27,750.75 in my current stafford student loans (subsidized and unsubsidized) balance that under the default plan are due to start being paid in January at $287 dollars a month at ~4.660% interest and a federal perkins loan of $3100 due to start being paid of at $40 a month at 5% interest in mid-March.

I have no savings accounts only a chase student checking with ~$2000 dollars to my name.

I have a herniated disk in my back that I'd like to get surgery on one day. Bad runners knee aswell. Runners knee is probably self curable. With no cost.

I have 2 wisdom teeth that I believe will run me about 1000 to take out in the future

My question is what I should do with the rest of the money? There's a good chance because of my girlfriend moving and the administration possibly changing that I will be switching jobs in 1.5 years where I wont be able to transfer my current retirement fund with the state.

Possible places I could put my money that I've thought of:

6 month emergency fund (based on current expenses when I dont have a job with any benefits and living at my parents place)=$2850

New car fund (dont think I'll need one for a couple years)

Moving fund(I have no idea)

Supplemental retirement fund that could go with me from job to job(Likely needed)

New video equipment fund (I could use this equipment to help with the videos I create at my current job and allows me market myself as a more serious freelance content producer on the weekends or as an in between job)

Thanks for reading this very long post. All help is appreciated.

personalfinance,Worth it to Refinance Auto Loan?,"Hey guys, I currently have an auto loan for my SUV with the following terms:

* 3.03% APR,
* About $25.4k remaining balance,
* Monthly payment pretty much exactly $500,
* Credit score is 760+

I'd like to pay it off maybe a year or two sooner and minimize interest paid, probably without having my payment go up by more than $100 a month. I'm not sure what a good interest rate is for auto loans. Ideally, the savings of a lower interest rate would partially offset the payment increase from a shorter term loan and I'd get away with paying only $100 or so more a month.

Now, my credit score is pretty good but my credit history is still pretty short and so I don't think my score will ever get over 800 until some more time has passed.

personalfinance,Canadian with Credit Card Debt Looking for a Helping Hand,"Hello,

This is my first post and I'm relatively new to reddit. I'm looking for some assistance with my current financial situation, hopefully someone can help!

**Stats:** I'm a 30 year old male, living in Ontario, Canada. I currently have about $10,000 in credit card debt, and I am paying a 19&amp;#37; interest rate. I have a good job that I enjoy, and my income fluctuates but I'd say on average I take home about $1400 per paycheck, so $2800 per month after tax.

**Expenses:** I am living rent free currently. I have a cell phone, which is roughly $70/month. Car Payment which is $400/month. Gym membership $40/month. I'm on the road a lot for my job, so I do spend a good chunk of money on gas, and food while on the road (but I do try to bring as much food as I can). I would say this is where most of my income is going currently.

**Goals:** Ideally I'd like to be debt free as soon as possible, and begin saving for a down payment on a house.

I feel like I'm spinning my wheels making minimum payments on my credit card. I'm not sure the best course of action here, I've heard I could open up a line of credit or a new credit card and transfer the debt while taking advantage of a low interest rate? Does that exist?

personalfinance,Just graduated! Very conflicted about how to budget my new salary (190k),"I'm 24 years old, just graduated from law school and about to start work at a large firm in a high cost of living area (NYC). My starting salary is 190K, but I have an INSANE amount of student debt (380K). Right now the debt is sitting at about a 6&amp;#37; interest rate, but I'm eligible to refinance at a rate of about 3.5&amp;#37;. I went to a top law school so the debt is basically ""insured"" by my school, meaning that if I lose my job the school will help me make the payments as long as I am working in the legal field in some capacity. 

I'm really excited about my new job and have no problem working a lot, but the reality is simply that for the next 3-5 years while I do this work I'll be working 50-70 hour work weeks in a very high pressure environment. The up-side is that I can expect to get 20-30K raises every year and bonuses of 10-40K plus I get to do work that seems exciting to me.

I'm trying to budget for my living expenses next year and am having trouble balancing A) the amount of stress I feel from my debt; B) the feeling that I need to make my mental health a priority and prevent burn out. I've gotten advice from a few people that the most important thing is to prioritize my career right now, which means spending to decrease my stress and maximize the value that I get out of my free time. My game plan right now is this:

1) With my pretax deductions (including maxing out my 401K) and insurance) my monthly take home pay is estimated to be $9,300

2) Put $3,300 per month towards loans (my required payments for the loan refinanced at 3.5&amp;#37; should be about $2,800). Put all of my bonuses straight towards loans and use 70-80&amp;#37; of my raises to increase this payment. There are lots of variables here by my calculations show that I should be able to pay everything off using this method in about 5-6 years. The goal is to be out from under the debt by the time that I'm 30.

2\*) Once I get my debt down to a level that I am more personally comfortable with (at least below 250K), I may consider investing some of the money I was putting towards the loans.

3) This leaves me $6,000 per month extra that I'm tentatively planning to use as follows:

Rent: $2000

Utilities: $100 (I don't use cable)

Groceries: $450

Coffee/Lunches out: $450

Vacations/Drinking/Going out: $850

Shopping: $600

Personal Care: $650

(This leaves me with an extra $900 that I haven't budgeted for miscellaneous things. Most months I'm hoping that I'll be able to save it, but I'm not counting on it).

I'm used to living like a college student so this budget seems like it's crazy exorbitant to me. But also I'm going to be paying for convenience so things like having groceries shipped to me/having a house cleaner come in twice a month is probably worth it. I also need to build up a professional wardrobe (which can be expensive for women...) and I don't really own any furniture or kitchen supplies right now since when I moved in with my roommate she already had all of that. The idea is to budget a little bit each month to accumulate that stuff gradually. I'm also a single gal in her 20s, so when I get a night off I want to be able to go out  and have a fun time. I also don't want to have to skimp on my haircare, makeup, etc. since that's important to me and right now is just about the only thing I spend a lot of $$ on. 

So yeah....I guess I'm just looking for feedback on whether I'm being irresponsible. Sorry for the wall of text here, it's actually been really helpful for my thought process to just write it all down. I'd love any and all feedback

tl;dr I'm finally making real money at a high pressure job. Trying to figure out how to balance my high debt level with spending for convenience/mental health.",finance

personalfinance,Is there a way to invest without putting it into a retirement account?,"I'm new to investing. Currently I make a good amount of money(I'm 24), and I already maxed out the 401k my company offered, and effectively got the full match.
I recently opened up a brokerage account at vanguard. Completely separate from the company 401k. A rollover IRA brokerage account. I rolled over a ira from a previous employer and started contributing even more of my take home pay to this. 

I used the funds that appeared in the ""Vanguard Federal Money market fund(settlement fund)"" and bought all of VANGUARD TARGET RETIREMENT 2055 INVESTOR CL, VFFVX I believe. Is there a better choice for someone like me?

I currently have no debt, student loans are all paid off. I have roughly 20k in checking, and 3k in current company's 401k and an additional 5k in this new vanguard brokerage account. As you can see, most of my funds are sitting in checking. And the bank is a bad place to store your money. However this Brokerage account has limits just like a typical retirement account, for example a contribution limit of $5500 a year. 

So my question is, can I pour even more of money into this brokerage account, effectively bypassing the limit? Also how does this work, let's say if I needed my funds out for a downpayment for a house or something. Can you simply just transfer the funds out of your brokerage account into your bank account? How does it work?
I want to invest, but I don't want to be unable to withdraw any funds until I'm 60.

EDIT: I did not max out my 401k. I've contributed around 12% of it. I've contributed enough to get the full match. Also didn't start contributing to the companies 401k until later, since it isn't initially offered in the first 3 months. I've been here for 6-7 months.",finance

personalfinance,How is VMFXX taxed?,"Does anybody know how VMFXX (Vanguard Federal Money market fund) is taxed?  It’s the default fund for cash in Vanguard brokerage accounts (just opened account this year).  

I’d been assuming that the interest is ordinary income fully subject to state and federal taxes (like all savings account interest). But looking further into the fund makes me think that’s an incorrect assumption.  It invests pretty much exclusively in treasuries (exempt from state and local tax) and US government obligations (sometimes exempt from state and local tax). I live in Oregon and honestly I can’t tell from the state gov website if they allow interest from federal obligations to be exempt. If anybody understands this better I’d love the help!

So first, is any or all of the interest actually exempt from state and local taxes?  If so, does this show up on a 1099?

Texas resident here

This is going to be another one of those ""I'm young took out more than I can afford"" posts so if you're tired of reading them please please avoid reading this one because it will piss you off.

Anyways, I'm 23, in school (out of pocket) and took out too much than my monthly income. Add to the fact that I want to change jobs and this is a disaster recipe.

BREAKDOWN (---):

Car: $700 ($29,000/36,000) \[6&amp;#37; APR\]

Income:

$1800 Currently

If I stay at this job I will probably grow to earn around $4000 monthly but will take around 2 months at least. Next month i'm looking at about $1800-2200 or depending on these last days. I get $1000 on the first most likely and the rest on the 15th. The other job (Technical Support Representative for a ISP)  I'm thinking about falls in line with my degree i'm studying for as well as paying $15 an hour ($2400 a month gross). I got a call from Wayfair too but think that's cold calling sales and i'm definitely not interested in that.

Explanation:

Got the car while I was making a shit load of commission (about $4k-6k monthly). Now I switched dealerships in different city and this one I can't get cars out to save my life.

Ideas:

My first idea is this car. I'm looking to just say fuck it and call the lender and tell them to pickup the vehicle. I already was 2 months behind on payment and they deferred it and now I can't afford the next payment which is tomorrow (6/22). The problem with picking up the vehicle besides the credit hit is someone at my school backed into my vehicle and left a hole in the front bumper and some kids kicked a dent in the driver side door. Lastly needs a wheel alignment.

Call the credit card companies and do a repayment plan and close the cards/ask for deferment first.

I'm tired of sales and looking for other jobs and have 2 lined up. One is still sales with Sprint which has an hourly pay as well on top of the commission. The second job is Tech Support for $15/hr. Looking to be around $2400 monthly before taxes.

I meal prep 3lbs of meat and tortillas (about $17 every 5-6 days) for tacos. Car (The death of me) gets 13mpg average so I drive to and from work. Instead of spending damn near 60&amp;#37; of my income on this car, I can save for a beater for $600 bucks no A/C and save on insurance and gas and just give up the car and buy cash cars. The only worry is I know the lender will just sell the vehicle (29k miles) at an auction for shit money and just sue me for the rest? Should I trade in with a credit score of high 500's 560-595, eat all the negative equity and get into a 8-12k car (less than 8k I doubt would have the lenders to take in a 20k loan) hoping to pay less than 550, save gas and insurance? Im just scared the interest rate will be so high and I will end up paying damn near the same for a car I don't even like (Keywords are near the same NOT a car I won't like). At that point I'd just want to get a beater.

What do you guys think I should do?  


Edit: I'm in love with my car too it's just work change and I love to eat more than buying gas.",finance
personalfinance,Advice on buying property,"My Mother in law has recently sold her house, and will be moving closer to where my wife and I live, but property here is more expensive than where she is coming from. We'll be looking at helping her buy the house, and I'm trying to figure out the best approach for us.

My wife and I are relatively high-income, and we currently rent. We don't own a house of our own anywhere. I'm debating a couple approaches, and with the new tax laws, it's a bit tough to find the information I'm looking for.

1. my MiL ""gifts"" us (some portion of) the proceeds of her house sale. My wife and I then buy the house, she lives in it and pays us ""rent"" (we'd take it out of the proceeds of her house sale over time). There are two ways to go about this:
   1. We buy the house outright in cash. With the proceeds of the old sale, as well as cash we have.
   2. We take out a mortgage, and invest the money somewhere relatively safe. It seems to me that market returns tend to beat out mortgage interest rates, and should mortgage rates change drastically, we can always pay it off as long as the market hasn't tanked. I get that there's some risk here, but lets set that aside for a moment.
2. We give her the money to cover the difference in the sale of the old house and price of the new one. In this case, my wife would also be on the deed of the house. My MiL won't be able to get a mortgage due to a very low income, so this would likely have to be an outright purchase.

Any thoughts here, or has anyone been down this road before?",finance

personalfinance,"""Stuck"" feeling. Need help attaining goals and properly allocating funds.","I tagged this post as ""planning"" but am not sure if it is mostly ""planning"", ""budgeting"", ""debt"" or some other flair. If you feel it is better suited flared differently please let me know, and I will adjust accordingly.

This is a new account because I do not want this content linked with my primary account (though I'll be using it quite a bit for financial inquiries). I am struggling to understand how to get anywhere. I don’t feel like I’m sinking, but I know that I am wasting time. I need help. This is my current situation as best and as honest as I can make it. 

I plan to get engaged in about 7 months. I expect this to cost $10k. The realization that I do not know how to make this goal happen is what is driving me to post this. I have planned that my saving account is essentially a temporary emergency fund until it is around the amount of the ring and then it is going toward that while I rebuild an emergency fund. I am coming up on my second year of teaching so my job stability is slightly higher for the upcoming year than some people. I have student loans that currently total about $42k with varying interest rates. I have about $7,695 in investments (mostly in a ROTH IRA). I do not know how to organize what steps to make. I don’t know how to prioritize my savings, and I am looking for help. Any general tips on allocating my money would be greatly appreciated as well.

**As it stands (if my prioritizing of the goals should be rearranged please explain):**

* Primary Goal: Have $10k in savings for engagement ring by January 2019.
* Secondary Goal 1: Once I have $10k saved, still have an emergency fund.
* Secondary Goal 2: Pay down/off most needed student loan group
* Secondary Goal 3: Put money into Roth IRA (Have not contributed any of the $5,500 this year)


**Accounts (Rounded down except for cc debt):**

* Checking: $3,590
* Savings: $3,750
* Credit Card Debt: $2,523
* ROTH IRA: $6,695
* Robinhood: $1,006 
* Student Loans: 

&gt;1.  Group A: Original Loan Amount: $6,500. Interest Rate: 6.550%. Principal Balance: $7,815.41. Outstanding Balance: $8,827.51 (I am currently on an Income Based Repayment Plan that automatically puts $43.27 per month to this loan)

&gt;2. Group B: Original Loan Amount: $20,500. Interest Rate: 5.960%.  Principal Balance: 21,807.02. Outstanding Balance: 24,294.06. (I am currently on an Income Based Repayment Plan that automatically puts $120.73 per month to this loan group)

&gt;3. Group C: Original Loan Amount: $7,500. Interest Rate: 3.610%. Principal Balance: $8,085.73. Outstanding Balance: $8,510.76.(I am currently on an Income Based Repayment Plan that automatically puts $44.77 per month to this loan group)

My interest rate says this “Interest rates for federal student loans are set by Congress. Rates may vary depending on loan type and the first disbursement date of the loan. Interest on your account is calculated using a simple daily interest formula. Simple interest is a formula that multiplies your loan balance by the number of days since the last payment, times the interest rate factor. Interest accrues daily on your loans. “

How much interest is being accrued each day/how it's accrued is over my head. How much am I losing (accruing in interest - what I’m paying) each month by using this IBR Plan?

**Income and Expenses**

* Monthly Income: $2,565
* Rent: $540
* Electricity: $31
* Water: $23
* Internet: $48.75
* Gas: $120
* Insurance: $41
* School Loans (IBR): 208.77
* Netflix: $7 (shared account part of rent agreement)
* Amazon Prime: $8.33 (I have an amazon Prime Credit Card that I put all of my purchases aside from rent onto and then pay off each month)
* PSN: $8.33

*Total bills listed before food bill: $1,036.18*

* Food is tough for me. I don’t have a budget and am trying to make one. I eat out entirely too often as it is, and I want to cut back on eating out immensely. What is a good average for a single household buyer to be spending on groceries per month? I don’t want to eat strictly pasta type dishes that are going to contribute to me gaining more weight than I already have, but I still want some cheaper options for meals.

I also have a really hard time with impulse buying/purchasing discounted records on amazon. I love record collecting and subs like /r/vinyldeals are hard to avoid. I don’t buy unless they are records I really have had my eye on and are $13.xx or less. I’m responsible about sticking to this rule but not responsible in limiting my total spending because of the amount of records I want.


Looking at it now it looks like I have plenty of left over money at the end of the month, but I don’t. I *am hopeful* that once I realize **where** I need to be spending my money the frivolous/record/fast food buying will diminish and those funds will be allocated to their rightful places. Please help me make goals, order those goals, and get myself out of this “stuck” feeling.",finance

personalfinance,How much am I actually saving?,"I have a large private student loan that I am actively trying to pay down. The minimum payment on it is $415.76/month.

Is there anyone that can help me with the math on this?

personalfinance,How do I plan for a medical leave of 3 to 6 months?,"I recently experienced a medical emergency that landed me a week’s stay in the hospital, and which resulted in the discovery of a few health problems. My doctors are still investigating my health issues, and trying to come up with a diagnosis; however, one of the problems is that I may need a lung transplant within the next few years. I have been told in no uncertain terms that I should expect to be referred to the lung transplant evaluation team within a few months to a year. Lung transplants are super risky, so I am very nervous and scared, and still trying to process everything.  For now, while my medical issues are being investigated, I want to be proactive and start planning, researching, and learning about all the available resources.

My biggest issue is that I am currently in the early stages of a debt reduction plan, so it’s an upsetting thought that my plans may be disrupted by a medical leave.  I want to mitigate this as much as possible.  I especially do not want to lose the car that I bought earlier this year, which contributes greatly to my quality of life.

Some information:

\--I am a 32 year old disabled woman living in Seattle, WA.

\--My f/t income as an office assistant: $40k a year from a small nonprofit, for which I have worked almost 3 years.

\--I pay $100 per month into my 403b, which my employer matches, but other than that I have no savings.

\--Health insurance: $3,000 out of pocket maximum. My employer pays half of my premium, so it costs me $236 per month.

\--I get 96 sick hours per year and I accumulate 8 vacation hours per month

\--My p/t income: average $750 per month working two shifts per weekend (this income goes into a separate bank account and is only for debt)

My debts are credit cards ($5k), car loan ($18k), federal student loans ($8k), SSA ($1.3k), DSHS ($500), IRS ($6k-ish), and one debt ($2.7k) in collections from old medical bills.  I will pay off my credit cards by the end of this year.  The rest, I’m on a payment plan, and will pay off within about 3 years. 

My questions:

1. Heh: where do I start?
2. How do I go on medical leave, but still be able to return to my job afterward, and keep my health insurance?  I know there’s COBRA, but what should I expect?
3. Are there advocates or social workers for this kind of thing?  Where do I find them?
4. How do I keep everything organized so I don’t overwhelm myself?

personalfinance,"Two months until job starts. Will we be OK, or should I be worried?","Hello. I am 28 (M) with 22 (F), engaged. Neither of us are working right now.

I accepted a new job that begins in early September at 60k/year in the Midwest. Great news for me, it's a job in a field of what I've always wanted to do.

We decided to take a sabbatical in between jobs. I got the offer months ago. So we've both been out of work for about 5 months and it's been *way* more of a financial drain that I planned. Particularly because we had a lot stashed away in cryptos and they tanked in February. (I know, I know. Bad me.)

Maybe the sabbatical was not the best idea financially, but it's been a productive time for us, and peaceful. We needed a break. I wrote a book and we moved to the new city and so on. So it has been fun, though it's starting to get stressful for me. 

I am supporting both of us. Here is my situation:

**Assets**: 

Cash: 14,200

401k: 30,700

Cryptos: 19,800

Home purchased 2018: ~20k equity, 110k owed

Cottage + land in home state (previously used as a rental): ~20k+ equity, 18k owed



**Debts**

CC1 (7%): 11,780

CC2 (0%): 3,100

CC3 (20%): 3,200 (moving expenses, will be reimbursed by employer)


**Other**

Car: Owned outright, insurance is paid until December 2018. It's old but reliable. 

Pets: Two doggos

Wedding: This summer. Expected to cost another $4k in contracts we've set up.

Baby: Expected in September


**Expenses**

Groceries: 300/month

Phones: 80/month

Mortgage: 835/month (nothing due until August, new purchase)

Municipal bill lumped (electric, water, sewer, gas): less than 200

Pets: 50 +/-

Internet: 50

Gas for car: 100/month, rough

Cabin mortage: 280/month

CC1: 178/month

CC2: 50? not sure, nothing due this cycle

CC3: 50? not sure, nothing due this cycle

**Note**

We've *never* had this much CC debt and will want to get rid of it ASAP when I begin working again. And we live super frugally so I don't think it'll be too hard. But it's really starting to worry me and make me irritated and emotional about money. I feel like I'm not seeing things clearly. 

So, just looking for advice. I think we are pretty OK. We'll be doing really well once I start working again. We will be able to make it until I start working but I am used to having much more in an emergency fund and much more money to ""play around"" with, and I am feeling somewhat lost. The finish line is close, but not too close. 

We are also dropping from about 100k/year joint income to 60k/year, as she will be a SAMH.

And I don't really think I can do any work right now, as I am starting the FT job in late August and we will be out of state for most of July for our wedding. So I can't take on a p/t job or something for a little extra cash. 

Am I crazy for being fairly stressed at this situation? What could I do better? I have looked at this a bunch of different ways.

Cryptos are at a very low point right now, so I am being a baby and holding on to them because that 20k was just 60k a few months ago. It seems wrong to sell at such a low, low point. I would rather hold on to the cryptos than pay back the debt right now, especially because the interest rates are so low on most of the cards.

**TL;DR**: Job doesn't start 'til two months. Lots of CC debt. Am I crazy or are we OK?",finance

personalfinance,First Time with Independent Contractor Work,"I've read tons of advice for budgeting on this sub for the past few months since I found it, and it's been really helpful. I'd love to get some advice on a topic I don't know much about.

I'm 23 and about to go back to college this fall to finish my bachelors. I got a new job today that will look good on my resume for graduate school eventually and help contribute some extra fun money to my budget (my husband makes enough to pay our bills and contribute to retirement if we keep a close eye on spending, so this isn't a post about our budget). I was hired as a private tutor at a prep academy that does after-school, Saturday, and summer tutoring for primarily private school students, and I'm really excited! The issue is that they hired me as a private contractor, and I've always had regular employment jobs up until this point. I know it's very easy to do private contracting wrong and end up owing the IRS money in April, so after talking to my parents I've taken the following steps:
1. I called the closest tax prep company to me (an H&amp;R Block) and have an appointment scheduled for next Monday morning so that I do my estimated quarterly payments correctly. I know H&amp;R block isn't the best, but this is a part-time job and we don't have enough money for a more expensive accountant.
2. I bought a vehicle mileage logbook at the store so I can keep track of my miles to drive to and from tutoring appointments and deduct those correctly. 
3. I bought an extra file folder to keep track of receipts for business expenses.
4. I bought a separate planner for this job to keep track of both my students and my hours, to help with estimated payments.
4. I am planning to open a separate checking account for my paychecks so that  I know which money is coming in as a result of my tutoring work and can keep some back in that account for taxes.

Is there anything else I need to be keeping track of? I filled out my W-9 this morning, but haven't done any state paperwork yet. Since state paperwork in the past (NC) has been for tax withholding, do I need to pay quarterly taxes to the state as well or is it only federal? If this is stuff they'll help me with on Monday at my tax appointment, don't feel the need to answer it in the comments. Thanks for reading to the end!

investing,Bizarre Bond Price Action in Rising Rate Environment?,"On December 17, 2015, the Federal Reserve raised rates for the first time in 9 and a half years.  Rates have been steadily rising since then.  Classical bond pricing would tell you, all bond prices should be decreasing.  Not only that, but longer term bonds should be decreasing more, and short duration bonds much less.  However, examine this chart.

* ZROZ is 25+ duration zero coupon bonds.

* SCHR are 7-10 year duration bonds.

* SCHO are 1-2 year duration bonds. 

We would expect increasing volatility and decreasing price the longer the duration.  However, while volatility is in line with expectations, pricing is not.  In fact, the longest duration bonds which provide no income stream, are actually slightly positive over this time period.  Why is that?

Now I have a hunch about why that is, quantitative easing, but I just don't know the specifics.  Why is it still happening?  Didn't QE end around the same time as rates started to increase?  What does it mean going forward?

personalfinance,Got offer - should I take it?,"This has been an eventful week. I was fired Monday which I’m delighted about and been expecting. I was throwing out lines before but had planned first ever vacation for teenage kids and didn’t want to cancel or ask for time off with a brand new job.

The job was awful (nearly 100% turnover in 9m, incl a suicide due in part to job stress) and from like week 4 I was told not to touch anything I was hired to do, because the boss’s buddy was a contractor and he wanted HIM doing all the work.
Not given any work, and then boss complained I wasn’t doing work. Etc etc etc.


So, delighted I was fired because I was about to quit in a spectacular way. Just wish I’d lined up a job first, alas. I just got back from vacation a week prior.

I’ve worked full time for last 15+ years, and prior to that had stints I’d unemployment due to econ.

Been in my industry 20yrs and last couple jobs were 6 figure salary in low COL area.

I have approx 5yrs+ of living expenses saved, my only debts are my home and 1 of my 2 cars. I could probably pay both off and still pay my bills for 3yrs.

The reason I have so much savings is the 3ish years of rotating door of jobs in my early 20s from dot com/ 9/11 fallout. I’m fed in a better position career wise now (ie, higher up food chain) so I’d expect my situation to be better job openings wise.

I filed for unemployment right after I was fired but based on boss and behavior I fully expect they will fight claim. They fired 5 people in my position in the 3m before I was hired (wish I’d known that before!) 

They have no good reason, so I expect I’ll win if I have to appeal but I know that can take while. Unemployment should come close to covering my expenses. 

I’ve hit up every contact I have in industry and asked them to keep ears to ground, working with a recruiter who did business with a previous job and begged for chance to find me a job in future. I’ve basically got several people sending my resume out and telling companies “you may not have opening but you’d be foolish not to hire this guy”

Now, went on interview today and it’s contract with very little chance to go perm. Like 5% probably. 
It would allow me to pick up a few skills to add to my resume, but the job is remedial really for me. Boss seems ok, office is kind of a mess and that always triggers alarms. 
Pay is OK, but no insurance  (which I’m required to carry for kids) etc etc.

The biggest issue is, being employed will limit my ability to look for jobs, especially hourly. Full time I could fudge a bit more and “kids need to visit doctor, work from home after” type deal. 

Another big issue is highway or back roads I’m looking at probably 1.5+ hours each way commute. Traffic has gotten crazy here. Used to take me an hour to drive 25-30 miles that direction and now 15 miles is 1+ hours. 

I don’t like the idea of my young kids home alone that late and spending 60-90min with them before bed. 

I’m used to working 80hr weeks, but I’d be home around 6 and then work for 4-5hrs after they went to bed.

It scares me to turn down any job, and to have gap in resume but driving 3+ hours for a probably boring job, when I have funds to hang out and look for a bit... seems like waiting would be the better option here.

CryptoCurrency,Authy Is an awesome App - BUT there is one major security flaw.,"**tl;dr**: Authy is flawed in that it's own native tokens are not as well protected as Google Authenticator / RFC 6238 tokens that you can add

**Preface**

I see Authy getting recommended a lot here, and as one of the major supporters of this app, I couldn't be happier because I really do believe in having a good system of security that not only allows us to adopt better security (implementing 2FA for all our accounts), but to also do so without a loss in convenience (cloud backups). However, I do have to point out that one of its major flaws is that it doesn't protect Authy tokens with the same security it does with RFC 6238 / Google Authenticator tokens. I'll explain a little more in my post below, but let me first run through the details of Authy.

**Authy's Security Model**

I've always respected this model because it's a lot like LastPass' where your data is encrypted by a key that only you know. I studied this quite a bit and was impressed by their use of this concept. It gives me reassurance that accounts are protected and moreover by a password that only I know. [Authy even explains it in a lot of detail here](https://support.authy.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001950787-Backups-password-Master-password-and-PIN-protection-with-Authy) to tell us how secure the backup passwords are.

**Authy Tokens vs RFC 6238 TOTP Tokens**

Authy was originally made as an 2FA API itself. Now as a disclaimer, I'm not a software expert or anything, so I'm stepping on thin ice here in my discussion, but it seems Authy has its own token system that's slightly different from Google Authenticator / RFC 6238.

As one of the early users of Coinbase, they partnered up with Authy for 2FA initially, so all you had to do was tie your phone number to Coinbase and Authy and it would enable the Authy token automatically. A few other services today continue to use Authy tokens ([Gemini](https://authy.com/guides/gemini/), [Twitch](https://authy.com/guides/twitch-3/), [Twilio](https://authy.com/guides/twilio/) obviously, BitGo, and maybe a few select others). The problem I noticed was that these tokens are separate from Google Authenticator / RFC 6238 tokens that you typically add through a QR code or a seed phrase.

**The Problem**

These Authy tokens are NOT protected by the backup password that your other tokens are that you manually add via QR code..

Now you might not understand what an Authy token is, so feel free to look at those links for Gemini, Twitch, and Twilio that I posted above. You will notice that the setup involves typing in your phone number rather than a QR code. Since Authy also has your phone #, giving your number basically adds that token to your Authy account by linking the two together using that identifier. You may also notice that these Authy tokens are 7 digits instead of your typical 6 digit 2FA codes.

**How to Replicate the Problem**

What I hate more than anything else about PSAs is the people posting issues that only affect them, and don't do proper debugging to even reproduce the problem. While I thought I discovered this issue a while ago, I didn't make this post until I finally sat down and spent some time playing with multiple phones, tablets, computers, and accounts. I went ahead and tried this not only on my account but setting up a dummy account and confirmed both times that Authy tokens really aren't protected by a password. I encourage you to try the following steps:

1. Setup a new Authy instance either on a new phone/tablet or Chrome. Or if you already have Authy on every device, just remove it from one and try setting it up again.
2. Confirm your new device via an old device or via SMS
3. Open up Authy and look for your Authy Tokens. [I'll show you my Authy screen,](https://i.imgur.com/HuYo6s4.png) This was a brand new laptop I had just setup and installed Chrome. You can notice that all my Google Authenticator tokens are LOCKED. [I need to type in my backup password before I can even use those tokens](https://i.imgur.com/V0CqYl9.png). But BitGo there is an Authy token. [It's fully unlocked. I can click on it without typing any password.](https://i.imgur.com/bkqQuoT.png)

**What's the problem with this?**

Well I've seen many recommendations for Authy offer reassurance that even if your SMS is spoofed/hacked, that a hacker still needs a password to access your 2FA tokens. **NOT ENTIRELY TRUE!!!!**

Your Google Authenticator tokens **will be protected by the secure backup passwords** **but your Authy tokens will not be.** I'm going to guess this is why [Coinbase started migrating over to Google Authenticator instead of defaulting to Authy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6f0hhb/coinbase_recommendation_migrate_from_authy_to/) due to the threat of SMS being so easily hijacked.

**Damage Control**

So because your Authy accounts can be accessed w/o a password, anyone who can intercept your SMS codes can get access to your Authy accounts. The best way to mitigate the damage is to disable the ""Allow Multi Device"" setting in the Coinbase app. This prevents any other user from setting up new Authy devices with your account. Turn it on when you need to setup a new phone/device, but turn it off immediately after.

While this seems to prevent anything bad from happening, it's a band-aid solution. Authy's tokens may be encrypted on their servers, but it's certainly not encrypted with a password that only you know (it's either that or they know your backup password in reality). It would seem if someone hacked their servers, that they could get control of your Authy tokens even if your Google Authenticator accounts are still protected. So in conclusion this puts in doubt their backup password security explainer:

&gt;This means that if our servers were to be compromised, no hacker would be able to steal your tokens unless he also knew your backups password.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Need Loan Advice - Out of Options,"have recently accepted an internship that I need to take the next step in my career, however this internship is unpaid and I need to find a loan for the next year to cover rent of around $650/month and general living expenses. I have already taken out an $8,000 personal loan to cover the tuition costs that were due in July.  This loan carries a rough payment of $250 a month. I have no help at home or with relatives and will not accept a friend to be a co-signer. I need roughly $15,000 before extra loan payments to cover myself for the next year. I have tried almost everything I could think of:

* Applying to a community college for 3 online credits to take out a Sallie Mae loan, but they could only give me a maximum of $1,500 of the $15,000 loan due to my ""financial aid budget"".
* Piecing together $8,000 personal loans (monthly payments too high)
* Federal loan/FASFA are out of the question (this internship is non-credit awarding)

I have good credit 700+ but my monthly income is holding me back from receiving a high enough personal loan to cover my living expenses and future loan payments. I am currently working two part-time jobs, but when the internship starts I am lucky to be working 10 hours a week part-time on top of the work that I will be doing for this internship.

This is a last ditch effort to see if anyone here would have any ideas of which direction I should look in at this point. I am absolutely clueless and need some help. Thanks.",finance

I’ve had to take 2 semesters off already and have only finished my freshman year. Over the 6 months of taking the semester off, I had to pay what I owe for the previous semester back to school so instead of shaving like $10k by the end of 6 months I only am starting out with a few hundred before I have to go back to school.

Key Factors: I work 2 Jobs 
-1 job pays 350 after taxes weekly
-1 job pays 150 after 2 weeks
- I might have to transfer schools
- Father is making me move to Pittsburgh if I do not save up $3K and will have to go to community college up there

personalfinance,Exchanging car debt for student loan debt?,"So I just needed to double check my process here. I feel like I'm missing something, but I'm not sure, so on to the thought I had. I currently have a car loan amounting to roughly ~$10,000 at 6% interest. Not the best interest rate, I know, but it was my first actual loan ever. Anyway, I'm currently attending college (and working, hence the car loan), and this fall I have the option of taking out ~$2,500 in subsidized federal student loans at 2% interest with payments and interest accumulation deferred for 2.5 years (when I graduate).

My question is this: would it be a decent idea to take that 2.5k and place it directly onto the principal for my car loan, effectively exchanging 2.5k in 6% car loan for 2.5k in 2% deferred student loans? I'm not seeing much of a downside here, considering the car is an education expense, and I'd effectively be saving quite a bit in interest over time with this option.",finance

Anyone can offer any advice as to whether i should be paying off interest because im not sure if/when what loans will capitalize. just looking for general guidance, thank you.

Is there anything I should be doing before these loans are out of their grace of post grad deferment status?

Should I pay off the interest first or just pay down principle?

personalfinance,"Rising Junior, looking at $30,000 tuition for next school year, how do I pay this?","throwaway account, I don't want anyone to know yet.

Hello reddit, I'm panicking right now. Basically, I'm a rising junior at a private university. Normally, my family would not be able to afford going to this school, but the school had been very generous with need based financial aid in the past. However, this year's financial aid (FAFSA) is based off of 2016's tax forms. On average, my parents make around $40,000 combined a year. However, the total income on the tax form in 2016 was $100,000 because they had sold an old house that year. Most of that money went to paying off remaining mortgage payments, so we didn't gain too much from it.

When I asked the financial aid offices, they told me that because of the income in 2016, the school had significantly lowered the amount of financial aid they would provide. After deducting my grants and scholarships, I'm looking at around $35,000 in total costs for next school year, around $17,000 per semester. I suspect my parents to be able to pay only around $9,000 max for the whole year. I've contacted the school's financial aid offices and I'm constantly refreshing my email every couple of minutes. 

Even with a federal load, I would only be able to get $7,500 as a rising junior. If I dropped out for a year or switched schools, I'm worried that it would void all previous grants and scholarships and I won't be able to come back. What should I do? How can I over the remaining costs? 

Thank in advance for any help at all!

EDIT: The financial aid offices have gotten back to me. I've sent them a copy of my parents' 2017 tax form, and they said they'll review it. Fingers crossed!

EDIT2: The financial aid amount has been updated! The person I was in contact with was super helpful, and I now have to ""only"" pay $20,000 a year. This is a lot better than before, so I would recommend talking to your financial aid offices. I'll be closing this account, so thanks for all your help guys.",finance
personalfinance,W-4s and 401(k)/going from near-poverty to middle class,"I’ve been working at my current place of employment for about a year and a half. Last year, I took all the withholdings I was entitled to on my W-4 (newly single mom with no spousal or reliable child support, trying to get established after many years as a SAHM). I ended up getting a federal tax refund of about $1500 and owing about $600 in state tax. I adjusted my withholdings downward for this year because my kid is too old now for the child tax credit (in what world are 17YOs less expensive?!) in hopes of breaking nearly even this year. 

When I started out, I was contributing 5% to my 401(k), which I’ve since upped to 6%. My company matches 6% but only fully vests after 5 years. 

Now I’d like to increase my 401(k) contribution to 10% and hopefully offset it by increasing my withholdings as well. Starting next month, my pay will be going up by about $450 per biweekly pay period.

I have little significant debt (student loans about $1500, car loan about $6000 at under 3%) and a small emergency cushion that I’m planning to increase significantly starting next paycheck. 

Any thoughts on this? Any possibility that the withholdings and increased contribution will offset each other? Is there a reliable online tool I can use to actually see what those financial impacts will be before making any firm decisions? Thanks so much for your help.",finance

So let me just say that I messed up and should've been keeping track of this when I was younger, but there's nothing I can do about it now. I paid for college through federal and private loans through FAFSA and Sallie Mae. I have a federal unsubsidized loan total of ~$30,000, and four private loans through Sallie Mae totaling  ~$78,000. My father and I thought we had set up payments correctly through Sallie Mae, but we were ignorant, and now realize that in order to pay this back we have to pay a grand total of $875/month without including the federal loan. 

The federal loans look like this:

1) 29,876 at 4.25% interest = $186/month

The Sallie Mae loans look like this:

1) $22,465  at 9.625% interest = $276/month

2) $19,219 at 9.5% interest = $236/month

3) $18,685 at 7.25% interest = $203/month

4) $17,564 at 4.25% interest = $160/month



What I'm looking to do is refinance the first three out of the four of my private loans to reduce the monthly payment amounts. I can't afford $1060/month on student loans. 

If I can refinance those three into a single, monster loan, even if it has a $450/month payment. That would be so much more reasonable than what i'm doing now. 

Now, I do have a few immediate options if it comes to it. Sallie Mae offers a graduated payment plan where I only pay the interest off of the loans, which may do for loans 1-3 for a few years before I can refinance.

#The Conspiracy

**""In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that ...the threat of global warming, ..would fit the bill. ...caused by human intervention, the real enemy then, is humanity itself.""** - Club of Rome

The environmental movement has been described as the largest and most influential social phenomenon in modern history. From relative obscurity just a few decades ago it has spawned thousands of organisations and claims millions of committed activists. Reading the newspaper today it is hard to imagine a time when global warming, resource depletion, environmental catastrophes and 'saving the planet' were barely mentioned. They now rank among the top priorities on the social, political and economic global agenda.

Environmental awareness is considered to be the mark of any good honest decent citizen. Multi-national companies compete fiercely to promote their environmental credentials and 'out-green' each other. The threat of impending ecological disasters is uniting the world through a plethora of international treaties and conventions. But where did this phenomenon come from, how did it rise to such prominence, and more importantly, where is it going?

While researching for these articles, and during my academic studies, I have come across many references to the The Club of Rome (CoR), and reports produced by them. Initially I assumed that they were just another high-level environmental think-tank and dismissed the conspiracy theories found on many websites claiming that the CoR is a group of global elitists attempting to impose some kind of one world government.

I am not a conspiratorial person by nature and was faced with a dilemma when I first read their reports. But it's all there - in black and white. The CoR claims that ""we are facing an imminent catastrophic ecological collapse"" and ""our only hope is to transform humanity into a global interdependent sustainable society, based on respect and reverence for the Earth."" In the end I came to the conclusion that there are two possibilities – either the CoR wrote all these reports and setup a vast network of supporting organisations just for fun or they actually believe what they have written and are working hard to fulfill their role as the self-appointed saviors of Gaia.

Many years ago H.L. Mencken warned us of this technique. Of course not referring to current day climate hysteria, he know how the elites attempt to control the populous.

**""The whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed — and hence clamorous to be led to safety — by menacing it with an endless series of hobgoblins, all of them imaginary.""**

**""The urge to save humanity is almost always only a false face for the urge to rule it.""**
-H.L. Mencken:

Based on my close observation of their actions, and watching the recommendations made by the CoR many years ago now being adopted as official UN and government po

#So, what exactly is the Club of Rome and who are its members?

Founded in 1968 at David Rockefeller’s estate in Bellagio, Italy, the CoR describes itself as ""a group of world citizens, sharing a common concern for the future of humanity."" It consists of current and former Heads of State, UN beaureacrats, high-level politicians and government officials, diplomats, scientists, economists, and business leaders from around the globe.

The Club of Rome subsequently founded two sibling organizations, the Club of Budapest and the Club of Madrid. The former is focused on social and cultural aspects of their agenda, while the latter concentrates on the political aspects. All three of these 'Clubs' share many common members and hold joint meetings and conferences. As explained in other articles on this website it is abundantly clear that these are three heads of the same beast. The CoR has also established a network of 33 National Associations. Membership of the 'main Club' is limited to 100 individuals at any one time. Some members, like Al Gore and Maurice Strong, are affiliated through their respective National Associations (e.g. USACOR, CACOR etc).

http://www.green-agenda.com/globalrevolution.html

Dr Tim Ball details how the science of climate change came to be “tortured until it fitted in with [the] notion” :

**Almost every aspect of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) work is manipulated, selected, and controlled, to prove human CO2 is causing global warming. The objective was to prove the hypothesis, not to perform objective science.** [Source](https://climatism.blog/2014/01/24/in-searching-for-a-new-enemy-to-unite-us-we-came-up-with-the-threat-of-global-warming/)

This is echoed over and over again in the world of 'climate science'.

**“Rather than seeing models as describing literal truth, we ought to see them as convenient fictions which try to provide something useful.”**
-David Frame, climate modeler, Oxford University

**""It is no secret that a lot of climate-change research is subject to opinion, that climate models sometimes disagree even on the signs of the future changes (e.g. drier vs. wetter future climate). The problem is, only sensational exaggeration makes the kind of story that will get politicians’ — and readers’ — attention. So, yes, climate scientists might exaggerate, but in today’s world, this is the only way to assure any political action and thus more federal financing to reduce the scientific uncertainty.""**
-Monika Kopacz, atmospheric scientist

Assisted by politicians like Al Gore and Tim Wirth, in 1993 the latter did not hide the naked political objective.

**“We’ve got to ride this global warming issue. Even if the theory of global warming is wrong, we will be doing the right thing in terms of economic and environmental policy.“** – Timothy Wirth, President of the UN Foundation

It was never about the 'science'.

They were aided by national weather agencies and bureaucratic scientists with similar political persuasions appointed to the IPCC.

They claimed their goal was achieved in the 2007 IPCC Report which concluded,

**“Another unusual aspect of recent climate change is its cause: past climate changes were natural in origin, whereas most of the warming of the past 50 years is attributable to human activities.”**

All the CO2 numbers used by the IPCC are very poor estimates and designed to underline the human impact. They are meaningless figures from the total volumes to the annual flows and the human inputs as depicted in the IPCC carbon cycle (diagram). More [here](http://drtimball.com/2012/ipcc-control-calculations-of-annual-human-co2-production-for-political-agenda/)

**""It doesn't matter what is true, it only matters what people believe is true.""**
-Paul Watson, a founder of Greenpeace

IPCC wanted to prove human CO2 was causing global warming as part of their belief that industrialized populations would exhaust all resources and had to be shut down. Their only objective was to show human production was steadily, inexorably increasing. Their calculations predetermine that, because human CO2 production is directly linked to population increase. A population increase guarantees a CO2 increase. It is another of their circular arguments that has no basis in science. [Source](http://drtimball.com/2012/ipcc-control-calculations-of-annual-human-co2-production-for-political-agenda/)

They admitted as much.

 **""We routinely wrote scare stories...Our press reports were more or less true...We were out to whip the public into a frenzy about the environment.""**
-Jim Sibbison, environmental journalist, former public relations official for the Environmental Protection Agency

**""The only way to get our society to truly change is to frighten people with the possibility of a catastrophe.""**
-Emeritus professor Daniel Botkin

#Human CO2 production is central to the IPCC objective so they control production of the information. 

-Like most things they do it is disclosed, but they know few people realize the significance. The key is to control the process.

They do this through control of methodology, designation of technical advice, establishment of task forces, guidelines for reporting, nomination of experts to produce the reports and final approval of what the reports say. There have been many slip ups when they tell us the real agenda.

**""That, of course, entails getting loads of media coverage. So we have to offer up scary scenarios, make simplified, dramatic statements, and make little mention of any doubts we might have.""**
-Stephen Schneider, Stanford Univ., environmentalist

**“The data don't matter. We're not basing our recommendations [for reductions in carbon dioxide emissions] upon the data. We're basing them upon the climate models.”**
-Chris Folland of UK Meteorological Office",energy
personalfinance,Job offer for 30K less than making now in higher cost of living area. Is mental health more important?,"I am currently making 114K in a relatively lower cost of living area. The job is really wearing me down mental health wise. We have a new manager that used to work on our team. She is using things told to her in confidence by me when she was not in management against me. For the first time in my career, I was written up for my poor attitude, and she told me that I only do 30% of my job duties well. So, basically I need to find a new position before she fires me. It has gotten so bad that I am on 2 weeks of FMLA for stress due to this job. 

I have just gotten an offer to move to a different organization in a relatively high cost of living area. The HR person quoted me 82K for starting, doing the exact same position. I told her what I make now, and she explained that not even the most tenured person makes that much. However, they will conduct a market search to see what others are paying in the area and get back to me with a different offer. I'm not expecting much, and know they will not give me the same amount of money as my current employer. 

Current rent now is 1500, decent apartments in the new area run 2100.  I have 150K in savings and my only major payment is my car which is $500.  I choose not to pay it off in full due to an interest rate of .7%.

I am at a loss for what to do. I could take the pay cut for getting out of a toxic work environment, and better mental health, but would not be able to save much.  I feel pretty desperate at this point, but know that this new organization is majorly lowballing me. Should I just suck it up and take the pay cut?",finance

personalfinance,Took a loan out from 401k to pay debt. Advice?,"I have constantly turned to this forum to scrounge for nuggets that I can apply to my situation and it has been very helpful so first and foremost thank you!

I recently decided to take a risk to pay off some debt. I took a loan out from my 401k. Details are as followed. 

2700 401k loan
I chose to pay back in 12 months as a safety net though I plan to pay back early which I am allowed to do with no additional fees
6% interest annualy that goes back to my 401k.basically paying interest to myself.
50$ fee for taking the loan out.


Originally my plan was as followed.

Car payment 11.6%
2900 left
Minimum payment 300$

Credit card debt
3800 at 26%

Student loan 20k on deferment till October.


No other major debts.


My plan was to just pay off my car and reasoning was because I have been in debt for a while. I believe I'm referring to the avalanche method when I say just the thought of finally owning my car and not having to make payments already feels so incredibly good. I also figure that I will be able to lower my monthly insurance payment due to the fact I wont need to maintain the same level ( I trust my self as a driver have had 1 not at fault accident in the last 10 year, I am a driving instructor, I dont drive like an ass)


But what this sub has taught me was to always examine before making a decision. When I see how high my interest rate is for my credit cards part of me feels like I should lower that significantly and just keep making my car payments as is.


As far as work goes I make about 12 an hr but I can work as much overtime as I want.. I use to be in a pretty bad spot so for the last 6 months I have done 90 hr a week minimums. Its gotten me to this place but I will be burnt out fast if I dont ease up. I am working on trying to find a higher paying job but for now this is it. My biggest hurdle is budgeting which I am tackling as we speak.


Any insight, advice, questions would be awesome. Again thank you


TLDR
2700 loan from 401k how should I use it.

Bitcoin,India’s RBI and Bitcoin,"Hey Folks !!

As You All Know RBI has Repeatedly Cautioned Users , Holders and Traders of Virtual Currencies , Including BITCOINS , Regarding various Risk Associated in Dealing with such Virtual Currencies on Following Dates:

December 24, 2013
February 01, 2017
December 05, 2018

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley Kept on Saying that We Have Made a Committee to Analyze and Discuss the Matter of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies and Waiting for it's Report. Meanwhile RBI (Reserve Bank of India) Suddenly Sent Notices on 6th April 2018 to Exchanges and Banks About Not to Deal with Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies with Immediate Effect and Gave Three Months Time to Close the Operation.

Many Petition Were Filed Against RBI's Decision and Brought the Matter to High Court. Hight Court Simply Denied the Appeal and Said that all Such Matter Regarding Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies Shall be Discussed Only in Supreme Court.
Before Few Days SC (Supreme Court) also Said Banks and Appellant to Resolve the Matter at Their Level.

The Next Hearing Will Be On 20th July, 2018 in Supreme Court.

What Will Happen On 6th July?

The Crypto to Fiat Operation of Exchanges Like Zebpay , Unocoin and Other Indian Exchagnes Will Be Stopped On 6th July, But Crypto to Crypto Trading Will Be Operative.

Meanwhile Indians..!! You Guys Can Trade Your Bitcoins in Localbitcoins For These Days**

Do You Need To Worry About it?

No, Not at all.

We Have Found Something Which Needs To be Discussed Here.

A Person Named Varun Sethi Filed an RTI Against RBI On 9th May and Asked the Following Questions :

1. You( RBI) Warned People About Not to Deal In Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies Several Times (Three Times ).

 Did You Make Any Committee for this ?
   
  RBI's Answer : No

2. Can You Provide us the Members Details of Committee?

   RBI's Answer : We Have Not Made and Committee so We Can Not Provide Any Details.

3.  How did You Come To Know about the Risk Associated With Bitcoins and Other Cryptocurrencies
   
  RBI's Answer:  What is Sought is Not Information as Defined  in Section 2(f) of the RTI Act 2005.
   ( According to this Act they said that Such Type of Information about Blockchain and Bitcoin, Any Evidence , Any Paper ,    Any Model or Any Electronic Material is not avaiable Online)

4. Did You Collect Any Information About Blockchain From Any Other Countries Federal Bank
   
  RBI's Answer: No

5. Did You Take Any Measures To Adopt Blockchain Technology in Banking Sector

   RBI's Answer: No

6. Does These Rules and Regulations Apply on State Bank of Sikkim?

   RBI's Answer: State Bank of Sikkim Comes Under Us But We did not Provide any Notice to them

Can You Guys Look at the Answers of RBI. 
They did make the decision Without Any Adequate Reserach Which is Merely Speculative one.
We Belive that Cryptocurrencies are More likely to be Regulated Instead of Ban.
Regulations do Require Comprehensive Sets of Rules Which Requires Some time too.
Whithin Few Months or May be Few Years it will Be Regulated in India.

personalfinance,Better to put a stipend toward a 403b to receive an employer match benefit or to put it toward student loans?,"I'm a starting medical resident who is about to enter into a 3 year training.  I've been in contract negotiations with a future employer.

- I have 155k in total student debt with a weighted interest rate of 5.5%.

- I have the option to either
a) Have future employer pay 12k/year toward my student loans for the next 3 years
b) Receive 12k/year as a stipend with the option of contributing to a 403b.  In this situation, I would contribute 10k to the 403b and the future employer would contribute 2.5k for a maximum match. I would likely take the other 2k and place toward loans.

I am interested in what is better for me in the long run.  I can afford both options. The way I see it, if I opt for the student loans, 36k will be paid toward the loans over the next 3 years that I wouldn't otherwise contribute.  If I opt for the stipend, I will have a total of 37.5k placed in the 403b, but will only be making minimal payments toward my student loans, and as a result the total for the student loans will actually grow somewhat.  

I believe that through REPAYE simulations I've seen, by making minimum payments ($340/month) for my 36 months of training, I will have ~164k in total student loans at the end of training, less than you'd expect considering the payments due to an interest deduction through the REPAYE program that exists only through the 36 months of training.",finance

investing,Yield curve inversions preceding recessions,"[These graphs](https://imgur.com/a/P7xFSiE) indicate that the following series of events have preceded the past 7 major recessions:

1. corporate yield curve inverts
2. treasury yield curve inverts
3. corporate and treasury yield curves begin to recover strongly (although not back to positive)
4. recession begins

My questions are regarding the causes driving the yield curve recovery (movement back towards positive yield) before the recessions. 

* Is the yield curve rebound a reaction to FED policy and interest rate changes that make borrowing more palatable?
* Or is this driven by some other phenomena unrelated to FED response to the inversion?
* Lastly, I realize that inverted yield curves (corporate and/or treasury) are considered necessary but not sufficient conditions for a recession. That being said, what are you thoughts on the usefulness of these inversions for anticipating a recession and using them to hedge your investments?",finance

personalfinance,A Company is Charging my brother 223% Interest For a $2600 Student Loan,"I know my questions may not be answerable as this situation is complex but any help, advice, or guidance is very much appreciated.

My brother took out a $2600 loan to pay off his tuition rather than coming to ask my parents for financial help. Now this isn’t the first time he’s done something like this before, he’s gone to money tree in the past to do the same thing, pay off tuition. Now I’m sure the company went over his contract with him before his signing and agreeing to it and went over the interest rate for the loan explaining it would be 223% but obviously my brother didn’t pay attention and realize what he was getting himself into. 

Is this legal? I did some research on California Usury laws and found out that the state limit for interest rates on personal loans can not exceed 10% per year however, there are many loopholes and exceptions within the laws &amp; that many individuals who do take out personal loans waive their right of protection from these laws (probably when they sign the contract) and are thus allowed to be charged at interest rates higher than 10% per year. As it stands now, my brother took out a $2600 loan and has already paid back $1500 in $250 monthly payments with only very small amounts, approximately $14-$20, of the monthly payments actually going to the principal balance and the rest going towards the interest. My father spoke to the company on the phone and learned that as of today the full payoff value is still $2500 so essentially my brother has paid $1500 in total with $1400 going towards interest and only $100 going towards the loan.

My father was very upset when he learned of what happened and basically went into a full on rage and has advised my brother not to make any more payments until he figures out what to do. My father has basically come to two choices of what to do, option one would be having my brother default on the loan and hiring an attorney and taking the matter to court. Option two would be to see if the company can reduce the amount of the loan since my brother has already paid off more than half of it so that my father could pay off the rest. Basically option two is no longer really an option since he spoke to them on the phone and they said they couldn’t make any offer like that. What I am so confused by, and what I think the company would have a hard time explaining to a judge, is how they could justify charging my brother a 223% interest rate on a $2600 loan when his credit isn’t even that bad. I don’t know his credit exactly but I know it isn’t terrible and deserving of a 223% interest rate. He was able to lease a brand new Toyota Corolla with a low interest rate and not very much money down so I don’t see how his credit could be so bad he’d be given a 223% interest rate. 

This all seems very sketchy and shady to me but I don’t have very much knowledge on how loans work or laws of this matter so again, any advice and feedback is very much appreciated and thank you for taking the time to read all of this.",finance

CryptoCurrency,On Satoshi's Coins..... (Crazy Conspiracy or Real Concern?),"With the recent strange bitcoin hash number and all the crazy conspiracy talk it spurred I got thinking about some of the bitcoin theories out there, their likelihood and implications if true.  Now IMO the vast number of the theories out there are fairly obviously plain crazy, but some of the less extreme among them come with at least a possibility of a basis in truth.  I don't think that I'm quite in tinfoil hat territory like some of these people right now.  There's talk of the recent hash number proving Satoshi's return as a time traveling AI and other such insanity. 


Much of your opinion on this matter depends on how you would answer a few questions:
How big will bitcoin get?  Could it be the world's currency?
Who is Satoshi Nakamoto?
How world events play out?


It is my firm belief if even just one satoshi from a wallet known to belong to Satoshi himself was moved it would cause a panic that would crash the market faster and harder than the mtgox hack.  It seems to be a pretty agreed-upon fact that Satoshi's wallets account for around 1 million BTC.  That is nearly 5% of all the Bitcoins that will ever exist.  Think of the power over the price that holds.  With the lack of liquidity in this space, quickly selling that many coins could bring the price down to nearly nothing. 


Even with the current market cap Satoshi is worth over six billion dollars.  If price is to keep  increasing  it is not at all unbelievable that Satoshi could potentially become the richest man in the world, the first trillionaire ever.  Five percent of the total of an asset considered by many to be digital gold is a whole lot of wealth and power. The United States government holds a smaller percentage of the world's gold than that.  


So the trillion dollar question is who is Satoshi Nakamoto?  Some believe he is dead and gone along with the keys to his wallet. 
Maybe it is a group of people not just one individual, I believe this to be the most likely scenario personally. 
Perhaps like most people probably hope the person or people behind the project truly are individuals concerned with improving conditions worldwide, libertarian idealists fed up with the state of the current banking system.  If true, I doubt the keys still exist and if so wouldn't be used so the coins are safe from ever coming to market.
Then there is the scenario that is probably the most troubling. Perhaps the whole thing is a plot of some shady organization like the CIA, the Bilderberg Group, the Illuminati, or shape-shifting reptilians or whoever conspiracy theorists think run the world.  Of these I consider the CIA to be the only option with any real credibility.  The employ some of the best cryptographers in the world after all.


If it really is the CIA, or worse a rogue element of the CIA behind this I think it is a very troubling fact.  I think there is a pretty good chance they were involved somehow in the creation or at the least then or since have collected the relevant knowledge.

It's hard to say how likely it is that Bitcoin will become the world's main currency. But I think most people, at least around here, think it is going to grow a whole lot larger than it is now.  With the lead it has from its first-mover advantage it's going to be hard to top at least in the near future.

I find it unlikely that we will have world peace anytime soon.  If history teaches anything there will always be plenty of unrest and instability, and all empires, no matter how large, eventually fall.  I don't think I'd be safe to have the power those coins potentially represent in the hands of any one person or organization.  


So although it's an unlikely scenario, there is a non-zero chance that events could play out in such a manner. The question is can we do anything about it? Should we?",cryptocurrency
Bitcoin,"""Opportunity Zones"" - New way to defer capital gain tax on cryptocurrency - Invest in Detroit!","This new ""Opportunity Zones"" program allows for the creation of ""Opportunity Funds"" where capital gains tax can be deferred.  These funds can be used to buy and develop real estate and capital improvements in areas identified within the zone. 

I have a deep understanding of the Detroit real estate market and I am interested in managing an opportunity fund here in Detroit. Does this sound interesting to anyone? I figured maybe there are some people on here that hit it big with bitcoin and would like to sell some and avoid paying taxes.

A large portion of the City of Detroit is included within the opportunity zone and with the recent news of Ford's acquisition and renovation of the Michigan Central Station there is a lot of opportunity in Detroit.

 [https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/opportunity-zones-frequently-asked-questions](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/opportunity-zones-frequently-asked-questions)

## Q. What is an Opportunity Zone?

A. An Opportunity Zone is an economically-distressed community where new investments, under certain conditions, may be eligible for preferential tax treatment. Localities qualify as Opportunity Zones if they have been nominated for that designation by the state and that nomination has been certified by the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury via his delegation authority to the Internal Revenue Service.

## Q. Who created Opportunity Zones?

A. Opportunity Zones were added to the tax code by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on December 22, 2017.

## Q. Have Opportunity Zones been around a long time?

A. No, they are new. The first set of Opportunity Zones, covering parts of 18 states, were designated on April 9, 2018.

## Q. What is the purpose of Opportunity Zones?

A. Opportunity Zones are an economic development tool—that is, they are designed to spur economic development and job creation in distressed communities.

## Q. How do Opportunity Zones spur economic development?

A. Opportunity Zones are designed to spur economic development by providing tax benefits to investors. First, investors can defer tax on any prior gains until the earlier of the date on which an investment is sold or exchanged, or December 31, 2026, so long as the gain is reinvested in a Qualified Opportunity Fund. Second, if the investor holds the investment in the Opportunity Fund for at least ten years, the investor would be eligible for an increase in basis equal to the fair market value of the investment on the date that the investment is sold or exchanged.

## Q. What is a Qualified Opportunity Fund

A. Qualified Opportunity Fund is an investment vehicle that is set up as either a partnership or corporation for investing in eligible property that is located in an Opportunity Zone and that utilizes the investor’s gains from a prior investment for funding the Opportunity Fund.

## Q. Do I need to live in an Opportunity Zone to take advantage of the tax benefits?

A. No. You can get the tax benefits, even if you don’t live, work or have a business in an Opportunity Zone. All you need to do is invest in a Qualified Opportunity Fund.

## Q. I am interested in investing in an Opportunity Zone. Is there a list of Opportunity Zones available?

A. Yes. The current list of approved Opportunity Zones can be found at [Opportunity Zones Resources](https://www.cdfifund.gov/Pages/Opportunity-Zones.aspx). This list will continue to be updated as more Opportunity Zones are approved. A complete list of approved Opportunity Zones will be published later this spring after all Opportunity Zones have been nominated, certified and designated.

## Q. How does a taxpayer become certified as a Qualified Opportunity Fund?

A. To become a Qualified Opportunity Fund, an eligible taxpayer self certifies.  (Thus, no approval or action by the IRS is required.)  To self-certify, a taxpayer merely completes a form (which will be released in the summer of 2018) and attaches that form to the taxpayer’s federal income tax return for the taxable year.  (The return must be filed timely, taking extensions into account.)

## Q.  I sold some stock for a gain in 2018, and, during the 180-day period beginning on the date of the sale, I invested the amount of the gain in a Qualified Opportunity Fund.  Can I defer paying tax on that gain?

A. Yes, under § 1400Z-2(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code, you may elect to defer the tax on some or all of that gain.  If, during the 180-day period, you had invested in one or more Qualified Opportunity Funds only an amount that was less than your entire gain, you may still elect to defer paying tax on part of the gain, up to the amount that you invested in that way.

## Q. How do I elect to defer my gain on the sale of the stock?

A.  You may make an election to defer the gain, in whole or in part, when filing your 2018 Federal Income Tax return in 2019 (that is, you may make the election on the return on which the tax on that gain would be due if you do not defer it). 

## Q. I sold some stock on December 15, 2017, and, during the required 180-day period, I invested the amount of the gain in a Qualified Opportunity Fund.  Can I elect to defer tax on that gain?

A. Yes, as long as it was invested in the 180-day period, under § 1400Z-2(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code, you may elect to defer the tax on that gain.  A deferral election may be made on your 2017 Federal Income Tax return.  Information about the sale of your stock is required to be included in that return using IRS Form 8949.  Precise instructions on how to use that form to elect deferral of the gain for your 2017 return will be forthcoming shortly. 

## Q. Can I still elect to defer tax on that gain if I have already filed my 2017 tax return?

A. Yes.  You may elect to defer the gain, but you will need to file an amended 2017 return.  As part of that amended return, you will follow the election procedure described in the answer to the preceding question.",cryptocurrency

They just graduated about 1.5 years ago, and pay above the minimum @  $1,800/month (goal = pay off in 7 years). No other debts, 790 credit score. $30,000 saved for a down payment, $10,000 emergency savings. They save 4&amp;#37; into their 403b w/ 2&amp;#37; match (plan to increase to 8&amp;#37; soon)

\-Myself: about 48,000/year, in the process of applying for a higher paying position (55-60K). I paid off all my student loan debt &amp; have no other debt. 755 credit score. $30,000 saved for down payment, $8,000 emergency, and $36,000 in a 1.75&amp;#37; money marketing account from inheritance. I save 8&amp;#37; into my 401K w/ 2&amp;#37; match

\-The mortgage officer crunched some numbers. In our area, a 350,000 house w/ a 50K down payment (assuming \~10K goes towards fees associated w/ closing etc), loan of 300K at 5&amp;#37; interest rate + property tax/insurance/PMI = \~2150/month. 

\-A 325,000 house (285K loan) house run about \~2050/month

\-385,000 house (335K loan) about 2,342

These would make our ""DTI"" range from 31 to 33 ... I've read &lt;36 is ideal, but again I just don't want to be ""house poor"" once all other bills &amp; costs of home ownership etc are included. Thankfully we pay low rent right now living with family, but they're moving/downsizing so we need to be out by the end of this year, and renting in this area is very high 1,800+/month. We know we want to settle in this area where we're looking and will spend at least 8-10 years here. 

We also have a joint savings account w/ Ally @1.65&amp;#37; with 20,000 saved for our wedding (assuming family isn't going to help us)

Note crypto is far from a low risk place to ""save"" and not recommend for it but the big banks thoughout America and Europe are taking the piss out of any surplus/ spare cash you hold with them. 



Also governments keeping the base rate of interest historically low for such a long period of time are punishing those with savings.. but rewarding those that rack up credit and debt.

In all seriousness, though, thank you. This was mostly for my benefit. Telling people you are going to do a thing is actually motivation to do it. I do apologize for being so stubborn right off the bat- I'm opening up more to the idea of focus groups, as well as looking at other car options (though I honestly think my car is great and probably won't change it, but will drive it for the next 10-15 years)

I'm going to skim through the threads and will probably not be replying to many comments after this. I'm gonna fiddle with my budget a little bit, and try to squeeze some more. I am going to post an update (again for my benefit) at the beginning of September with where I'm at.

Warning: Long post. It's mostly for me, to have documentation and start holding myself accountable.

Income: Babysitting. Earlier this summer was about $250/week, but I start a second job on Tuesday, so it will be about $335/week until September. Then I'll be at about $500/week.

* BoA CC - **$792.05,** 18.49&amp;#37; interest, $14.38 in interest 2018
* Barclay CC - **$955.94**, 0&amp;#37; until August 2018, $0 interest
* Citibank CC - **$1530.10**, 20.99&amp;#37;, $1.45 in interest (Only $76 currently subject to interest rate until April 2019)
* Student loan #1 - **$21**,**311.58**, 6&amp;#37; interest, accruing
* Student loan #2 - $**2,582.63**, 7&amp;#37; interest, accruing
* Car Loan - **$10,183.80**, 3.74&amp;#37;, $205 monthly payment (these are increased payments- I could/should lower it to I believe $150)
* I'm also behind on my rent $550 for one month, and don't have July's yet. However, my ""landlord"" is actually a family friend who made it explicitly known that while I'm in school, if I had to do a no interest ""loan"" for rent for a couple months, that was fine. I do not want to do this, but I know them extremely well, and they genuinely do not need the money, and are very supportive of me in general.

Total income (until Tuesday): $1,071/month

Total income (Tuesday-September): **$1**,**435/month**

Total income (September+): $2,142/month

I included my previous/current income to make myself realize how crazy it was to think I could live on that. There is clearly no reason, once September rolls around, for me to have any struggles as long as I stick to a budget. I'm gonna work out a better budget and repayment schedule based on my summer pay, then come the end of August I can reevaluate and see where I'm at, and make a plan going forward.

I used [unbury.me](https://unbury.me) to work out my payments. Until September I have an extra $112/month (going to Citibank, then BoA). After that, I have $819 a month, but at that point, I'll be driving more and my garden won't be providing any groceries, so we will see. Even if I only have an extra $500/month, it still cuts down my repayment to 4 years (as opposed to 10). My debt will be rising due to student loans, but honestly, once I get my CC debt cut out, I'll be able to be aggressive about my student loans. In fact, just looking at CC, looks like I can be debt free in 6 months if my expenses don't change too much.

personalfinance,Credit dropping and I am not sure why? (Also general advice),"Hi /r/personalfinance,

I am in my late 20's and trying to make progress on the remainder of my indentured servitude term(student loans).  I have about 20k(started with 30k) worth of student debt remaining from college and last year took out another loan for 15k to finance continuing education(coding bootcamp).

While college turned out to be a TERRIBLE investment, the coding camp turned out to be a great one, and I am finally in a good position career wise and can start making progress on my loans. So I have been paying as much as I can to try and make some headway.

I have been paying pretty much solely into the loan I took out last year as it has the highest interest rate (8.5) while the loans from school are all within the 4-6 range. Currently the 15k from last year is down to ~7k. I have just been making the minimum payments on the rest of my loans so for those I am basically treading water with the interest.

Recently, I have noticed my credit taking a nose dive and I am unsure as to why. Back in February I was sitting a little over 850(all #'s are from FICO out of 900) and my score has since dropped to ~770, and appears to be on a steady decline.

I am not sure as to why my score is declining? Over the past  few months I have been paying more that I ever have into my loans, could this be causing my score to go down for some reason?

Also, any general advice on improving my financial situation would be greatly appreciated! I really want to start investing, but from what I have heard I should probably hold off until my loans are paid off.",finance
personalfinance,Credit card utilization and lowering interest rate to pay off my debt,"Here's my situation:  after grad school, my salary was on the lower end as I began my career.  I used credit cards to cover moving expenses, car repairs, to make ends meet, etc. for the last five years, before I knew it I had maxed out 2 credit cards, $8k on one and $3k on the other.  I had previously not done well with credit and had been irresponsible so my interest rate is 24.9%, (temporarily 17% for the next 7 months).  I've been much better with finances and budget, haven't used them for a year and pay as much as I can per month above the minimum.  At this rate I'll have them paid off in 3 years. My credit card company won't lower the interest rate any further or permanently  because of my credit score, currently average at 655.  My score is rising slowly and is hindered only by my utilization (90%).  I asked them to raise my credit limit to lower my utilization which in theory would raise my score and lower my interest rate and allow me to pay off quicker.  They declined to do so due to my score.   

Here’s the question:  should I stay the course and slowly pay down the debt at rates between 17% and 25% and gradually increase my score or open a new line of credit with little or no annual fee which would decrease my utilization, increase my score, lower the interest rate on the two cards and allow me to pay off quicker than 3 years?  I'm confident that I won't use this new card only to  exacerbate my financial issues.  Am I talking myself into something I shouldn't do or does this make sense?  I have looked at 12 to 18 month no interest transfers, the max amount to transfer was only $1k though. 

Am I missing any other options?

personalfinance,A story of a bank looking out for a customer.,"I feel like we we see a lot of negative stories (and rightfully so) about the crappy ways in which banks treat their customers, so I thought I might share a positive experience I recently had with one.

I have a credit card through Huntington bank that I don't really use a whole lot other than when the it's the right reward category.

Back in February I was on vacation in Mexico and I brought that card with me since it doesn't charge foreign transaction fees. While there, I made two purchases on it totaling about 200 bucks and for whatever reason, totally forgot about them.

I'm usually pretty good about checking all my CC statements every 2 weeks to pay them off in full, but this is one I don't check as often since I so rarely use it. Fast forward 4 months later, and I see my FICO score start to dip big time, so I request all 3 of my credit reports to see what's up. 

Much to my surprise I see I'm 60 days late on payments for that card and I'm absolutely horrified as I've never done anything like that before. So now I call up the bank and see what they can do.

I explained to them what happened, admitting my own oversight (while also pointing out that I never got any sort of notification from them that I had overdue payments) and hoped for the best. Turned out the lack of notification from them was also my fault because I forgot to change my address with them when I moved last year.

Well I'm happy to report they came through big time. I offered to go ahead and pay the balance in full and asked that they waive the late payment fees (60 bucks worth) which they did. I then asked if there was anything they could do about the ding on my credit score. They opened up a case on my behalf disputing the ding on my credit score to all 3 agencies and I just needed to fax them my credit reports to complete that process.

I was really blown away by how willingly and thoroughly they helped me out here. They could have very easily (and would have been perfectly within their rights to do so) told me to go pound sand since this was all my fault, but they did me a huge solid. Just goes to show that not all banks totally suck.



TL;DR: Effed up by forgetting charges I put on my CC and had a bunch of late fees and a dinged credit report, and the bank waived all the fees and filed a dispute to the credit agencies on my behalf despite it all being my screw up.",finance
personalfinance,Help with my budget,"Apologies for the lengthy post

Hey guys, throw away account because I don’t want people knowing my current situation.
I currently make $29k as a 23yo and I live with my parents, I bring home anywhere between 1600-2000 a month depending on overtime with not very many monthly expenses. My savings are as follows:

-401(k): 2k with 10 percent contribution
-Mutual funds: 1,400 with 200/month contribution
-Savings bonds: 3,900 with anywhere from 7-15 years until full maturity
-CD: 9,400 with unknown interest rate or time period, I’ve had it since I was born and my parents have just kept it rolling over
-$5,100 in savings account

I spend monthly:
$32 on auto insurance
$150 gas
$44 gym membership
$50 dog food
$200 mutual funds
Totals $476 a month on bills, I try to save at least $300 a paycheck in my liquid savings account.
I am also very careless with my spending habits while at work as sometimes I am too busy to access a microwave so I end up eating on the go a lot.

     I have some expenses coming up and would like some advice on how to prioritize my savings. 
    I’m starting school in January for approximately 13 months which will cost $5,700 dollars and will raise my income to roughly 45-50k depending on which department I get a job with
     I would like to propose to my long time gf as well in January, I have budgeted $3k for a ring but I may put this off until after school when I have the increased cash flow.
     We are also moving in together in January which I am guessing will cost roughly 1-1500 for moving costs.

I am getting $2,500 from my employer for my schooling costs but other than that how would you fund these upcoming expenses and which would you make a priority? Thank you all in advance!",finance
personalfinance,"With rates near 4%, is anyone else buying longer-term CD's through a brokerage these days?","Like most prudent investors, I have funds allocated to a variety of asset types, including CD's for some shorter-term needs.

Recently, I started looking into trading new issue CD's through Fidelity where several of my accounts are held. They have 15 year CD's at 3.80%, 20 year at 3.9%, and 30 year at 4%. Those all have monthly coupons so you're getting the yield each month. And while the CD principal isn't compounding, you could reinvest those dividends to effectively create compounding.

Now like everyone else I have funds invested in equities because I know over the long term that these go up at a greater rate historically. But if you believe in diversification, maybe these CD's could occupy some of the space in your portfolio that would otherwise be in bonds or cash for example?

Obviously duration versus interest rate risk is relevant, especially with two more rate increases expected.

To start off with I got myself into a real mess and consulted a bankruptcy lawyer this week. He recommended chapter 7 based on my situation, but since I had used my credit cards recently he wants to wait to file for 90 days to prevent any accusation of fraud. To summarize here is my situation. I work hourly + commissions so my income will waver, but this would be my 6 months income if we had filed today:

$46,000 gross income

$36,000 net income after insurance, SSI, income tax, etc

$43,000 car loan with 13% interest ($850 payment) that I just got in March

$54,000 federal student loans (currently $0 payment due to IBR from 2016 tax return)

$18,000 credit card debt (minimum payments between $400-$500)

$5,000 personal loan ($232 a month)

$850 a month rent/utilities

$278 a month joint car insurance policy with girlfriend

$200 phone bill with girlfriend

My girlfriend gives me $600/month to help with rent and her portion of the bills. After bills I have around $600 a month to use on food and gas and other expenses. However when my student loan IBR changes next year, it will likely rise to $400-$500 based on my income leaving me almost completely insolvent and certainly not enough money to throw anything substantial at debt. We have roughly $1500 in a joint bank account and that’s all the money I have. She has her own separate bank account as well and so do I but mine has $2 in it. 

My state median income is roughly 42k so there was some question about means test because I’m over that but he said with 120k in debt he has no doubt I’ll qualify so to prepare to file in 3 months. He said I should stop paying all credit cards and car loan because I’m surrendering the car. The next car payment isn’t for another month so a repo happening before filing is unlikely but possible. One reason why he said to stop paying is so that I wouldn’t be accused of showing favoritism to creditors. Since I’m surrendering the car, should I stop payments as he advised or would a potential repo be even worse compounded with the bankruptcy on my credit report post-discharge?

TL:DR keep paying car I’m going to discharge or stop paying as lawyer suggested before filing bankruptcy in 3 months?",finance
datascience,Disillusioned with data science,"To preface: I am two years into my career as a DS. I studied Econometrics in university. I work at a Fortune 15 company.

It has been a long year. We have a massive initiative this year within our group to stand up an entire machine learning/DS CoE for our domain. We have a ton of buy-in from senior leadership (I even presented one of our products to the CIO of the company a few weeks back), and it's kind of a ""strike-while-the-pan-is-hot""-type of year for us.

However, I feel like I spent most of my time just wading through shit use case ideas, where ML isn't the optimal approach, or the output is ill-defined. Square-peg-in-a-round-hole stuff. We have a couple of good wins so far, and some other good use cases in the pipeline, but are woefully understaffed (not from a warm-bodies point-of-view – we have plenty of team members). We have more engineers than we know what to do with, and not enough people who are independent and can see the end-to-end vision of an ML idea. Queue me working every weekend this year because of the amount of work that is shoved on my plate. But I'm young and out to prove and improve myself, so I don't mind it as much, especially during the winter. 

I like to learn, but I have next-to-zero inclination to go back to school for math/statistics. That idea just does not grab me. I love programming and general software engineering, and would consider myself an intermediate overall programmer, and an advanced Python programmer. However, the thought of leaving DS to do more SWE and becoming a code monkey also doesn't sit right with me. I love talking and working with people. While I do enjoy the occasional day spent programming, I couldn't do that for the rest of my life. I also feel like, while I don't think DS is going anywhere, that SWE has an even better chance of not going anywhere (i.e. always remaining relevant).

I guess I'm kind of at a crossroads – probably just pissed off and tired of working every weekend (some weekends are fine, but it might be taking its toll), and tired of shaking my head in frustration at others' lack of caring and competence before 7:30 each morning.

I guess I don't really have a question. I'd love to hear any advice folks might have, or if others are in a similar boat. I don't hate my job – I actually quite like it, when I consider what other jobs I could have. Perhaps I'm in a grass-is-greener situation. Cheers.",technology

This is what my portfolio looks like going into my deployment to Iraq after banking a solid amount at Army Ranger School (5 months, yikes): 

Salary as 28 y/o First Lieutenant: 60k
Debt: 30k student loan with no interest (parents)

My next course of action:

1.) Max SDP to the 10k cap with first few paychecks in Iraq (a program that gives 10% interest for deployed soldiers)

2.) Max Vanguard Roth IRA (5.5k)

3.) Put 6k in Vanguard Roth TSP (10% of my salary)

4.) Put the rest of my earnings in a high yield savings account (save for a house/wedding and pay back my parents)

5.) 90 days after deployment (limit of when you have to withdraw from the previously mentioned SDP), take the 11k from SDP (originally 10k + 10% interest) and put it towards the 30k I owe my parents, hopefully being the last bit of paying off all 30k by the end of the deployment.

The reason I chose a high yield savings account instead of a brokerage fund is because I’m 28 and expect to get married/buy a house in my mid thirties. From what I understand, a brokerage will gain me more interest in the long run, but I might not have access to it in my mid thirties or it could be rapidly decreased around then. A HYSA will be easier to access in this potential 5-7 year time frame at a lower risk, and is still more efficient than a regular savings account. I really don’t have too much free time to keep up with CD laddering.

The reason I’m not maxing out my Vanguard Roth TSP is because I feel comfortable that the 20% of my salary (5.5k Roth IRA + 6k Roth TSP) I am putting away will be enough given my course of action after the army. I have a federal law enforcement job lined up after my four years of active duty when I switch to the National Guard, so if I make it for those two pensions, I should be looking okay in my late fifties if all goes well. I can always add more to the TSP when I make more money in my civilian career.

1.) Any thoughts on this combined framework?

2.) Would you do anything different?

3.) Am I wrong for choosing the HYSA over brokerage at 28 years old for the reason stated?

financialindependence,Does amortization mean that your mortgage interest rate is irrelevant to the pay-off-early conundrum?,"Because of amortization, should you technically (purely numbers-wise, not psychologically) never pay your mortgage off early regardless of the interest rate? Even if you have a 15% interest rate, it’s simple interest and is already factored into the amortization schedule, so you will pay the same amount no matter what, right? Wouldn’t that mean that paying off early is *not* a question of a guaranteed return of investment at the mortgage interest rate? It seems to me that because of the time value of money, it would technically make more sense to always pay the minimums and invest the difference even if the expected market returns are lower than the mortgage interest rate as you will simply end up with more money available to pay down the same total amount of mortgage. I feel that this is a significant part of reaching FI, so I’m not sure why this aspect isn’t talked about here (not the tradeoff between paying off a mortgage early and investing the difference, but about how amortization seemingly makes the mortgage interest rate irrelevant in the discussion). Am I missing something?

personalfinance,How to prepare oneself for loss of financial support?,"Hello, I'm a foreign student who goes to a university in the US on F1.

From the beginning, it was agreed upon that my parents would support me through all my education (even grad school, etc.) However, two years ago it was revealed to me that my father is cheating on my mother and already has two children with another person, and he wanted to divorce, but right now they are still married on paper. He has always acted generous towards me, but recently he has been hinting that he would not give me any money beyond my tuition, even my flight tickets back to my university. The cheating thing is an elephant in the room that I have never brought up with him, so I don't know if he has changed his mind about supporting me – we don't particularly have a warm relationship.

I have about $700 in savings and a total of $4000 in credit line with all my credit cards combined with a very good FICO score (all with US banks). I also lead a frugal lifestyle by cooking for myself and thrift shopping when needed (rent is included with the tuition payment, which is greatly reduced thanks to financial aid). However, living in the US is inherently much more expensive than in home country as the US dollar has a much greater purchasing power, so even when I try to consume the bare minimum while studying, I would still hesitate to ask for money from my father especially in this circumstance (my mother is retired and lives on welfare). I am not legally allowed to work for anywhere but my university, where the maximum number of hours I can work is 10 per week (paying $15 an hour). I have also been taking out student loans which will amount to about $10,000 by the time I graduate, with a 5&amp;#37; interest rate.

My plan right now, given that I am not willing to ask my father for support with life expenses in case he uses it against me later, is to use my credit cards and some of my savings to get through the last year of uni with the hopes that I will find a job in the US right after graduation so I can start paying back my debt.

I would really appreciate some financial advise to maximise what I am currently doing with my money because as it is I don't have a great understanding about anything finance or what I should be doing with my money

**My current situation:**

I am 23 living in the UK and graduate next month from university, and I have a grad job due to start at the beginning of July which is around £20,000 a year. I understand that I should be paying as much as possible into my pension as early as possible. So the company offers to match the pension amount up to 5&amp;#37; so I intend to put 5&amp;#37; of my salary into my pension. Should I be putting more in? And the company has said that my pension investment choice is Scottish Widows ( 100&amp;#37; Scottish Widows Balanced Pension Investment Approach (targeting flexible access) Current Annual Management Charge (AMC) 0.75&amp;#37;) but they said that I can choose whether or not I want to change my investment choice.. so can anyone recommend which investment option I can use to maximise my pension potential?

I currently have two bank accounts -

123 Santander account (currently 3&amp;#37; interest up to £2000) my main bank account which currently has around £1500

A Metrobank cash ISA (1.25&amp;#37; interest) which currently has around £1500

Are these good enough (high enough interest) and am I getting the most out of my bank accounts? One of my friends has around 6 bank accounts all with different interest rates so I feel like maybe I'm not doing nearly enough with my money.

**What I intend to do:**

I understand that I should have some kind of emergency fund so I was thinking maybe I should be putting maybe £300-500 that I get from my salary into some kind of separate account with high interest and just let that accumulate until I hit the £10,000 mark. Can anyone recommend the best kind of accounts for this, like a fixed rate ISA or something or just another current account? And what should i be doing with the rest of my money, just let it keep building up interest in my main account or should I be investing it somewhere?

TLDR:

Should I be paying more into my pension?

Any recommendations for a better investment option to maximise my pension potential?

Are my current bank accounts good enough? If not can someone please recommend me a better one, and should I have more accounts?

personalfinance,Paying off a low interest rate mortgage early.,"I've spent a lot of time lurking this sub and the popular advise is to leave money in the market as opposed to pay low interest debt.  I completely understand the math behind that but chose to pay off my 15 yr @ ~3% in four years.  I live in a MCOL area (Tampa) and the house was $200,000.  I have zero other debt.  Here are my thoughts on why you should eliminate your mortgage as quickly possible.  This is based just on *my* experience and obviously isn't right for everyone.

* First is risk.  I am very lucky to be in a job that affords me the ability to pay the mortgage off this quickly ($145k + bonus).  There are very few jobs in the state that pay that kind of money for my field and very few jobs in my field in general in Tampa.  This job may not be around forever.  I understand this risk can be mitigated by a sizable emergency fund.

* My state has unlimited homestead exemption in bankruptcy and not subject to sale from creditors.  The only debt that can force a sale is not paying my mortgage.  I will have a roof over my head for the rest of my life irregardless of a large medical bill or a lawsuit.

* This house is a pre-marital asset.  While I understand prenups are not iron clad and I would have to speak to an attorney if I ever get married I am coming into it with a paid off house and there is no way she can argue ""Well... marital funds went to paying some of the mortgage"".  I don't plan on getting married anytime soon nor do I plan on getting divorced though :p.

* The biggest portion of my budget is freed up.  I can now afford to take risks I wouldn't ordinarily do w\ a mortgage.  I can quit my job to start a business, work for a startup or heavily commission based position, offer to train for a few months in the office\out of state (and rent a place) to give me an edge over my competition for remote jobs, not *have* to take the first job that I'm offered, and if I get a wife and kids down the line they can stay at home because we don't *need* two incomes.  A lot of people overlook this.  Simply put it's freedom and I honestly feel the fact that I can take these kind of risks will benefit me more in the long run than that extra few % in the market.

* I can do what I want with the house.  If I want to move I sell it on my terms (I can get another mortgage somewhere else first).  I can rent it if I want.  Renting a house is not as easy as it sounds.  Banks won't typically consider rental income toward DTI and you may be FORCED to sell your houses to qualify for a new mortgage.  A lot of people overlook this as well.  Also in the event of damage banks may sometimes require to use the insurance money to fix the house (with a licensed contractor).  If you own it outright you can take the check and fix it yourself cheaper.
 
* I'm now 100% ""locked in"" to having a roof over my head in a decent area.  If the market goes up or tanks and I want to move to another ""decent area"" the prices typically follow each other proportionally (sell high... buy high or sell low... buy low)

* I can now invest on my terms.  Now that I don't have a mortgage I'm throwing the bulk of my pay into the S&amp;P and maxing my retirement.  In the event of a job loss I can stop doing this.  It's a lot easier to temporarily halt investing than it is to not pay a mortgage.  This also goes for saving for things like a car, I can do it a lot faster with no mortgage payment.

* Don't neglect your 401k.  I still did 10% + 5% match (15% total).  Now that the house is paid I will do the full $18,500.

* Like college, It's an investment in yourself.  There is an extreme psychological benefit to be able to just quit your job at any time.  I feel like a huge rock has been lifted from my shoulders.  I'm 27 and never ""have"" to work hard again for the rest of my life.  Taxes are insurance are only like $3000.  Plus the fact that you can take extra risk helps (see my point above).

* Finally ask yourself.  If you had a paid off house would you take a second mortgage to put it into the stock market.  If the answer is 'no' you are still technically doing this by investing in the market as opposed to paying the mortgage as quickly as possible.  As they say in government all funds are fungible.

Anyway just wanted to share my thoughts.  After all personal finance is well... personal.  As long as you are not doing something stupid like paying 25% interest on things sometimes the mathematically efficient answer is not always what's best for you.",finance
personalfinance,Should I ask for settlement of credit card?,"I owe around $2,300 on my credit card. I'm on a hardship program that reduced my interest rate to 4.99% and monthly minimum payment to $95 per month. The program is for 60 months. It started February 2017. I got into the hardship program because I wasn't making much at the time and had missed some payments. I'm now gainfully employed and can afford to pay the debt quickly. I even paid $1,000 on the card last week after I received an upfront payment from my new employer. My sister suggested that I ask for a settlement to pay it quicker. Should I ask for the settlement even though I can pay it off? My job pays well. Before going into the hardship program, they had offered me an option of paying only 75% of the balance within three months and they will forgive the rest but I turned it down because I couldn't come up with the money. They had asked questions about my income and expenses. From a moral point of view, I just want to pay it off which would take a bit longer than if I were to settle.",finance

btc,I convinced a prostitute in Tokyo to accept Bitcoin Cash,"So I came to Tokyo for 4 weeks to attend the BCH Meetup's and last night I was lurking around the red light area. This really cute girl waved at me and said 2000 yen. She was very pretty and baby faced but I forgot to convert my USD to YEN and I was fed at the hostel so I didn't feel the need to, but she was still very hot and I didn't wanna pass up on it.

I talked with her for a bit about her work what she does etc then asked her if she knew about Bitcoin. She said she heard about it and I asked her if she would like to have some to hold on. I explained her the price volatility and told her she could have 200$ end of year if I give her 20$ in Bitcoin Cash right now. She shrugged and said ""Okay"" so I installed a wallet on her iPhone and taught her how to use it and sent her around 0.04 and taught her to sell it or spend it and where to do it etc.

I took her to a local restaurant and we had a nice convo then we went to a love hotel, she was just too adorable, I had to cuddle her after the act (cute faces and anime girl behavior 100&amp;#37;). I feel very content with life and proud of myself for helping BCH spread adoption.

personalfinance,Large student bill for making too much money.,"Hi,

I'm a rising senior in college (ironically studying Finance) that just got screwed by Financial Aid. Not too familiar with this sub so I apologize if my flair is wrong or if I'm even allowed to post here.

Here's my situation: basically, I pay for tuition 100% by myself. My mother who I live with simply cannot afford to pay for it. I am lucky enough to have a scholarship for my school, and compared to most students I do have a sizable financial aid package. For the past 3 years I have payed out of pocket (after federal loans/grants) $4-5000 each year. Each year for the past 3 years I have made anywhere from $6-8000, with the remaining balance going mainly to gas expenses (I commute from home).

My issue this year is FASFA finally noticed! As a result they expect me to pay $10,000 this year! To add to this, my sister just got out of college herself, so it looks like my mom has more money (even though once again this is irrelevant to my situation). I know this doesn't appear like much to most people, but its been a serious struggle thus far and now its gonna be even harder!

From everything that I have read online, colleges assume that paying for school is a ""family matter"" and that since I live with my mother I am dependent on her. Does anyone have any experience with this or know if there is a way to plead for more aid?",finance

Forex,My EUR/USD Thesis,"Hey everyone, long time lurker here. I'm a Finance/MIS student with experience in equity/crypto markets, and now looking to be profitable in forex and to contribute to this community.

I have put together an argument for why the EUR/USD will be headed lower for the rest of the year and perhaps into 2019. There are both technical and fundamental aspects that will be presented, with an imgur album attached with a 4H, 1D, and 1W chart. The daily chart is attached with the post. Let's get started!

Technicals:

1. From a 40,000 ft. perspective, the weekly chart presents a price channel going back to 2008 that the pair has traded in. In early 2018, the uptrend of 2017 halted and then reversed from the upper bound of the channel, while at the same time breaking downwards out of a symmetrical triangle formation - a clear reversal formation.
2. On the daily chart, we have the 50 day SMA crossing the 200 day SMA on June 6, the first time this has happened since the beginning of an uptrend in May 2017.
3. There is a potential descending triangle forming, which is labeled on the daily chart. There have been two overhead rejections, and two bounces from the supply zone. On the first bounce labeled ""1"", there was a bullish engulfing candle that failed to generate a significant rally - then on ""2"", there was not nearly as much buying pressure present off the bounce, signaling a likely continuation of the downtrend once the triangle is broken.

Fundamentals:

1. The Fed is further along than the ECB when it comes to raising rates. The U.S. economy continues to experience strong growth in almost all sectors which has led the Fed to steadily increase interest rates. On June 14th, the ECB announced rates would remain unchanged which led to a bearish reaction for the EUR/USD.
2. While the U.S. has been no stranger to political instability, the EU is increasingly being affected by eurosceptic forces. The Italian populist government recently gained power and is implementing anti-EU policies and has considered dropping the Euro/leaving the Eurozone. Angela Merkel could potentially be ousted as Chancellor and thus the de factor leader of the EU over migrant policies.

The trade, and where it could go wrong:

I will open multiple trades after a retest of the supply-turned-demand zone at 1.151, with take profit levels outlined by the gray zones and the black line representing the height of the descending triangle. Trade wars, a downturn in the US equity market, and the de-dollarization in the world financial system are the three big threats to this thesis. If you have advice, opposing views, or just want to tell me I'm wrong, please let me know. Thanks!

personalfinance,"First time taking out student loans for my PhD, no idea what I'm doing--how much to take? What are the risks? Help!","Hi there. I'm a PhD student in the US who unfortunately didn't land a teaching gig over the summer, which means I have essentially zero income for the next 2.5 months (minus a part-time $10/hr job on campus, which won't do much). I have about $100 to my name at the moment and have finally decided to bite the bullet and take out student loans.

I'm lucky enough that I've never needed to do so before, which means I need a bit of help. I've been reading up on the various types of student loans available to me, submitted my FAFSA to my (public) university, and just received approval for an unsubsidized federal loan of $20,500.00 (breaks down to $10,250.00 in Fall 2018 and Spring 2019, respectively). (My Googling tells me that subsidized federal loans are not offered to graduate students, unfortunately, but please correct me if I'm wrong about that.)

I have a few questions. 

First, there's no way I'd actually need 20k in loans. I'm thinking 5k would be enough. I know I have the option to take as little or as much of the money as possible, but am worried I will misjudge--what if I only take 5k and end up needing more? Can I up the amount at a later date? Or if I take too much, can I cut the dollar amount back down? How flexible is the aid?

Second, because I'm an idiot and didn't think to file my FAFSA until 2 weeks ago, there is no aid available to me before Fall 2018, and I specifically need money for rent this summer (my regular teaching stipend will kick back in around September 1st). If I take on a loan for the Fall semester, when might it become available to me? 

Third, if I'm correct in my assumption that a loan taken for Fall 2018 won't be available until Fall 2018, what is my next best option for aid during the summer? I applied for a private loan through Discover, but only did so to see what they would approve me for ($5,000.00). I've read all sorts of horror stories about private loan companies and the predatory nature of credit card companies in particular, so I'm loathe to commit to this unless it's really my last option. I wish I had started thinking about this earlier, but in my naivete I didn't realize that loans weren't ""instant"" across the board.

That's where I'm at right now. Thoughts? Advice? Things you wish you had done?

Thanks!

Edit: Hi everyone. This has been useful. I think my next step is bringing a few of these options in to my financial aid office and getting a second perspective from them as to which bears least risk.

personalfinance,Unintentionally haven't filed CT state tax for 1 (possibly 2) years. Now facing 5400 penalty for 2015(possible more for 2016)... What can I do?,"So I've bought a house in CT may 2015, but I work across state lines in Mass.

I thought I only need to file state tax in the state where I work, which is Mass (for several reasons   - friend advice and turbotax being not helpful).

So for year 2015 and possibly year 2016 (I still need to check later)  - I erroneously filed state taxes as Mass resident.... This year (so for tax year 2017) - I finally did file for both..

Recently **I got this audit letter from CT dept of revenue services: :-(**

&gt;Our records show that you did not file a Connecticut Income tax return for tax year 2015. Based on information we received from the IRS under 6103(d) of the internal revenue code, we believe you may owe income tax to the State of Connecticut.  
&gt;  
&gt;You must do take the following action to settle this matter:  
&gt;  
&gt;1) File your tax using the instrctions below;  (pay taxes + 10&amp;#37; interest + fine \~= 5400$)  
&gt;  
&gt;2) Complete page 2 of this notice telling us why you were not required to file.

**I have the following questions:**   

A) Why the fuck did they audit me only now? What information made them finally audit me now?  Is that standard practice to audit 3 years later?  

B) Why only 2015 and not 2016 as well since I think I also didnt file CT return for 2016... Is that fine also coming?  

C) does 6103(d) has any special significance? or is this a standard wording?   

D) Why does CT wants so much? They estimate state tax for 2015 as 3400$ based on 72k income from federal return apparently. Is it possible that they are coming from the wrong idea that I actually worked in CT and not in Mass?   

E) On the back of the form it says that one of the reasons for why I didn't file CT return would be that I was a resident of another state and in this case I can provide a copy of my State return to prove it or a driver license copy. Since I technically filed as Mass resident for 2015 - can I just do that? what investigative powers do they have?",finance
personalfinance,Being cut off during med school with no money to my name. Advice on how to strike it out on my own?,"I have 2 weeks until my next semester of med school and up until this point, I have been loaning through my parents to pay for school (with the intention of paying them back after, and they were adamant about this way as opposed to taking out private loans - since my school doesn’t offer federal student loans - because of lower interest rates). I’m appreciative of my parents’ support but over the past year we haven’t seen eye to eye and because I’ve been financially dependent on them for almost 25 years of my life now, it’s their way of having me abide by their rules, even though sometimes I’m unhappy with the lack of autonomy (although I understand I can’t just do what I want if I’m under their roof), that means not hanging out with “bad influences” who are actually good friends that they think have changed me or wanting to go on dates.

Here is the rundown on my situation.

income

$4.2k/mo after tax

$500-$1,000(sometimes more) odd jobs in my field of work

Expenses

$500 i use penfed's cash reward card(1.5&amp;#37;)( for gas and food and every month it totals to around that).

$50 student loan payment ($3,078 owed at 4.47&amp;#37; interest so i pay minimum trough FEDLOANS).

$100 personal loan ((penfed) bought my truck on auction and had to have money on hand, i owe $2,294.81 at 12.99&amp;#37; IR, i dont pay it off to make credit history as all my credit history is tied to credit card and not long loans.)

$60 cell phone(its usually 55 but att always finds a way to charge me a few bucks more)

$100 walmart( $967 No interest, i buy things i want/need or just christmass gifts with promotional pucharses)

$80 amazon(next month i clear this debt!!)

$100+/- electric bill

$40 home internet

No rent for the time being(staying home untill i figure out if i want to buy a place, family is very ok since i help around and pay bills, paying utility bill is almost nothing for me compared to a full blown rent. There is absolutely no pressure for me to move but i could if i wanted to and to be honest i don't think they'd want me to).

Some child support, don't want to be specific in case someone who i don't want to know my financial situation is reading but i spend a lot of time with the kid ruled by judge and what i pay is very minimal when it comes down to child support standards.

My credit score is 738-750 in credit karma.

So i had the idea that i wanted to start a business in my area of expertise, i thought all i needed was money but when i ran numbers, i figured that i need way more than 30k to start and im making ok money and getting experience in my field so i will just hang tight unless i see an opportunity. This is why id rather the money be somewhat liquid but i will follow the advice i get here since ive been a lurker for some time and i know the quality of advice being served. I also want a house, its a great time to buy where i live but i just haven't made my mind up because id very much like to break in to my field of work as a contractor which i can do with little money as i have tools and a work vehicle(my pick up). While all of this happends, my money is just there in two checking accounts.

My questions is, should i invest? Should i just leave my money where it is? Should i buy a house now that potentially the market will rebound in the future? I am very comfortable where im at and my money just keeps growing but i also kinda want to move out, i already moved out once and tried to have a family.Divorce quickly destroyed me, left me penniless with some debt and back in square 1, i really don't want this to happen again so im taking my time.

personalfinance,Looking for new Financial Institutions,"I am currently looking to change my financial institutions, I use BancFirst for my checking account and MidFirst Checking as a sort of savings account. I am looking to change to a High Yield Checking and savings accounts and have been doing a lot of research for the past couple of weeks but I am always talking myself out of anything I find.  


What I want is a checking account with a high APY, mobile friendly so I can use their app and link to other apps like Mint or Qapital. I would like a savings account with high APY, easy to transfer money, mobile friendly so I can use their app and apps like Qapital and Mint.  


Savings Accounts:  
I was looking at Discover since I already have them for my Credit Card and they seem to have good customer service and everything else I listed - 1.65&amp;#37; APY  
Ally looks almost identical to Discover so it comes down to personal preference but I have never used Ally - 1.65&amp;#37; APY

Marcus by by Goldman Sachs does not have a mobile app so everything would have to be done through the website which sucks but I did see that they recently added support for Mint so I would at least be able to check my balance there but I have no clue about them as a company and if I would like them - 1.8&amp;#37; APY  
PurePoint Financial is essentially the same setup as Marcus no mobile app only website, but I don't know if they would work with Mint or not again, don't know much about them and if I would like dealing with them -1.9&amp;#37; APY

The idea behind my savings account is just to start making money off of the money I already have. My MidFirst account hasn't been touched in two years, I have only withdrawn money from it once and that was when I was buying my house so the idea is to just put the money somewhere and start making money while making additional deposits to it. I would also like to be able to create additional savings accounts for vacation trips or big purchases that I want to save up for.  I was considering setting up a CD Ladder but I just haven't had the time or energy to look into looking up who to go with and actually executing that plan.

Checking Accounts:  
Consumer Credit Union they have a lot of good stuff going for them, they participate in shared branching so my girlfriend and I would be able to go to the same place for a lot of our banking needs since they don't have a location near me, they do have a mobile app but it doesn't look very polished and I'm not sure how many online services like Mint and Qapital it will work with, their APY does have a lot of restrictions on it like 12 transactions a month which I'm not sure if I would be able to do every month - 3.09&amp;#37; APY

Memory Bank has a mobile app but it looks like my current banks app very old school with not a lot of features, I have not heard anything about them until I started looking into other checking accounts - 1.6&amp;#37; APY

There are a handful of other Financial Institutions like Blue Federal Credit Union, Heritage Bank, Signature Federal Credit Union etc that all have above 3&amp;#37; APY but I don't know enough about them to really make a decision.

For the accounts that need a certain amount of transactions I have read that you can fund amazon gift cards or PayPal account etc to reach the amount of transactions you need, but need more info on how it would work with whoever I went with.

The current idea behind my Checking account is to pay bills like Mortgage, Insurance, Internet/TV, Cell Phone, Gym Membership etc. All of my ""spending"" like daily transactions for grocery store, restaurants, etc will be on my credit card to earn the rewards and then be paid off almost instantly with my checking account. So I want something where I can have my money available to spend and not have a limit on how many times I can take money out even though there won't be a lot of transactions, and I also just want to be able to start earning money on the money that I just have sitting there. I would also like to be able to link this with my savings accounts so I can transfer money easily between them. Qapital has some cool Rule Based Transactions like every time you spend money it rounds up to the nearest dollar and adds it to a savings account etc, but their savings accounts don't earn interest.  


  
I know that was a lot to read but I am trying to be very thorough so I pick the best accounts for what I am wanting to do with them. I am open to any suggestions you may have on other accounts that may work better for what I want. Thank you in advance for your help!",finance

In October of that year, my ex decided to call it quits, and I fell flat on my face with a rough case of Complex-PTSD from narcissistic mental abuse. This coincided with being laid off after a downturn in business at my work and I ended up living off the $25k that I'd saved for taxes for some time. 

I barely got by making $30-40k/year in 2016/2017, but got a job in 10/2017 paying $72k/year with bonuses up to $15-30k. I'm currently negotiating a raise to $90-110k/year, and have been paying on my previous tax debt and doing estimated 2018 payments so far this year. I owe \~$35k to the IRS, and I originally owed $5500 to the California FTB (I live in Oakland). 

Since March, I've been paying monthly payments to both entities. I'm paying the IRS $500/mo towards my previous debt with them, and I've paid $4k towards estimated 2018 so far this year (trying to pay at least $15k). I've paid the CA FTB $2300 towards the $5500 I owed, and $1000 towards estimated 2018. 

I'm going to have my previous state debt paid within 60 days. I am also 4 payments of $278 away from paying off my car note. These will open up more money to pay towards estimated and previous taxes. I still have student loan debt around $30k as well (Cal Berkeley grad), which is the biggest reason for my 570 credit score. 

I'm trying to figure out a way to build my credit score while paying off the $35k that I owe the IRS. I applied to SOFI and a couple of other sites, but got denied before even talking about the amount that I needed. 

I have a good job again, my career is back on track, and now I can see most of the red flags that proceed unhealthy relationships.

I’m having trouble grasping what the business model is. They buy senior living facilities and create partnerships with companies that will do the day to day operations?

Pros:
Steady financial growth since its inception in 2014.
Dividend increases every year and sits at about 5% currently. 
About 80% of their properties are locked into their contracts until 2029. 
Recession proof company 

Cons:
Rising interest rates will eat away at profits over time.

My daughter goes to daycare 1-2 days per week  at $25.00 per day, depending on whether my dad (retired) can watch her or not.
My internship is out of town, so I am also totaling about $275.00 per month in gas. I have a 2011 Chevy Equinox AWD 2LT, V6 with about 90k miles. (Currently getting 22-23mpg)
Note: As for things like groceries, and diapers, the amount I spend is highly variable, depending on what my parents decide to help out with.  Groceries(Including things like diapers and wipes) ranges from $100-$200 per month.  (This does not include eating out, which I no longer partake in, unless someone else is paying. 

On another side note: I do have $1000 in an emergency fund, $1000 in a Roth IRA, and $750 in savings as a cushion if I need something extra to pay bills (most of my bills are due at the beginning of the month and I don’t always have a large enough paycheck to cover the whole amount, so I take from savings and replace it with the next paycheck if need be.)

I am hoping to increase my income after my internship is over.  It ends at the end of July.  I graduate in August, so I should be able to find a full time position right out of my internship.    
I have considered getting a second part time job in town on Saturdays and Sundays in order to increase my income to pay off debt faster.  I only want to do this as a last resort because that’s even less time I will get with my daughter, not to mention, those are the only days I really get an opportunity spend with my boyfriend.  He is supportive of my decisions and wants me to get out of debt too, but we’ve only been together since February.  I’m afraid if I have no time to spend with him, it will drive our relationship out the door.  I have also considered selling my car and getting a cheaper car that gets better gas mileage in order to expedite the process.

personalfinance,A few questions to help me get what I need from a student loan,"I'm 18 and I do have someone to Cosign with me for my loans, which are due to the school next month. Right now, I need around $30,000 for my freshman year, and have been looking at Sallie Mae and Discover. Only thing is, the Schumer Box which both Sallie Mae and Discover have shown me (Before adding a cosigner to the application) both say ""Amount Provided: $10,000"". I assume this means the most they can loan me will be $10,000. My questions are:

1. Once I add a cosigner with good credit, will I get my full amount?
2. Do I need to take all $30k out? Or should I ask my school to pay per-semester? (School is University of New Haven)
3. If my parents were to instead, take out a Federal PLUS loan in their name, is there anything unlawful about me just giving them the money to make the payments?
4. Do you guys suggest any other ways to take out a loan that I can Defer until after college?

personalfinance,Wanting to sell investment property and toss profit into existing home mortgage,"Hey guys,

I currently have a condo as an investment property that I owe $131,600 (4.25 interest rate on 30 yr fixed loan). The current market value is $250,000.  I want to take the profit I make from the sale and toss into my existing home mortgage and then refinance my mortgage. My existing home mortgage is $267,150 (4% interest on 30 year fixed loan)

The reason why I want to do this is I'm planning on a career change next year and will take an initial 20k pay cut that I make currently, but will be able to make my current salary within a year.  This will help with the initial pay cut, but also payoff all my debt minus what is left on my home mortgage. I have a car loan at $8,800 and wife's student loans that are at $10,800.

personalfinance,"Trying to help my GF, who is buried in her loans, and I'm worried it's going to destroy her future","So here's her situation.  She took out 60,000 in student loans for her first two years of school, and had planned to take a total of 120,000 in loans over the course of her education.

Unfortunately, at the end of her second year she was kicked out due to poor performance (she was having a lot of problems at the time), and took a year off from school to work and try to resolve some of her personal stuff.

Fast forward to a year and a half later, she's back in school and doing much better!  She has a part time job, is doing well in her classes and has really turned things around.

Now for the shitty news.  Because she took that year off from school, the loan company (which is private, by the way) came looking for money.  She was able to keep up with the payments for a while with the help of her family, but now she's having to deal with it on her own, and the payments are totaling like 371 a month, which she can't keep up with while in school and only working minimum wage.  She is now getting FEDERAL loans for school, because she now qualifies for them when she didn't several years ago, but it's these private loans that are the real problem.

She has fallen way behind because of her inability to keep up.  It's gotten to the point where the loan company is calling me - one of her personal references - to track down repayment.  She has explained to them that she cannot repay because she is still in school, but they refuse to work with her.

I don't know what to do, and she is feeling pretty stuck.  Once she graduates and gets a decent job, she will be able to easier keep up with her loan payments, but until then she just can't afford what they are asking, and they refuse to work with her in any way on it.  I know that there are companies like SoFi that will refinance private loans, but only if your loan is in good standing and you have good credit.  

Any advice?  I don't want to see my GF of 5 years (who I will more than likely marry), get buried in debt and have this ruin the rest of her life, when she's only in her early twenties.

Any help or advice would be much appreciated!  We basically have to find a way to deal with her private loans from the first half of her education.  All of her federal loans are being deferred, and I know there are many tools available to deal with those.

We have investigated income-based repayment with this company, which they said they will not do, asked if they will re-defer the loans now that she is back in school, which they will not do, or refinancing to a longer loan period to lower payments, which they said they do not offer.",finance

personalfinance,I'm confident that the repayment planner on my student loan's website is incorrect. Be careful when using numbers taken from online planners/calculators.,"I'm refinancing my student loan in order to save some money. My current loan is a little confusing (which is probably the source of the error - but it doesn't excuse my borrower from having a faulty online planner). My loan is split into four loans, each with different interest rates. So in order to make the best of it, I have to go one-by-one paying off the highest interest rate loan first, and work my way down to the lowest interest rate loan. I save the most money by doing this.

Now, I'm not sure the online planners/calculators account for that fact. I *think* they just take the interest rate of whatever loan I'm currently paying off, and apply that to the *whole* four-part loan. Making a misleadingly high ""Interest you'll have to pay"" figure.

So... I was skeptical about the planner's numbers just by looking at the repayment planner without any interest rate black magic. Bear with me with some math for a minute: I've got a fixed amount that I pay per month (P) and the **total** amount I will eventually owe (T), which theoretically should be my loan balance, plus the interest that will accrue on it over time until the balance is $0 (which, granted, is a complex calculation given how the loan works). ""T"" is given to me my the planner, and ""P"" is defined by me. They are both plainly visible in the planner. So the following equation is pretty straightforward:

T / P = Number of months until balance reaches $0

Simple, right? I pulled out the big guns on Excel and ran the numbers for myself, down to the cent and accounting for each ""switch"" event where I go from one loan to the next. Using my calculation which I've gone over a thousand times, the answer is 60 months. But the online planner says... 77 months. The ""T"" number they give is $1500 **higher** than the number I calculated. That's not really a negligible difference.

And the kicker? Using their numbers, a refinancing would save me about $1500. Using my numbers, with verifiable math, I'll save a grand total of $50. I'm still going to refinance, because the new loan will be much simpler and more flexible, but it's frustrating to learn I won't be saving that much.

This post mostly serves as a warning against blindly trusting online calculators. The funny part is, most of the time you'd expect them to make their own loans look more attractive, when my situation was exactly the opposite.",finance
personalfinance,Is it worth it to refinance my student loans?,"I have five different student loans (all federal) with interest rates varying from 3.6 to 5.0, and in total, I currently owe about 17k.

I would appreciate any input.",finance
personalfinance,What are the benefits\drawbacks of financing via a loan secured by a savings account?,"I have an account at my CU that I can't (or really just don't want to) withdraw from, but I am able to borrow against.  The APR for a loan would be the interest rate plus 1%.  So right now the interest rate would be 1.25% because the account is earning crap rates.  If the rate in my savings goes up then the rate of the loan (and thus the payment)  would go up.  I'd still be earning interest in the savings, so I'd effectively only be out the 1% regardless.  It is a fairly long term loan with a very manageable payment that would most likely be paid off in about a third of the time unless interest rates on savings go through the roof in the next few years.  And even then I would be making more interest and could use that to make up for the payment increase.  I have no other debt currently.  

This seems like a no-brainer, but are there any gotchas that I'm not seeing?

financialindependence,Just starting to think about FIRE...,"I have been reading diligently about FIRE for the last week as the entire concept is brand new to me. In the last month I've had to start making some career trajectory decisions and how and when I retire will factor greatly in my plans. So, I'd like to get a status check. Having read the FAQs, hopefully I am doing this correctly and hopefully I am in the right place!

**Life Situation:** Married, single income (for last 8 years, may change in next couple years). I'm 41, wife is 42. 3 dependents (ages 9,8, and 5). Houston, TX area

**FIRE Progress:** Net worth = $1M (at least according to personalcapital), $600K in retirement accounts; $100K in 529s; Home value appox. $320K

**Gross Salary/Wages:** $164K

**Yearly Savings Amounts:** 401k $18500 (matching brings it to $25000), with another $8K-$10K in high-interest savings account.

**Other Ordinary Income:** Pension from age 50-57 will be $74K; from 57 on will be $58K (will get COLA increases to offset inflation).  Spouse may go back to work in next couple of years...perhaps school nurse ($50K-$60K). Not counting on it, though.

**Rental Income, Actual Expenses, and Depreciation:** None

\*\*Current expenses:\*\*Mortgage payment = $1500 a month, 4 years left.; Property taxes = $7000 a year; no other debt.

**Expected ER expenses:**

**Assets:** Listed above.

**Liabilities:** Mortgage listed above.

**Specific Question(s):** Not even sure where to start or how to organize my thoughts/questions, so I'm just going to jump right in (forgive me for rambling).Trying to understand my FI number factoring in a pension. I will be eligible to retire in 9 years (fed) with pension and medical. Pension from age 50-57 will be $74K; from 57 on will be $58K (will get COLA increases to offset inflation). SS at age 62 projected at $24K, wife at $20K.

My plan has always been to retire from current job at 50 and begin a new job in the private industry. Just always assumed I would need to, never giving thought to what exactly I would want to do....how much I would actually want to work, or whether I would want to work at all. If I had to guess today, it would either be managing a team in my current SME or consulting....though I haven't looked into either at all yet.

Based on pension alone, I'm already at leanFIRE, correct? Thinking I would probably be more comfortable toward FatFIRE, or $80K-$100K (FYI: PC projects my desired retirement spending at $65K)....how many years would I need to work in the private sector (assuming $120K job) to call it quits? Again, not even sure if I would really want to....just want to know when i would have the option.

The dream is to eventually sell current home and buy a house on a lake as the permanent home. Even trade-in would be great, but guessing would have to get a mortgage for additional $100K or so. This is dependent on whatever that 2nd job would be (and where) and where the 3 little one (hopefully) go off to college.

So, I guess the ultimate question is...could I really do this at 50 if I wanted to? Is that actually an option?If you actually read this ramble, thank you so much....I am open to any thoughts, advice, or even stories you may have that you think I may find useful. In the mean time, I will continue to read this sub (and the others I have found) to educate myself about all of this. Thanks again!",finance

I am a 21 year old college student who works currently  part time . For the upcoming fall semester, I owe a remaining balance of $4,662, which is due August 1st. I have used all resources available at school, which include a scholarship and assistance grants. I have $3,600 in savings and around $770 in Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF. As for loans and financial aid, I have the federal Pell grant and NYS TAP, which are unfortunately both minuscule compared to my previous years of college (I would not be owing this much if I received what I usually receive in financial aid). I also have the Federal Stafford loan, both sub and unsubsidized.

How do you guys recommend I go about paying this money off within the next month? My family can not financially assist me, even though my ECF is $5,000, as they can not afford that. I made $20,000 last year, which I assume to be the case as to why my financial was reduced by over half on both the Pell and TAP.I will also be living on my own within the next month, if that adds any relevance to my situation.",finance
personalfinance,401k or Roth for guy making 41k/year?,"Buddies I'm a factory worker making \~41k/year USD.  I'm a single guy, no kids, living with my mom and I basically split the expenses with her (she pays her mortgage and I buy all the food/supplies and pay part of the utilities).  For the past few years I've had the mindset that a Roth IRA is better than my 401k at work even though my 401k is really good (5.25&amp;#37; defined contribution from employer that will increase a little over time, good selection of investments with low fees).  Heretofore my strategy has been to max the Roth and do 4&amp;#37; + 5.25&amp;#37; employer contribution in the 401k.  Recently I've been thinking what might happen if I abandoned the Roth contributions and went all in on the 401k.  I live in a state and city which both charge me income tax (Alabama).

If I set my 401k contributions at like 25&amp;#37;-30&amp;#37; it would certainly reduce my current tax burden, but I think it would also qualify me for a little bit of the ""saver's credit"" on federal tax.  Also I'm on a income-based repayment plan with my huge student loan debt.  Reducing my AGI would reduce these monthly payments too I assume.  I'm 38 and have always had the mindset that I've got 2-3 decades of growth in US equities coming my way so Roth is the better option.  However, now i'm thinking that if I can beat my AGI down through 401k contributions it might make me eligible for programs like reduced student loan payments and ""saver's credit"".

This manifests into looking as though he is lazy and neglecting his responsibilities (which he is also doing actively to a degree).    He didn't graduate from college (while pursuing a degree in Chem Engineering for 6 years) and is currently living at my dad's place, working as a waiter - making prospectively about $30,000 (before taxes). He hasn't been paying off any of his loans and his credit score is approx. 600 with about $800 in credit card debt that my father is helping him with.

I'm afraid things will spiral even more out of control but don't know where to start.

As things currently stands, he holds approx. $110,000 in loans from private lenders (namely Sallie Mae and Great Lakes). They range from $30,000 to $3,000 all with pretty high interest rates. The Great Lakes loans being between 3.8-4.2&amp;#37; while Sallie Mae is about 10&amp;#37; (which is insane).

personalfinance,Looking for financial advise? 26 yo in nyc,"Hi all,

I am a 26 year old living in nyc where I work at a tech company. It has been three years. I’m looking for where I should be investing my money.

Currently I am making 70k a year with a 5k bonus. As of now I have 12k in a liquid savings, another 13k in a liquid savings that is a high yield interest account (1.65 return) 

For investments, I have 15k in my 401k with a company match where I contribute 10 percent each year. Also, I have 9k in mutual funds, an etf and an ira.

My only debt is 15k in student loans with a 6.8 fixed interest rate (federal loans). Each month I’m paying off 300 dollars. I’ve read that it’s better to put money into my 401k and investments because the extra cash will pay off in the long term more. Is that true?

Should I also get rid of my high yield savings account and just dump that money into the market? In my regular savings I have more than enough for an emergency fund

personalfinance,Trade in car question,"Hi! I really need some advice.

personalfinance,Fresh grad with new job looking for budgeting advice.,"This sub has been incredibly useful in the past so I turn to you guys again. 

I just graduated college with 0 debt and got a job that pays me 70k/yr. Take home is about $54k or about $4450/month. Just signed a new lease with 2 roommates and rent is $710/month with utilities running another $100. 

I need to buy a car because so far I have been commuting to work on a rental which is extremely expensive. Now that I have a couple of paychecks and the security deposit on the apartment rental is taken care of, I can think about buying a car. 

I'm in Long Island, NY and there are benefits to having an electric hybrid car like being able to drive in the car pool lane (my commute to and fro work is about 1 hour without the lane and about 35-40 mins with the lane) and fewer tolls, better parking etc. 

My workplace has free EV charging and there is a federal tax credit for buying a new car up to $7500 (which I believe I am fully eligible for) and a NYS rebate of up to $2000 depending on the car and model etc. 

I'm considering buying a Prius prime which will get me about $4500 in federal tax credit and $1100 in NYS rebate. The car itself is about $32k with all taxes and fees included. My credit is good (albeit age of accounts is low) and I was quoted a payment of $450/month with 6k down payment at 2.9% for 60mos through my credit union. 

I would really really like to save 2k+ per month to save for grad school which I plan to attend in about 2 or 3 yrs so the job is temporary. 

Other living expenses (food, entertainment etc) are about $400 per month. 

The biggest unknown right now is car insurance. I had a car before for about a year but it was registered to my permit (NY State let's you drive with an international license and NY permit) and just got my American license a month ago. Have been a licensed driver in another country for over 4 years. My previous insurance was about $170/month through a very shady insurance company and GEICO quoted me about $360 for this new car. This seems absurdly high but it's the cheapest quote I got. I have even done a defensive driving course last year. 

So my questions are multiple. Is this the right car for me? Or should I get something cheaper? How do I get a better insurance rate? I can also get renter's from the same company if that helps. My roommate is also willing to be part of the same policy if it's cheaper for us and my understanding is that you can add people from the same address to 1 car insurance policy. And finally is my budgeting fine? Should I cut back somewhere? Is trying to save 2k+ per month reasonable?

financialindependence,32 M and 30 F Paying Cash For First Home,"Hi all, We are looking for some guidance here and will try to provide all pertinent points.  I grew up in a family that lived well, but also well beyond our means.  Ultimately this led to a ton of debt, parents divorcing and our home being foreclosed upon.  Needless to say this contributed to me being pretty debt averse.  Fast forward a decade or so and the wife and I have a net worth around 370K and \~300 of which is in non retirement accounts.  The long and short is we are looking to pay 290K in cash for the property.  This will leave us an emergency fund of about 10K (monthly household expenses are projected at about 2K) in new property and annual income is a tad north of 100K.

Any thoughts, questions and feedback are all appreciated.

Not sure if it's relevant but current savings rate is right around 65&amp;#37; so we would build emergency fund back to where we want fairly quickly and thereafter invest assets to increase diversification.

Edit: A lot of individuals have spoken of how low interest rates are and the lack of diversification by having so much of our net worth in one asset.  The way we view this is as follows-our primary home is more of a comfort/practical item and secondly we will have more cash flow freed up to invest or by a second property--this would not be in cash.  Thirdly, we will have more money to invest in the market--we broke down the math like this:

Current Situation-rent

net worth \~380K all in equities

Proposed Situation-Own for Cash \~290K house

Equities\~ 90K

One Year from Now-Own for Cash\~290K house

Equities\~150K based on saving about 60K over next year and assumes that equities stay flat

By no means is this perfect but hopefully it helps explain how we are thinking through things.  If anyone has questions/feedback I'm happy to hear :)",finance

personalfinance,$80k in student loans,"Hi all. I'm currently about to start my junior year of university studying mechanical engineering. I have had to take out loans for the entirety of my tuition, Room, and board during college. I just finished taking a gap year consisting of internships and was able to pay off my first year of school for the most part on a 11% student loan. By time I graduate, I estimate to have about 80k in debt; 60k private at about 8.5% and 20k federal at 6% (I believe, possibly 4%, but assume 6% as  worst  case). One of my potential options of employment after college that I am very grateful for would land me in the 70-75k range (most likely lower towards 70) living in the Austin TX area. I also have a relatively new car that will be paid off by time I graduate, and I do not intend on buying another one for a whole, at least until my student loans are gone. So that expense is out of the way. I'm basically just wondering how feasible is it to pay off my student loans within 10 years or hopefully less? What is the best course of action for me to pay them off as soon as possible? I live rather frugally but also want to enjoy myself. Is $80k manageable in my situation? All advice is much appreciated!

personalfinance,should we stay or should we go-o,"Hello reddit community! A newly married couple kindly requests your help because we are facing our first real consideration of buying a house and and very much want to avoid making a decision we'll regret for years to come. for context and color, we are both bachelors' (fine art and neuroscience), below average wealth, and trying to scratch up to middle-ish class (oh what the hell, let's shoot for the 1&amp;#37;!!!). for a dire forewarning--whole lotta text down there....sorry! 

We have combined income of \~55K a year, with 47K being salary and the rest being freelance home-based business. 2200$ guaranteed monthly income after: health insurance, 8&amp;#37; (6&amp;#37; pretax) to 401K with a 4&amp;#37; match, and $200 extra dollars towards fed. taxes (just for bigger yearly return because that's how I'm used to paying down credit cards/treating myself to something nice). we don't count freelance money as guaranteed income because often times gets rolled back into business/pays off credit/serves as fun money.

total combined credit cards of 18K paying min balances of \~350/a month across 3 cards (two are 25&amp;#37;/26&amp;#37; and the third is lower, probably \~18&amp;#37; but has the highest balance) and student loans of 60K in repayment for \~150$ a month, IBR. 

bills total \~$650 a month for: cell bill, car/renters insurance, food, dog food, and internet. any extra money each paycheck goes to paying off the highest interest card ASAP, the first two months we were paying 300$ a paycheck but then vet bills, travel costs, and car repair jumped the balance up again. we have no savings. we have a car and a truck, the car's clutch is going out (3rd gear synchro) and so is basically a time bomb until it's worthless because it's not worth the money at 176K miles to replace the clutch. The truck was just fixed up and is in good shape (for a '95). no car payments. Up until a few months ago we were renting a cute house with a big yard in an economically depressed state for 700 a month, just barely treading water and really not enjoying our life day to day...

then we were offered to stay in hubby's late grandmother's house while mom and two uncles decide if they want to sell or keep. it was just sitting empty, 3 bed 2 bath ranch style townhouse in an HOA...so we relocated from across country in order to pay off debts and save up some money. Right now we're able to stay here rent/utilities free (thankyajeesus) but with the info that mom wants us to buy this place or be out by end of August so it can be sold. 

reading all this, I'm sure you're like, ""dudes--you're so not there yet. don't buy a house, you're not doing awesome."" yeah, I'm with you hombre/mamacita, except get this: mom says house appraised for 160K in December, she would want to get 100K from us to give 50K to each of her brothers and then she would loan us the other 50K and eat 10K of the house cost (Zillow mortgage estimate is actually 190K! :/). Then we'd stay here a few years, maybe do some cosmetic renovations, and sell in 3-5 years--hoping to make a profit of the 50K for mom plus money for a down payment on more permanent digs. the mortgage calculators never agree with each other, so I have no idea what a monthly mortgage would look like for 100K mortgage or 150K mortgage, but imo 100K is the max house we can really afford..Zillow predicts about 4&amp;#37; value increase for the neighborhood over the next year--for whatever that's worth...but seeing as neither of us have bought a house before, we have no idea what's possible or prudent for buying a house with family connections involved. and it's a bigger financial commitment than we've ever made...rent on a comparable house in town is out of budget for us, probably 1200-1500 a month, and we both work from home with two large dogs, so we kind of need the space, imo. but we could find an apartment that would be sufferable within our budget, maybe a rental house in the super sketch area of town. we could move back to the cheaper (ahem, less expensive) parts of the country (read, BFE), our jobs will move with us but freelance job might be harder to get gigs depending on how hopping the art scene is...and fuuuuu neither of us are ready to move again...friends and families are here....ok I've just been spouting a rambling, stream-of-consciousness type thang that might not be germane  so I'm going to cut it short here with:

Please feel free to give any and all ideas, words of warning, hints, tricks, tips, suggestions, etc. wife is first one in family to even plan for retirement and husband's family is all well off so we don't think they'd be able to give applicable advice (or maybe we're just too embarrassed to ask?)

personalfinance,Have you or Someone you know used ClearOne Advantage or a similar company?,"Ok, so I got myself into a financial pickle and I need help. I have looked into bankruptcy (doesn't really help me much), and I have looked into personal loans. My final step is trying a Debt Solutions program. Here is my story:

I owe about 34,000 in Credit cards and personal loans. Yeah I know, pretty bad. So My interest rates are average 21&amp;#37;. Terrible, it's going to take years to pay off. My ex-husband defaulted on the mortgage we had together and I cannot save it, so my credit score went from 750 to 620. It can be saved but not a high priority. 

I found this company, ClearOne Advantage. So, they negotiate with your creditors to  get a lower pay back amount. For it to work you have to default on all your payments, they negotiate on your behalf and you pay one monthly payment that they ""store"" to pay off any balances. They claim they can save me about 5K in expenses - I end up paying about 29k instead of whatever it would be in five years for the principal plus interest. I currently pay about 1000 a month for these bills, they offer 450 for 64 months - with option for early payoff if you have any extra money come in. That frees up about 600 a month - but is it really smart move??? 

I just received the contract, I haven't finished reading through it, but I did review some of the comments on BBB to see what people have said. Some good, some bad - typical. Most state the company doesn't settle with all creditors, or that the amount quoted increased, or in one case someone was summoned to court! 

In all reality, I just want to be debt free, for it to not take forever, and to be able to live comfortably while paying them off.

personalfinance,Grad school financing gut check,"Hi /r/personalfinance, I'm a frequent lurker and have learned a lot from this sub. I thought I could benefit from some collective wisdom as I prepare to enter a graduate school program in the fall.

I'll be doing a two-year master's that combines applied statistics and computer science with a heavy focus on AI/machine learning. It's at a top-ranked program with excellent name recognition - not to brag, just to explain that the all-in yearly cost of attendance (tuition, fees and living expenses) is $80k for a total two-year cost of $160k. A few notes: this program is highly specialized in my area of interest (one of max 5 in the country that combines the theoretical math/comp sci with my subject matter area of interest, and the oldest/most reputable one at that) so I am extremely confident that my education through this program will be the highest quality and most tailored compared to any other options. 

A combination of merit aid and federal work-study will cover 60&amp;#37; of the tuition for me - $30k of $50k tuition per year is taken care of, leaving me responsible for $20k of tuition and $30k living expenses. My parents will be able to help out to the tune of $10k per year, which leaves $40k per year that I will be taking out in federal student loans (split evenly between direct unsubsidized and GradPLUS loans). My plan is to aggressively apply for other outside scholarships throughout the 2 years, so hopefully that number will come down somewhat, but to be conservative let's assume none of that pans out and I end up on the hook for the full $80k.

According to research both online and with folks currently employed with this degree, I can expect a starting annual salary in the range of $90k-$120k once I graduate with a lot of upside to earning potential as I gain experience. I know the rule of thumb is that you shouldn't take on student debt greater than 1x your starting annual salary, and I am fortunate enough to have no student loans from undergrad (or debt of any kind, for that matter). From that perspective, a total debt load of $80k for this degree seems reasonable, but it is still definitely a big number and nothing to sneeze at, so I wanted to get some outside perspective.

Trading,[Trade Idea] Long JPYCNH,"Today was very revealing.

A report leaks saying Trump is going to block investment. Equities start selling off pretty hard (but not that hard, let's be honest). Trump sends out Mnuchin on Twitter to say that everything is gonna be alright, but he doesn't specifically say that the report about blocking investment is false, so equities continue to sell. Then they send out Navarro, and Navarro is explicit and denies everything completely.

If I'm the Chinese government and watching this, I'm thinking that the President of the United States does not have a very high pain threshold for losses in stocks. I also already know that the Chinese people are going to be able to tolerate higher prices a lot longer than Americans. I also have a political system that means it doesn't matter whatsoever if I impose costs on the population. This would encourage me because I'm sure to win eventually. So I continue a tit for tat strategy.

But eventually, like-for-like measures will be exhausted if Trump puts tariffs on everything. Because China sells us a lot more than we sell them, we have a lot more things to put tariffs on. China will therefore eventually have to move towards asymmetric responses, and may target index leading FANGs.

One thing is almost for sure I think: further escalation is inevitable because Trump calculates he has an advantage when he does not, and China knows it has the long-term advantage and views this as part of the long-term struggle for regional supremancy in APAC. They are going to be willing to go the distance. Eventually they will start using other tools, like currency devaluation.

All of this points towards buying JPYCNH to capture the devaluation in the Yuan against the safe-have Yen. I think there's a reason the PBC didn't raise rates after the Fed did...they're keeping devaluation in their back pocket.",finance
personalfinance,I filed a Federal tax extension in 2015 and never paid the rest of it. Just got this notice...,"Throwaway, because I'm embarrassed by all of this for obvious reasons. In mid-2015 I started a business which did really well. I unfortunately didn't know much about business taxes (and honestly, was very irresponsible at the time) and didn't set enough money back for taxes. When April 2016 rolled around, the business that did so well in 2015 was unexpectedly in its death throes. My estimated taxes for the previous year were $13,000—more money than I had in the bank. 

Hoping that the business would recover by October, I filed an extension and paid $8,000 of the estimated $13K. But by October, the business had only continued to spiral downhill and by then I'd amassed credit card debt trying to save it.   


So if you're paying attention, we're 2-3 stupid decisions (or ""learning moments"" as I like to think of them to avoid self-pity) into this story.

personalfinance,Ultimate New Car Buying Guide (Part 1 of 2),"# Introduction: Ultimate New Vehicle Buying Guide

Personally, I love negotiating for a new car at a dealership - there's very few places where you still get to go head to head in negotiating. I've helped a ton of other people negotiate for new cars and I've read hundreds (more likely thousands) of posts about mistakes people realized they made. So I spent the last few days writing a comprehensive (6000 word!) new car buying guide. It's targeted at first time new car buyers but really should be useful to anyone. Hope you all find this useful!

First, I've got to get something out of the way - *buying a brand new vehicle is not a good financial decision* most of the time (less so for Toyota/Honda and more so for more expensive and less reliable brands) *and trading in your old vehicle at the dealership is rarely good either*. Ideally, if you want newish vehicle, you should:

* Buy a 2-3 year old vehicle private party (brand new vehicles depreciate steeply early on - as much as 25&amp;#37; the moment you drive it off the lot). \[It will take a bit of effort/flexibility since there tend to be fewer private party sale inventory of 2-3 year cars\]
* Sell your old vehicle private party.
* Drive your new-to-you vehicle for 10+ years or longer.

Assuming you still want a new vehicle, this article is for you.

# Chapter I: Understand your Financial Health

**When:**  \~1 month  before vehicle purchase

**A.Determine your monthly budget:** The largest components of your monthly vehicle spending will be:

* Monthly vehicle loan payments
* Monthly insurance premiums

Your budget for payments and insurance should be no more than 10&amp;#37; of your monthly gross pay. For example, if you annual income is $60k, then 10&amp;#37; of your monthly gross ($5k) is $500. This is your max budget for *both* vehicle payments and insurance.

**B.Determine monthly insurance and adjust budget:** When you buy a new vehicle, the financing company will require you to add the following types of coverage on top of the liability coverage you already have:

* Collision: Covers losses due to damage to *your* vehicle in an accident. [https://www.allstate.com/tools-and-resources/vehicle-insurance/what-is-collision-insurance.aspx](https://www.allstate.com/tools-and-resources/vehicle-insurance/what-is-collision-insurance.aspx)
* Comprehensive: Covers losses due to theft, vandalism, fire/hail/fallen tree damage etc. to *your* vehicle  [https://www.allstate.com/tools-and-resources/vehicle-insurance/what-is-comprehensive-auto-insurance.aspx](https://www.allstate.com/tools-and-resources/vehicle-insurance/what-is-comprehensive-auto-insurance.aspx)
* Gap: (usually optional) In the event your vehicle is a total loss and your remaining loan balance is greater than what insurance pays you, gap insurance will cover the remaining balance. [https://www.allstate.com/tools-and-resources/vehicle-insurance/gap-insurance-coverage.aspx](https://www.allstate.com/tools-and-resources/vehicle-insurance/gap-insurance-coverage.aspx)

Finally, the specific vehicle model/make/trim level you buy (which you don't know for the time being) also impacts your vehicle price. For now, a safe estimate is $200/month and your actual vehicle loan payments are the difference in your monthly budget from the previous step and $200. So in our example, the actual vehicle payments can afford is $500 - $200 = $300/month.

**C.Determine value of your trade-in:** There are a few few websites that can help with this. You will notice that the value of your trade-in when selling private party is higher than when selling to a dealership. The reason is the dealership needs to make money when they sell your vehicle on to the next buyer. This is why I usually suggest selling your vehicle yourself on Craigslist/Autotrader etc. to a private party. To determine your trade-in value, here are a few websites to help you out:

* Edmunds: [https://www.edmunds.com/tmv.html](https://www.edmunds.com/tmv.html)
* kBB: [https://www.kbb.com/used-vehicles/](https://www.kbb.com/used-vehicles/)

Alternatively, you can go to [autotrader.com](https://autotrader.com) to see what people are listing their vehicles for. Based on your research, determine what your trade-in value will be. If there are other factors such as various add-ons, then adjust your trade-in value accordingly.

**D.Determine your credit score:** A key factor that impacts your vehicle payment will be your credit rating since vehicle payments almost always have interest which is partly based on your credit score. Here are a few options to get a credit score:

* Equifax Only: [https://www.equifax.com/personal/products/credit/report-and-score/](https://www.equifax.com/personal/products/credit/report-and-score/) ($15.95)
* Experian Only: [https://www.experian.com/consumer-products/check-credit-report.html](https://www.experian.com/consumer-products/check-credit-report.html) ($19.99)
* ALL 3: [https://www.experian.com/consumer-products/experian-equifax-transunion-credit-report-and-score.html](https://www.experian.com/consumer-products/experian-equifax-transunion-credit-report-and-score.html) ($39.99)
* ALL 3: [https://www.transunion.com/ppc-credit-report-495-free](https://www.transunion.com/ppc-credit-report-495-free) ($4.95 if you cancel before trial period ends)

If you feel confident that your credit is good, then you can get a free credit check (no score) to verify there won't be surprises later when applying for a loan here: [https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action](https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action).

**End of Chapter Goal:**  *Understanding of you financial ability to purchase a vehicle.*

# Chapter II: Calculate your Vehicle Budget

**When:**  \~1 month  before vehicle purchase

Many people think they know how much vehicle they can afford. And many people go bankrupt. I purchased a $40k vehicle when I had a annual salary of $60k. It made me poor for many years. Don't be me!

**A. Determine your vehicle budget ceiling:** Based on your credit score from the last step, you can determine your credit score range (super prime, prime etc.). The range will determine your likely interest rate. Next we will use a vehicle payment calculator *in reverse* to determine your vehicle budget. Go to [https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/loans/vehicle-loan-calculator/](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/loans/vehicle-loan-calculator/) and set values as follows:

* Credit Score: Pick the credit score range based on the score from Step I.D above.
* Vehicle Price ($): Use $20000 as a starting point, we will adjust very soon.
* Interest rate: Choose the rate that the website suggests based on your credit rating range. For example, in June 2018, the average rate for new vehicles in the super prime credit range was 3.23&amp;#37;.
* Number of Months: Select a maximum of 36 months.
* Trade-in / down payment ($): Enter the $ from Chapter I Step C. Add any down payment you intend on making. Subtract your remaining loan balance on your trade in if you have any. *If the total is negative, you probably should not be buying a new vehicle.*

*The monthly payment will update based on your entries above.*

**B. Adjust** **'Vehicle** **Price' field** **up/down iteratively:** Take a look at the 'Monthly Payment' field and compare it to the payment we calculated in Chapter I Step B. Adjust the 'Vehicle Price' field up/down until it the monthly payment matches your budget from Chapter I Step B.

When it does, the number in the 'Vehicle Price' field is your vehicle budget (Inclusive of all taxes and fees - ignore anything that says otherwise)

So in my example, assuming a trade-in of $5k, interest rate of 5&amp;#37;, and 36 month loan, I had to adjust the vehicle price down to $15k to make my monthly payment $300. So my vehicle budget is $15k inclusive of all taxes and fees.

**C: Vehicle budget too low?:** The number from Step B above might end up being disappointing. Well, consider it is a reality check. If you want a higher budget you ought to:

* Pay off your current vehicle if trade-in value is below your existing loan balance.
* Pony up a bigger down payment.
* Work to improve your credit score.

Whatever you do, DO NOT select a longer term length than 36 months; if you have to select a longer term length to afford to a higher vehicle price, YOU CAN'T AFFORD THE vehicle. This reddit group is filled with people that ended getting into serious trouble by taking very long loans and are under water on their vehicle for years.  If you can afford the car with 36 month term but want to do a longer term because you got a good interest rate, that's ok. *However, do not extend the loan term just to be able to afford the monthly payment.*

**End of Chapter Goal:** Once you've gotten to this stage, we will use the vehicle budget from Chapter II Step B and this will be your maximum **Out** **the** **Door** **Price**.

# Chapter III: Research and Narrow Down Vehicle Options

**When:**  \~1 month  before vehicle purchase

**A. Create a shortlist of vehicles to research:** Now that you know what your ceiling out the door price is, you should create a short list of 7-10 vehicles to research further. There are a few ways to create an initial list:

* Talk to friends/family/co-workers who bought a new vehicle recently - find out what they thought and why.
* Read magazines (latest Consumer Reports vehicle purchase guide (preferred, \~$4.99), [motortrend.com](https://motortrend.com) etc.
* Internet research on vehicle forums, reddit etc.

**B. Key** **evaluation criteria:** Use some of the criteria below to narrow down your list of vehicles:

* Vehicle Type: Determine what kind of vehicle (2-door, SUV, hatchback etc.) you need. If you are planning to have kids in the next 3 years, don't buy a 2-door coupe.
* Vehicle Safety: Research safety using data from IIHS ([http://www.iihs.org/iihs/ratings](http://www.iihs.org/iihs/ratings)) and NHTSA ([https://www.nhtsa.gov/ratings](https://www.nhtsa.gov/ratings))
* Reliability: Look up reliability data on the internet; I prefer consumer reports ([https://www.consumerreports.org/vehicles-vehicle-reliability-guide/](https://www.consumerreports.org/vehicles-vehicle-reliability-guide/)); keep a special eye out of new model refreshes since the manufacturer hasn't had a chance to work out the kinks.
* Standard Warranty: Vehicle warranty lengths can vary broadly. Longer is better. Bumper to bumper covers everything and is better than powertrain which only covers the moving parts that require power (engine, transmission, axles etc.)
* Total Price: Verify the desired vehicle model/trim level fits in your budget from step II.B. You need to reduce the vehicle price to account for fees (assume $1000 for destination charge, document fee, registration etc.) and sales tax. So if sales tax is *10*&amp;#37; where you live, then your vehicle price should in our example should be max ($15k - $1k)/(1 + *10*/100) = $12.7k. You can use the following websites to determine whether the vehicles fit your budget:

Edmunds: [https://www.edmunds.com](https://www.edmunds.com)

KBB: [https://www.kbb.com/new-vehicles/](https://www.kbb.com/new-vehicles/)

**C. Other** **evaluation criteria:** These are less critical but still important to dig into.

* Looks/Aesthetics:  Whether you like the look
* Trim Level: Most models have different trim levels that add more standard features and go up in price as features are added
* Vehicle depreciation: Luxury vehicles depreciate the fastest; Toyota/Honda vehicles tend to hold their value the best.
* Maintenance costs: Expensive vehicles like a Porsche can be $300 for an oil change.  Call the service department of a dealership to understand maintenance costs.

**End of Chapter Goal:** *At this point, narrow down your initial list to 3 vehicles to test drive. Max 5.*

# Chapter IV: Test Drive Target Vehicles

**When:** \~2 weeks  before vehicle purchase

**A) Head over to the dealership:** Bring your drivers license (required) and insurance card (optional). When greeted, say *""Hello, I'm not going to be buying a vehicle today, but I'd like more information about vehicle X.""* A vehicle salesman will seat you at his sales desk and take down some contact details, take a copy of your drivers license etc. and ask you what model/options etc. you are interested in and will present some vehicles for you to test drive.

**B) Actually test drive the vehicle:** Here are some things that you can only determine through driving the vehicle such as:

* Ride: going over bumps, dirt etc.
* Shifting smoothness
* Road noise on highway
* Seat comfort
* Driver front/rear visibility
* Turning radius
* Braking distance
* Vehicle acceleration
* Electronics/convenience features (GPS, speaker quality)
* Leg space (front and rear seats)
* Cargo/trunk space
* Vehicle feel/finish (interior and exterior) for the trim level you picked

**C) CAUTION: Do not get suckered into buying a vehicle now:** At this point, you will be suffering a high from the new vehicle smell and the sales pitch but *you are not ready* *to buy yet*. The vehicle salesman will try their best to have you make a hasty decision. Tell them politely that you are not interested. *Do not discuss any numbers, financing etc.* *under any circumstance.*

**D) Finalize your vehicle decision:** After test driving all your candidate vehicles, you might have arrived at a vehicle you really love. Decide on make/model/and trim level. If you are not happy yet, go back to Chapter III Step B.

**End of Chapter Goal:** *You've finalized a specific vehicle make, model, and trim level.*

# Chapter V: Finalize Financing

**When:** 1-2 weeks before vehicle purchase

While vehicle dealerships have their own financing departments, it's critical for you get a vehicle loan *prior* to buying your vehicle from elsewhere. If you don't, the dealership has tremendous leverage on you and you will end up with higher interest payments/longer terms than you would otherwise.

**A. Shop for vehicle loans:** The best place to get vehicle financing will be at a local credit unions. Credit unions are not-for-profit organizations that exist to serve their members. Like banks, credit unions accept deposits and make loans. But as they are member-owned, credit unions lend at more reasonable rates.

* See more here:[https://www.mycreditunion.gov/about-credit-unions/Pages/How-is-a-Credit-Union-Different-than-a-Bank.aspx](https://www.mycreditunion.gov/about-credit-unions/Pages/How-is-a-Credit-Union-Different-than-a-Bank.aspx)
* Rates for  credit unions vs banks: [https://www.ncua.gov/analysis/Pages/industry/credit-union-bank-rates.aspx](https://www.ncua.gov/analysis/Pages/industry/credit-union-bank-rates.aspx)
* You can find a credit union in your zip code here: [https://mapping.ncua.gov/](https://mapping.ncua.gov/)

Other alternatives to credit unions are USAA, traditional big banks (Bank of America, Chase etc.) but a credit union will likely give you the lowest rates.

**B. Apply for a vehicle loan:** Pick a reputable lender with low rates. Apply for a loan amount that is bit more than that what you need (loan balance on current vehicle - trade-in value + vehicle price + sales tax + expected fees ($1000) + 20&amp;#37; buffer) . The buffer is to allow for some room if your trade-in value comes lower or you don't get as low a purchase price as you expected. Once approved, you will receive the documents (with a special auto loan blank check) in a few days.

**C. Research any manufacturer/dealership specials:** Research any incentives you might be eligible for (loyalty discounts, military discounts, student discounts etc.) on the manufacturer and dealership websites.

**D. Get quotes on** **auto insurance and gap insurance:** Now that you know exact make/model/trim level you are buying, you should be able to get accurate insurance quotes. Shop around for insurance rates at 5 vehicle insurance companies (Amica, USAA, Geico, Allstate, Statefarm, Progressive, esurance etc.) as rates can vary drastically. Remember you will need comprehensive and collision insurance as well. Get a quote for gap insurance as well. Here is an article comparing various vehicle insurance companies:

[https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/vehicle-insurance/buying-guide/index.htm](https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/vehicle-insurance/buying-guide/index.htm)

**E. Find a good calendar window to buy a vehicle:** Best time to get deals are end of the month/quarter/year (vehicle dealers get $$$ from the manufacturer if they meet monthly/quarterly/yearly targets). Also look whether there are any sales events (Labor Day, end of summer etc.) coming up from the manufacturer.

**End of Chapter Goal:**  *You have a auto loan approved and insurance quotes for the vehicle you are going to buy.*

# Chapter VI: Negotiate Prices Over Email

**When:** 1-2 days before vehicle purchase

The smart buyer has negotiated prices before they step into the dealership to buy the vehicle. Be smart! This is one of the most important steps to get the best deal.

**A. Email dealerships for quotes:** Email the internet department of 5-10 dealerships in 50 mile radius. Tell them you will be buying a vehicle (specify in the next couple days and ask them for their lowest **Out the Door Price**. The out the door price is inclusive of all taxes, fees, incentives etc.

You’re going to have to pay title/licensing fees, sales tax, and a destination fee, which is set by the manufacturer. The dealer might include a number of other fees, such as documentation, marketing, or dealer fees. Make sure everything is included in the our the door price to allow for an apples to apples comparison.

**B. Do not provide phone numbers:** Dealerships might ask you for your phone number; don't give it to them and insist on communicating over email. This is for a few reasons:

* It limits the salesman's ability to apply sales pressure compared to the phone
* You have a communication trail in writing for any promises made.
* If you must send a phone number, use a Google Voice number or some number because you might get spammed. *Do not discuss trade in or financing at this stage.*

**C. Negotiate over email:** Use prices from one dealer to drive the price lower with another dealer. Keep repeating this until you arrive at the rock bottom price.  If you get a response that the dealership doesn't do competitive bidding, tell them that if they give you their best price, you'll buy today. They'll most definitely get back to you (as mentioned in the video in the intro). Pick a new email address to communicate because you will get a ton of email.

**D. Confirm deal terms and actual availability:** Once you get to the rock bottom price and there does not appear to be any more room for negotiation, you are done! Confirm the key details with the dealership:

* Verify the out the door price is inclusive of all taxes/fees.
* The dealership has the vehicle in their lot. Ask for a specific VIN number.

**E. Setup an appointment:** Contact the best rated dealership to make an appointment for the next couple days

**End of Chapter Goal:**  *You have an agreement for an out the door price that is inclusive of all taxes and fees , verified the specific car is in the lot, and have an appointment set.*

# Chapter VII: Final Prep (New Vehicle Buying Guide)

**When:** 1 day before vehicle purchase

**A: Recruit a friend to tag along:** Ideally bring someone that is not vested in the purchase decision in anyway and will stop you from making a hasty decision.

**B: Make arrangements:** For anything that will force you to make a hasty decision. For example, don't bring kids in to the dealership and instead find a sitter for the entire day. Reschedule any appointments that you may have for later in the day to another day. Pending deadlines lead to hasty and bad decisions.

**C: Clean your vehicle:** To get the best value for your trade in, get your vehicle washed, cleaned, and vacuumed. Add vehicle air freshener if needed. You want to give the dealership the impression that you've taken good care of your vehicle.

**D: Justify trade in price:** Think of all the reasons your vehicle should get the upper end of the trade-in estimate. These might include:

* Tires with low wear
* Less mileage than average
* No accident/damage
* Any transferable warranties
* Good maintenance records
* Add-ons (cargo net, extra floor mats, tire locks etc.).
* Trim options

*Write these down* so that you don't forget when negotiating with the vehicle salesman.

**E. Get you 'go bag' ready:** Bring drinks, snacks, Laptop + charger , phone charger etc. Since you already negotiated a vehicle price and got prior financing, your time at the dealership should be much less than the 4+ hours it would take otherwise but it is good to be prepared.

**F: Prepare documents:**

* Print trade in value from KBB/Edmunds etc.
* Print new vehicle estimates from KBB/Edmunds etc.
* Get your vehicle title handy (assuming your vehicle is already paid off)
* Check book for any additional down payment
* All vehicle remotes/keys: Don't forget the valet keys that come with many vehicle in addition to the second set of keys
* Vehicle manuals
* Vehicle maintenance records
* Print email with out the door price and VIN number
* Loan documents from Chapter V Step B

Throw all of these into your go bag and throw it into the trunk of your vehicle *right away or else you are going to forget the next day*.

**G. Remove all personal items:** such as child seats, maps, charging cables etc. that you won't need.

**H. Rest Up:** You could be in for a marathon day (4+ hours) in the worst case. Tired/emotional minds make bad decisions - get a good night's rest!

**End of Chapter Goal:**  You are ready to go first thing next day!

personalfinance,My plan to tackle ~17k in credit card debt,"tl;dr - I have 17k debt. I have 2 ideas/plans to deal with debt.  Is idea(s) good? Could be better?

**The Financials and Bills**

Currently 33, working as an RF Technician in NY (long island), making \~55k per year. \~20k in 401k, no savings, and 17k of credit card debt spread between two cards - 10k (BofA) and 7k (capital one) - \~25&amp;#37; APR on both.

I get paid every two weeks, which generally translates to twice a month (July 6th, and July 20th being my next checks). I'm paid hourly @ $26.00, and work on average 90 hours during a 2 week period. Average paycheck is \~$1700, bringing my income to \~$3400 per month. \*Gonna start aiming for 100+ per week, and see if I can bring that $3400 number closer to $4k. 

My bills include rent ($1200), phone ($90), Uber ($360), and food ($200), coming to a total of $1850 in bills per month, leaving me with a net of $1550. The only un-calculated bill I have is for general toiletry items (soap, shampoo, toilet paper, etc) which I buy in 'bulk' on amazon every month/quarter as needed - figure \~$100 per quarter. 

Aside from the CC debt, I have one final payment of \~$300 for dental, and a $150 coffee truck tab, both of which will be paid off this week. 

My plan is to have these debts completely paid off in 12 months. I realize that it will probably take a little more then that, because of interest or any unexpected emergencies, which I'm fine with - I just wanted a general plan/schedule to follow.

With the help of mint, and my own excel worksheet, looking at the numbers revealed two ways of dealing with the debt.

**Method 1 - Dealing with the lowest balance first**

Make 7 payments of $1k for 7 months for capital one. 7 payments of $500 for 7 months for BofA.

This will leave me with a balance of $6500 on just the BofA, and then I can allocate the full $1500 towards the remaining balance (another 4-5 months)

debt free!

**Method 2 - Gradually bring both balances down**

Make 3 payments of $1k for 3 months for capital one. 3 payments of $500 for 3 months for BofA.

This should put me @ $4k remaining on capital one, and $8.5k on BofA. $12.5k total.

Make 3 payments of $1k for 3 months for BofA. 3 payments of $500 for 3 months for capital one.

Balances after 6 months - $5.5k on BofA, $2.5k on capital one. $8k total.

Repeat steps above for another 6 months - debt free!

**Final Thoughts**

Either method will resolve the debt in the relatively same amount of time (I assume), but method 2 feels more relaxed and more effective.  I also want to point out that I wont be saving any money during this entire period, which means if I have an emergency, its gotta either come out of credit, or the money I'm using to pay for credit. This is really why method 2 is more desirable for me - with both accounts having a lower balance, they will also have lower minimum payments, so if I need to dip out of the $500 or $1000 debt payments, it wont hurt as bad. 

I've though about taking a lump sum loan with a lower interest rate, or doing a balance transfer, but frankly, I'm not financially savvy enough to know where to start with that - and so it's probably better off that I don't bother. Slow and steady, even if it is less efficient.

**Even More Final Thoughts - Ranting at this point**

All of this assumes of coarse that I don't use either of my credit cards for anything, go back to smoking a pack of cigarettes a day @ $10 a pack/$300 a month, buying an ounce of weed for \~$300 per month, spending stupid amounts of money eating out, and purchasing things recklessly before dealing with my debt. That $1500 'net' quickly disappears. 

I've always felt that I dance on the edge of success and hitting rock bottom. I'll never 'snap out of it' until I hit rock bottom, but I'll also never allow myself to get too close to hitting rock bottom. Although, this time around, I flew a bit too close to the sun and got burned - not toasted, just burned. Frankly, at 33, I don't have the time, energy, and desire to continue living in this endless fubar loop. I cant keep living paycheck to paycheck, year to year. If I don't front-load the pain of paying off my debt for the next year, and deal with some minor 'inconveniences', I'll be seeing that sun again.

I've been lurking in this sub since I first signed up for reddit, and I've read through enough personal finance threads to pick up on some of the wisdom found in them , which ironically, in retrospect, all of my debt and financial stress is a result of not following that wisdom. 

\- Using my credit card before saving money to cover the expense - DON'T get into debt in the first place. Build credit, not debt. 

\- Not having an emergency fund - Those emergency situation expenses/debt could of been lower.

\- Not realizing the potential of compounding interest - I've been working since 19. I started contributing 6&amp;#37; to my 401k 2 years ago. I have 20k in my 401k at 33. 

All I can do at this point is pony up for the next year (or so) and just get it done. Then I can focus on turning the money I was paying towards debt, towards savings/investments and building the future that I just spent the last 15 years figuring out. And I'd like to be on that path before I turn 40. 

Thanks for reading. I'm open to questions, comments, critiques, stories, experiences, etc. Just wanted to share the financial portion of my 5 year life plan.",finance

# Chapter VIII: Car Sales Person Showdown

You've spent a lot of time until now to make the best possible decision. You are in the red zone and any mistake now is expensive! If anything feels off at the dealership, **WALK AWAY** (even if only for a coffee break, it'll freak the sales guy !). *Walking away is your superpower, don't be afraid to use it.*

Remember, the average vehicle sales guy sells 120 vehicles a year while on average you buy 1 vehicle perhaps every 5 years. So on average, the sales guy is 600 times more experienced at this than you! *Keep your guard up.*

**A.Check-in:** At the dealership and mention you've made an agreement over email and would like to talk to the salesman.

**B.Provide basic info:** You'll be seated at sales guy's desk/office and asked some basic information (name, address, cell # etc.). They'll likely ask you if there is anything you need. You should ask for:

* WiFi password (to research anything unforeseen)
* Power outlet for your laptop/phone charger
* Some water/snacks

**C.Show your email agreement:** Confirm the details of the deal and verify that they have the specific vehicle on the lot and the *out the door price includes ALL taxes and fees.* If there any shenanigans, *WALK AWAY.* Chances are they will relent immediately or chase you down in the vehicle lot. If not, you can contact the second dealership and continue the process there.

*Under no circumstance should you answer any questions around finance or trade in at this stage.* Each of those things obscure the price of the vehicle and make it look like you’re getting a better deal than you are. Instead state you will be discussing only the out the door price of the vehicle inclusive of all taxes and fees. *If the sales guy brings up trade in or financing, turn them down.*

**D. Test Drive the actual vehicle you will be buying:** Ideally, you test drive the vehicle with the VIN you agreed on. Verify that the vehicle has the options that were agreed on and nothing is missing. Do an inspection and verify nothing is awry (high test drive mileage for a new vehicle, scratches etc.)

**E. Negotiating the** ***OUT THE DOOR*** **price (hopefully not needed):** Ideally you did the smart thing from Chapter VI Step D and followed my advice to pre-negotiate the price over email and this step is completely unnecessary.

However, some of you won't do that and so here is what you do: offer 10&amp;#37; below the price your research led you to believe you could get and there will be some back and forth among you, sales guy, and his manager. They will keep you waiting for long periods to wear you down. You could ask to negotiate directly with the sales manager. You should walk out at least once (even if it's only for coffee to keep them on their toes). If the vehicle has dealer installed options that inflate the vehicle price, tell them you don't want them and to have them removed (like fancier rims, dealer installed tow package etc.)

*Again do not talk monthly payments, loans etc. The only number you discuss is the* Out the Door Price *inclusive of all taxes,fees, incentives, and charges. Do not sign anything yet.*

**F. Negotiating a trade-in:**

Ideally you did the smart thing and will be selling your vehicle privately. But many of you won't. Only once you have agreed on the out the door price should you start talking about your trade-in. Do not allow the sales person to manipulate you into getting a bad deal on the trade in because you got a good deal on the new car. *Treat each of these as independent negotiations.* They will want to inspect your vehicle.

Show them all the research you've done on and what you'll take for the vehicle. High ball by 10&amp;#37;. You'll get low balled. Use the reasons your vehicle is worth more from Chapter VII Part D to drive up the trade in value. If you are not happy, don't trade in your vehicle and walk away.

One thing to note is that in many states (such as WA where I live), the sales tax on your new vehicle will be based on the difference between your new vehicle price and trade in value which will make selling to a dealership a less shitty deal. If you agree on a trade-in, make sure the out the door price is adjusted to account for the tax savings and not just the trade-in value.

*If financing comes up, tell the sales guy you will discuss that later.*

**G**\*\*: Some common sales tactics and how to respond; *be polite but firm.*

\[SM: Sales Manager;SG: Sales Guy;Y: You\]

\--

**SG:** We can't do the deal as per your email.

**Y:** I'm sorry, I thought we had a deal. It's a shame I won't be buying a vehicle from you today. 

\--

**SG:** This vehicle might get sold if you wait until tomorrow.

**Y:** That's possible, but it's more likely I will buy somewhere else before that.

\--

**SG:** Option X will bring you more money when you sell your vehicle; you shouldn't remove it.

**Y:**  I'll lose less by not adding the option than taking the depreciation hit.

\--

**SG:** If you agree that I can get you to price X, sign here that you will buy (happens when negotiating a price).

**Y:** Sorry, I can only sign the final sales contract and only after my terms are met.

\--

**SG:** Think of all the money you'll save on gas; you don't need a better deal.

**Y:** Gas mileage is not a factor to me since I expect low annual mileage.

# Chapter IX: Finance Manager Showdown

Mentally, you will be very drained by now. Your guard will be down. *Beware, you are about to enter the lions den....*

Before we continue, it's important to understand who gets to become a finance manager. Remember when I said the sales guy was 600X more experienced than you in the previous chapter? Well, the finance managers are selected from the best sales guys with years of sales experience. The finance office is where the real money is made in the dealership. *If you go in unprepared, you'll lose all the progress you've made so far.*

**A. Verify the key terms of the deal:** Confirm the O*ut The Door* P*rice* is inclusive of all taxes/fees, Trade in value of your vehicle, exact VIN number of vehicle being purchased.

**B. The Upsell:**  The finance manager is going to try to pitch you on a lot of things that are *horrendously* overpriced. Here are some  examples

* $500 for fabric protection is likely a $7 bottle of Scotchguard hand sprayed by the service tech.
* $200 VIN etching that can be done with a $15 kit on Amazon.
* $300 for pin stripe that can be done with a $10 kit on Amazon.

You catch my drift. Other complete rip-offs include:

* Universal security Guard
* Brake Light Flasher
* After Market Paint Protection (unnecessary, just wax your vehicle every 6 months)
* Underbody Coat (redundant and can actually cause rust by clogging drain holes)
* Clear Bra/door edge guards
* Gap insurance (will be 10X cheaper from your insurance company and is optional anyways)
* Window tinting (much cheaper elsewhere)

***Here is the only thing you need to say: ""I'm not willing to do anything that changes the out the door price in any way"".***

That should kill this quickly. If they persist, threaten to walk away. Some people opt for extended warranty but I'd argue you are buying the wrong new vehicle if you think a extended warranty is needed since that implies the vehicle reliability is crap.

If for whatever insane reason you want something, remember all of these warranties and service packages can be negotiated. If the extended warranty offer is for $4,000, tell him you'll buy it for $1,500. If he says no, tell him you don't want it. You'll probably get it for $1,500 because they are still making crazy money even at the lower price

**C. Dealership Financing:** *This is the FIRST time you reveal you already have your own financing.* This will make the finance manager very sad. However, I'd recommend seeing if the dealership can beat your financing. Be careful that they don't sneakily change the terms in their favor (for example, offering extra cash back for using their financing but increasing your total payment through changing interest rate or number of payments. Often, dealerships can offer better terms than even credit unions. Compare the options again in your calculator (specifically the total 'Amount Paid Over the Price of the Loan' field) to make sure you are not getting a worse deal:

[https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/loans/vehicle-loan-calculator/](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/loans/vehicle-loan-calculator/)

If you decide to stay with your financing, the vehicle dealership will need to talk to your lender to activate the loan. Make sure the loan amount is for the agreed out the door price.

**D. Read the contract:**

Nothing that the sales guy, the finance manager, or anyone else said matters anymore. The contract is the only thing that matters and supersedes everything else. The finance manager will try to hurry you through this and they often sneak in changes. On my first vehicle purchase, the interest payment jumped from .9&amp;#37; to 2.9&amp;#37; and the term increased from 36 to 48 months. They claimed it was a ""mistake"". It was BS. If I signed, I would have gotten screwed.

**E. READ. THE. FUCKING. CONTRACT.**

I can't stress this enough. Triple check every number. Ask direct questions. Read every line. twice. Then ask your tag along to read everything as well. If you are tired, take a 30 minute break to get your concentration back. Ensure your out the door price is honored and all fees are included.

**F. Sign the contract:** The contract is binding.  There are no take backsies. There is no cool down period. Sign carefully. Sign over you trade-in vehicle title. Get a copy of all signed documents.  If you are now unhappy about something at this point, it's too late!

**G. Common finance manager tactics and how to respond:**

\[**FM:** Finance Manager\*\*;Y\*\*: You\]

\--

**FM:** Would you like warranty option A, B, or C.

**Y:** Sorry, I am not interested in anything that changes the our the door price in anyway. 

\--

**FM:** Your kids will make a mess. I recommend our fabric protection add on for $500.

**Y:** Sorry, I am not interested in anything that changes the our the door price in anyway. 

\--

**FM:** You really ought to get a warranty. You don't want to run into issues when your warranty runs out.

**Y:** I am buying this car because of the reliability. If you really think I need an extended warranty, this is not the right car for me.

\--

**FM:** Our financing is only $30 a month extra. That's not even a coffee a day.

**Y:** After interest, that's $1500 over the loan term (use loan calculator)! That's not insignificant!

\--

**FM:** Something came up, we can't offer you the deal the sales guy offered you.

**Y:** I'm sorry, I thought we had a deal. It's a shame I won't be buying a vehicle from you today.

\--

**FM:** You need to get gap insurance to protect yourself; it's only $1000.

**Y:** My insurance offers it for $20; I'll be purchasing gap coverage through them.

\--

# Chapter X: Take Possession of Vehicle

You are almost done. Just a few last things to do....

**A. Update insurance:** Sign up for the best insurance quote you got earlier from Chapter V Step D and cancel the one on the previous vehicle. You will likely need to email or have the insurance company fax a copy to the dealership before taking possession of your vehicle. Have them print a copy for you so that you have one with you for the drive back home.

**B. Clear out your old vehicle:** Make sure you collect all the things you will need:

* Garage clicker
* Easy pass/EZ Tag
* Handicap/disabled tag
* Parking tag/sticker
* Vehicle electronics (portable GPS, portable XM radio, dash cam, phone charging cables etc.)
* Empty out glove box, center console, seat back pocket, side pocket, coin box, sun glass storage
* Verify nothing is left in the trunk/ back seat
* License plates (based on state)

**C. Vehicle inspection:** Do a walk around and verify there is no cosmetic damage. *Test everything; it's much easier to get it addressed now than discovering these later!* If there are issues, resolve them right away (or get a written promise for them to fix it). Ensure all options have been accounted for. For example, if you were promised free rubber vehicle mats that they are there. *Test drive the vehicle as though you were buying as second hand vehicle.*

**D. Collect new vehicle:** Make sure you collect the following:

* All vehicle keys (including valet keys)
* All documents (sales contract, insurance copy, vehicle manual etc.)

**E. Setup new vehicle:** have the sales guy set up things like GPS, activate XM radio, phone pairing/bluetooth setup and walk you through anything else you might need.

**F. Acclimate yourself to your new vehicle:**

* Adjust vehicle seat, side and rear view mirrors, steering wheel,
* learn key controls : headlights, AC, defroster, dehumidifier, hazard lights, speaker volume - you don't want to be fidgeting with this in the middle of the road

**G. Drive home!**

# Chapter XI: Post Purchase

**A.Drive** **vehicle lightly over break-in period (if applicable):** There is a break in period for some vehicles which limit speed, trip distance, sudden acceleration etc. The reason is the oil that comes with the vehicle is special to help engine break in. Make sure you don't cause long term maintenance issues by over exerting the vehicle in the break in period (break in period will be specified in the vehicle manual).

**B.Setup monthly payments:** If you financed your vehicle, don't forget to setup automatic payments at the credit union/bank/lender website.

**C. Update** **o\*\*\*\*nline accounts:** Update any online accounts such as your apartment parking records, work parking records, EZ pass settings etc. that might be tied to your old vehicle/license plate.

**D. Yoyo financing:** Sometimes, if you financed the deal through the dealership, the financing might fall through after you've taken possession of the vehicle - this is a shitty thing for the dealership to do. If this happens, you could finance with your credit union. If the dealership gives you any grief (and you don't want to use your financing), your nuclear option is to tell them you will be ""unwinding the deal."" This will make them try their hardest to make things right.

**E. Happy driving and make sure to maintain your vehicle regularly!**

personalfinance,"Help! Bought Real Estate With My Sisters While in High School, and Need Help Restructuring It","Hello Reddit. I am looking for advice on how to move forward with a weird real estate setup I have with my sisters. It has never sat well with me and I would like to do things right going forward.

When I was in 10th grade, back in 1999, the three of us had some money from our grandparents that we decided to pool together to invest in a condo in San Diego, CA. My older sister was the only one who was a working, legal adult so while the down payment was provided by all three of us, the loan and title for the condo we found ended up in her name only. 

Two years later, home prices had gone up by about 30&amp;#37; while interest rates had gone from around 7-8&amp;#37; down to around 5-6&amp;#37;. The numbers worked out enough so that we refinanced, pulled out equity, and used it to buy a second condo.

For most of the past 16-17 years we have been renting the two condos out. The rent essentially just covers the mortgage, HOA, insurance, etc. We don't really cash flow very much, especially considering occasional repairs, but we have built up a fair amount of equity over this period of time. For several reasons it's never really sat well with me that everything is in her name. 1) I don't care for her husband, who did thankfully signed over his legal interest in the property fully to her. 2) Her credit is not great (due to joint accounts with her husband) and so we weren't able to refinance the two loans from 6&amp;#37; down to 3.5&amp;#37; over the past couple years. This could have saved us thousands. 3) I don't have full say in how to run the investment; my sisters let the places get run down and we have a lot of tenant turnover and sometimes need to do evictions, while I would prefer to keep the places more well maintained to charge higher rent and attract better tenants. If my sister had had my credit, we probably also could have taken advantage of the low interest rates to pull out equity and buy another place even. 4) There's been times I wanted to sell out so that I could perhaps buy my own place, but my sisters didn't agree and I felt there was nothing I could do about it. 5) I'm not sure if my sister is smart with how she handles the properties when filing taxes, and I'm not sure if she probably shares the tax benefits back with us. I don't think she is cheating us or anything, but its just messy.

I am not completely disconnected from the properties. My sister did create a living trust with my younger sister and I as beneficiaries in case something happens to her. However, this is only a little bit of comfort to me. What if she changes the trust? I have a kid now, so I should have her named in the trust too in case something happens to me right? I also started managing the finances about 4 years ago. My sister sends me the rent checks from the tenants, I cash them, and then I pay the mortgage and HOA out of a separate reserve account I created for the properties. This gives me some comfort as the account does have a bit of cash saved up that is legally just in my name if shit were to hit the fan, but the value in the account is not nearly as much as my ""claim"" to the properties.

What do you guys recommend for a situation like this? What is the optimal, and cost conscious, way to set things up going forward and what steps do I take to get there? Should I ask my sister to quitclaim deed portions of the property to me and my little sister? Do we need the bank's permission to do this? What are the tax implications of that? Would the government treat it like a ""gift"" my sister is giving to us? Should we instead setup an LLC that owns it? Will the bank allow the properties to be owned by an LLC while there is a mortgage balance? Do I need to hire someone to help me with all this? If so, what type of professional/s do I need?

While there were times in the past I just wanted ""out"", I don't really need the cash right now; my main concern is that I just want to make sure my share is legally recognized so my child/ren would get what should be theirs. So I am fine with a solution in which we don't sell out so long as I have a legal claim to the property. One last wrinkle is that I am extremely busy in my work, and I don't live in San Diego anymore, so that complicates resolution some.  Anyways, thanks for reading my novel. I didn't intend it to get this long. I see some very thoughtful advice given at times on reddit and I am hoping someone out there can offer some here. Please be kind to me, I got myself in this situations with decisions made in high school. Sometimes I regret those decisions, but on the other hand property skyrocketed so much that if we hadn't have bought something at that time, I'm not sure we could have bought later and ended up with so much equity. So the decision wasn't all bad. Anyways, thank you for your time and responses!",finance

personalfinance,"Is it ever optimal to pay the 10% and use 401k to ""shift"" income from a high-income to a low-income year?","Here's my situation:

- had high income for a few years (say ~30% effective tax bracket between state and federal)

- won't work for a year or two and will spend from my savings. 

I'm wondering if it makes sense to ""spend"" from my 401k instead of after-tax savings. If I take $25k out of my 401k on an otherwise zero-income year, then that previously untaxed money will be taxed at ~8%; even adding the 10% withdrawal penalty, that means I've essentially converted pre-tax income from a high-income year into post-tax income at a tax rate of 18% instead of 30%. 

Now - I'm not sure how to fully account for the difference between that money growing in the 401k vs. in a post-tax fund, so I'm not sure the math works out. Have others played with this? You can assume this wouldn't affect my retirement savings - I'd allocate more post-tax money to retirement to account for the lowered 401k.",finance

1. Despite the nice-looking surplus, items like clothing, hair cuts, medical expenses, boarding/vet, shopping, etc get us nearly every month and we are unable to add to our savings. Looking at the situation as objectively as possible, I can honestly say that many of the non-fixed expenses every month cannot be avoided. I plan to address this with my wife by sitting down together and coming up with a plan to tackle the things we *can* control.
2. I don't feel that we're saving enough for retirement. I only contributed $4,700 to my IRA last year (including company matching).
3. Should I consolidate our student loans? I am currently paying to 5 different companies with a weighted average interest rage of about 5%. Some are private, some are government. The biggest problem I have here is that when we pay a loan off we don't snowball the payment into another loan. I wish we had done that 10 years ago instead of buying a bigger house. If it's one big loan then I have no choice in the matter.
4. PMI is currently about $220/mo. I have another $11,400 to pay on the principal before I hit 80% LTV and can have it removed. Is there a way I can refinance this to get that removed earlier? I believe the current home value is increased enough that a new appraised amount would put my LTV below 80%. My mortgage interest rate is 3.5%.

Appreciate any advice you guys can offer.

personalfinance,Question about credit card debt / buying an RV,"So I work on the road, and I'm looking to buy an RV to stay in because it is much cheaper (roughly $700-$800 a month with note/lot rent/etc.) than the hotels that I stay in ($1,200-$1,400 a month). The problem is, when I applied for the RV loan, the interest rate was very high (like 14&amp;#37;). The only thing I could think that is hurting my credit is that my credit card balance is somewhat high (balance of $5,200 with limit of $8,800). I make a decent income, around $10,000 a month, so I wouldn't think it would be too much of an issue. I don't have a lot of debt, just a house, truck, and the credit card ($150K, $25K, $5K). Is there a way to maybe take a loan out to pay that credit card down so that it isn't so close to the max? Would that help my credit enough to bring the interest rate of the RV loan down?

personalfinance,Loan from a UK bank to study in Spain (UK/Europe),"Hi everyone

I have just been accepted to start my Master's degree in Barcelona from September 2018 for 12 months and need some advice about getting a student loan from a UK bank. First off, it may be helpful to outline the basics. I'm, 26, a British national, studied in the UK from 2010-2013, living in Germany, and I have a UK bank account and a German bank account. I currently have about £16,000 in my UK account and, unfortunately, -900€ in my German account. Let's make that an even +£15,000 for practical purposes. I also have a student loan of £20,000 (1.5&amp;#37; interest) from my Bachelor's degree, but I will not include this in my calculations...

Master's degree total: 11,000€ (£9.696 according to Google).

Living costs in Barcelona: 700-800€/month (£617-705) for food, accommodation, commuting and other expenses - I will use 700€ as my base figure

Spanish lessons: 200€/month (£176)

Sports memberships: 50€/month (£44)

Soooo, all of that combined:

11000+(700\*12)+(200\*12)+(50\*12) = 22,400€ (£19,729)

That leaves me 7,400€ (£6520) in the negative. I've been travelling around Europe on and off for the past two years, and have had hardly any income, so I'm a little worried that a UK bank won't give me a loan. Although the fact that I have £16,000 savings is definitely on my side. The concern will be the interest rate, of course. I will not have a job whilst studying, aside from a little under the table babysitting in the evenings, so that will also be a bad factor. 

I'm going to read every offer from many banks, but in the meantime, does anyone have any personal experience with getting a loan to study in another EU country? 

Many thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Whether to refinance student loans or not.,"I currently owe $45,580. These loans are made up of both Federal and Private (Nelnet, Salliemae, and Navient). My Monthly Payments are $770 give or take. My wife and I collectively make approx. $75,000\~ a year. We can afford the $770 a month + the student loan payments she makes but it would be super helpful if my payments were just lowered a bit. 

I'm just on the fence on refinancing because it doesn't look like rates are that good right now and I don't want to get slammed with a bad fixed interest rate. However, having an 'alright' interest rate doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad option because I could always make bigger payments if I wanted to, right?

Any guidance with this would be so helpful, thank you so much!",finance

However, I'm nervous about dumping all of that money right now in the market, particularly as I hear that the positive effects from the tax bill will wear out soon, interest rates will rise, trade war effects will loom, market's due for a correction, etc. I don't want to invest this chunk of cash, and then the market go through a 'correction' and lose 10-25% of its value. I'm healthy financially, so waiting for this money to regain its value isn't a huge issue, but who wants to lose money?

I did get some advice concerning my worries: Don't dump it all in at once. Only invest 3,000 of it at a time when you think the market is 'low', but make sure that you set a hard deadline for yourself (3 months - 1 year) in which all the money should be invested.

What do you all think? Should I drop it all in today? See how the rest of the year unfolds? Wait for the market to drop? Set up a schedule for investing small chunks as a time?

**TL;DR I don't normally consider timing the market (a fool's errand, I know). But it seems that if you have a chunk of change available to go in the market, in which you would want access to in 5-10 years, right now might not be the best time. What are your thoughts?**",finance
personalfinance,Refinance Federal Student Loans,"I have about $20,000 in federal student loans. I'd like to see about getting a lower interest rate as my credit score is in the middle of the  740 -850 range. My highest interest rate is 4.040% and my lowest is 3.610%. I'm also making more than the required payment. I've seen where a lot of places will let you pay less, but you can't pay more over the period of the loan. I'd like to somehow get a lower interest rate and not get penalized for making payments that are higher than required. I have no idea what I'm doing any advice can be of some use.",finance
personalfinance,I have ~4 months salary saved up. I could use half of it to pay off my auto loan. Am I better off just paying it or continuing on with my monthly payments?,"I am a graduate student.  I am married and my wife has a pretty good job, but she is paying off her student loans.  I could just pay it off to have one less thing to worry about, or I could just continue paying them, having 12 payments left.  The interest rate is 4.5%, and the monthly payments are about $230.  I have no credit card debt, but have student loans.  Being in school still, they are being deferred at the moment.

From this sub I learned that having a few months salary saved up is important, as well as paying of all debts.  I'm a tad conflicted on what to do and would appreciate any insights.",finance
personalfinance,Which offer should I choose to consolidate credit card debt?,"I currently have about $7400 in credit card debt.  Credit Karma recommended Upstart to consolidate my payments and get a lower interest rate.  Upstart has offered me the following loan options:

$7,400 for 3 years  13.62% APR  $238.57 monthly payment  
$7,400 for 5 years  12.84% APR  $159.09 monthly payment

I really didn't want a 5 year loan, because I really want to pay it off as soon as possible, but the lower APR and monthly payment are really attractive, and I figured I could pay extra and pay it off faster, as upstart says it has no prepayment penalty.  Is it worth it, or should I go with the 3 year plan? 

Edit: there is an origination fee of $382.72.  
I have also tried getting a credit card to transfer the balance about a year ago, thinking it would let me transfer the whole amount into the card, but they ended up only giving me a limit of $1,400, which really didn't help me.",finance
personalfinance,I plan on buying a house in roughly two years. Should I keep my low interest student loans alive to keep my credit score higher?,"Hey everyone, long-time lurker here that has appreciated the financial information over the years. I feel like this sub alone has helped turn me from financially ignorant to financially successful. I realized I finally have a question of my own so hopefully you can help out. 

Some background:

Right out of high school I spent 4 years at university but due to medical reasons, I ended up not getting a degree at the time, but I did get all of the student debt. The following 3 years I spent working on a new degree at a cheaper school which allowed me to defer my original loans. I'm now a few years into my new IT career and I've been aggressively paying off the original debt of about 45k. I've got about 14k left to pay off on fairly low interest loans, averaging about 4&amp;#37;.

The thing is, as I pay off each loan (originally I had 12 of them), my average age of credit drops as the original student loans are ranging between 6 and 9 years. Unfortunately my only lines of credit are several credit cards opened in the last 4 years (yes, paid off in full every month) and my student loans. My average age of credit has been at or around ""4 years"" for the last 3 years or so because as my credit cards get older, I'm also paying off student loans which reduces it.

So now to the meat of my issue. I have a rough plan to buy a house in about 2 years. I have two main courses of action, the way I see it. I can either:

a) Keep paying off my student loans. 2 years from now I can easily have paid off the remainder of my student debt. My average age of credit will be maybe 4.5 years old, but probably less as I'll likely have a car loan in to bring it down. 

b) Save/invest the \~12k I would have put into those loans. 2 years from now my average age of credit would be 6+ years. Also the saved money goes towards a down payment and possibly lowering the interest rate on my mortgage.

I know that your credit score has a huge impact on the mortgage rate you're offered. If I'm offered even a 1&amp;#37; lower interest rate because of my higher credit score, I might be saving over $100 per month for 30 years which is considerably more than I would pay in interest over the next few years paying student loans. Should I pay it all off now? Could it actually be financially beneficial to not pay off the student debt until after I've locked in a mortgage rate in a few years?",finance
personalfinance,Fiancés student debt,"My fiancé has roughly $41,000 in student debt remaining (she started paying right after she was done with school, ~2 years ago). She recently brought up the idea of paying it all off at once or at least paying a large portion of it at once. She has a pretty decent paying job right now, and her monthly loan payment is $575. 

She has about 5 different loans that together equate to $41,000, each with different interest rates ranging from 4%-7%. 

Should she keep making that monthly payment and take close to 10 more years to pay it off, or use a chunk of her savings (she saves very aggressively) and pay all or almost all of it off at once?",finance
personalfinance,Divorce - Should I keep the house?,"I'm looking to get some opinions regarding what to do with my house following a pending divorce.  My wife and I are getting divorced in the near future; everything is amicable and we are still friends, just have decided we'd probably be happier going our seperate ways.  No kids, and no debt joint or otherwise other than mortgage on our home.

We purchased the home just over two years ago in a location very convenient to getting on the train for my job.  We live in one of the most expensive metro areas in the country (USA).  We currently have 28 years left on the mortgage at 4% fixed rate w/ a current balance of $675k; the house realistically can probably be sold for about $900k. Our current mortgage payment per month is $4150.

My current financial situation is as follows:  I work for the federal govt in a position I enjoy so I have a very steady job and very unlikely to get laid off or something.  I'm maxing my TSP (Govt version of a 401k - max contribution is $18,500/year).  My take home income after the TSP contribution and taxes/health insurance, etc is $3000 every 2 weeks.

My current assets are as follows:
""High-Yield"" savings account - $110k [I know this is not ideal, separate issue I will be working on once I resolve this divorce]
Dividend focused stock holdings - $95k
TSP/401k Balance - $200k

Our initial plan was to just sell the house, split the equity and move on.  However, now as I look at what I'll likely be paying for rent at an apartment, etc, I'm wondering if I should consider just holding on to the house for awhile and paying the whole mortgage myself.  My wife has similar assets and makes more than me and I think would be amenable just letting her 1/2 of the equity sit in the house until I sell it sometime in the future.

Realistically, I'm looking at between 2400 and 2600 a month for a nicer 1 bedroom apartment + parking spot a comparable distance from work.  Obviously, paying $4150/month on my own is way more than I'd normally be comfortable paying, but even at this early stage of the 30 yr mortgage $1000 of that is against principal on the loan so to some degree I'm paying myself that portion of the mortgage payment.  I would still be maxing my TSP/401k contribution so I'd still be saving for retirement, even though my liquid reserves and stock holdings would probably not grow at all while I'm in this situation.  I don't have any other debt other than the mortgage.

Further making me think about keeping the house is that, in theory, for my career progression I probably need to transfer at some point in the next few years somewhere away from my organization's HQ.  If I do this it would be a cost transfer so the government will pay my transfer costs, including realtor fees to sell the house, etc...even with a really crappy budget realtor, we are looking at realtor fees of 30k to 40k if we sell the house at $900,000, which the government will pay if I take a cost transfer for work...I feel like it would really suck to move out now, pay the realtor fee, pay for movers, etc, only to then transfer in 2 or 3 years and miss out on the government covering all that for me.

I'd love any advice or perspective anyone can provide.

personalfinance,Fantastic air miles credit cards + bank accounts / stock accounts in Canada?,"I recently returned to Canada after about 11 years living in Japan.

personalfinance,Paying down mortgage vs investing,"Hi everyone,
Long time lurker first time poster here.  For the past few years I've been putting the majority of my extra cash into my mortgage but I've been toying with getting more into the stock market this year and was hoping to get some 3rd party thoughts.

Stats:
Income is 130k/year
Mortgage is for 420k and is now down to 346k over the past 5 years with an interest rate of 4.75
I have no debts other than the mortgage
Currently 10% of my salary goes to 401k
I have an IRA which I've generally maxed every year
30k in savings emergency fund

Every month I have an extra 1 - 1.5k extra cash which for the most part I've been putting into my mortgage but lately I've been toying with doing something more liquid like stocks/mutual funds/ETFs.

Any thoughts on my position would be greatly appreciated.

personalfinance,Recent college grad. Need advice paying loans,"I graduated from college late last year the thought of paying off my loans and saving for a house has been really stressful.

Right now my take home pay every month is $3450. My loans are the following

$26k  in Federal loans. The minimum payment is $285 for 10 years.

$24k in private loans. The interest on these loans was 8%. I was making the minimum $250 payment in addition to an extra $250 every month. My stepdad decided to help me out by purchasing my loans on the agreement that I pay him $500 a month interest free until I pay them off. 

I manage to save $1k a month for a house in the future. But I'm not sure if I should be paying more towards loans. My rent each month (split with gf) is $650. My thought was I should be looking into a house in the near future instead of wasting money on rent that I won't get back.

personalfinance,"I bought a house with cash so I could beat out another offer, should I get a cash-out mortgage or just leave my money in the house?","So I recently purchased a $250,000 house with cash. I have an offer on the table for a cash-out mortgage for 30 years, $200,000 at 4.75% interest (this is definitely the lowest offer I could get, interest rates are higher for cash-outs than new purchases). I'm 24 years old and I received the money from a relative who passed away last year. The money was a huge help so I could beat out the other offer on a house I love (the other offer was similar, but not cash and a longer close, so we won). 

The mortgage will give me monthly payments of $1000. I can consistently afford this with what I make and I have savings if I get into a tough spot. I'm also planning to rent out a room in the house which would go for $700-$800 and half my utilties. 

Now I'm wondering if it is worth it at my age to mortgage the house or just enjoy living with no monthly housing payment. If I have no monthly housing payment I'll definitely put that extra money in the stock market, but I could also take the cash out and put the full $200,000 into the market right now.

Any thoughts? I know I can predict 8% return on that $200,000 from the market, but leaving the money in the house means I get guaranteed 4.75% return by not having to pay a mortgage.

financialindependence,Why am I so lucky? (FI guilt),"I'm going to state something that is painfully obvious, but I never fully appreciated before now.  

Here is the context: I have a sister that earns three times what I do, is a bit older (5 years- in her early 40s) and always a bit more financially established salary wise.  This description also describes a number of my friends.  I live a reasonably responsible fiscal lifestyle, but I would not call myself frugal compared to others here.  We vacation, go out to eat 3-4 times a month, and I do get little luxuries like the occasional massage, housekeeper once-a-month, and I go to a mid-priced gym.

At random times when colleagues or my sister mention their savings, or having difficulty coming up with a few grand for unexpected expenses, I always become puzzled or feel guilt.  Why is a friend who earns 350k per year having difficulty with coming up with a down payment on a home?  Poor thing.  Why is a 4k medical bill a huge hassle for a software engineer that makes 100k?  Poor guy. Sometimes I'd feel for them, seeing how hard they work and how they still have nothing I really value.  (They have lots of expensive toys and stuff-which matter less to me than freedom and options.) A friend said as much to me the other day, not fully knowing my financial situation, she offered, ""You're so fortunate to have savings.  Not everyone does.""  She earns about what I do. 

And then it hits me: I have been contributing the federal maximum to my 401k for FIFTEEN years.  Plus putting a little money into emergency savings and taxable accounts consistently for fifteen years, and saving a bit even before that.  I started early.  When I maxed out my 401k for the first time, I was only 25 and earning 47k a year before tax and 401k contributions.

It's not luck.  It's math.  I am where I am because I made choices that got me here.

personalfinance,Student Loan vs Inheritance: How should I finance my MBA?,"Hey all, I'm wondering the wisest way to pay for school. Here's the information:

* The MBA program I am attending will cost just about 50k per year in tuition/fees.
* I have been approved for the following annual loan amounts (haven't accepted anything yet).
   * Fed Direct Unsub Stafford Loan: 20,500
   * Graduate/Prof Plus Loan: 50,503
* My father passed away and left me a windfall (north of six figures) in an Inherited IRA. I am able to pay for school right away, if needed. Taking 50k per year will be taxed as income, and added to my wife's salary, about 30k year, for us jointly. Drawing this money now while I am a student, will probably be during a window in life where our joint income is the lowest it will ever be. If we want to reduce our tax burden on money drawn, it probably isn't a bad time to draw a large amount now. (I would probably draw 70k to realize 50k to pay tuition. Total drawn approx. 140k.)
* Leaving this IRA account alone and drawing the minimum required amount annually, was my initial goal for this money. It is deployed in the stock market and has gone up significantly (no surprise) since my father passed 2 years ago. I hope to not have to touch it and use it for retirement in 30 years (I am 29).
* I do not believe Inherited IRAs are able to be borrowed against, or used in creative ways to pay student loans, like 401ks. This could have been a nice tool to use, but Uncle Sam wants his money.

Essentially, I want to utilize the cheapest money at my disposal. I just don't know which path represents the most affordable money to use to pay for school. Inherited IRA? (Pay the taxes, lose the potential stock market gains over decades). Student loans? (Pay interest, utilize interest tax right offs, keep IRA intact and watch retirement grow).

My gut is to not take student loans, as it regularly represents stress and ruin. My gut is also to not touch retirement money, as it represents financial security. At an impasse. Any words of wisdom from the community?",finance

I first created a full budget, laying out ALL of my expenses and have gone completely to the cash system so that I have to see what I am spending.  I set aside $850 a month specifically for credit card repayment. 

I then re-consolidated my credit card debt through payoff.com as I was having a fairly difficult time getting out from under my 28% interest rate on a couple of my credit cards. I now have 1 single debt of 14k through payoff at 9.97% interest. It is a 24 month loan at $650 a month. I'm finally seeing the light!!  With this re-consolidation, I will automatically be saving around $180 a month in interest alone. 

With my new debt repayment budget being $650, my immediate thought was to still throw the additional $200 at the payoff.com loan. Then the more I read on r/personalfinance it makes me think even more about my future and I ask myself, should I put the $200 a month into my 401k? Should I start an emergency fund with the $200 a month so I never touch those credit cards again?

My company matches the 401k at 7.5% which is an insane amount that I haven't had the opportunity to take advantage of yet. 7.5% would be more than $200 a month, but I could always start with $200, fully matched and then intend on upping my contributions to 16% once my debt is 100% paid off.

Sorry for the long description but the 
tldr; Should I put $200 a month into debt repayment with 9.97% interest, into a 401k fully matched, or start an emergency fund?

personalfinance,iPhone or Mac Apps to Help Me Save / Be More Cognizant about Money?,"I will admit, I don’t know how to save $

After college, I used the remainder of my full ride scholarship to travel for 1.5 years. Then, I started working, pulling a salary of 89k per year. Along with that, I went in and out of cryptocurrency, amounting to around 50k in gains.

Now, I am 25 and unsure how to save for a house or a wedding (in the future). I blow money nonchalantly on anything — there is no doubt that pulls me back. Whether it is buying gifts for people or a $10 cold pressed juice, I really do not care. I’m not dumb, but am young. Currently sitting at \~10k in savings where I should have over 75k probably. I need an app that will make me more conscious. Below are my income  and expenses.

Income: 

89k salary

Expenses per month: 

$1.5k - Southern California rent

$300 - BMW car payment

$39.99 - Gym membership

$24.99 - Tidal subscription (I am an audiophile)

$40 - 2 haircuts per month

$9.97 - Dollar shave club

$100 - Car insurance

$40 - Pet insurance

$9.99 - Postmates Gold

$19.99 - Unlimited car wash card

$240 - Eating out (I freelance for a few restaurants doing social media management in the area and get fed for free so I eat out on days they don’t give me food)

$75 - Protein and vitamins

$100 - Gas

$50 - Grain free pet food

$50 - Skincare

$2k - Random shit (clothes, going out, concerts, buying gifts, postmating alcohol to a friend across the country to chug, skateboards, whatever)

No but really. Aside from random shit, I should be fine. Im just a person who needs to be spontaneous in order to get motivated for life and work. I’m highly valued in my company and should be getting a third promotion in a year, but that can’t be an excuse to be more wreckless. Watched too much Wolf of Wall Street in college lmao. Need to chill. What are some success stories? Also I am better at handling things if I am actively watching it, hence an app, either iPhone or on Mac would help me manage my money — suggestions?

People always tell me that ""It's not gonna be your last house"". 

Two major things that I think applies to your next house -- it's either you're downsizing or upgrading.

In our case, our 1600-sqft 3-bedroom 2-story house is just the right size for our family (me, my husband, 3-yr old son and 4-yr old border collie) even if we decide to have another baby in the future. 

Not thinking of upgrading if I'm kicking out my son by the time he's 18. Not downsizing since a three bedroom house for a couple I think is small enough.

personalfinance,Should I plan on refinancing my auto loan or should I just throw as much money as I can at the principal?,"So I have always has the bad habit of trading in my car once I have some equity in it.

The loan itself is about $54k after the interest is factored in (about $8k)

I have been saving all my spare money including any bonuses from work and my last year's (and future) tax returns. 

So question is should I get a large amount saved up, let's say about $10k and refinance or should I just be putting all my extra money into the principal to pay it off quicker? 

I'd imagine that paying it off quicker would save me more money than looking for a lower interest rate.

I could probably save for a flat (its around 50-75k decent one) and then rent it (150-200$ monthly rent) while i work for this company but i'm not sure if thats smart or worth.

personalfinance,"Bought a new car and now I'm tied down and realize the mistake I've made, please help!","Hello redditors of r/personalfinance!

I'm in a bit of a pickle and I'd like some help or advice on my situation. I bought a car that I can pay for but don't really need and it's also hindering me from saving money for things like a house and so on. 
First of all I absolutely accept that I made some really bad choices when I bought this vehicle, I signed many papers by my choice and no one else's. I am completely responsible for this mess. 

About 3 months ago I bought a 2018 Chevy Cruze Sport for 24,000$ brand new. I was upside down on my vehicle that I traded in so that's why it cost more than the normal MSRP. 
I have an 11.90% interest rate, which I realize is horrible. 

I have a 6 year loan on it and my payments are 468.53$ a month. My insurance is about 375$ a month and that's the cheapest I can find (I'm young and I've gotten lots of tickets on my motorcycles). 
I make about 3,300$ a month after taxes. 
My bills are as follows:
Phone: 110$
Rent and utilities: 550$
Auto Loan: 475$(roughly)
Insurance: 375$
Les Schwab credit account:50$
Food: 250$
Weekend shenanigans: 400$
And I save just about exactly 1000$ a month.
Reading all that may make everything seem okay but I really want to go to college and not be stuck at the job I'm at.
I work 55 hours a week at a Sawmill busting my ass, it pays decent but it's already taking a toll on my body and I don't want to be here long term. I'm not exactly passionate about lumber.
When I bought this car I only saw the positives but now I'm stuck with it and I can't pursue the career I want because I can't afford to quit my job. 

Do I have any options other than to just suck it up and live with the choice I've made? Any replies are appreciated!

personalfinance,Questions Regarding Student Loan Refinancing/Consolidations.,"back in 2011 I graduated in the midst of the ""economic crisis"" and in the middle of that got hit with some pretty gross loans with interests rates of up to 13&amp;#37;. Both Federal and Private loans. when I first got out, consolidating the federal was easy but the private loans NO ONE wanted anything to do with them except for wells fargo. But they needed a Co-signer due to my debt to income ratio, and I didn't have a cosigner available to me.

Skip ahead 3 years and banks start opening up. Got my private loans consolidated at around 7&amp;#37; by citizen bank and have been riding that for a while. However it has been some time and I want to revisit consolidating both my loans and or refinancing them even. The goal is, same remaining payment period with lower interest, and lower payments (but still paying same amount most likely). I keep seeing ads for interests in the 3.5 ranged and would LOVE me some of that, but feel those are reserved for the more well off people =/. So the questions are as follows.

\-Who are the most reputable companies? Earnest gave me lowest interest online quote with Sofi behind by a &amp;#37; (5&amp;#37; vs 6&amp;#37;)

\- Is it possible to refinance federal and private into one loan or must they be consolidated first?

\- Is it wise to consolidate federal and private?

\- Is there anything I should look out for while doing so?

TLDR: want to refinance students loans looking for advice and who to choose and what to go for.

some side notes. the grand total in student loans is around 70,000

for those who mention IBR I was on a plan but got off for 2 reasons. 1 I couldn't get a home loan for my small condo with it and 2, I fear people overlook the fact that once its forgiven it has to be claimed as taxable income. which is something I feel ALOT of people haven't experience yet cause the people who started it haven't hit the end of it yet. and that's gonna be a surprise IRS bill a lot of people will be unhappy about. am I wrong in this assumption?

Bitcoin,There’s nothing “Happy” about HAPPY TAX,"On March 26th 2017 I hired HAPPY TAX to handle my crypto reconciliation and e-file my state and federal taxes.  500$ with a 100$ discount that didn’t work originally, but was rectified quickly. 

No mention of a back log or filing extensions before I purchased. After I purchased I was actually reassured that there’s still plenty of time before the 17th to get it done on time. 

First contact was Lynne for the reconciliation. Starts pushing me to file extension “we offer it for free” 

I paid to have my taxes done on time.

She was against using Btc.tax.com info. Even though I already paid them 30$ to do it and it’s advertised on there site they accept it. She claimed api info isn’t accurate. She wanted to manually enter each csv file into their way of doing it. I did business on only Coinbase and gdax. I had no other income or dependents. This was the easiest scenario possible and she made me jump though unnecessarily hoops that procured identical data that I already had. 

No personal attention to the customer. I kept getting emails about extensions. I kept asking for definitive answers about my taxes being filed on time. No dice. Just generalized or mass email answers. 

No professionalism. When I finally was called by my “CPA” the numbers didn’t jive at all. They persisted in my using their minimization method. I have a business degree, two years of corporate, business and personal IRS tax along with 2 years of accounting that I excelled in and graduated suma cum laude GPA 4.0

I say this not to brag or boast- who gives a shit? I know that FIFO IS THE RECOMMENDED METHOD. 

I asked can I change to FIFO next year: SURE. NO!
You have to file a written reason a year in advance for such a change. 
If I had taken their “advice” I’d of been audited. The minimization method accounts for gains in later years -not good if you plan on making a lot of money in upcoming years. Completely ridiculous unprofessional advice. 

The answers I’m giving here are directly from a reputable local CPA by the name of Hunter Nottingham. He accepts business from anywhere in the US. He’s also working on several crypto apps for tax and filing purposes that are more accurate and user friendly for next year than what’s currently in the market. He’s an avid crypto investor, accepts crypto as payment for his personalized services and is very adept at crypto reconciliation done the right way.

HAPPY TAX strung me along from March 26th to April 15th and two days before the deadline tried to charge me an additional $250 because of multiple exchanges. COINBASE owns GDAX. They are one of the same. Coinbase is a buying/selling platform and GDAX is an actual exchange owned by the former. I was outraged at this point. After sending an email mentioning my concerns and disappointment, the CEO admitted to having some hiring issues and problems. But then went on to up-charge me $250 for filing a complaint.  I lost it. I called and spoke to Christa my “CPA” livid. I asked for her CPA license number and she says she doesn’t have one because she’s not a CPA. But she claimed to be one earlier. FRAUD

They decided to refund my money two days before the tax deadline. AND BASICALLY LEAVE ME SCREWED ON TAX DAY. 

I got my money back a day after the tax deadline.

Hunter Nottingham did my brothers taxes. So I called him. 24 hours. Done. Accurate. Personalized attention. Professionalism. The Cost? $400. Effortless.",cryptocurrency

Thanks for all the amazing advice time &amp; time again. 

22M moving on his own. **EDIT: Moving to Lutz, FL &amp; looking for work in Tampa.**

I'm fulfilling my lifelong dream and moving to FL from CT this August. It's a permanent move, and I will be attending college. I get a fresh new start with life and I can't wait. I'm now preparing my budget and I just have the a few questions.

&gt; FLORIDA BUDGET

**Rent** - $630/m ($575/mo + renters &amp; split electricity). This cannot be changed as I already signed the lease. No security deposit.

**Food** - $300 | This includes cooking, meal prepping and the occasional $6-$10 meal out. I'm trying to put on weight as well so that's why it's high for just me. I love fruits &amp; veggies and they're *extremely* expensive. I really wish it could be lower but after almond milk, $15 in fruit, it's hard to spend less than $75 a week if you eat out even twice.

**Insurance** - $140/m. No discount for paying the entire premium in full. Insured on my own by GIECO, cheapest of all rates I could find online. 5% renewal discount every 6 months offered as well.

**Gas** - $120/m or $30/wk. Takes me to school &amp; back, to work and to the bar/parties/school activities.

**Going out/fun/misc.** - $100/m. Surely not enough but it gives me a little room to be spontaneous and not feel bad for it.

**Gainer/Protein** - $100/m. Just to help with the bulk.

**Phone** - $70/m. Talk, text, 6GB data &amp; $35 phone installment w/ insurance inc. I can't do any better than this and am locked in since the phone hasn't been paid off.

**Healthcare** - I'm under my dad's until I'm 26 but I hope there's no complications with him being in CT and me moving to FL.

**Total Monthly Expenses =** $1460

I have an associate's degree in Business Management. I was hoping to land a job as either a supervisor/team lead/manager at a Walmart, Target or merchandiser of the sort. I feel like they pay ~$13-$15/hr. I feel like with my degree, this type of job can be attainable. I also have around 5 year experience in the work force (customer service, retail, companionship), but no management experience.

**EDIT: I don't know if anyone cares of if there's a sub but I can provide my CV/Resume if necessary!

I was also looking at becoming a waiter. They make more money but I've got no experience. Also, I'm an MIS major so waiting provides nothing for my resume.

Questions:

1. Is there anything missing from my budget? I've already portioned out my moving expenses.

2. Are there any other jobs I can get with my Associate's in Business Management that I'm not looking at or?

3. What are your personal opinions on opening a line of credit/federal unsub. for ~$2-$3000 just to help out with my living situation for the first year? After the first year, all my expenses will go down but this first year will be tough.

**\*** One note on the retirement piece, I do have a sufficient emergency fund built so I'm planning to take my last check from the old job as well as my vacation payout (I had quite a few days accrued that I never took) and putting that money into a Roth IRA. This will allow me to contribute the $5,500 max in one shot for 2018.

**Loan details**:

*Federa*l: Remaining balance is **23k** made up of several smaller loans. Over the past year and a half I've paid this down from about 30k. Originally there were a few loans with higher interest rates (\~6.5&amp;#37;) but those have been paid off. The average interest rate across the remaining loans is \~4&amp;#37;...I'm currently prioritizing the two remaining loans at 4.5&amp;#37; rates. Once those are done, the remaining will have rates between 3.1&amp;#37; - 4&amp;#37;.

  
*Private*: Here's the big chunk, remaining balance is **\~100k**. Fortunately, my parents wanted to help me here and while they were not financially positioned to pay the loans down in full they did ""pay"" the loans off using their HELOC. Now, I'm paying toward their HELOC every month at a significantly lower interest rate than what was originally attached to my private loans (and for this I am very grateful). At first the HELOC rate was \~3&amp;#37; but this has been gradually climbing toward \~4&amp;#37; as of late and may continue to rise.

Prior to the interest rate changes, I had been prioritizing the federal loans as they had the higher interest rates. I'm now wondering if, after I pay off the remaining two 4.5&amp;#37; loans, I should re-shift my focus toward the private loans as the rate is climbing and the federal loan interest is deductible. Let me know if that sounds like a good plan.

**Retirement:**

As far as retirement goes, I have nothing established at this point. As mentioned above I intend to take my final payout from my old job and start/max a Roth IRA for 2018. My new company does have a 401(k), but the company does not begin matching contributions (if I contribute 7&amp;#37;, they will contribute 5&amp;#37;) until after one year of service. Given this, I'm not sure if it makes sense to begin contributing to a 401(k) before the employer matches or if I should just focus all of my additional money on the loans for the first year and then start contributing 7&amp;#37; when I'm eligible for their match. This is primarily where I'm stuck, I've found it difficult to decide whether to contribute to the 401(k) without match for the first year or just aggressively tackle the loans. Regardless, I will be increasing my loan payments each month.

That's a lot of information and rambling to skim through, so I guess in summary the real questions are:  


1) Should I shift priority away from my federal loans (I'll still overpay on them as I am now) and toward the private HELOC loans due to interest rates rising and the student loan interest deduction benefit?

2) Apart from starting a Roth IRA and maxing it for 2018, should I begin contributing to an (unmatched) 401(k) or should I wait until one year of service when my employer starts contributing? If the latter, I would use whatever money I would allocate toward the 401(k) on the loans.

3) Side question, and I'm still gathering more details on this, my employer also offers an ESPP where stock can be purchased at a 10&amp;#37; discount. I'm still trying to determine when this can be sold (can I buy it today and sell it tomorrow), but I was curious how this is treated from a tax perspective. Are gains from ESPPs treated as ordinary income or would this be taxed at a short term capital gains rate?

4) Any sense in setting aside a small amount of money each paycheck in a high interest savings account for a future home purchase? Seems the answer would be no as I would get a higher guaranteed rate of return paying down debt, but might be some positive psychological effect in seeing a house fund gradually grow.

In summary, my primary goal is to continue moving upward in my career and escape debt as soon as possible. I just don't want to let my desire to escape the debt impact my decision making to the point that I handicap myself for retirement down the road and fall further behind my peers.

Any input and advice is appreciated,  I want to situate myself in the best way possible and there is a lot of knowledge on this forum. Let me know if I left out any key pieces of information needed to answer any of the questions/provide advice.",finance

personalfinance,"Inheritance, what is the best way to invest?","I am due to inherit a substantial amount of money in the next month or two since my grandparents have both passed on. This money is coming from a trust from insurance. Not sure if that matters.

My father suggested putting it into a savings account, from which i could live off the interest. My question with this is how exactly would this work? And how high of an interest rate would i be able to obtain realistically in order to live off of this money? 

If i do not chose to go down this route, what are my other options for making the most of this money? I do have a career, however i do not make a substantial amount of money from it at this present time, and therefore would like this inheritance to help make up for it. So ideally i would like to invest it in a way that would provide me with a monthly pay off.

Any insight on investment options in my situation would be greatly appreciated. Finance is clearly not my forte.",finance

personalfinance,Consolidating debt with a fair credit score,"I am helping my roommate make a budget to straighten out her financial situation, but I feel I need to call in back-up. She has about $4k on one card at 25&amp;#37; interest and $5k on another card with 17&amp;#37; interest. Based on the budget I made for her, she has about $450/mo of disposable income after bills, rent, food, car payments ($400/mo), gas, etc. She also has about $2k in savings.

In addition, her student loan payments ($400/mo) will kick in starting in January.

Her credit score is 660, so probably too low for a 0&amp;#37; APR balance transfer card. I think consolidating into a loan with a lower rate is probably a good idea, but I have never done that before, so any advice would be great.

I will definitely talk to her about how a lower interest rate doesn't matter if she keeps using the credit cards.",finance
personalfinance,Should I get a cash out mortgage so I can take advantage of the interest tax deduction?,"So this is an update to this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8u40s1/i\_bought\_a\_house\_with\_cash\_so\_i\_could\_beat\_out/](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8u40s1/i_bought_a_house_with_cash_so_i_could_beat_out/)

BACKSTORY: So I recently purchased a $250,000 house with cash. I have an offer on the table for a cash-out mortgage for 30 years, $200,000 at 4.75&amp;#37; interest (this is definitely the lowest offer I could get, interest rates are higher for cash-outs than new purchases). I'm 24 years old and I received the money from a relative who passed away last year. The money was a huge help so I could beat out the other offer on a house I love (the other offer was similar, but not cash and a longer close, so we won).

The mortgage will give me monthly payments of $1000. I can consistently afford this with what I make and I have savings if I get into a tough spot. I'm also planning to rent out a room in the house which would go for $700-$800 and half my utilties.

Now I'm wondering if it is worth it at my age to mortgage the house or just enjoy living with no monthly housing payment. If I have no monthly housing payment I'll definitely put that extra money in the stock market, but I could also take the cash out and put the full $200,000 into the market right now.

Any thoughts? I know I can predict 8&amp;#37; return on that $200,000 from the market, but leaving the money in the house means I get guaranteed 4.75&amp;#37; return by not having to pay a mortgage. At that point I, and the people in the comments on my last post, were leaning towards not getting the mortgage since the house would be a nice stable investment to complement my riskier investments in the market.

HOWEVER

I realized I forgot to take into account the mortgage deduction on my taxes, which means my APR when adjusted for the mortgage deduction is 3.419&amp;#37; (the non-adjusted rate is 4.75&amp;#37;). That's barely above inflation!

Given this new information, do you guys think it's worth it to cash out and invest or just take the guaranteed, low risk value of my property and use other money for risky investments?

XRP,"Are institutional investors limited in buying XRP before official regulation, -even for their personal investments?","I've been hearing certain arguments that XRP should technically be classified as a financial security, and by being classified as such it would allow institutional investors to begin trading xrp.

Brad is coming out strong that it is not, but arguing instead it is as a 'digital asset'.

I just don't understand why we are not seeing a price rise from people buying in who are supposedly working behind the scenes to lay the ground work for Ripple and Xrp, such as all the people who work for companies, banks, and possibly the Federal Reserve. Would this be considered insider trading? 'Strong form market efficiency theory' would have all these people and their relatives buying if they believed in the work they are doing.

CryptoCurrency,MoneyToken &amp; the rise of the Bitcoin Bull run - your thoughts ?,"Please spare a few moments of your time to answer a few simple questions... trust me, you’ll be glad you did...

(1) Investment banks such as Goldman Sachs and Barclays are considering, or are in the process of opening Crypto Trading desks. Do you think they’re doing this because they expect Crypto to fail?

If your answer was “Yes” then I think we are done here; best go sell your tokens and invest elsewhere.

If your answer was “No” however, this gets interesting...

Because we can agree now that although the market might go down a bit from where we are now, sooner or later it will go up - and significantly too.

Now, when is a great time to buy?

On a dip, right? Everyone tells us to “buy the dip” but we respond: “With what?! Everything I can afford has already been spent on crypto!

So you need to borrow some money to buy more crypto without depositing more Fiat... but borrowing money costs interest right?

Well no... that’s why MoneyToken is so great right now...

Bitcoin is quite low in value right now and will probably go lower, then will start an amazing climb towards the moon.

So with MoneyToken you can deposit two BTC in order to obtain enough USD equivalent to buy 1 BTC with.

Then when BTC shoots up, sell that 1 BTC and pay back the amount of USD you were given, keep the rest and get your two (more valuable) BTC back too!

But why would MoneyToken do this zero percent interest rate?

Well it’s either a marketing gimmick to attract people to the platform OR a loss-leader to allow them to crush any competition but for us, the borrowers, who cares? This is incredible!

Take advantage of this while you can; gifts like this don’t come along very often.

But... what’s more important here?

Well with a deal like this, just imagine how popular IMT will be once the team start marketing their product... and the less of it for sale, the higher the price people will pay for it; simple supply and demand.

So hold your IMT, take advantage of the zero percent crypto loans and let’s all get rich together! Happy days!

**I believe MoneyToken will succeed in the very near future.**

**And the timing could not be better in a bull market. People don't want to sell their coins which they know will be valued much higher in the future, but they need capital to invest right now.**

**Conventional banks laugh at your face, and say no. The Answer is and will be: MoneyToken**

personalfinance,Slowing losing money each month. Live in high cost-of-living city (San Diego). Where can we save?,"My husband and I earn about $175,000/year. We were doing fine and treated our personal finance as if it was a done deal (saving money without trying too hard) up until we started paying for day care for our 6-month old. All of our dispensable income went - poof! Now, it feels like we're living above our means. 

By no means do my husband and I live luxurious lives, but we have a mortgage, a car lease, day care, and insurance payments. I also have a hard time admitting that we probably didn't make the best decision when it comes to health care (we did a high-deductible HSA plan the year we delivered a baby - probably an HMO would've been better). 

Here's a breakdown of my husband's net and my gross income (I run a business). His income excludes expenses like a 4&amp;#37; 401K with matching, FSA, and HSA, all of which can't be changed this year:

Net Husband/Gross Wife June Income: $11,741

Expenses:

* Mortgage ($1788)
* Day care ($1700 - sigh, I know. I know you all might tell me to find somewhere cheaper. In our defense, it's the day care at the synagogue we're members of and considered one of the best in the city with a 3-1 ratio. We have a $3000/year FSA we haven't tapped yet. We chose $3000 before we were sure we were going to go the day care route.)
* Business Tax allocation ($1100 - I siphon $1100 each month into an AMEX personal savings acct. to pay for business federal and state taxes)
* Property tax allocation ($500 - ditto)
* HOA ($295)
* Co-working space ($259 - I've pre-paid this for July but I cancelled it afterward)
* Car lease ($215)
* House cleaning ($160 - this is for 2 4-hour sessions. I've tried to find cheaper and failed. This seems like a straightforward one to skip, but my husband will fight me spending all the extra hours cleaning.) 
* Auto insurance for 2 cars ($145)
* Water ($75 - monthly)
* Electricity &amp; Gas ($105)
* Internet ($40)
* Cell phone bill ($100)
* Business expenses ($334 - software, contractors, etc. This ranges up to $700 depending on the month. This also excludes some softwares I purchase annually to cut costs. I try to get rid of softwares I don't need if I can.)
* Monthly synagogue membership ($50)
* House insurance ($35)
* Baby swimming classes ($75)
* Gifts ($220 - we have a big family. This is split between father's day gift, housewarming gift for my brother, and our niece's birthday)
* Baby things ($141 - some of the Costco/Amazon is baby gear too)
* Gas ($194)
* Auto repairs ($110)
* Home improvement ($100 - spent money trying to repair a washing machine)
* Groceries ($190 - one idea I have is to STOP buying groceries at Costco and only do Vons delivery to stop us from unnecessarily buying in bulk and prevent impulse purchases)
* Costco/Amazon ($800 - we make a lot of impulse purchases on Amazon and Costco which I'm trying to stop. Some of this is groceries, some diapers, some impulse purchases, etc.)
* Entertainment ($350 - soccer game tickets, music concerts, bachelor party drinks, Spotify, etc.)
* Clothing ($45)
* Restaurants ($181 - most of this is my husband eating at his work's discounted cafeteria)
* Out of pocket health ($30 - fee for day care document &amp; flouride treatment)

Total: $9,337

Savings

* SEP IRA contribution ($1000)
* Vanguard investments ($600)
* Extra principle contribution to mortgage ($300)
* Baby College/House Fund ($150 --&gt; AMEX personal savings until we have enough - $3000 min - to buy stocks)
* Emergency fund contribution ($150)

Total: $2200

Income: $11,741

Expenses &amp; Savings: 11,537

Net: $200 (but doesn't include other misc. expenses like car tickets, parking, etc. In truth, we're negative.)  

Do you have recommendations for savings?

My ideas:

* cancel co-working space - done
* don't do food purchases at Costco with some exception, i.e. hosting a BBQ - TBD
* no purchases on Amazon unless it's cleared by both of us - TBD
* cooking more to save on restaurant expenses
* get more clients - each new client is min. $1500 gross revenue

My question is regarding APY for my savings.  NFCU seems to offer the standard that most banks do which I think is .05 it seems.  Is switching to Ally for checking also worth the .05 points in the long run.  I’m smart enough to know it was for Savings, but for checking I’m lost.   How does one even compute these figure.   

For instance say I have 3k on average in the checking account, how can I determine the difference I’d make per month and year with Ally compared to NFCU.   Usually I get about .08 per month with NFCU and it confuses the crap out of me trying to figure out how that number even is calculated. 

Also, I just saw wheee NBKC bank has a .90 APY for checking.  How would this also make me more money.  Help me out financial experts.",finance

personalfinance,What to do with excess loan money,"Hi,

I'm a 28 yr old returning to school in  a few weeks for a Master's degree program. I have some credit card debt and overdue taxes totaling roughly $8000. I also have student loans from my bachelor's degree, and car payments. I have applied for student loans again and received amounts greater than what I need for all of my tuition payments.

My question is, what should I do with the excess student loan money? Should I immediately pay it back to reduce the student loans, or use it to consolidate other debts where interest rates are high? Does anyone have any experiences doing this, how did it work out and how did you decide what was the priority debt to relieve?",finance
personalfinance,Need help with repairing credit,"Hello all, first I'll just state what I need, then follow up with the details.

I need to be able to rent an apartment or buy a home, and I would like the option of leasing a new vehicle.

My credit score is somewhere between 490 and 530.

I currently have 11 charge offs on my account, and two paid accounts for federal loans. These are all the accounts that I have, nothing is currently opened on my account.

I just completed credit disputes with the three major agencies, transunion removed 4 accounts, Experian removed 6. (Had 17 total charge offs to start)

Several of the charge offs are listed as sold to other collection agencies. Most of those agencies are not listed, but 2 are creating multiple charge offs for the same debt.

At this point I'll not sure what to do next. Should I try contacting the original agencies and settling? Should I write pay for delete letters? Should I try settling only with the agencies that purchased my debt? For the debt that's listed twice, how do I remove the redundant entries, or is this normal? If I do try to settle, what's acceptable for me to offer?

Most of the debt is between 400 and 1600 dollars. I have 2, one for 4000 and one for 6000 that are over 1800.

That's pretty much it. Now, so you all know how I ended up getting myself into this mess:

I moved out of my parents house and out of state, but had no credit to speak of in 2012, so I couldn't rent an apartment or a car. To fix this I applied for several credit cards, about 4 or 5 of them. This built my credit for two years while I lived in Craigslist homes. At that point I was able to rent an apartment and get a motorcycle loan, which is the 6000 debt above.

In February of 2015 my father passed away unexpectedly. As a result I quit my job and moved back into my parents home. I took out a couple payday loans (huge mistake) to help cover expenses and pay for my apartment in the other state until my lease was up. After about a 3 month grieving period I got a new job and started paying back on my bills, which were all capped at this point. I was there for 6 months when I got a bad ankle injury that caused me to lose my job. That time I couldn't pay back on my loans and credit cards on time and they all defaulted. I used the time to study, got my CCNA, moved to Portland Oregon, where I am now, and finally have a good job and can start fixing my debt again. I'm once again living in Craigslist homes, but have two years of solid rental payments to private parties. I make enough that I can afford better, only my credit it's holding me back. I'm eager to rebuild it without the mistakes I made last time. I just need advice and suggestions that work.

Help me reddit, you're my only hope.

I posted earlier this week in /credit but had no responses. I'm hoping for better luck here. Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,[Q] Tax Withholding on Paychecks,"Hello, I just started a brand new job after leaving my current job and this time I noticed when my HR person was doing my new hire paperwork a big conversation was tax withholding on federal / state taxes on my paychecks, (She said she's not allowed to give advice &amp; I understand that would be a red flag) So I wasn't sure, so I put down 0

I wasn't sure why I wasn't told about this at my previous job?

And was my decision correct to put down 0?

Here's my living situation:
- I live in California
- I'm being paid 21$ an hour (43,680 annually) as a office assistant my previous job paid similar, but I had to get out.
- I'm filed as Single (Will probably be married in the next three years)
- I bought a house in cash under my name (Just wondering if this affects anything (500k))
  - Monthly expenses range around 50% of my earnings 
  - I pay property taxes every year around 4k - 6k
- I have a son, unfortunately I don't get to claim him ever, as his grandfather (not my father) is a evil person, I won't get into this.

Ideally is better to withhold taxes in a scenario like this? Which one would I withhold? As well as how much? (State / Federal)(I've been working the past seven years and have been getting tax refunds not knowing I was allowed to withhold, I'm not entirely sure what it means but I understand I can probably squeeze a little extra in my paychecks by doing so but may have to pay taxes)

Let me know thank you!",finance

personalfinance,Should I buy these CDs as a college student in my situation?,"Hi, PF. Throwaway for obvious reasons.


* **Checking Account**:  $2,200+
* **Savings**: $8,650+
* **Debt**: None, will have no student loans either (Again, thankful for my parents here). 
* **Etc**: Collection of physical media worth $1000+, Silver(?)
* **Credit Score**: 780

I follow the prime directive to the T, practically. I’m looking to beat a 0.01% interest rate on my savings (i literally get 1 cent deposits on an account with 6k+ in it at all times.. it's horrible). The options I’m looking at right now: 

* Ally High Yield CD, 5 year (2.65% APY)
* Capital One 360, 5 year (2.90% APY)

My goal is to buy a place to live ASAP out of college, so that’s why I’m looking at CDs. 

Questions
For the CD, can I just continually deposit/buy more? I want to put in $50-150 monthly.
How do I pick between the two banks? Capital One has a higher rate but Ally has more rapport on this sub.
Can I put gained interest directly back into the CD?

Potential Results

1. $8k principal, 5 years at 2.9%, $50 contributed a month = **$12,450**

2. $8k principal, 5 years at 2.65%, $50 contributed a month = **$12,320**

3. $10k principal, 5 years at 2.9%, $50 contributed a month = **$14,750**

4. $10k principal, 5 years at 2.65%, $50 contributed a month = **$14,600**

I really really like these results, as they’d be awesome for a down payment. Also, as I move through my college years my intern pay will increase. Your thoughts?",finance
personalfinance,Personal Funds &amp; Uni Grants - Need Advice!,"So, I worked last summer and now this year's summer (with a well paying job) to fund myself at uni, I made enough to fund my first year and have enough savings to fund my second year (purely living costs and a small chunk of my rent, not the 9.25k uni costs). First year I got a minimum maintenance grant of £3928 (I opted for), however, this year, I have just been approved a higher amount of £7.7k - £8.9k... I do not need that amount and am deciding if I should (morally) change my application to around a £4k standpoint.

  
However, I am not real-world savvy so, could there be a smarter way of looking at this? Interest rates are on the increase, I believe currently around 4-6&amp;#37;, so should I take the minimun amount or take the maximum I can get and use it as an investment in attempt to make profit with interest? Would an extra £4 or so thousand be enough to make interest to even out my payback interest on my 2018/19 loan?

investing,Amazon reveals a new plan to deliver more packages: Recruit people to run small-scale delivery services,"Watch out [FedEx](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=FDX), [UPS](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=UPS), DHL and the U.S. Postal Service: [Amazon](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=AMZN) is building its own last-mile delivery service.

The e-commerce behemoth announced on  Thursday its new Delivery Service Partners program — designed to let  entrepreneurs run their own local delivery networks of up to 40 vans  emblazoned with Prime logos.

Each delivery unit will  start their day at one of 75 current Amazon stations in the U.S. where  parcels ordered from Amazon.com are picked up by drivers wearing  blue-collared shirts with an Amazon logo and black hats. Algorithms will  determine which packages are sent to these delivery stations, and which  are sent to other delivery partners, like FedEx and UPS.

""This is all about scaling cost  effectively,” said Dave Clark, senior vice president of Amazon Worldwide  Operations. He said the new delivery program will help meet the growth  in e-commerce. “We are going to have to meet this growth, and it's  outpacing the growth of our core providers.”

This year, more than 40 percent of all e-commerce purchases will be made on Amazon, according to an eMarketer estimate.

Clark said Amazon has  “great relationships” with its external delivery partners. “We use  everything in order to meet our scale and meet our needs. I don’t see  that changing in the future,” he said.

In its latest annual 10-K  filing, Amazon noted the risk associated with relying on external  partners like FedEx and UPS. “If we are unable to negotiate acceptable  terms with these companies or they experience performance problems or  other difficulties, it could negatively impact our operating results and  customer experience.”

In the filing, Amazon  said shipping costs — including sorting, delivery center and  transportation expenses — ballooned from $11.5 billion in 2015 to $21.7  billion in 2017, and its shipping costs are expected to continue to  increase.

The new program brings  more of the costs and customer service under its control, while letting  entrepreneurs run the operations under the behemoth’s name.

The e-commerce giant said  the program will enable “hundreds” of small businesses to get started,  and it will ultimately hire “tens of thousands” of new delivery drivers  across the country. This comes at a time when there is a trucker  shortage in the U.S., adding to rising transportation costs for many  businesses.

Amazon isn't providing an  estimate for how many or how long it will take to get more delivery  stations built in order to get packages to these new 10s of thousands of  delivery drivers.

Each Delivery Service  Partner can start a business with as little as a $10,000 investment. The  partner is vetted by Amazon, and once accepted, will lease  Prime-branded vehicles from Amazon, but the entrepreneur will be in  charge of recruiting and hiring drivers. Amazon will offer discounts for  costs incurred to run the business on expenses like fuel, insurance and  benefit programs. The company says the program is set up so successful  delivery partners can make up to $300,000 in annual profit.

Olaoluwa Abimbola has  been running his delivery service business in the Denver area as part of  the beta test for the last five months. While his background is in  computer science and not logistics, he says he’s “loving” his new  business and has already hired more than 40 employees who work “fairly  regular hours” and “are encouraged to take breaks.”

This new last-mile  delivery program is in addition to Amazon Flex, a delivery program in  more than 50 U.S. cities that operates more like Uber or Lyft, with “gig  workers” delivering parcels from their own vehicles for $18 to $25 an  hour.

Amazon’s Delivery Service  Partners is just another part of the company’s own logistics network.  It already has 7,000 of its own trucks and 40 airplanes which, along  with external delivery partners, shipped more than 5 billion Prime items  last year.

While Amazon won’t  disclose the financials behind the new program, Clark says it’s “much  more about customer experience and meeting overall growth. We think this  is going to be a cost effective way to do that.”

personalfinance,Finally paying off student loans,"Throwaway account. Longtime redditor, occasional peruser of this thread.

Private student loans currently at 13.5k, 5% interest. 396/month, have been paying 500-700/month for a few years now. Less than 3 years left and we've decided to pay them off fully.

We bring home about 4k a month in income. Expenses are 3k including 500 for this loan. 2 auto loans, 1 mortgage loan, this is our highest interest rate loan. We have 25k in cash and 27k in the bank eating away so we'll be using that for the loans. Have 9k in a separate stock account and 25k in IRAs. Both government employees set to receive pensions in 23 years. I'm 34 she's 32.
Any reason we shouldn't do this? I really want to payoff this fucking loan and get it done as it's been eating away at our finances and my soul for over 12 years as a horrible financial decision that I'm reminded of monthly when I pay it. We've had the 27k sitting around for a couple years now doing nothing so we want to do something with it. On top of that, we plan on putting the extra 500 (and 1000 surplus) into our bank account for a bit to build it back up and then use the 500 to generate more income (more dividend stocks, possible business idea, etc.). We have enough in emergency savings and income surplus each month where we think we're comfortable enough to do this.

Any advice?",finance
personalfinance,Student Loan Debt &amp; Refinancing?,"Hello PF!

My husband and I attended university together. When health issues made it clear only one of us could continue our degree, I dropped out and have been working full time since 2012. In 2014 my husband received his BS and deferred his loans for 1 year until he found a job in his field. I started paying on my loans in 2013 (I left school second semester, and it took 6 months for the loans to come due). 

I have roughly $6,500 of my student loans left. All three loans are federal, @ 6.8%. 

My husband has ~$40,000 in federal student loans, also all at 6.8%. 

I pay $100-$150 a month on mine, and my husband pays $500 monthly on his. We both are gainfully employed making ~$77k a year combined, live in a low COL area, have a mortgage at 3.5% and a car payment at 2.8%, and generally live well within our means. 

I get a LOT of junk mail about refinancing our student loans. I personally find it insane that our education loans are double what our mortgage is in interest, and I feel like we aren’t making any headway. Are these companies reputable at all? Does it make sense to consolidate our loans? Do we lose any protections if they’re no longer federally held? Even if everything is on the up-and-up with them, does it make sense to do so with a relatively “low” student loan debt of less than $50k? We try to throw any extra at them, but we also have a kiddo and a home we’re trying to fix up. We pay slightly more than the minimums, but it feels like we’re barely treading water with them. 

If it maters, any continuing education for my husband would be paid for via his employer and I have no intention of going back to school. We live in Illinois, and have no CC debt.",finance

personalfinance,Two part Federal Tax Credit Question,"Hello,

I got a two part question

* How are federal tax credits calculated 

* How do I figure out if the tax credit is beneficial for me this year

---

Here is my guess for the 1st answer.  I normally use the standard deductions and my total tax from last year was $7403 and I had $8100 withheld. I was refunded $697

So I would think because I didn't have more than $7500 as my total tax I don't get the full $7500 tax credit. I would only get a federal credit of $7403. So if $8100 was withheld and my total tax is $0, I would get a $8100 refund if I took advantage of the tax credit? Is this math right? 

---

My second question I'm not really sure how to accurately calculate the above formula (assuming it's right) with my numbers for 2018. Right now I'm looking at current withheld amount and guesstimating how much it will be by years end, but I'm not sure how to calculate my total tax.",finance
personalfinance,Trying to help with my wifes insane car loan.,"Hey all,

So, a little background. When my wife and I first started dating she had a Saturn Ion. We seperated for about 6 months, and during that time frame, the car died due to a manufacturer defect, and they bought it out for 5k. Having no car, she went to the dealership, and ended up getting a used Toyota Camry for ~17k. THe kicker here is that she had loan consolidation due to her ex being a dick, and having tried to get multiple loans before this, she went with the car, and a 19% interest rate.

So, I have been trying to work with here to get it knocked down, so we are now at about $6k over what it is worth. The car has 165k miles, and is showing its age, with something going wrong each month. 

She has been going to college for the past year, and is eligble for student loans. I have no idea how this works in particular, so I figured I'd ask what PF though about utilzing some of the student loans to pay down what is left on the loan, sell the car, and pick up something cheap but reliable to get her back and forth from school. I belive the intrest rates are 4.5%, so much better than the 19 she is paying on it. Any thoughts?",finance
personalfinance,Best Money Market Account for an Emergency Fund?,"I want to separate my starter emergency fund (approx. $1500) from my regular saving and checking account. An Online Money Market Account, with the much better interest rates, seems ideal. Since it will only be for real emergencies, the monthly six withdrawal limit doesn't bother me at all. However, many MMAs I've looked at are very difficult/time consuming to withdraw money from or have ridiculously low transfer caps (CIT Bank has an incredible APY, but maxes account-to-account and paypal transfers at $50 a day) that would make them a lot less helpful if an emergency actually occurred.  

I've been googling trying to find a comparison of MMAs that allow Debit cards/ Checks but none of the lists/blog posts I've found so far are very forthcoming.  The best I've found on my own is Ally MMA which has debit/check/ATM access with no additional fees and a 0.9&amp;#37;APY.

personalfinance,Lurker Hoping for Feedback on a Detailed Personal Finance Plan of Action (with a Defined Benefits Pension),"A couple of months ago, this sub encouraged me to apply for a housing program for moderate income folks in my city. Last week, I closed on a new condo with new appliances. It's a tiny studio, but I like small spaces and it's in a good part of town. Also, my mortgage, HOA fees, and assorted housing related bills are around $250 less than I would have paid if I had continued to rent. 

I spent the entire closing process lurking here so I could decide how to best invest the surplus. I learned a lot of tips I'd like to use going forward. **I'm looking for feedback on how I've tried to apply what I learned.**

At 38 years old, I have no retirement accounts because I spent the last four years paying off $7k debt from a long stretch of unemployment and because I had to replenish my emergency fund (one that was way too high and wasted in very low interest savings account -- closing reduced it to ""only"" a six month emergency fund). **I haven't worried much about retirement because I have a defined benefits pension. I'm guaranteed 65% to 71% of my salary, depending on when I retire.** However, I now see the benefit in having an extra cushion.

Before I bought the condo, I saved roughly $600-$700/month. Since my mortgage is now lower, **I can probably save $850-$900/month** (a third of my take home salary). **My plan is to do the following, based on reading a ton of threads here:**

1. Open an online high interest saving account through Ally and park my $9k emergency fund (six months of living expenses) there.

2. Throw all my bills on auto-pay. I always have the cash to pay my bills and I check my accounts regularly; however, I'm not always good at paying the right bills at the right time, especially when I get stressed.

3. Open a supplemental retirement account through work with a $300/month contribution. I can chose among a 403(b) Traditional, a 403(b) Roth, and a 457 (same fund providers and investment options). I've decided on the 403(b) Traditional, as it is pre-tax, there is a catch-up advantage I might use later, and it seems slightly more permissive with hardship withdraws/loans. Since my pension is guaranteed, I assume I can be more aggressive with my allocation. I have decided to use Fidelity as my provider and invest in FXAIX (S&amp;P Index, 0.015% ER) at 56%, FSIVX (International Index, 0.06% ER) at 24%, and VBTIX (Bond Index, 0.04% ER) at 20%.

4. Start paying off my mortgage early with an extra $275/month principal payment for three years, then $230 for the next twelve. If I do that, my PMI will go away in three years instead of eight, and my mortgage will be paid off in fifteen years instead of thirty. I've seen the daily threads about whether to invest or aggressively pay down your mortgage early, and I've decided to take the middle path (especially since I have PMI and my interest rate is a tad high, in the 4-5% range).

5. Open a post-tax investment account through Charles Schwab and invest in similar ETFs &amp; allocation to my retirement funds with a $250/month contribution. I might split up the S&amp;P index fund to maybe a 10% Dow Index/46% S&amp;P depending on the choices available. I don't want to tie all my money up in retirement accounts when I probably won't need it. I might also get a free checking account through them too, as I've read they are good for travel, especially foreign travel, and I'd like to finally take a vacation where I actually go somewhere. I'm also choosing Schwab because I can start investing with a small amount of money since all I've got at the moment is my $9k emergency fund, and I'm not investing that.

6. Any remaining cash will get added to the Ally savings account as a vacation fund. Whatever extra money I have come vacation time is what I have to spend on my trip.

7. Next year, (after my credit isn't impacted by the two credit pulls that just happened with my mortgage), apply for the credit card that offers 6% cash back on groceries. I use my credit card for everything possible, then pay it off every month so that my debit account won't get compromised. I might as well earn some cash back.

Any thoughts? I couldn't find a great deal of information on retirement planning and investing when you have a defined benefit pension plan.",finance

investing,Tesla test driver says next Roadster will be ‘proper weapon’ and Musk's speed claims are actually ‘conservative’,"[Source CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/27/tesla-test-driver-elon-musk-roadster-speed-boast-conservative.html)

Tesla CEO Elon Musk elicited quite a bit of [skepticism](https://bgr.com/2018/06/25/lamborghini-vs-tesla-roadster-battery-speed-terzo-millennio/) when he [boasted](https://electrek.co/2017/06/13/tesla-roadster-next-gen-elon-musk-maximum-plaid/)  in June 2017 that the electric automaker’s next-generation Roadster  would be able to accelerate from zero to 60 miles per hour in under two  seconds — a feat that [Musk said](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/11/17/tesla-unveils-electric-big-rig-truck-amid-manufacturing/) would make the vehicle the “fastest production car ever.”

Now, a Tesla test driver is saying Musk’s boast might have even been “conservative.”

“I think I can say  without getting in trouble that those are actual figures,” says Emile  Bouret, who says he's test-driven the new Roadster. 

""Those aren’t theoretical. Those aren’t calculations. We’ve done those numbers,"" Bouret says in a [video interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=242&amp;v=UcI-5AzPlr8)  posted to the VINwiki YouTube page on Tuesday. ""And I probably  shouldn’t say that those numbers are even conservative, but they are.

 “That thing is going to be a proper weapon.""

The new sports car is not expected to be available until 2020, but experts have already voiced [reservations](https://jalopnik.com/how-the-tesla-roadster-might-pull-off-zero-to-60-mph-in-1820682224) about the new Roadster's so-called “Maximum Plaid” speed mode.

A mechanical engineer at YouTube channel Engineering Explained even [made a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAvIVGGhEis)  in November arguing that no car tires can get enough traction to go  from zero to 60 mph faster than 2.05 seconds, while other experts [suggested](https://www.valuewalk.com/2017/11/tesla-roadster-speed-60-mph/) there would need to be advancements in tire technology in order for the Roadster’s speedy feat to take place by 2020.

Tesla’s Model S sedan with “Ludicrous Mode” has been timed going from zero to 60 mph in [under 2.3 seconds](http://www.motortrend.com/cars/tesla/model-s/2017/2017-tesla-model-s-p100d-first-test-review/), while Porsche’s 918 Spyder is considered one of the world’s fastest at [2.2 seconds](https://www.caranddriver.com/features/the-2015-porsche-918-spyder-is-the-quickest-road-car-in-the-world-feature).

But Tesla’s upcoming Roadster update may have them all beat, according to Bouret.       

Bouret, a college roommate of Tesla Chief Designer Franz von Holzhausen, says he drove the Roadster prototype when Tesla [debuted it](http://fortune.com/2017/11/17/tesla-truck-200000-roadster/)  in November. He suggests the skeptics should “have faith” and that  anyone who loves cars should be rooting for the new Tesla Roadster to  break the mold and become one of the fastest cars ever made.

“I’m definitely rooting  for them, because the world will be a better place if that car does get  built and it does get on the road, because other people are going to  build cars to beat it,” he says.

There is, of course, a down side to speed. On the same day the Bouret interview was posted, federal investigators [said on Tuesday](https://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/local/feds-tesla-traveling-116-mph-before-crash-that-killed/wK81B3qFlrFADMTxk2zF7O/)  that a Tesla Model S involved in a deadly crash in Florida in May was  traveling 116 mph only seconds before it crashed into a wall.

personalfinance,Trying to figure out which student loans to pay first and how much?,"Hi all!

Last year, I graduated and had a bit of an issue in job searching with just under 30k debt. While talking to my boss, she's mentioned towards the end of my particular temp position wanting to hire me as a HR generalist that'll pay between 49-51k before taxes. The job has me thinking of how quickly I can pay my loans off within hopefully the next 2-3 years or at least owe around the 6-9k range by the 2 year mark.

I currently live with my parents and my monthly bills would be about 1k, 500 (hopefully more) for savings, and my minimum payment for my loans are $306 a month. I've paid one loan tnat was $200 just to get it out the way, but these are my leftover loans.

So heres all my loans and interest rates:

* Subsidized $5496.38 at 3.76&amp;#37;
* Subsidized $5496.29 at 4.29&amp;#37;
* Subsidized $4496.91 at 4.66&amp;#37;
* Subsidized $3566.06 at 3.86&amp;#37;
* Subsidized $3557.96 at 3.44&amp;#37;

* Unsubsidized $2222.47 at 4.29&amp;#37;

personalfinance,Should I refinance?,"I currently have a 3.125% interest rate on my mortgage.  Balance is $299 and my home is worth ~$400K.  Great right?   The kicker is that I have an FHA loan with $200/mo PMI payment.  We put 20% down on house but due to credit issues, had to accept the FHA loan.  

Now that my credit has bounced back I have been exploring the idea of refinancing to remove that payment, but I don't know if it makes financial sense or not. 

Current loan:  $299K @3.125% 30 year fixed, 28 years to go, P&amp;I is $1375, total payment with taxes/ins/PMI is $2075. 
New loan - 2 options:
option 1: $11K closing costs making new balance $312K, 4.125% fixed for 10 years, then variable.  Monthly payment is $60 less per month. 
option 2: same as above except 4.625% for a 30 year fixed. Monthly payment is $30 more per month and P&amp;I will be $1600. 

My gut is telling me that I should just stick with my current loan, suck it up and pay the PMI until it drops off in 9 years and then enjoy my 3.125% interest rate on the rest of the loan.

personalfinance,Another John Hancock 401k thread,"I found a few threads about JH 401ks through searching but I have a question in addition to the typical ""which funds should I pick?"" that I didn't see answered anywhere.

So I just got the enrollment information for my company's 401k plan and the general consensus seems to be that John Hancock sucks because of high fees which I've found to be true. My employer is matching 3% at 1-to-1 for the remainder of the year then will go up to a 4% match with a 5% contribution starting in January. I intend to do Roth 401k contributions to get the match then continue investing in a Vanguard Roth IRA. The list of funds I can choose from is [here](https://imgur.com/a/w94Pdjx).

The first question I have is regarding expense ratio. In the list of funds to choose from the expense ratio is indicated as ""Total Annual Operating Expenses"", but when looking at the details of a fund there is another expense ratio listed (gross and net) called the ""Underlying Fund Expense Ratio"" seen [here](https://imgur.com/a/no4I9aL).

* If I understand the footnote correctly, the actual expense ratio is the one shown in the fund list, which is the underlying fund expense ratio minus any fee waivers. Does that seem correct?

On to the fund selection. I'm a little behind at 28 with nothing invested currently, so I'm ok with going 100% stocks for the time being. I have about $37k in student loan debt and will hold off contributing to my IRA until I've paid off the loans with interest rates over 5%, so I'll be stuck with nothing but the not great funds from the above list for a while. What would be decent options given I'd like to have the following?

* 100% stocks
* Roughly 70% US stocks and 30% international stocks
* The expense ratios in the list are missing 1.16% in administrative fees that are tacked on, pushing some funds close to a 2% ER.

It looks like the only passive index fund option is the ""'Mid Cap Index Fund"" and maybe the JH Multi-Index Lifestyle funds. The Lifestyle funds seem to just be different percentages of a JH US/int'l stock blend and a handful of mostly Vanguard ETFs.

btc,Fiat money targets obsolescence by design,"Central Banks control national currencies. Everywhere around the world they justify their existence by promising ""price stability."" Their main tool is manipulation of interest rates, a tool they use to reach an arbitrary [inflation target](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting), usually around 2%. Think about what that means for a second. They aim for *price stability* by *deliberately devaluating* your money.

If you start with $1000, and you hold on to it for 10 years, what equivalent purchasing power in the future can you expect to retain in today's dollars, given 2% price inflation?

$1000*(1-0.02)^10 =$817

What do you call a currency whose value, by design, asymptotically approaches zero? Certainly nothing good. I'm pretty sure that programmed obsolescence is not one of the qualities of sound money, and not a great store of value for non-trivial time intervals.

When I was a kid, I would pick up pennies and buy candies with them at the corner store. The thought of buying a candy for a penny is laughable today, pennies have already become obsolete.

Most countries experience price inflation much in excess of central bank targets, and the poor suffer the most due to the centralized economic mismanagement.

Giving the vast majority of the Earth's population a tool to free themselves from state control of money is the reason bitcoin was created.

Satoshi Nakamoto said it best: 

"" The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. ""

And that is why I support bitcoin cash. It is the only currency I know with the potential to fulfill Satoshi's vision of freedom from state control.

We must win. Not just freedom, but millions of lives depend on it.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,New computer,"A little background: My husband started a business with my brother, and things are already going well for them. In the near future he hopes to quit his job, once he's making at least as much as he makes per month, if not a little more) and be able to work from home. (For what he's doing it'll be very doable).

I also work full time, no kids yet, and none in the foreseeable future.

He'll have  to travel from time to time, but not in the near future. 

Our one year wedding anniversary is coming up and he has had his laptop since 2012 and it's on it's last breaths of life, he is also a musician so he is constantly using his computer to record.

Before it completely shits out, I was planning on giving him a new iMac for our anniversary so that when he does begin working from home, he has a reliable computer and can also record on it. He can get an iPad/laptop for travel when the time comes and it'll come out of his businesses account. 

My question is this: I can technically afford the computer no problem. We have almost 10k in saving, 5+k in our checking. We make about 5k a month after taxes. (+/- 500, I work commission, but usually make up for it in tips)

I have a credit score of 740 according to my FICO, Mint tells me it's closer to 790) and recently got a hefty credit limit increase. 

I am always trying to get my credit score up so when it comes time to buy a house, I can get a lowered interest rate. 

Is it worth applying for the apple finance, paying it off in 12 months rather than the 18 months interest free they offer?

I only have two credit cards, both are paid on time every month, one is paid off in full the other were paying off slower, it was all wedding shit but it's down to 5k and will be paid off in the next year. (I currently have about 30% utilization between both cards) 

My biggest concern is I apply for the finance, get rejected and there's a mark on my credit report. 

Not sure what to do.

Tldr: buying new computer, can pay off in full right now, but wondering if financing it will help my credit score.

personalfinance,"Getting married, buying a house, having a baby, finishing school","I've been meaning to make this post for a while but I've been too afraid of the reality of the situation. My fiancee and I are 21 and we're getting married on the 19th of July. We have a little one due in November and we currently live in an overpriced one bedroom second story apparentment. Aside from the price everything about it is perfect. Location is perfect (close by parents and relatives), the building is brand new and we actually signed the first lease, and commutes to school and work are 25 minutes or less. We are both in school (off for the summer) and work full time jobs. During the school year I work full time and take 8 credits. My fiancee has worked part time and done school full time. My degree is in electrical engineering and I'm about 30 credits shy of my degree. Now my work which requires me to be a full time employee offers 100% tuition reimbursement. Until I started here I borrowed about 25k in student loans. Fiancee is starting dental hygiene and is still doing gen eds. Now for the reason I came here: financial and personal advice. We do not want to be on the second floor in a small apartment. First floor two bedrooms in our complex are $375 more/mo. All other complexes in our area were either built in the 70's, not much cheaper than what we're paying now, on a large slope (winters can be bad here), and don't have in unit laundry. Most are a combination of the 4. So we're thinking about buying a house in our area that's would be a similar cost monthly for us with more room and less stairs. I have good credit and we have 8k in liquid assets, after the wedding it may be more. Yes I know our accounts will be looked into and we may not be able to use some of our gift money. I was pre approved by quicken loans for a $150,000 30 year fixed mortgage and we qualify for a USDA RD loan. We are looking into the 110-130k range. My concern with just renting the bigger appartment is that we will not be able to afford it on only my income. We currently take home about $3500-4000 post tax depending on overtime but solo I bring home $2000-2700. These are 4 week estimates so maybe a hair larger per month. Our bills add up to about $2700 currently so we've been saving a huge chunk every month starting this year. As of now I'm depositing $300 a check into my HSA account and this will cover the family deductible by the time the baby comes. 100% is covered after the deductible. After that I will drop it back down to maybe 75 or 100. I understand most people on here use the account for retirement purposes, but I'm more interested in supporting my family now rather than myself in retirement. That gives us an extra ~300 bucks a month post tax. I guess my question is am I sane for wanting to buy a house with everything going on with us? Or should we just keep looking for another place to rent? I would post our budget but I don't have access to the spreadsheet right now.  Rent is $950. Car insurance + renters is insane at $580. We both have reasonably priced cars with low interest rates ~4%, $172 and $75/mo. If I left anything important out besides the budget let me know, I will add it later. General advice is of course appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,18 With extra money should I do? If anything??,"Hello,

I'm a pretty driven young man with about $2k in my checking account with about another $2k coming in by the end of the summer. And I plan on working a small job during the coming school year because I get $2k/yr in federal work aid (I forget the name of the program) I don't spend it all instantly and actually live off of basically nothing because I'm in school and everything is paid for atm. I come from poor parents and I actually have more money than the both of them combined right now that I know of. But that is besides the point.

I feel like I'm very smart- 3.8 GPA after my first year at a top 50 University studying chemistry (hopefully it doesn't get too hard lol); especially with money. I'm not exactly sure what I should be doing if at all anything. I'm extremely young so I don't know anything about 401ks and IRAs which I probably shouldn't because what I have read about them they're basically for people with consistent paying jobs.

I recently just bought my self the newest MacBook Pro with the Touch Bar for a measly $400 off a guy (what a great deal I know), and there's really nothing else I can treat myself to that I know of at least haha. I am taking out loans for school currently about $3,000/yr so maybe I was thinking of paying some of that off?? But my older sister who has a M.D, which is what I eventually plan on doing, advises me to not even bother because $3,000/yr will be nothing when I eventually have to take out a lot more for medical school.

So with all of this being said what should I do with my money that literally rots in a checking account, (I should probably at least get the crappy rates on my savings account and move it there honestly I know). I was thinking about getting into day trading maybe which I'd have to learn a lot to do but like I said I'm driven. Basically I've read a lot online before making my own post but not surprisingly everything is targeted not for 18 year olds who are turning 19 3 hours. And also it's one thing to read stuff about someone else's situation than have someone tell you to your own situation. Overall I'm just very curious what ideas might be out there for me to make more money with my money or just make more money in general! Thanks for the help if anyone responds :P",finance

I put an extra $550 a month into an investment account, plus I divert another $500 a month from my paycheck into a savings account and use it as a slush fund. I’m wondering if it’s more worth it for me to make an extra monthly principle payment of $1050 a month and skip the investment. Doing the math I’d save a ton on interest and pay down the loan quickly. 

While I believe in the benefit of investing, not having a mortgage YEARS sooner while still being of working age seems like a better position to be in. My house has already gained a lot in equity.

CryptoCurrency,"Australians, you need to start buying as much crypto as you can.","I’m Australian, this isn’t meant to be an alarmist or sensationalist post, but the economic situation in our country is a lot more serious than most of us think.

First off, the current economic situation.  

Simply put, our economy is fucked.  Our housing market is dangerously overleveraged and because of [policies by our government at the time](http://ministers.treasury.gov.au/DisplayDocs.aspx?doc=pressreleases/2008/107.htm&amp;pageID=003&amp;min=ceb&amp;Year=&amp;DocType=), we never experienced the correction the US and most of the rest of the world did during the 2008 Global Financial Crisis.  And now the [chickens are coming home to roost](https://www.domain.com.au/news/australia-faces-twice-the-housing-hangover-of-the-usa-20171124-gzrw1k/?utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_content=link-newsfeed&amp;utm_campaign=c-all-autopromo).  Australians are up to their eyeballs in debt, [almost half of the housing loans are interest only](https://www.afr.com/business/banking-and-finance/interestonly-loans-could-be-australias-subprime-20170519-gw939m), it’s the reason the Reserve Bank of Australia hasn’t raised the interest rates since 2016.  Because as soon as they do, even by 0.01%, tens of thousands of Australians are going to default on their mortgages. It’s no secret that our housing market is one of the most expensive in the world, and anyone living in our country already knows this.  The market value of Australian homes is **4 times** the GDP of the country.  Our housing market is beyond the point of saving and the bubble is about to pop.  And while our mainstream media is trying to convince us that it will [deflate slowly](https://www.afr.com/real-estate/no-pop-in-housing-bubble-sydney-melbourne-to-deflate-gradually-kpmg-says-20170620-gwuouh), history paints a different picture.

And that’s just the start of our problems.  It’s no secret that China is our biggest trading partner.  [We rely on China more than any other developed country in the world](https://www.austrade.gov.au/news/economic-analysis/australian-exports-and-chinas-transition).  And what is currently happening on the greater global stage?  Our most important military ally has engaged in a trade war with China, and the effects of that trade war are starting to be felt.  Chinese stocks are in freefall, and that’s only going to be the beginning of the negative effects from Trump’s hardline approach to dealing with China.  It doesn’t take a genius to see that this is going to have a devastating effect on our economy.

Our biggest trading partner is having a financial gunfight with the USA, which is going to result in them buying less of our stuff.  And still that isn’t the end of it.  Mining is down.  [Commodities prices are down](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/iron-ore).  [Our manufacturing sector is almost dead](https://theconversation.com/toyota-names-2017-end-australian-car-making-to-cease-experts-react-23037).  The only thing we have going for us at the moment is agriculture and that can’t prop up the entire economy.  You wanna turn white?  Read [this article](https://medium.com/@matt_11659/matt-barrie-australias-economy-is-a-house-of-cards-6877adb3fb2f) from last year.  Our economy is teetering on the precipice.

You think I’m being dramatic?  Well even the Australian MSM [can no longer ignore it](https://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/australian-economy/we-just-got-a-glimpse-of-australias-future-and-it-is-not-good/news-story/bcc95c134c2f78d1878c6ca58f39a06d).  With articles like [this](https://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/australian-economy/how-to-prepare-for-economic-armageddon/news-story/08c0ab60e4184ee2d2f3e3d199a5a803) appearing almost on the daily.  [Our dollar is in serious trouble](https://www.macrobusiness.com.au/2018/06/australian-dollar-finished/), anyone who knows the slightest bit about TA go look at the graphs in that article.  Our country is in serious economic trouble.  And we don’t know shit about it because [our media is a duopoly that makes most of its money from their real estate arms](https://www.macrobusiness.com.au/2016/10/australian-property-bubble-scale-like-no/).  All signs are pointing to our dollar about to be worth a hell of a lot less than it currently is.

What can we do?

Since this is the crypto subreddit the solution to this impending economic shitstorm should be painfully obvious.  **Buy fucking Bitcoin**.  Not the solution for the country, for you.  The country isn’t going to do shit for anyone of us except saddle us with debt and a cooked economy that is going to take generations to get out of, if ever.  So we should be diversifying.  Sure buying gold probably isn’t a stupid idea either, but if you think that is proof against state intervention, [read a history book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102).  Even then, gold still needs to be converted into cash to be useful, and anyone paying attention can see that [Australia is gearing up for a war on cash](https://www.perthnow.com.au/politics/budget/government-bid-to-ban-cash-buys-of-more-than-10000-to-stop-organised-crime-ng-b88830273z) that borders on tyrannical.  The only way for us as individuals to protect our wealth at the moment is to convert it into cryptocurrency.

But Bitcoin is low at the moment!

No shit.  But if you think it’s going to stay that way you are 1. In the wrong subreddit, and 2. No paying attention to the macro factors of crypto.  [Wall St is gearing up to enter](https://theicojournal.com/source-morgan-stanley-wants-to-beat-goldman-to-crypto-trading-riches/).  [The bank that runs the world is getting involved](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/02/technology/bitcoin-goldman-sachs.html).  [And not just American banks](https://www.ccn.com/japanese-banking-giant-sbi-plans-summer-launch-for-crypto-exchange/).  Bitcoin may be low now but if you know anything about market cycles, you know that it’ll be back.  [Here](https://twitter.com/StackinBits/status/1012521199908413440) is a good comparison of BTC a few years ago as opposed to now.  It’s almost at the point where it’s irresponsible not to be buying bitcoin, [and I’m not the only one that holds this opinion](https://www.ccn.com/almost-irresponsible-to-not-invest-in-bitcoin-billionaire-mike-novogratz/).  Worst case scenario, bitcoin falls to USD 3k.  What do you think is going to happen after that?  Bitcoin and crypto aren’t going anywhere and you’re kidding yourself if you think that the value of bitcoin isn’t going to be much higher in the years to come.

Of course [the RBA is telling people that Bitcoin is dead](https://www.news.com.au/finance/money/investing/bitcoin-unlikely-to-gain-foothold-in-australia-according-to-rba/news-story/e2326eea581898de512df64e879ac8ff), probably because they don’t want Australians to dump their soon to be worthless fiat currency.  In fact one any given day you’ll see a bunch of anti-crypto propaganda on our MSM.  The same MSM that has been telling us all to buy as many houses as we can for the last 20 years.  The same MSM that up until now hasn’t said shit about the direction our economy is heading in.  

The writing’s on the wall people.  If we keep our wealth in AUD it’s going to be worth considerably less sooner rather than later.  Our property sector is going to crash, our dollar is going to crash, our personal wealth is going to be stripped away from us.  If you want to avoid this, if you want to protect your wealth, ensure a future that isn’t financial hardship, then we really only have one choice.  Buy bitcoin.  Personally I am converting half my pay each week into BTC and just holding it.  Not putting it into alts.  Just btc.  I’d advise you do the same as well.  I understand that this sounds super risky.  But if you read the articles I’ve linked to in this post I’m sure you’ll see that the only risky move is doing nothing.  This isn’t a joke or a false alarm. The notion that our economy has always been fine up until now isn’t valid anymore.  If you want to protect your personal wealth and purchasing power in the next few years, you really should be buying as much btc as you can while it is this low.  This is what crypto is for, avoiding the negative financial downturns of specific countries.  It’s a globally traded commodity that is accessible by anyone with a computer.  Our economy tanking isn’t going to affect the price one bit.  

I hope some of this has been useful.  Listen to me, don’t listen to me, it’s your choice.  But this is the digital age, there’s no excuse for ignorance anymore.",cryptocurrency

G20 points to Financial Action Task Force (FATF) — an intergovernmental body formed to fight money laundering and terrorist financing — to cryptocurrency, for recommendations on how to regulate digital assets within each country.

“We commit to implement the FATF standards as they apply to crypto-assets, look forward to the FATF review of those standards, and call on the FATF to advance global implementation. We call on international standard-setting bodies (SSBs) to continue their monitoring of crypto-assets and their risks, according to their mandates, and assess multilateral responses as needed.”

Though during the last meeting it was noted that cryptocurrencies are less of a treat . — “Cryptocurrencies make up less than 1 percent of the global gross domestic product (GDP), he said, while credit default swaps were equal to the global GDP in 2008”

below are some the FATF Recommendations though this recommendations are since 2014 , I find them valid till today.

“When assessing the ML/ TF risk of convertible VC, the distinction between centralised and decentralised VC will be one key aspect. Due to anonymity and the challenges to conduct a proper identification of the participant, convertible decentralised VCPPSs in general may be regarded of higher risk of ML/FT which would require the application of enhanced due diligence measures. “ “According to this risk assessment, countries should decide to regulate exchanges platforms between convertible virtual currencies and fiat currencies (i.e., convertible virtual currency exchangers). Some countries may decide to prohibit VC activities, based on their own risk assessment (including, e.g., uptake trends) and national regulatory context in order to support other policy goals not addressed by this Guidance (e.g., consumer protection, safety and soundness, monetary policy). Where countries consider prohibiting VCPPS, they should take into account, among other things, the impact a prohibition would have on the local and global level of ML/TF risks, including whether prohibiting VC payments activities could drive them underground, where they will continue to operate without AML/CFT controls or oversight. Regardless of whether a country opts for prohibiting or regulating VCs, additional measures are useful to mitigate the overall ML/TF risk. If a country decides to prohibit VC activities, additional mitigation measures would include identifying VC providers that are operating illegally in their jurisdiction and applying proportionate and dissuasive sanctions to them. Prohibition would still require outreach, education and enforcement actions by the country. Countries would also need to take into account the cross-border element of VCPPS in their risk mitigation strategies. “
Here FATF recommends differentiating between centralized and decentralized virtual currencies and insisting on very strict AML/CFT rules for exchanges, and they warn against outright ban due to anonymity and the challenges to conduct a proper identification with VC,which might escalate underground activities and are hard to regulate.

2. “countries should consider undertaking short- and longer-term policy work to develop comprehensive regulation of VCPPS if widespread adoption of VC occurs.”

3. “directs countries to register or license natural or legal persons that provide MVTS in the country, and ensure their compliance with the relevant AML/CFT measures. “ Money Value Transfer System, this is a red flag for Tether/bitfinex might have issue here the will need to be registered and licensed. “Because convertible VC exchangers that transfer value digitally, via the internet, are not subject to territorial boundaries and generally offer VCPPS to persons in countries in which they are not physically present, it is very important that all home countries apply domestic licensing or registration requirements when required by the FATF Recommendations. For the same reasons, proper oversight by the home jurisdiction and adequate cooperation and information exchange between competent authorities between jurisdictions where the entity provides services is of high importance. “

Conclusion:

Outright ban will likely not happen having had FATF advise against it, but like we are already see in South Korea and Japan , strict KYC , ML, and TF rules are to be expected at all levels of exchange .The treat of VC is in its decentralization and anonymity, so Governments wouldn’t want to escalate things by not handling them properly.

That said the sell off since march might be due to the expected outcome of this meeting, in other words, there might be some relief or hysteria due to the outcome of the meeting , probably why the sell-off is happening.

personalfinance,"Starting medical school, could use some advice.","As the title states, I will be starting medical school in August at a US, MD state school program. I have been approved for the full loan amounts but my wife and I are trying to figure out a way to minimize debt load. My wife and I currently both work but I will have to quit my job in the fall to go to school. The school absolutely forbids working as a student (for good reason) and unfortunately, I currently carry the insurance benefits for my family.  

Background Info| ..
:--|:--  
Family Size|4 (Me, my wife, and two children- 2 year old &amp; 3 month old)  
Monthly Income starting in August|$4600  
Average Monthly Expenses|$4500 (includes childcare, renter/car ins, utilities, food, etc)  
Car Loan Monthly Payments|$510  

Other Debts|Debt(Value, if any)  
:--|:--  
2015 Volkswagen Passat| $6823 ($8000)  
2017 Chrysler Pacifica|$17462 ($21000)  
Wife Student Loan|$1350
My Student Loan (Undergrad and Graduate)|$86000  
Total(not including my student loan)|$25635 

*Note about my student loan*    
Unfortunately, in my field of science without a master's I would have been unable to get a decently paying job with benefits in a research lab in my region. This said, not only did the master's degree help with the job, without, I would not have been competitive enough for medical school applications. I know this amount is absurdly high, especially since I will be taking on more loan debt with med school, but at the time I felt(and was guided) this was the only way to get to medical school.  

Assets|Value  
:--|:--   
Checking/Savings|$11000(this is spread across multiple accounts including a separate college savings account)
Mutual Fund|$14300
Retirement(refunded to me when I quit)|$5200  
Total|$30500  

**Short Term Plan**  
My plan is to close all of the mutual fund positions and pay off the Passat and put the rest toward the my wife's student loan. Then put the rest of the remaining balance toward the Pacifica. My wife and I under the new tax reform will have a 22% income tax so all said and done, I should be able to put $2981 towards the Van leaving $14481 remaining. With the retirement refund (~30% tax and penalty apply)I should receive ~$3484, again put that toward the van bringing it to $10997.  We would like to keep about $2000 in savings initially as an emergency fund so we planned on throwing the remaining $9000 at the Pacifica, leaving a little under $2000 left which we hope to pay off before next summer. Since my wife's income will barely meet ends, we plan on using student loans to pay for rent/utilities and use my wife's income for everything else, which should leave us with enough to keep a emergency fund as well as pay off the van in about 10 months, barring some large expense coming up.  My wife and I will be put on my school's student insurance and my two kids will go on an excellent state insurance program for kids (total $80/month premium). 

**Long term plan**  
So here is the kicker, by the time I am all said and done I calculate I will owe somewhere in the ballpark of $350k-375k in federal student loan. Not horrible, but not great either. My goal is to refinance (the 6.8% and 7% notes are killer) and get into the REPAYE program(if it still exists) before starting residency. My intended speciality is Neurology which is a four year residency (apprx. salary is ~55k). After the four years, I estimate a starting salary around 250k-275k. Most places I have seen offer some type of loan repayment on average of 50k/year depending on location and years worked. My ultimate goal is to still live like a resident and pay down student debt. I hope to be debt free in 3-4 years post residency but this is very optimistic.  

I would appreciate any advice, especially about our short term plan and if this is the best way to go about paying off current debt. One question I have is whether I should slowing take of the mutual fund so that I can spread the tax burden over 2018 and 2019. Again, any advice would be helpful and thanks in advance.",finance

personalfinance,Personal Loan? Or credit Transfer? Or both?,"So I owe approximately $10k in debt, with half of that being student loans and the other half being credit cards (one $5k with 24% apr and one $500).

My question is, to save myself on interest and consolidating my bills into one (and possibly paying off either my loans or my credit cards with the personal loan), what would be the best course of action? I currently am trying to pay off debt and I almost have the $500 card almost paid off completely, but the interest rate on the 5k is kicking my ass. If I were to get the loan (pre approved for up to 6k), I could pay off all credit cards and just pay the loan off each month, along with my other loan at minimum payments. Or I could possibly pay off the student loans and get a balance transfer with the cards and not deal with an interest rate for the next year or so. 

If you need any more information beyond that I’d be happy to share, thank you to anyone that responds to my question!",finance
Banking,Which savings accounts should I consider if I am just starting out?,"I am a recent graduate (I'm 21) considering opening a savings account somewhere so that I can start depositing regularly. I have very basic knowledge of banking so I would appreciate some clarification.

I was checking NerdWallet, but almost everything listed is ""Online Savings"" or ""High-Yield Savings"" (which is also online). I'm open to online accounts, but I can't say I'm too comfortable with them. I like being able to go up to someone and ask questions about my account. Currently, I have one local checking account.

I'm actually not too sure how online savings accounts work.. Take Ally for example, (1) do I deposit with.. a transfer of funds from my checking? (2a) What if I want to purchase a property in the future and need to take the money out? (2b) What is an overdraft fee and how will it affect me when I want to take large sums out? (3) How do I order like.. a cashier check to take to my other bank and (4) how long would it take? (5) If I want to deposit cash, how do I do that? I'm also not familiar with ATM machines either. (6) What are the chances of online banks getting hacked? (7) Or their system shutting down?

I noticed that both online savings accounts and high-yield savings accounts have really tempting interest rates, (8) which is taxed, right? Besides the difference in interest rate, (9) what's the difference between a traditional savings account and a high-yield one? I can't help but feel that there's a catch.. I haven't found enough positive reviews on Ally to trust them completely yet, but Chase also isn't attractive enough with their 0.01&amp;#37; interest rate. I prefer not to take big risks, though so if I feel that cons outweigh the pros of an account, I would rather go with a lower return for a safer option. I don't know if this makes any difference but I am debt free and I have a mid-700 credit score.

If you could, please give me some recommendations as to which bank I should open a savings account.

It’s been another rough quarter for the rollout of [Tesla Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/TSLA:US)’s Model 3. The factory was shut down at least twice for [extensive upgrades](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-06-08/tesla-model-3-photos-of-elon-musk-s-factory-in-fremont), a new production line was hastily erected in a [tent in the parking lot](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-25/the-future-of-tesla-hinges-on-this-gigantic-tent), and Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk moved from sleeping on the couch to [sleeping under the desk](https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-races-to-exit-teslas-production-hell-1530149814). He was [even seen personally torquing bolts](https://twitter.com/S_Padival/status/1009956753272782848) on an assembly line, alongside a summer intern. 

Now the mad scramble to meet a self-imposed production deadline—a rate of 5,000 cars per week by the end of June—is coming to an end. The quarter concludes Saturday, and Tesla is expected to report its production figures for the last three months before the July 4 holiday. Tesla has repeatedly fallen short of its own manufacturing targets. Now investors will find out exactly how many cars Tesla made, sold, and stockpiled and what sort of weekly rate they were finally able to achieve.

Here’s our rundown of what to expect. 

## Seeing a Shortfall: Bloomberg’s Model 3 Tracker

Back in February, Bloomberg introduced an experimental tool to [track the Model 3 rollout](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-tesla-tracker/). The tracker uses vehicle identification numbers (VINs) to estimate production in real time. The model projects that Tesla finished the quarter making 27,957 Model 3s—or 4,533 per a week, shy of Musk’s goal. Since production of the Model 3 began in July 2017, the Bloomberg tracker estimates that 40,409 of the sedans have been made.   


Musk himself has suggested that this estimate is too low. An analyst report by Goldman Sachs, which projected quarterly production that’s just 43 cars more than the Bloomberg estimate, prompted the CEO to send an email to his employees. “They are [in for a rude awakening](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-27/musk-says-rude-awakening-awaits-bearish-goldman-sachs-analyst),” Musk wrote. 

The Bloomberg model is, by design, slow to reflect sudden shifts in production and could underestimate Tesla’s last-minute manufacturing push that spilled into a gigantic tent outside the factory in Fremont, California. Back in the first quarter, the Bloomberg Model 3 Tracker underestimated the actual production total by less than 5 percent—coming closer than the Wall Street consensus. The tool doesn’t estimate total deliveries, which can vary based on the number of cars in transit at the end of the quarter.  

## Wall Street Doesn’t Think Tesla Made It

Wall Street has also been placing their bets on Tesla’s quarterly figures. The average of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg projects second-quarter Model 3 deliveries of 26,121 cars. Three analysts also gave estimates for production, which averaged 30,167.

The number most people are watching is Tesla’s weekly production rate, a squishy figure that Musk has set up as his quarterly benchmark. Tesla initially targeted a rate of 5,000 per week by the end of 2017, but the company has since moved that target back twice. Only one firm stuck their neck out with an estimate of weekly production: Evercore ISI predicts that Tesla will hit 4,600 during the final week.  

Total shipments for Models S and X are expected to be around 22,622 units, according to an average of six estimates. 

One thing that makes this quarter particularly hard to assess is the approaching expiration of the U.S. tax credit for electric vehicles. [Tesla may be suppressing](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2018-03-12/insights-on-telsa-model-3-bloomberg-tracker#5B2D2D9D68C80000) U.S. sales as the quarter ends as way to extend its federal electric-vehicle tax credit of $7,500 per car. The subsidy begins to phase out one full quarter after the quarter in which Tesla sells its 200,000th electric car in the U.S. By hitting that milestone after July 1, rather than a day earlier, Tesla would gain an additional three months of tax credits that could be worth [more than $400 million](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2018-03-12/insights-on-telsa-model-3-bloomberg-tracker#5B2D66D868BC0000) to Tesla customers, according to Bloomberg estimates. 

In June, Tesla filled Model 3 orders to reservation holders in Canada ahead of deliveries to some U.S. customers. There are other actions Tesla may be taking, including accelerating its overseas deliveries for the Model S and Model X and stockpiling cars at holding facilities, all of which could push quarterly revenue into the third quarter, which is when Musk vows that Tesla will finally become profitable. 

Tesla’s stock has been on a tear in the second quarter, boosted by apparent progress on Model 3 production. The stock has climbed 31 percent to close at $349.93 on Thursday. Tesla’s market value reached $59.4 billion—more than long-established rivals General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co.

Here’s a roundup of what analysts’ are saying ahead of the key delivery figures: 

**Goldman Sachs, David Tamberrino:**   
**(**Sell, price target $195)

* “We believe that Model 3 deliveries are tracking below consensus.”
* “Investor conversations on the stock have moved past the 5,000/week run-rate production target (as we believe most investors are giving the company credit for achieving this level entering third quarter) toward vehicle profit margins and conversion of Model 3 reservations to higher priced vehicles.”
* Forecasts Tesla achieving about 22,000 Model 3 deliveries to customers in the quarter, up from Goldman’s previous 19,000 estimate, but well below consensus. His forecast for production is 28,000, in line with the [Bloomberg Tracker](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-tesla-tracker/). 
* Believes Tesla is tracking below its 2018 Model S/X guidance of about 100,000 units, based on the quarter-to-date May cadence.

**Barclays, Brian Johnson**  
(Underweight, price target $210)

* “While we appreciate the steps taken to raise capacity, we believe the admission that it needed a second general assembly line to reach 5,000/week is another indicator of the challenges in ramping production.”
* “On the path to reaching 10,000 model 3/week, one key item to be addressed is paint shop capacity. The paint shop will need to have capacity added to handle 10,000 Model 3/week in addition to 2,000 S/X per week.”

**Bernstein, Toni Sacconaghi**  
(Market-perform, price target $265)

* Says Tesla’s Automotive segment’s gross margins may be overstated, noting a steep plunge in the gross margins of the Services and Other segment.
* Expects second-quarter Model 3 deliveries of 26,000.

**Evercore ISI, Arndt Ellinghorst &amp; George Galliers**  
(In-line, price target )

* Expects Tesla to deliver “21,800 Model S/X during the quarter and 30,700 Model 3, with Model 3 production at a run-rate of 4,600 during the final week versus guidance of 5,000.'”
* Notes comments by Panasonic executive that a pick-up in Model 3 production has resulted in occasional battery shortages.

**Guggenheim, Robert Cihra**  
(Buy, price target $430)

* Still sees Tesla flipping from “losses to profits in second half of 2018” and the prospect of a profitable Tesla setting up a “meaningfully more positive stock narrative.”
* “Tesla producing as many as 35,000 Model 3s and shipping 29,000, up from just over 8,000 in the first quarter and 2,000 in the fourth quarter.”
* “While 6 months later than projected, we continue to estimate that 5,000/week bogey then setting up Tesla’s overall model to flip from sizable cash burn in first half of 2018 to profitability in second half, as Model 3 volumes drive big revenue, margin and free cash flow leverage off the big fixed-cost structure Tesla has been building.”

**Consumer Edge, James Albertine**  
(Overweight, price target $385)

* “Production of the Model 3 is still the primary driver of upside to expectations and shares in 2018.”
* “We visited the Gigafactory in May, which is when we learned about Tesla’s push to 5,000 units per week of Model 3 production by second quarter-end, a goal we believe many investors did not believe management could achieve prior to our visit.”
* Estimates second-quarter Model 3 deliveries to stand at 25,000 units.

**Baird, Ben Kallo**  
(Outperform, price target $411)

* “We expect the focus will be on exit rate Model 3 production and total Model 3 production in June, in that order, and believe the stock could trade up if Tesla approaches its 5,000/week production target.”
* “We think TSLA may deliver about 25,000 vehicles.”
* “Consensus estimates for second-quarter deliveries may be too high, particularly given our belief there could be a larger-than-normal delta between production and deliveries due to the ramp during the quarter.”",finance

personalfinance,Pay off Student Loans or Invest?,"Hey guys I'd like some input on my situation. I've never considered myself to be great with handling finances so any advice is appreciated.

I am 24 years old with around $40k in debt (student loans, car loan) and have an annual income of \~$120k before taxes. I make all of my payments and just stash the rest in savings. I want to maximize the amount of money that I am pulling in, so I'm eager to start investing my money. 

Should I completely pay off my loans before I even think about investing? The way I see it is, my loans have about a 3.5&amp;#37; interest rate -- so as long as my investments yield a return greater than 3.5&amp;#37; then it would make more sense to just continue with my monthly payments on the loans and milk the investment while I can.  


Is investing right now a bad idea for me? I can see why eliminating debt asap would be a smart thing to do, but I'd like to at least start building some kind of investment portfolio.  
Also on that note, is it realistic to find something to invest in with an ROI &gt; 3.5&amp;#37;? Or does that get into the risky territory?

Does the Federal Reserve raise interest rates through out the year on a set schedule? Do they raise and lower them whenever they feel like the economy is growing or declining?

personalfinance,Don't know who to trust. Is what this company is telling me the right thing to do?,"I'm at a loss and not sure what direction to go in. I'd really appreciate a solid direction from anyone that is well versed in this arena or has had experience in this situation - really unsure who I can trust. 

Here is a situation:

I run a family business with my parents out of our home. We refinanced that home in 2005 as we really wanted to build a separate building for the business on the property as we had the space. At the time we applied for the new mortgage we hired an architect to design the studio. The refinancing went through but the cost to build a studio ended up exceeding what we had imagined due to factors in the housing industry, based on area region etc... It became cost prohibitive.

Rather then sit on the money we ended up investing in some unrelated real estate in hopes of a return some day. How can you go wrong with real estate? 

Then the bubble burst, for everyone. 2008 and the recession, you know the rest is history... If that wasn't enough, my dad had total kidney failure. We managed to get him on disability, as he can't work anymore.
  
Oh did I mention that the money we borrowed had a variable interest rate? It didn't bother us at the time because we thought we would just refinance it in a few years before the rates went up. We tried to refinance but didn't qualify any longer. Good idea... until everything that could go wrong went wrong.

We tried to get a refinance due to the kidney failure as a hardship case and we were denied. 

We were trying to keep up with the payments, and did for a long time, but it has slowly bled us dry as we tried to figure out a way to refinance.

We still have equity in the house of between 200k and 400k. We also have a lawyer handling the mortgage company who told us we could stay here longer - but for an indefinite amount of time? Of course the payments of $5400 per month are adding up, not to mention interest and penalties. We are currently a year and a half behind on the mortgage payments. The rate was 6.75%.

Other than the delinquency on our mortgage, we have no other debt (thanks to this sub).  

Another issue we are having is with our Home Owners insurance. Never ever had any claims. Been a Client for 13 years. We always paid or bill. They had no issues taking our money full well knowing our property size, square footage and my fencing and everything else it entailed.  

We experienced last September 2017, the colossal category 5 Hurricane Irma, which did considerable damage to the house, considering a 23 year old roof and not to mention we are on acreage with over 1000 feet of fencing that is destroyed and heavy landscape debris removal, etc... 

We are currently going through the process with a public adjuster and a lawyer to remedy this and he sees us as having a good case for the money. There are no liens on the property as we're waiting for the money before starting a re-roof.

So our mortgage company has officially served us. We have a lawyer who is going through the process for us of responding to the suit.

We had a company contact us offering us cash for the property (I assume they found out as soon as the lawsuit was filed). After discussing it with these people, they shared with us the 3 options we have moving forward:

* Reinstatement if we managed to get a modification,
* Sell the house, pay off the mortgage company and take what we can,
* Take their cash offer.

He told us to do a couple things:

* Request a reinstatement of the mortgage so we understand what it would take to make the loan current,
* Request a Payoff to find out what the difference would be if we sold,
* And request for a modification again. (he said to just call them non-stop and keep trying)

Ideally, we would like to stay in the house - but we can't afford $5,400 a month. I do understand that the longer we wait, the more equity we lose on the property. We also understand that if we need to sell and move, that's what we have to do.

**TL;DR: We are behind on our mortgage due to family health issues and a variable loan and have not had any luck with a modification. What should we do?**

**My questions and concerns:**

* What would you suggest moving forward?
* What would be the best move for us financially?",finance

personalfinance,Sell my car?,"So here's the predicament:
I'm buying a new home (630k) and have around 10% to put down which would allow me for a 5+% interest rate. Talking to a lender I was told that they could do a 4.5% interest rate if I could put 15% down. After taking my car to Carmax to get an appraisal, I could get $38,000 for it, which would allow me to put 15% down. In the meantime, I could drive an older car that my parents own. PF, do you think it'd be wise to sell my car to put the extra 5% down? Or just do 10%, keep my car, but get a higher interest rate? Thanks in advance!",finance
personalfinance,Downturn in US markets?,"I'm curious if todays surge following bank stress tests is a dead cat bounce. Between increasing oil prices (impending reinstatement of sanctions on Iran), international trade war (first tariff goes into place beginning of August), tariffs against American allies, an increase in steel and aluminum prices, and slow fed interest rate hike are we looking at a perfect storm? Even if some of these expected announcements do not come to pass it seems like the fear alone may cause a massive sell off of stocks. 

Given that US bonds are also at an all time high, and if the above mentioned problems cause an increase in energy costs and an increase in national debt, it seems that traditionally lower risk investment strategies may not fully protect one's investments.

COD:    
    
Mike Myers.   
    
Border Patrol - team of snipers in a tower have to stop the team of unarmed runners from reaching a designated border.   
    
Cops &amp; Robbers - Cops with shotguns and riot shields have to hunt down and put robbers in a designated jail, robbers can only knife to kill the cops but can escape and distract guards for easy kills. Once all robbers are jailed, game is won or if all cops are killed.    
    
Red Dead, my fave customs games:     
     
Bear Cabin Boxing - Everyone aggros as many bears as possible and leads them to a low roofed cabin, everyone climbs up on the roof. Whilst the bears circle below, everyone boxes on the roof. Due to the rag doll mechanic, players often fall off the roof and get mauled by the awaiting bears, BUT a player might fall and avoid getting mauled, in which case it's fair game to try and climb back up onto the roof to continue fighting. Last man standing wins.     
     
Cougar Cabin - wait inside the cabin with melee and thrown weapons only, all run out at same time into the clearing occupied by pissed off cougars. No pvp, last man standing wins.",technology
personalfinance,[ADVICE]: Please critique my budget. I could use some help in prioritizing my emergency fund and outstanding debt over my retirement savings and saving for a house.,"Recently, I moved to the southwest in a relatively low COL market and have done my best to set up a realistic budget for myself. However, I have quite a bit of student loans outstanding and I need help deciding how to allocate my money amongst my 401(k), Roth IRA, emergency fund, saving for a house. My goal is to buy a house within the next 2-4 years. Lastly, I live with my fiance and we split the expenses at a 75% to 25% ratio. 

About me:
* 26 years old and obtained my masters degree last year

* Income $70k, relatively low COL area (NV), fiance makes $25k

* $600 in an old HSA from my previous employer

* $6k in savings (currently serves as my emergency fund--approximately 2 months of expenses in this fund)

* $6k in 401(k) with old employer (currently not contributing to this investment vehicle) 

* $500 in 401(k) with new employer (contributing 3%--my employer contributes 4% regardless of what I contribute)

* $400 in Roth IRA (Opened two months ago. I contribute $75 a month and buy ETFs, like SPYD).

* Student Loan Balance: $21.3k (at a 8% interest rate)

* Outstanding Car Loan on 2011 Elantra: $2.8K at 2.74% interest (I plan to pay this off by December instead of stretching it into next year)

* Outstanding Credit Card Debt (0% interest rate): $2.5k

* Our goal is to buy a home with worth, at most $275k. Since it's likely that I'll be the primary source of income in about four years (after marriage, first child, etc.), we're budgeting for a home that's no more than 4x of my current gross income even though I expect raises before we eventually buy. Through saving, the help of family, and grants, we hope to have enough for a 20% down payment.

Now that you have a little bit of background on me, here are my share of expenses I incur each month. I expect that this will be my monthly budget through at least June 2020 when my current lease expires.

**Obligatory Fixed Expenses:**

* Rent: $1,200

* Cell phone: $85

* Car Insurance: $150 (I've come to learn that car insurance is criminally overpriced in NV)

* Renters Insurance: $12

* Car Note: $282 (I pay $70.5 per week)

* Student Loan Payments: $465

* Minimum credit card payments: $100

**Obligatory Variable Expenses:**

* Groceries: ~$160

* Gasoline (car): ~$70 (I fill up twice a month)

* Utilities--Gas, Electricity, Water, Sewer, Trash, Internet: ~$350 (It's the summer time in the desert)

Total $2,874

**Discretionary Expenses**

* Restaurants/Alcohol/Bars: $150

* Barber: $25

* Subscriptions (Amazon, Netflix, etc.): $120

Total $295

**Savings**

* House: $100

* Car Maintenance: $50

* Contribution to Roth IRA: $75

Total $225

Paycheck Deductions:

* 401(k) $81 per paycheck (4% of gross pay contributed by employer)

* Health Insurance: $45 per paycheck 

* FSA contribution $20 per paycheck 

Total $146

SUMMARY:

* Monthly Take Home Pay: $4,600 (Note: I get paid every two weeks, so I took an average of my next six months of take home pay)

* Obligatory Expenses: $2,847

* Discretionary Expenses: $295

* Savings: $225

This leaves me $1,300 in left over funds at the end of each month (on average, as I receive three paychecks in one month a couple times a year). 

I was thinking of building up my emergency fund to account for 4 months worth of my obligatory expenses. However, I'm not sure what I should do thereafter. Should I increase the amount of payments I make on my outstanding debt or increase the amount I save for a down payment on a home?

Any insight on allocating my finances would be greatly appreciated!!!",finance

personalfinance,Need feedback about plan to reduce student loan,"I'm in need of perspective about a little plan I've come up with.

Here's my situation:
- Living in western USA
- 17k in student debt @ 6.2%, about 6 years left with current payments (total interest cost 3.4k)
- Car (paid off) worth about 19K (as recently valued by carmax): '14 WRX w/33k miles
- Credit score around 650-700
- About 3k spare to play with (on top of an emergency fund I don't want to touch)

What I'd like to do is significantly reduce or eliminate the student debt without hiking my monthly payments - either by lowering the interest rate, or paying off a big chunk. I'd also like to switch cars, as I'm not a fan of the one I have - it's a sports car with high insurance and running costs, and will enter the 'high maintenance' part of it's life soon.

My plan is as follows: sell the car, use the money to pay off the student loan, and take out another loan for a new (used) car (10-15k, at 4.5 - 5% for 3 years, for a total cost of $700 - 800 in interest). This would net me interest savings of about 2.6k. I would end up paying taxes + registration on the new car, which I estimate to be around 1 - 1.5k, so real savings would be about 1-1.5k (plus whatever I save on maintenance and insurance). And I'd be done with the debt in 3 years instead of 6. Also, I'm assuming I wouldn't be able to get a good deal trying to refinance the student loan. The new car would likely be a five to ten year old Lexus or Acura with 50k+ miles.

The Fed usually hikes rates too far, which causes a recession. This point is great in theory, but it only works if inflation is low because the Fed needs to be contractionary to quell heated inflation.

I'm 23, soon 24, year old male. I'm a software engineer. I've been working for a bit more than 3 years. My monthly income is $3250 minus taxes and health insurance so it's $2800. I've got no debt, no kids. I'm from Costa Rica, so $3250 per month is considerably above average. I'm extremely cautious when acquiring debt, so much that I don't have any. I have a credit card that I always pay on time and have never missed a payment in 2 years. 

I've got the opportunity to buy one from two houses in a nice neighborhood. The first is an apartment and costs $75k, the second one is a house and costs $85k. They both have two bedrooms and two bathrooms, it's actually a little big for myself. The monthly payment for the apartment is $660 and for the house is $720 plus the maintenance cuota for both of them ($120ish). I don't know yet the interest rates for the loan as I will know them tomorrow. 

Normally these houses cost around $100k-$120k because they are in a nice area with businesses (supermarket, drugstore, gym, etc) nearby, but lately the real estate business has been going down a little bit because people in my country are so full of debt that banks won't lend them to buy a house. 

I feel I might need to start with something smaller and cheaper, but these opportunities are hard to find. I am in a 5 year relationship with my girlfriend, she's almost finished with her degree in microbiology, so it's possible that we move together when she's economically independent, she may take some portion of the monthly payments.

I don't want to make a rushed decision, I don't own any property except for my car. I've been wanting to move out of my parents house for some time but I don't feel like ""wasting"" my money renting on something that will never be mine.

I think that if the monthly payments are too much I could rent the house for a couple of years until I'm set to go.

Chapter 13 BK, from 2013 to 2018, just discharged. Paid 150K over that time. Bad divorce, stupid debt, living outside my means. Changed habits, remarried, and doing well. Live in southern US. 

I make a good income (about 300-350K/yr); wife makes about 40K/yr. Rent a modest home (1250/mo), wife has 2 car notes in her name, one car is one payment away (more below), another is a lease with 10mo to go. About $500/mo each. She has made me an authorized user on several credit cards we use for purchases/points. We like to travel. Large limits, low balances. Pay all the bills on time. About 3K/mo in child support. Started working on 401Ks, about 200K now. 45yo. 

Just finished the BK. Credit scores are good 733 TransUnion, 738 Equifax. Applied for a Lowe's card in my name only, but got denied. Little surprised by that, but I guess since the ink wasn't dry on the BK and it was unsecured--they passed. 

The car with one more payment just got totaled. We'd like to buy a small crossover about 20K. We can pay cash, but I'd like to work on my credit. Wife can cosign.

financialindependence,Check-up: Not sure if I'll make it to the FIRE,"Hi all, 

I've lurked on this sub for a while and figured I'd come in for a general inspection, not unlike one of those 50 point auto checks. 

Anyways, here are the details and the juicy bits:

Male | Late 20s | about to be married | US cit. working abroad | just joined a new company for a 2-year contract

Assets
Car: 15k CPO car entirely paid for, but sitting in a garage in the states

Savings: 10k brokerage; 300k liquid (it's technically 220k at the moment, but I'm waiting for the 80k signing bonus to come through on the first paycheck)

Retirement: 11K vanguard (two years of uninvested ROTH IRA that I finally got to investing after a bit of goading from /PF); 10K trust from previous employer (It's passively managed, but I haven't looked at it for a year, so I'm not sure how that's doing)

Now, the job itself is pretty straightforward, but it requires extensive travel, grueling hours, and quite a bit of number crunching in excel, so perhaps you can guess what I do. I just joined the company this month, but I'm already having second thoughts and am considering going back to school for a masters or PhD. Thoughts on an MBA for FIRE? I am cuffed with a 60k penalty for quitting before the contract end; my employer is well-connected, so there might be serious potential ramifications if I pulled an up-and-leave maneuver, but I don't mind not coming back to this industry.  

Pay:
Base - 100K Base
Performance bonus - Up to 50% of base
Profit sharing - Up to 100% of base

I get nada for retirement, and the other fringe benefits are mediocre; the firms partners are firm believers of the theory of lump-sum revelation, which I guess I can't argue against too much, other than it might lead to wasteful tax situations.
 
Now, the problem is that I'm afraid that these next two years will just be busy work, and I won't be gaining any additional transferable skills. In other words, I'm afraid that I'm just wasting time for a moderate, but not guaranteed level of income. I'm also not sure what I'd want to do afterwards, which is why I'm considering going back to school. But if I do go back to school, then the penalty makes it more expensive (I'm budgeting 200k for school) and I feel like I'm just falling further behind on the journey to FIRE. The last option is entrepreneurship, which I know I can put in the time and effort, but I don't have any ideas on what to do; all of the work I've done requires large organizations and would be super capital-intensive to even get started.  

tl;dr: Feels like I've lost my way, and am just floating. I want to know how to stabilize my footing and get back on the path to FIRE.",finance

personalfinance,My bank forgot to add my upgrades into my mortgage and i had to pay cash one week before my possession date on my home (CAN),"I'm closing in on my possession date for my home next week. When I met with my lawyer I was expecting to pay my remaining down payment (15%) plus his fee and first month of property tax and condo fees which should have been roughly $40,000.  By his calculation I needed to pay $49,000.  After looking at the number puzzled for 10 minutes, I realized the upgrades I made were not added onto the mortgage as I requested. My last change was made July 2017. I sent all that paperwork to my mortgage broker at my bank. 


I called him up and went to see him immediately. First, he tried to blame the builder ( I had a lot of problems with my builder so naturally he thought I would get on his side). We reviewed the documents and it shows that we clearly marked the upgrades/changes should be added onto the mortgage. He says he can't add it now otherwise I lose my lower interest rate and we risk not being able to close the deal by July 6th, which would mean I incur the interest penalty. His other solution was to give me a LoC at their special deal of prime rate plus 2%...I declined. I paid cash to make sure the deal went through. 

On top of that, my builder required 8 posted dated cheques for condo fees. I don't have cheques, never used one in my adult life.  The bank would take a week to order them. I had no choice here again but to pay 8 months up from which amounted to $1050. I'm annoyed at this because I asked my lawyer two weeks earlier if he needed anything else from me. 

All that money I unexpectedly paid cash for one week prior to moving was suppose to be my emergency fund. Now I have about $5,000 left and still need to buy a few things here and there. I expect my monthly bills to be $2800 all together.  To be honest I am angry as hell and panicking a bit. This is my first time living on my own and I feel insecure.

personalfinance,Defaulted private student loans - PLEASE HELP,"I have a couple student loans issued to me directly from a university in texas (i'm assuming this means they are private student loans, as opposed to federal) that went into default back in 2014, totaling about $8,555. They loaned me this money because my federal financial aid hadn't come through yet. I haven't paid a single cent on it (that's another story) but i've been saving up money the past 4 years to pay it off in full, thereby allowing me to go back to school. I talked to the school and they've told me they ""assigned"" this debt to a debt collection agency and I can no longer go through the payment process with them. The debt collection company is called Williams &amp; Fudge, when I first went into default it was a different company, if that means anything. It used to be on my credit, but last year it fell off. I received a letter from Williams &amp; Fudge stating they ""represent the above creditor (SHSU) to collect the total amount owed."" Now, the debt totals to about $11,000 when I originally owed $8,555 (I guess this is interest accrued and not additional fees by the credit company?) I emailed them so they could prove the debt and they mailed me the entire loan contract from the school. Will I be able to negotiate with the debt collector and pay less than the amount owed? If so, what % of the debt should I offer to pay? Once I do pay, the school should then be able to release my transcript, allowing me to register to another school, right? Williams &amp; Fudge allows me to pay back the debt on their website, allowing me to do it in payments or pay in full. I haven't attempted to call the company as i'm not sure what my rights are, how to go about this, or what questions to ask. This is a lot of money and i've worked hard to save up all of it, so I want to make sure i'm going about this properly and am curious to know my options on how to relieve this debt paying as little as possible. My goal is to be back in school by next semester, so any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated!",finance
Bitcoin,German court rules negative interest rates on fiat retirement plans legal,"A retirement savings plan by a German bank promised positive returns, but allows them to add negative interest rates, which eats up the return.

investing,Federal tax receipts have plateaued,"Federal tax receipts [appear to have plateaued](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/W006RC1Q027SBEA) in a fashion very similar to 2001 and 2007. Total receipts show [a similar trend](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FGRECPT). The large drop in Q1 2018 seems to be mostly due to the changes in corporate tax rates, but the absence of growth since 2015 suggests broad based growth has ended. It will be very interesting to see if revenues recovered in Q2 and where the trend line is established by Q3.

Does anyone know when Q2 numbers are due?",finance
investing,"SO, what's the status (or the latest scuttlebutt) on the Federal Reserve's QE-unwinding program? Haven't heard anything good or bad.","After ramping up to purchasing $85Bn of bonds etc every month, they started ""non-renewing"" (meaning, not -selling- exactly, but not rolling over matured securities) $10Bn/mo for a quarter, then $20Bn/mo for 3 months, and so on up to $50Bn/mo in 4Q17 or 1Q18, not sure when.

This ""unwinding"" was praised by some, derided by many, and predicted to be an unmitigated disaster by a few pundits.

I haven't heard anything for the better part of a year.  Does this mean it **wasn't** a disaster?  Anything else notable about what happened / what's happening here?",finance
personalfinance,Is it wise to consolidate student loans?,"I am trying to figure out if consolidation is the way to go. I have loans ranging from 3.4&amp;#37; to 7.2&amp;#37; (effing Grad Plus loans). My average interest rates came out to around 6.22&amp;#37; (IIRC, that would be the interest rate if I consolidated?). To people who have consolidated - do you feel like you saved a significant amount of money in the long run? Or is it just a smokescreen/pipe dream?",finance
personalfinance,Panic while dropping out,"**Context:**

I am a High School graduate in desperate need of assistance. I was planning on going to college at the University of Houston when I suddenly got rejected from my major, I thought it to not be a big deal and decided to go with my backup major which the college didn't offer. Due to several different reasons I decided that It would cost too much money to just do prerequisites and some overlapping classes due to how the classes are structured and how the whole Exploratory Studies system worked and how much it was going to cost. I have no other interests in that college because the only classes I was going to take were only for honors college students, I am not one of those and I don't plan on it. This and many more slightly smaller but equally important reasons is why I decided to drop out and find another college possibly next semester or next year while trying to do some community college work on my free time.

**The Problem:**

I accepted financial aid, but in the withdrawal application it says 

"" I understand that if I withdraw from ALL classes I may owe financial aid back to the university based on federal regulations that require a refund calculation to determine the Federal Title IV Funds I earned. I understand that any future financial aid will be cancelled. I understand that **if I withdraw prior to the Official Reporting Day of a term, all state and institutional aid will be cancelled and I will owe this to the university.** I understand that withdrawing from classes **will impact my Satisfactory Academic Progress standing and may cause me to lose my future financial aid eligibility.** I understand that if I am receiving a university scholarship, I may lose scholarship eligibility.""

I'm really scared. Can they really do this if I was barely ""enrolled"" in my classes for less than a day and not even close to the first day of class? Will dropping out this early really affect my financial aid options in the future? Is there anything I can do? Will I have to pay all of the scholarship money to the university despite never using any of it?

Thank you for your help",finance

personalfinance,Should I allocate all excess loan payments to my highest-interest loan to save the most money?,"Hi everyone. I'm 23/M and just got finished my MS degree. I have ~32k in student loans to repay, and I am currently working a 77.5k salaried job. I have a handful of loans that range from 3.7-6% interest rates. My loan provider gives me the ability to choose how to allocate excess payments toward each loan. The default ""standard allocation"" just says it is ""fixed"" for each loan but doesn't give the numbers, so I imagine the excess amounts are either split evenly across all loans or proportionately based on the principal + balance. 

However, I'm also allowed to choose a custom allocation where I decide the percentage of the excess payments that go to each loan. My intuition tells me I should just have 100% of the excess go to my 6% loan until it's paid off, then put 100% to the next highest, etc. Does this sound like a good plan or am I missing something here? I am new to the work force and just now trying to really get my finances together so I figured I would ask for some help here.

Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Not entirely sure what to begin with,"Hi guys, I'm currently 20, living in NYC with my parents, and currently plan on staying at home for the next two years while studying at NYU. As such, my cost of living is fairly low, and I was wondering what i should be doing with my money. 
I currently work as a cashier at a small deli, and make around 500 every week, until school starts again, where I'll have to cut down my hours by alot. I currently have around 5000 in federal subsidized loans, so Im not incredibly worried about that yet. 
I just checked my credit, and its not great, around 650, and so I've been thinking about getting a credit card to start and try and improve my credit.
I'm open to any and all advice.",finance
