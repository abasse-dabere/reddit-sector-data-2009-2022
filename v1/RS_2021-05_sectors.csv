CryptoCurrency,New Argument Against Moons,"First off don’t like this post. I know there is a lot of hate on here about moon harvesting posts. First off, your investing in crypto why does anyone care about moons worth pennies while basically all crypto coins are gaining at a crazy rate? I recently shared a very personal story and trying to give sound advice. The common comments were I was trying to harvest moons. I don’t care about moons!!! I was trying to give advice to correct a serious issue I feel is common in this Reddit group which is getting friends and family to invest in crypto. Don’t like this post but this pisses me off cause good and helpful discussion is being snuffed out due to moons. It’s worth pennies people, crypto as a whole is the future, not stupid moons",cryptocurrency

stocks,Tax on high frequency trading. HFT,"What Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Stenny Hoyer and all the other Democrats need to put together is a tax on High frequency trading HFT instead of capital gains tax. 
They should not be going after the small investor or  the person who is putting money into their retirement accounts. Instead they need to go after the high frequency traders who are screwing the individual investor who does not have the opportunity to trade in and out of a stock multiple times a day or week.  The HFT trader is the guy who is also the short that is causing your stock to be ground into the dirt.  

I would not be objectionable to a One cent tax per share on all transactions.  As Elizabeth Warren kept saying. How about you millionaires and billionaires just giving us an extra .01 cent more in taxes.  
You can bet that the Democrat investor/backers would not be in favor of this because of what it would cost them. But to the average investor it would not cost anything other than to ensure that the stock market was better regulated.  The federal government could raise billions of dollars with this type of tax on the high frequency traders.",finance

CryptoCurrency,Investing in utility,"I've gotten a bit sick of all the posts complaining about the sub's meta. 

So rather than make a post doing the same and fall into a vicious trap of irony, let's discuss my investment strategy and how I arrived to it.

I'll then provide my reasons for investing in each of my holdings as well as some details on portfolio construction that might benefit newcomers. 

# Initial skepticism and investment philosophy 

For a while, I didn't think investing in cryptocurrencies to be prudent. That's because I was thinking about them as currencies. Why would a deflationary currency be good for an economy? It's commonly accepted among economists that deflationary currencies ruin economies. They ruin incentive to spend, which results in lower economic output.

I brought this opinion to a friend who actually works in defi. His counter was that I shouldn't be thinking of cyptos as currencies. Sure, some of them fit that use case, but most don't. He believed I should be thinking of them as assets, more specifically a piece of a new technology with wide ranging purposes. 

After thinking on that for a while and researching the space more, I decided I agree.

# Holdings and utility

**ETH**  

Probably a bit obvious why I chose to buy ETH given my recent comments, but I'll elaborate anyway.     Decentralized computation is an invaluable technology. 
It allows anyone to create what they want free of censorship and provides a low cost compute back bone. Most of defi is built on it and I only see that expanding into the future. Provided upcoming upgrades go well, I see ETH2 being worth at least usd 1 trillion by 2030.

Hopeful that eventually smart contracts can be utilized for much more, perhaps even web hosting.

**BTC**  

Bitcoin's only utility in my opinion is as a store of value, falling in-line with the opinions of the talking heads.

It also has the benefit of being the primary sink of normie liquidity. Once I have more time on my hands I'll likely build an old options strategy that I used to use into a trading bot targeted at bitcoin. So, I'm also building a stack for the purpose of having principal for that effort.

**XMR**  

This is the coin that I see as having the utility fitting a great currency of the future. Monero is anonymous and fungible: even more so than cash, which is stamped with black-listable serial numbers. If Milton Freidman were investing in crypto, I think this would be his choice.

If you are open to mining, please consider mining monero anywhere other than minexmr to help decentralize the network.

**COMP**  

Compound finance is brilliant. A freedom inducing liquidity pool with rates blowing modern banks out of the water is exactly what the federal reserve deserves. Borrowers' loans are overcollateralized, keeping risk for lenders low. Borrowing infrastructure such as this also provides a critical market service, allowing short sales and regulation of errant capital flows. 

**ADA**  

I picked this up as a pure hedge that ETH's developers don't solve their scaling issues. Provided that IOHK completes their implementation of smart contracts, ADA will have utility and potential for scaling.

# Portfolio construction and diversification 

Many of you will know this and many of you will not. Optimal diversification is not just 'buy many things and achieve less risk'. Optimal diversification also included picking assets with little correlation. A specific advantage this can give to an investor comfortable with making tactical moves is that when one of your assets is up and the other is down, you can sell some of the up to buy the down.

You can use the following web site to check your assets...

https://cryptowat.ch/correlations

Correlation is highly dependent on the time frame over which it's calculated. I suggest a time frame fitting with your investment horizon.

Even more important is picking assets with uncorrelated risk factors. Which is why if you are not, you **should** be investing in other asset classes than cryptocurrencies: as risk factors can be asset specific,  sector specific, and/or asset class specific.

# Appendix 

Other assets on my watchlist include:    

AAVE  - same as COMP

UNI  - because **centralized** exchanges reduce freedom

XTZ  - just scratching the surface looking into this

MATIC  - because you can never have too much scaling

LINK  - want to talk with developers to get their opinions first

I'll let you all try to form your own further opinions and hypotheses on those unpolluted with my judgement.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Extra payment to home mortgage - effects on amortization,"I'll be purchasing my first home later this year and while browsing on tiktok, and I know you shouldn't get financial advice from tiktok, but I came upon this video where a guy is giving this suggestion:

Let's say you plan to put 20% down for your home. You'd be better off buying the property with little to no money down (let's say 3% for this example) and on the second month, you pay the remaining 17% towards your principal and this would significantly decrease the interest you pay over the life of the loan due to how amortization schedules work.

I tried running some mathematical formulas but started overthinking it and got lost so now I have these questions. Assume I'm buying a house worth $292,565 @ 3% interest rate

1. Principal + interest monthly is $1,196.46 if you put 3% down ($8,776.95) and $986.77 if put down 20% ($58,513). The total interest over 30 years would be $146,938.22 and $121,186.16 respectively. Does the monthly payment expected by the lender stay the same every month or would this huge deposit decrease my monthly payments by a lot?
2. How much would that monthly payment become?
3. How much would be the total interest paid doing this method?

I tried running an amortization table on excel, but using the PMT formula, it runs a constant monthly payment and I'm not sure if this is right. I don't know how to incorporate that huge deposit and how it changes it everything.

Basically, I'm trying to see if by using that method, I'm able to lower the total interest paid over time AND decrease my monthly payments (currently based on my estimates, with 3% down, my monthly payment would be more than I'd like it to be)",finance

Are there plans to eventually reduce it?",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,"Fed tax owed from taxable income is slightly different value in TurboTax and H&amp;R Block than using 1040 instructions, even with zero tax credits. What am I missing?","Married filing jointly, trying to do it by hand again this year as I have in previous years to save some bucks and challenge myself. I typically use a few online services to double and triple check my math, and I'm usually spot on, but this time it really isn't adding up.

[Here's a screenshot of H&amp;R Block.](https://i.imgur.com/MKIPqym.png) Note the zero tax credits. I deliberately entered the bare minimum of deductions and no tax credits to try to narrow down the discrepancy.

When using the Tax Computation Worksheet on page 77 of the [2020 IRS 1040 instructions](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1040gi.pdf), a taxable income of $125,087 in Section B yields the following:

&gt;### $125,087 * 0.22 = $27,519 - $8,420 = **$19,099**

Several online fed tax calculators yield the same value.

###However, H&amp;R and TT both report my tax burden as **$19,066**.

What is the reason for that $33 difference? I can't find anything in our W-2s to account for it, and really none of the deductions should make a difference, since the my value for taxable income matches that of the 2 sites, and that value is, by definition, *after* deductions are applied. If the tax credits are reportedly zero, then it should be a straight marginal tax rate calculation using our taxable income, right?

Please let me know if I need to provide any extra information. At the moment, I'm at a loss, and am tempted to just take the lower refund. I doubt I'll cause a fuss by paying $33 more in taxes than I actually owe, but when 2 major players both come up with the same value independently, something's up.

Thanks!

**EDIT**: Answered! I had qualified dividends, so I was using the wrong calculator/worksheet to derive my taxed owed. I should have used the one on page 35 of the instructions. Thanks /u/tariqabjotu!",finance

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. Cardano is now being used as a traceability solution in conjunction with Scantrust for wine from the Nation State of Georgia. This is a great use case for the Cardano blockchain! [https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/cardano-reveals-its-first-supply-chain-solution-in-association-with-scantrust/ https://www.scantrust.com/](https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/cardano-reveals-its-first-supply-chain-solution-in-association-with-scantrust/)
2. The latest roadmap video from Charles covered a lot of ground. We’ll tackle it piece by piece. [https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM](https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM)
3. Ourobouros Omega. Ourobouros Classic 2016 was a “theoretical artifact” that IOHK could build upon. Ourobouros Praos was 2017 and it’s still running now. Ourobouros Genesis was 2018. Ourobouros Omega is going to be the capstone. It will be a rollup of all the previous iterations plus Redux, Chronos, Ledger Combiners, and some things they’ve learned from the larger industry. The paper and a prototype will be this year. We want to be there by Cardano 2025.
4. Light Clients/Wallets (e.g. Yoroi). Great way to get a view on the blockchain through a server. Trouble is that it’s not trustless as to the blockchain since you don’t download it. Protocols currently on the market like Mina are using recursive snarks (“zk-snark” = “Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge”). You can basically have a proof that proves 1) coins exist, and 2) haven’t been double spent with a goal of 22kb of data (very small amount of data). IOHK has been following Mina and “Bulletproofs” (also a type of snark). IOHK will bring out a paper and (hopefully) prototype of the Mithral Protocol this year. It will be a similar trustless model where light wallet is the default and you can still trust the blockchain on the server is correct without downloading the chain.
5. Today will be Part II of the coverage of the lates Roadmap vid from Charles. [https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM](https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM)
6. Sidechains. They call the main chain the “Cardano Settlement Layer” (CSL) and the side chains are called “Cardano Computation Layers” (CCL). They are looking at having CCLs for the EVM, IELE, Catalyst, and WASM (web assembly). They are trying to figure out how to pay for the maintenance of these side chains. A current thought is to possibly create a mechanism where you can “refine” ADA to get “fuel” for these sidechains. You could even have a Plutus side chain that runs on its own fuel. This year they will propose a Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP) to see if the community wants to update the monetary policy in an HFC event to go in this direction. This could be a good way to include the parachain ideas from Polkadot. They could also add Hyperledger related permissioned sidechains with this.
7. Layer Two. A lot of deal flow with Prism right now around digital identify for things like authenticated wallets, KYC/AML, regulated DeFi, and human readable addresses. Charles will probably do a full video on this. Hydra is the other piece of off-chain infrastructure for this year. IOHK has a whole team working on this. They’ve already put out two papers on this. Will put out two more papers this year and a prototype will also be on the way. Hydra will be run by the stake pool operators.
8. “With all this, we’re going to piss all over what ETH 2.0 is trying to accomplish”. I’m paraphrasing slightly, but I almost spit out my coffee when he said this.
9. Quantum Resistance. This will be a big project involving: QR VRF, QR zero knowledge stuff, quantum signatures, and modeling of a quantum adversary. This is a huge amount of work. But this is a whole agenda that is in scope for Cardano 2025.
10. Catalyst &amp; Voltaire. Right now Catalyst is mainly about treasury but it needs to be linked to Voltaire which is all about protocol updates. This will probably mean a bicameral voting model that controls hard fork combinator events.There will be DAO as a service to provide voting rights for your users if you build a dApp or other project on Cardano. They will move from the current plutocracy to something that is hybridized between the current system and “proof of merit”. This is going to require a lot of thinking around the social science behind governance. It will be a more nuanced power dynamic.
11. Approach to the Reference Client.Right now it’s just Haskell, they will probably also build out clients in Python and Rust. Eventually they may have things like Agda, Idris, or Coq at the core. This notion of a “Core Developer” could end up being a digital identity that is authorized through voting.
12. Commercial. On the commercial side they are really going to scale things up to the eight figure level. There’s a lot of good news coming there. Charles says he is reserving that for the Africa Special.

49. We just experienced a big flash crash in price. A prime suspect is the drop in hash rate in BTC due to the Blackouts in China. Is the crypto space ready to accept that Nakamoto style consensus on PoW leads directly to unacceptable levels of centralization? This has been the dirty secret of PoW crypto and its decentralization loving enthusiasts for years.

Omega is a capstone rollup of Praos (2017), Genesis (2018), + Redux, +Chronos, +Ledger Combiners, +some other things from the rest of the space. Hydra is layer two. Mithral is trustless light wallets via zk-SNARKs. Guesses as to the “GG” ranged from “Good Game” (as in game over for competitors) to “Goguen”.

57. Shahaf Bar-Geffen, CEO of COTI (the first recipient of a Cardano CFund investment), says he just finished recording his segment in the Africa special which he mentioned was airing at the end of April prior to the IOHK announcement of April 29th. He also said: 1) ADA Pay may be ready in early May or maybe even late April; 2) there will be a big launch for ADA Pay and once the Africa Special airs “everything will connect”; 3) “people are probably not getting how big this is….but you will down the line”; 4) COTI integration with a major exchange is happening, progress is not as quick as they would like, but it’s progressing; 5) last week they released the possible designs for debit cards, they are even considering some designs submitted by the community; 6) and iOS and Android integration is coming along nicely and well on the way.

61. Recap from yesterday: the Africa Special Announcements revealed some additional puzzle pieces 1) COTI’s AdaPay is possibly the larger payments infrastructure puzzle piece, 2) [payway.et](https://payway.et/) is possibly the local payments puzzle piece, 3) [yellowcard.io](https://yellowcard.io/) is possibly the local coin exchange puzzle piece, and 4) World Mobile (not mentioned at [africa.cardano.org](https://africa.cardano.org/) AFAIK) may be the network connectivity puzzle piece. I think they are going to connect a lot of disparate pieces for us on the 29th.

63. Rick interviewed CardStarter which is a Cardano accelerator. The interesting items are 1) it appears they are purporting to somehow insure their community backers against certain financial losses with caveats, 2) they plan to fund projects prior to token launch through token vouchers, and 3) it sounds like they are building a DEX called Card Swap. Notice that the “insurance” comes with caveats. They were very transparent on that point and people should take notice. Is CardStarter good? Is it bad? I have no idea.

76. Charles does a big interview with Forbes and points out the huge differences between a bonded staking system (ETH) and a liquid staking system (Cardano). This is highly overlooked.

77. Charles also covers his projections about interoperability and the future converging on a “wifi moment” when an interoperable “internet of blockchains” emerges. In this future, it will be a race to the bottom and the systems that are too expensive to operate will simply be priced out of the game.

83. In today’s video we also cover questions about the relationship between Atala Prism and ADA and who will actually benefit from the Cardano Projects with African governments.
84. The Africa Special made it clear that Cardano has a brilliant grand strategy for the developing world. As framed by John O’Connor this would be:  1) provide digital identity; 2) provide digital transfer of value; and 3) provide programmability of that digital value.
85. Mickey Watkins (CEO of World Mobile) added a step zero to the formula above with: 0) provide access to the digital world.
86. As has previously been mentioned, it was officially announced that Cardano is partnered with World Mobile to provide digital connectivity to people in the developing world starting in Tanzania.  They plan to have 100k subscribers in Zanzibar by the end of the year.
87. This is just the beginning in Africa.  John O’Connor had a nice tweet that very succinctly laid out some future plans. [https://twitter.com/jjtoconnor/status/1387919060197855234](https://twitter.com/jjtoconnor/status/1387919060197855234)

CryptoCurrency,Unpopular opinion: decentralisation is not a required feature of blockchains,"**tl;dr** Claiming that a blockchain is bad because it is centralised is stupid. Decentralisation is a scale ; nothing is 100% decentralised, and decentralisation is not needed in the majority of use-cases. Blockchain can still be useful when it is centralised.

When people compare blockchains, the discussion is sometimes cut with “but it is centralised “. 
And indeed, there are many blockchains which are quite centralised, e.g. BSC (Binance smart chain). 

However, I don’t see decentralisation as a “no go” feature:

- first of all, the literal definition of blockchain is “chain of blocks (which can be verified)”.
- **blockchain technology still offers advantages in a centralised chain**, such as transparency of transaction and ability to verify the program executed. For instance, I can verify that, in this casino, the chance to win is indeed 1/N for this game. 
- any project needs a form of centralisation to get started. 
- real life is not decentralised, but rather federated. People trust more their friends and family than strangers.
- even on a mature project, I think that decentralisation is harmful for the evolution of the project. In real life, societies and companies are not governed by decentralised organisations. Most societies have represented democracies, and companies have board of directions. And asking a crowd without expertise to take decisions is very inefficient. 
- Many use-cases don't need decentralisation, since they rely in the end on a central actor to provide a service. 
- For currencies, it makes sense to have a central bank that adjusts the monetary supply to the economic growth. 
  - a max fixed supply necessary leads to deflation. Bitcoin is a good example of hyperdeflation. 
  - a percentage supply is more likely to be usable for a currency. But I have not seen a currency that adapts this rate depending on number of transactions or active wallets. 

Last but not least, many decentralised consensus algorithms have incentives which naturally lead to centralisation. The PoW consensus requires investment in compute power, and Bitcoin 4 largest mining pools have more than 50% of the hash rate. And delegated proof of stake obviously concentrates the staking in a few validators which tends to become an oligarchy, as Tron or EOS have shown.

The bottom line is that I see centralisation like a scale ; nothing is 100% decentralised. In fact, I'm not sure there is even a metric to measure centralisation (happy to learn more about that). 
Repeating that ""something is shit because it's not decentralised"" is a shitty argument when the use-case doesn't require decentralisation.",cryptocurrency

Trading,"Treat all instruments as pairs (e.g. TSLA&lt;-&gt;USD, ala currency pairs), right?","So, bear with me on this – I might be talking complete garbage, or not… …and really I’m not sure where best to post this (maybe r/algotrading, but its not really about algos)...  ....I’m not really sure where would be the best fit, so here goes!

(also I have literally no training/qualification in finance nor economics, trading is just a hobby for me – so if this is Economics 101 please be gentle 😉)

Here goes…

So, when looking at stock we typically look at its price and speculate on what the price may be in the future when deciding to open a position. And in this process we consider the asset (say CCL, Carnival Cruises, for example) and its future prospects in thinking about where price is and where price may go. This is normal-ish trading, although obviously I’m grossly oversimplifying.

Conversely, in forex, we might look at GBPUSD, and we consider fundamentals both for GBP and for USD. I.e. for GBPUSD to go “up” this may be cause by either something that increases the value of GBP or something that decreases the value of USD. We are trading a ratio; the relative value of two fluctuating assets.

But actually aren’t \*all\* instruments really conceptually a ratio between the relative value of two assets (two stores of value).

I.e. stock is the same; CCL isn’t just CCL, it could be better thought of as “CCLUSD” and things that would affect price can be things that affect the value of CCL, \*and\* things that affect the value of USD.

In this way we would consider assets to have an intrinsic value; whether that asset is a corporation, or a commodity or a currency (as a representation of the nation state that backs it), or anything else.

Instruments are an exchange rate between a pair of those assets.

More directly; we can only quantify the value of an asset by expressing it through an instrument; value is not absolute, value is only expressable relative to other assets.

So coming back to actual trading…

…trading is “just” a mechanism for converting value from one form to another (cash-&gt;stock-&gt;crypto-&gt;etc).

…the bull run we’ve all been in the last year or so isn’t just about stock appreciating, it’s also about a reducing value of USD (because the Fed keep printing money, so there’s more of it and therefore each unit of money ($1) is worth less).

…red/green days in the stock market is also about perceived value of the currency, not just peoples’ propensity to store their wealth in stock (or not). (?)

…all of this may be more useful in non-US instruments, just because USD is so massive there’s likely not anywhere near as much volatility as there would be in a smaller currency.

Therefore to inform a trading system and be more predictive of price direction we should be inclusive of all of the things; modelled as a directed graph where each node is an asset (USD, CCL, BTC, whatever) and each edge is an instrument.

And so, a more effective trading system will be one that includes all of the things, rather than being “stock only” or “fx only”. By all the things I also mean bonds, warrants, commodities, futures, etc too of course.

Then, by looking at fundamentals/catalysts that may affect the intrinsic value of each asset (e.g. CCL affected by no-sail orders, USD affected by quantitative easing, GBP affected by Brexit, BTC affected by new regulations, whatever) we can be more predictive about changes in the value ratio (price!) of any given instrument.

Why? Because people with lots of money (institutions) want that money to grow, so they will move it around to places to give it the best chances of growing. That may be in stock, or bonds, or cash, or internationally, or all of the things. It doesn’t seem to make sense to look at only one kind of asset in isolation.

So, I’m not articulating any of this particularly clearly – but this post isn’t really intended to try to explain a fully fleshed model, I’m really asking if it’s a useful direction… …given that this kind of thing doesn’t really seem to be talked about nor explained anywhere at all that I’ve found on the internet, on Reddit, on other forums, in books, anywhere.

I figure the answer has to be one of…

a) This is just Economics 101, I should go read more books

b) It’s all garbage, I should stop smoking that stuff, go outside and give myself a stern talking to

c) Yup its real, but there’s nothing interesting there to inform trade decisions so forget about it

d) Yup its real, but \*using it\* is next level hardcore shizzle that retail don’t really get concerned with, which is why nobody talks about it.

I can work it out empirically of course – and I’m in the process of doing so – but it’s a lot of data and a lot of work (something like \~20-30m rows/day in the way I’m currently approaching it). I feel like there should be something useful in there – even if it just increases predictability of red/green days in stock, helps spot rotations into different asset classes or just makes it easier for me to be diversified across different asset classes to (hopefully) make it easier to profit in different market conditions.

So, assuming its not A or B, any pointers (or not-yet-obvious-to-me dead-ends to avoid) would be awesome?

Hi guys, I got involved in a local project that helps stray dogs and cats found on street and rescues animals abused by their owners.

It is a small and local project on my city, in Brazil, with current prices I believe DOGE can really make a difference **to help with veterinary and food costs**. The rescued pets are fed and treated until they are adopted by other families.

This is a legit project, you can check it out on instagram: [https://www.instagram.com/projeto.meldeesperanca](https://www.instagram.com/projeto.meldeesperanca/)

We are off course willing to provide any proof that the community finds necessary, please ask and I will look into it.

I am looking for options on how to collect DOGE and fund them directly.

If you are a miner, I would ask to use a referral code on unMineable: **2g4k-5sy1**If you wish to donate, here is the wallet address: **DKpkAoKcQCAScrqvjYGnGDWdspf75Z4BGx**

If you can't do any of those, a simple upvote here is enough help to raise awareness.

I am very new to this so if there are any other options please share, all suggestions and ideas are welcome.

stocks,Let's talk Lumber Gang! Bullish on $BCC and $LPX. Bearish on Home Builders.,"First DD about something I'm familiar with.

I am currently in FAANG tickers plus MSFT. Earnings were good but the stock is either not moving, or went up and came back down. I’m planning to sell everything I’m green in and move the majority over to something that has been killing it which is lumber. It can add some more variety to this sub.

My husband is in the industry (his company is not publicly traded) and things have been good and bad. It’s been good because people have been paying ridiculous prices for houses. Combine that with the building material shortage and he has been able to raise his profit margins. Very nice commission checks coming home.

It’s bad because there is not enough lumber for everyone and he’s been having hard conversations with builders who don’t get that they will have to slow down because product is running out.

Here are how lumber futures have been doing.

5 Day – 9.45%

1 Month – 48.41%

3 Month – 69.36%

YTD – 72.15%

1 Year – 359.39%

If anyone knows how to invest in futures without receiving actual product I would love to know. Don’t want to be that guy that got a bunch of oil delivered to him.

With how things are going we are going to continue to see a rise in lumber for at least through the summer. The biggest problem is obtaining Engineered Wood Products (EWP) and OSB. Home Depot has quadrupled the price of OSB over the past year. There is also a resin shortage that is needed to make these products. Timber is cheap but the bottleneck is sawmills. Either they have reduced capacity due to covid or they are switching business to OSB because it is more profitable.

I’m looking at companies such as $BCC (38% last 3 months), $WY (23% last 3 months), $LPX (71% last 3 months). They have had great runs and are currently in a dip from the last few days. (Hopefully a dip and not the top).

First companies that will be screwed sooner than later will most likely be home builders. They will soon realize they have been building houses for free and will get hit first. They try to hit a 35% profit margin. That margin is eroding by rising costs but they are under contract. Contracts last about 6 months. So expect their profits to go down. Unless they have been really good at guessing lumber futures and buying appropriately.

Home builders have been hitting highs and could be shorted or have puts placed on them. Just look at the top 10 list of publicly traded developer stocks. Be careful with timing. They’ve had big jumps this last week.

Bear case: The fed could finally raise interest rates which would decrease demand and let supply catch up. More investment can go into building out saw mills. Builders can get creative and use different materials. This is where steel gang can benefit. Supply could eventually catch up but it may take some time. This is a several month play for now.

Current position is shares in $BCC. I've seen nice steady rise over the last few months.

TLDR: Lumber has been on a great run and is getting more scarce. Buy lumber tickers such as $BCC, $WY and $LPX and puts on big home developers. Mid term play.",finance

personalfinance,Mothers Retirement,"My father passed away and we finally got his investment portfolio rolled over. He’s got about 2.5 million with about 85% Apple stock and the rest spread around to various mutual funds. My mother is 65 and has no plans to work, so this will fund the rest of her life.

My fathers financial advisor had told her to keep it as is, but I have a hard time believing that’s smart. Makes sense to me to sell apple and move those funds into a less risky, interest bearing fund. Or heck even a high interest rate savings account that can guarantee preservation of funds.

Am I off base here? Appreciate any info.

personalfinance,Should I find a financial advisor/planner/tax professional?,"I’ve always managed my finances myself. I have a decent understanding of basic finance because of my job, but as things get a little more complex I’m worried I’ll overlook something and make a mistake!

Here is a little detail on why I’m considering a financial advisor/planner/tax professional:
- $125k salary + bonus that varies, target is 15% (I’m single, 26F)
- I’m considered a “highly compensated employee” which means I’m limited in what I can contribute to my retirement account at work. I am capped at 8% and I currently do 4% pre- and 4% post-tax. This definitely stresses me out as I’d like to save much more than 8%
- my company has a PSP with a target of 5% each year (I get this regardless of what I contribute)
- my company also has a pension (1% of final avg salary)
- last year (somewhat impulsively) I opened an IRA because I was worried I wasn’t saving enough for retirement
- when I turned 26, I got off my parents health insurance and opened an HSA that I am maxing out and not spending (I’m about to have enough to start investing)
- this year I bought a house and am currently paying PMI (not sure if/when I want to pay early to get that removed, since my interest rate is only 3%)
- when I bought the house I dipped into savings a bit more than I would have liked (who knew furniture was SO expensive??) so now I have about $10k left, my comfortable emergency fund is more like $30k

I’m at a point where I feel like I might start investing in non-tax advantaged accounts, but I’m starting to feel in over my head! Should I find a professional to help?",finance

CryptoCurrency,Citibank says Bitcoin may be optimally positioned to become the preferred currency for global trade,"In March, Citibank (top 4 US bank) published a report on Bitcoin, called Bitcoin: At the Tipping Point. It is an extensive 108 page report that examines Bitcoin in detail and alleges that it is currently at a tipping point and we could be at the start of massive transformation of cryptocurrency into the mainstream.

According to Citibank, Bitcoin is in prime position to become the currency of choice for international trade, because it is immune from both fiscal and monetary policy, avoids the need for cross-border foreign exchange (FX) transactions, enables near instantaneous payments, and eliminates concerns about defaults or cancellations.

They also envision a system where individuals and businesses would have digital wallets holding a variety of cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and CBDCs just like they today have checking, savings, and treasury accounts. Connectivity between the traditional fiat currency economy, public cryptocurrency networks, and private stablecoin communities would become fully enabled.

Since we've all been hearing so much about how Bitcoin is not a currency but a store of value, it is very interesting that a top level bank would envision it as a currency for global trade.

personalfinance,Pay off debt or save for a house?,"I'm a 25M that according to my amortization spreadsheet will finish paying off my private student loans in 2021 from my mechanical engineering degree. I'm trying to start planning what my finances will look like in 2022 after paying this off. Unfortunately I still have about 20k in federal loans. Here's my current breakdown for how I spend my take home pay:

Monthly income: 3362

Expenses

Rent 853

food+gas 400 (100 per week between them)

utilities+dog meds 150

private loan( 7% interest) 1750

renters insurance 10

phone bill 75

Before the federal loan forbearance my payment towards my monthly federal loan was $285. Right now I just added that on to my private loan payment to pay it off faster because of the interest rate. The interest rate for the federal loan ranges from 3.76% to 4.66% for the different loan groups. Also I'm splitting the cost for dog meds with my sibling even though the dog lives with my parents. The other thing that may look odd is currently I don't save monthly for my car insurance, I'm just going to take it from a extra paycheck in July caused by a biweekly pay schedule( I get 3 paychecks in July).

After paying off my private loan my expenses in 2022 are forecasted to look closer to this:

Monthly income about $3323 after contributing 6% instead of 5% to my 401k. I got a salary increase of 6% last year and was told to expect close to another 6% going into 2022.

Rent 847

utilities +dog meds 150

groceries 340 (85/week)

gas 120 (30/week)

phone 75

federal loan 285

HSA 180 (135 per paycheck but tax advantaged so I only count as $90/paycheck)

Roth IRA 500

house savings 400

misc/general savings 300

car insurance/renters 110

I'm wanting to get my emergency fund back up to 10k from about 7.5k right now. I have a older car (early 2000s Camry) so I expect I'll have some unexpected maintenance costs for upkeep. I'm planning to max out my roth and HSA accounts for retirement. I'm wanting to relax my budgeting a little bit after cutting it tight for the last 3 years to still have some fun times in my 20s. I doubt I'll actually spend $300/month in misc but this will accumulate to go towards going snowboarding, hiking etc.  with my friends and some other reasonable purchases I've been putting off.

My main question is should I start saving for a house in 2022 or put that $400/month towards the  federal loan? The interest of the loan seems to be low enough that most of each payment goes towards principal. Just paying the minimum my payoff date should be sometime in 2028. With $400 a  month extra my payoff date would be August 2024. That assumes no other additional  payments from my yearly bonus or extra two paychecks from the biweekly pay schedule. Most likely I'm going to throw some additional money  towards it occasionally depending on other needs. I think I'll be in a  good position financially next year but feel like I need some more  planning for having so much of my income freed up from paying off the private loan.

I have tried calling them multiple times and was only able to get through to a real person on one occasion, the one person I did speak to said she sees the deposit but was unable to tell me what it was for, only that it was sent from the IRS and that I *may* receive a letter at some point confirming the deposit. 

What should I do here? I haven’t touched the money as I assume it’s a mistake on their end, but I also can’t confirm that I need to return it or how I would even go about returning it. Hoping someone that’s a little more tax savvy can point me in the right direction.

stocks,Should I be concerned my brokerage turned my ETF holding into a short position?,"Long story short (no pun intended) back in January I decided to open a Roth IRA account and I invested $12k into a clean energy ETF. After seeing the ETF decline in value to $11k, I transferred the Roth IRA account to a new brokerage &amp; sold the ETF position, now converted into a mutual fund. I then bought xx shares of GME during the recent dip to $160. However, the day after GME opened at $150 before shooting up to $185 after hours, I was shocked to get margin called by the new brokerage 

The brokerage informed me, ""The recent purchase of securities in your account has created a cash call. If this call is not met within the time required by Regulation T, per Federal Reserve Board, portions of your portfolio may be sold to cover this cash call."" Reluctantly and without immediately reaching out to the brokerage for further clarification, I sold my GME shares that same day at $177 for over $1k profit (bringing my account back above $12k for the first time).

What happened next was even more surprising! I let $12.3k cash settle for the T+2 settlement period and assumed that I had been margin called because somehow the initial purchase of GME interfered with the settling of money from my sale of the mutual fund. Instead, after 2 days the mutual fund showed up again in my account as a short position! Now, I believe what happened is the brokerage bought the mutual fund position from me ""on loan"" instead of simply selling it. In one sense this seems to be great because now my account has roughly doubled in value to nearly $24k with the mutual fund short position showing up as a positive asset.

On the other hand, I still want to own xx shares of my favorite stock without risk of being margin called if GME drops in price again due to its inherent volatitlity. So really what I'm wondering is:

* Was the margin call a one-time-only occurrence while my brokerage was setting up the short position in my account, or can it happen again if the value of my stock holdings declines beneath the value of the mutual fund?
* Can I sell the (now $11.5k) mutual fund short position itself for an equivalent amount of cash?
* Why would they even do this to me instead of just seling the mutual fund flat out?
* What happens if I try to transfer the account again to another new brokerage? Would the short mutual fund position get transferred too, or would it have to be unshorted by my current brokerage before I transfer the other stocks and/or cash I hold in the account? 
* Ultimately, does having the short position held in this account as an ""asset"" a positive incentive to stay with this broker, or does it create a crazy ridiculous amount of risk of getting margin called &amp; having to potentially put forward extra cash to cover if my stocks decline rather than agreeing to sell at a loss? (I got super lucky this time!)

I'll probably call the brokerage on Monday for answers but meanwhile it would be great if anyone who has experienced and/or has knowledge about this kind of situation could give me a better idea about what sort of unicorn or beast I might be dealing with! 

Thanks in advance,

gaming,"LF A multiplayer, NON TOXIC yet social game","So I said I quit online gaming. Several times. Over and over, and I keep going back.

Truth is, the best games I've ever played were SP games, BUT SP games need a certain amount of focus. Following a plot, the way the game is changing, which is actually wonderful and I really like it, but...

That's not what I always need. Sometimes I want to sit back, pop a few mindless headshots, or do some mundane grinding, while having random interactions with the people I encounter, be that in an MMO or a competitive game. I don't always need an epic story and grand new locations - I'm an addict for progress bars and small talk with strangers.

But in my 30s, I'm tired. My reflexes are not what they used to be, so I can't really be good in most of the content. And people hate that, and I get kicked out of parties, or generally suck on the FPS scene. Now I'm not some 89 year old who can barely move his mouse, but it takes a lot out of me. 2 rounds I'm top in my game, then 4 rounds my mind dazes off to relax a bit, because it just takes so much out of me. And also, I don't have 8 hours per day to just refine some ""skills"", and I wouldn't want to even if I did...

But the big, big No-No. Toxicity. I can fill progress bars in so many single player games if I wanted to, but the social gaming stuff is the real deal for me. And the toxicity ruins it. I guess I didn't mind when I was younger; though I never recall ""I'm gonna f\*\*\*\* your mom"" over any game, even when I was 13ish. I was immune to it so many years, but maybe because I'm a dad myself, or because i'm just older and don't have the patience for that shit, or I actually see the harm in it and shake my head in disgust. Or maybe I'm just fed up with it. The COVID situation has limited our social connections to 0, and if the only people I talk to online are angry, I get very depressed.

I still like FPSes, but I'd rather they are strategy &amp; tactics heavy, not based on twitch reflexes as much. Best of all - if it's PVE I guess, though I always loved PVP when I was younger. Guess I need to adapt. I don't expect a non-toxic PVP game, unless all comms are blocked (lol). But besides FPSes, any other genre could work. I'm curious. I have played MMORPGs, ARPGs as online games, curious what else is out there.

Once or twice, I was curious to try some roleplaying servers on NWN too, but I always feel like I'm gonna goof up.

In short, while I still have relatively good reflexes, they take a lot out of me and I can't keep up. I've been into the competitive games ... all my life, and I can't really take the toxicity anymore. Looking for something better, different.",technology
CryptoCurrency,"Crypto is sneaking up on the dollar, and institutional money doesn’t know how to react.","As a preface I am very pro-crypto and anti-institutional or ‘centralized’ money, and my warning towards the fed is more so a shock that they really don’t seem to see what’s coming. It’s good for us crypto enthusiasts but impressive that they are failing to understand what crypto means to the dollar and the institutions relying on it.

I am reacting a bit to seeing Jerome Powell’s (who I respect and believe is a smart guy with smart people working for him) brief comments on crypto in recent weeks. He hasn’t said much, but the impression I consistently get from the fed is that they have no idea how threatening crypto really is to them, and how being unregulatable is intrinsic to crypto’s design.

Imagine some eccentric business or entrepreneur invents the next high demand good or service. It’s going to be like the hottest Christmas present of the year or something and everyone and their mom wants one. Imagine the product is finally ready to launch, everyone is hyped, and the market says “We love it! How much is it? How many dollars?”. Imagine if the creator of this high demand good or service says ‘we don’t take dollars, we only take crypto….’

Now I realize this is simplistic because crypto is readily exchangeable for dollars, and in a vacuum, an instance like this isn’t much more than a bizarre moment and probably a bad business decision. But if a trend like this were to take on speed, there could be entire emerging markets for cutting edge high demand goods and services that reject the dollar entirely, and from there it’s a stepping stone to making taxes and many financial laws unenforceable. What can the fed realistically do? They can’t track transaction histories, they can’t freeze or garnish your wallet, and they can’t control the supply or do any of manipulative techniques a central bank would utilize, because crypto was designed to be a challenge to their power from the beginning.

I’m excited about the future of crypto and how this may only be the very beginnings of it’s rise in value. But even though I don’t like the fed at all, I am worried that their perceived lack of awareness on how threatening crypto really is, is going to fuck a lot of people over (all over the world really) who are heavily banking on the dollar being stable and unchallenged. And the global economy will then be damaged massively before a better decentralized financial world emerges as the new norm. Without getting too political, it shouldn’t surprise anyone that the government entering a new era in borrowing is only helping make this potential catastrophe worse. People on both sides of the isle are starting to question whether either political party or agenda can be trusted with the printing press.

Many of us are fantasizing about how many dollars our crypto ‘investments’ will be worth in the future. Such a dollar-centric perspective may be unhelpful. Perhaps in the future, we won’t be saying ‘look how may dollars I made off crypto’…

Biden calls for even more stimulus, but it’s doubtful all of it will make it through the Senate. Meanwhile, the parameters for Gold  and silver  remain the same. Resistance is at 1800 and support is at 1740-50. 25,60 silver 
Yields are rising again
Real yields are flat to lower recently, supporting Gold’s move off its lows. While Powell says rising inflation is temporary, all evidence is to the contrary. While yields cannot be allowed to get out of hand and risk the collapse of everything, inflation will continue to rise as the printing presses remain plugged in and supply chains break down. This is the foundation for the coming surge in precious metals. I don’t see the 30-Year T-Bond going beyond the 2.75-3.00% resistance zone.

personalfinance,At what point does locking in a low interest rate and buying real estate be better financially than living with my parents and saving money for later?,"I make a bit less than 6 figures right now and have about $25k in savings, most of which I built
up since October and was unemployed before that for a while, plus a little in investments. I get along with my parents pretty well and have lots of room in their house for myself, but admittedly being a 30-year-old woman living with my mom and dad feels like a bit of a drag sometimes. However, since I work from home full time and my company has no office in my area to reopen, I have no specific place that I need to be kills my motivation to move out. This is a HCOL area with lower than normal rents now due to the pandemic, but generally its expensive to live here.  

Since I only pay my parents $300/mo to help with expenses, I have my 401k contributions maxed right now and am opening a Roth IRA at fidelity to catch up to my modest retirement funds balance. I was also thinking of opening a small brokerage account for conservative investing to beat out the interest I’d get in my HYSA and match inflation so I can withdraw it later if need be. Sounds good, right? 

But I don’t know how much this actually gets me ahead vs. buying property in an area where home values go up 10-20% annually.

I know the answer is “don’t FOMO into buying a home”, but realistically, how much better is it financially to keep doing what I’ve been doing? For how long should I do it? Some friends tell me forever, but those guys are kinda deadbeats (lol)

Oh, and I should add I have zero debts or financial obligations besides minor bills like my cell phone plan.",finance

Bitcoin,Talk me out of (or into) doing a VA Cash Out on my mortgage and putting into BTC,"I have a VA mortgage.

VA has a program called Cash Out which allows you to Cash Out 100% of the value of your home (minus what you owe).  This is a pretty remarkable concept, as typically the best you can do on a traditional loan is 80%.  Fee is about 2.5% of the total loan.

VA Interest rates are about 2.6% or so right now (30 year)

I owe about 13 years on my mortgage.

Market is at All Time High (Housing Market) and I believe its going to correct/go down, it has too, but right now I can basically pull a substantial amount of equity into cash at a very low rate.  My mortgage payment would actually reduce.

Thought is, pull out a nice huge sum of money, invest in crypto, continue to pay mortgage and profit huge on the gains over time (5y, 10y, 20y, 30y).  I could even choose to sell at some point some of my position and just pay off the loan (If I would have done this earlier this year, I would already have enough in just ""months"" to pay off the entire loan, and own my house outright).

I plan to do this.  I am looking for agreeing or opposing viewpoints to make sure I have done all the critical thinking that needs to be done here.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,"Immediately Repaying off an Entire Student Loan, Good Idea?","I just graduated with about the average U.S. student loan debt, a combo of three private loans via Sallie Mae and both subsidized and unsubsidized federal loans (two of each). I'm going to be deferring the loan repayments for a year because I'll be doing a fellowship abroad, but I plan on continuing to pay interest for all of the private and federal loans while completing the fellowship. 

One of my Sallie Mae loans is about $4,900, the smallest of my private loans (I'm trying to go for the snowball method). I have enough money to pay that off immediately with enough money left over to continue paying interest on all of the loans throughout the year of my fellowship (I won't really have much disposable income coming in). 

If I do this, I won't have a bunch of money left over when I return to the U.S., but I have a sure place to live with my parents while I find a job, etc. 

Will Sallie Mae even allow me to do this before my grace period ends (my grace period ends June 20th, fellowship begins not even a full week later)? I can't find anything about that anywhere, but I know I would probably need to do this BEFORE the end of my grace period, because I should probably begin the deferral process a few weeks before my grace period does end, and I'm pretty sure I can't pay off a whole loan while I'm deferring loan repayment. 

Also, is this even a good idea, like credit wise? I have good, almost very good, credit at the moment, so I think I can take the hit, but is it worth it for the immediate debt increase?",finance
stocks,Waste Management (NYSE: $WM) stock DD i wrote for a discord I'm in,"When searching for a company to do a DD on this week for this Discord, I initially was struggling to land on a company. There are just so many dividend growth companies on my watchlist that I didn’t know where to start. Initially I was wanting to do a write up on HanesBrands, ticker $HBI, due to everyone needing underwear and socks but then I realized I hadn’t put on underwear since I got home from work on Friday, so I just couldn’t bring myself to break that streak to product test this company as thoroughly as I would have liked. However, this did lead me to throwing away some older underwear from the back of my drawer and having to race out to get them in the bin before the truck picked up this morning. Funnily enough, it was this little act that led me down the rabbit hole of America's first, largest, and objectively best waste management company, $WM. This write up will attempt to go over some of the reasons I view $WM as a prime choice for any dividend growth investor who is seeking to add to their industrial holdings by buying a company worth holding for 20+ years, including some basic financial information, how WM can grow into the future, as well as some potential problems with the stock that I see. Finally I am not a financial advisor and this is written purely for the purpose of sharing some publicly available stock info in the form of a poorly written, weed induced WM DD, I hope you enjoy.

The aptly named Waste Management, ticker symbol $WM, is an industrial sector powerhouse with first mover-advantage specializing in the waste management sub-sector that has been slowly and steadily raising its dividend over the last 18 years. Waste Management operates primarily with four different revenue streams consisting of waste collection, landfill operations, waste transportation, and finally, recycling. It is with these four primary sources of revenue that allow $WM to boast a current dividend yield of 1.68% with a yearly dividend of $2.30 paid out quarterly in March, June, September, and December. This dividend represents a payout ratio of only 53% which is not very high at all and is actually very sustainable. In fact, it has a dividend safety score of 98 from simplysafedividends.com and is over where management is aiming for their dividend to be (between 40-50% according to their 2020 Investors day presentation.) In addition to being very sustainable, a payout ratio of 53% also leaves room for growth, and $WM has been doing just that. While it's 4 year average dividend yield is just slightly higher at 1.98% compared to todays at 1.68% the amount that yield represents has been growing at an average rate of 41.46% over the last 5 years, 28.24% over the last 3 years, and even in the shitstorm that was 2020, WM raised its dividend by 6.34% just showing that this company not only cares about it's dividend growth, but that it can easily afford to raise its dividend as one important thing to note is that during the last 18 years (since 2004) of consistent dividend increases, the payout ratio has more or less remained unchanged, maintaining managements preferred 40-50% payout ratio  with occasional outbreaks such as where we are currently due to a contagious outbreak that rocked the entire world. Finally, Waste Management has a Current Price of ≅ $138, an analyst price range of $125-$160, and an average analyst price target of $144 showing some room for this stock to still raise or fall to a better entry point if it does fall to test the lower analysts prediction. 

Moving on from the dividend and surface level stock price breakdowns, $WM has a current P/E ratio of 37.7 and I know this might seem very high, it actually isn't when you compare it to other waste management companies. For instance, WM’s next three largest competitors are Republic Services, with a P/E of 35.2, Clean Harbor, with a P/E of 36.7, and Waste Connections, which has a huge P/E of 141.13 (this is the only one of the three that I went and checked multiple sites and yes, it really is that big...) As you can see, a P/E ratio in the low to mid 30’s basically comes with the territory of being in the waste management sub-sector. Just as the P/E ratio comes with the sub-sector; growth in the form of acquisitions will almost always bring some additional debt as its +1, and this is the next aspect of $WM’s balance sheet that I want to touch on. In 2019 Waste Management achieved a major milestone for any company, it officially made enough to fully pay down it's yearly short term debt and pay off future long term debt, an achievement it had not completed since at least 2016 (and possibly before but this is the furthest back I could find regarding short term debt payments). Regardless, this is still an important feat as it shows that $WM is making enough money to support not only a growing dividend, but also additional amounts of debt to fund new acquisitions now and in the future. Now how can I make the claim that they can afford to take even more debt on? Well in 2020 (yeah the shitiest of shity years for businesses) $WM paid off all their short term debt and an additional $7.8 Billion in long term debt as well, just showing the strength of it's balance sheet and how the acquisitions it's made are paying off in time.

Finally the last bit of financial digging I did resulted in me coming across something that did cause me to pause and I feel that any decent DD should include some potential negatives to put the positives into a better, more complete light. The elephant in the room in regards to Waste Management is it's unusually high P/B ratio of 7.7ish. While this ratio is generally not as important in the industrial waste management compared to say the financial sector, it is still important to compare it to its peers. The same three competitors mentioned above all have lower P/B ratios than $WM. Ultimately this just means it is slightly overpriced compared to its book value, this can be explained away simply by the fact that in 2019, seeing that it could pay off all it's short term debt, Waste Management added a large amount of debt to its balance sheet so that it could buy new acquisitions, one such acquisition was Advanced Disposal for 4.6 Billion. This higher P/B ratio also explains Morningstars 2 star rating. However my response to this information is just this: If you plan to buy and hold a stock for 20 years, isn’t it better to open your position early, accrue dividends and price appreciation, while buying dips, than to just wait for its P/B ratio to dip down to a level you’re more comfortable with? Especially considering that there is a very good chance that as the debt goes down as the acquisitions begin paying for themselves, so too will the P/B ratio fall.

Moving on from financials and more towards hard assets, Waste Managements true strength starts to take form as it truly lives up to what one imagines from a company with first-mover advantage in its respective sub-sector. The company services over 20 million residential and 2 million commercial customers in 48 US States, Canada, DC, and Puerto Rico. $WM has a total of 293 active landfills with an average remaining lifespan of 22 years per landfill. They also have 346 waste transfer/consolidation stations, 146 recycling centers making it the largest recycling network in the nation , 16 waste to energy facilities that burn up to 23,000 pounds of trash to generate up to 670 MW/hour of electrical/steam energy, enough to power 660,000 homes. Waste Management also boasts 4 new Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) facilities that have already created more than 16 million gallons of RNG since coming online. This is enough RNG to power 1/3 of their 26,000 strong fleet and sell the remaining to local energy companies that then use the RNG to power roughly 460,000 homes. Finally every other landfill that WM owns and operates that isn't a special waste-to-energy or RNG facility also has some more basic ways to capture the methane that comes naturally with decomposing trash and sells that to local gas-to-energy companies that use the supplied methane to help power an additional 180,000 homes per year, bringing the total number of homes powered by trash to a whopping 1.3 million and WM only plans to raise that number to over 2 million in the coming years.

The last aspect of Waste Management that I want to discuss is their future growth prospects and why I am bullish on them as a company overall despite the higher than average P/B ratio the company currently has. Everyone creates waste and we all need that waste taken away somewhere so that we can live the normal lives we have become accustomed to. In addition to being the largest, the first, and objectively the best waste management company, $WM is also investing heavily into renewable energy by harnessing the naturally occurring methane and other RNG’s that are simply by-products of their primary business.  In addition to selling the naturally produced energy that they found themselves having on their hands, $WM has also found a way to make money off of full and capped landfills by taking advantage of existing power lines that run to and from local electrical infrastructure turning them into solar farms and boosting the local power supply. Waste Management is also currently undergoing a change in it's payment model, a shift away from a flat rate bundled model that didn’t take into account the costs of processing and holding the waste $WM picks up, and is changing to a fee-for-service model which will take into account everything from pick-up to transport, to recycling to even the costs it takes to turn that waste into energy. This move will essentially turn every action $WM takes into a way to make money. By providing such an essential service that no-one is exempt from needing, $WM has positioned itself amazingly to continue being the industry leader in waste management for decades to come. And that is no understatement, Waste Management has proven to be a very sticky company with a customer typically being a customer for 10+ years. The final aspect of $WM’s growth potential I want to dig up hits closer to home for me and those in Texas than others, and that is Waste Management basically has a monopoly in Texas. Yes there are competitors here, but between being headquartered in Houston which is the 4th largest city in the nation and rapidly growing, and having cornered the market in the new silicon valley cities of San Antonio and Austin, $WM can rest easily knowing they have future customers for years to come.

Overall I am extremely bullish on Waste Management and see this as an investment to hold for the 25 to 30 years I have left until retirement and honestly, with $WM I might get to retirement early, and while investing in trash might not be a dirty job, as someone who grew up watch Mike Rowe, I think it's only fitting that I make my portfolio get a little dirty to make money.",finance

personalfinance,Taking to your parents about investing,"I will not bore you with details, but mother is in her early 70s and she inherited stock from her father from a big oil company. The amount is relatively significant and the company pays a high dividend that she can live off of. The problem is that I think it is silly that she keep so much money in one company and she also has kept a lot of money in cash the last 20 years (she is financial conservative). She has been open about the fact that all her money is going to her 4 kids equally (she has no husband). She is really stuck in her ways and I am grateful she is financial independent, but it does bother me she has kept all her money in one stock and then has a lot of cash that has been generating hardly any income due to low interest rates. I want her to start investing in Vanguard index equity funds and take a 4% withdrawal each year which should be more than enough to live off of. I think this will be a much better investment in the long run and she will leave us more money. I don’t want to sound like a grave robber. I love my mom and I think this is a better investment strategy for her. She is concerned the investments will not do as well. I was wondering if people had advice on how to talk to parents about investments? My mom is the type to look at me as a little kid and she trusts no one with money. One more thing to note, all her kids including me are doing fine financially and can support if it is needed.",finance

Bitcoin,Peter Schiff has some tough words for Bitcoin.,"Peter Schiff says 

 

1. ""Bitcoin is not a currency, it's not used as a medium of exchange really, or a unit of account. It's just used for speculation. It's not an investment asset like real estate, doesn't pay rent, it's not a stock, it doesn't pay dividends, it's not a bond, it doesn't pay interest. It's not even a commodity, because you can't use it for anything. It's a collectible token.""

2. ""I don't think these bitcoin collections are going to be worth anything when the music stops. People have told me that when the bubble burst in Beanie Babies, they were able to use them to insulate their homes. They could shove them in between the walls, and they made good insulation. You can't do anything with a bitcoin. Once nobody wants your bitcoin, it's completely worthless.""

3. ""The bitcoin bubble might pop before the dollar bubble. We may have a cryptocurrency crisis before we have a dollar crisis.""

4. ""My son's been indoctrinated into the bitcoin cult. He's completely delusional. Now, he's got an excuse, he's only 18. But you've got a lot of older people that don't really have an excuse."" - *comparing bitcoin to a religion whose followers believe each coin will be worth millions of dollars someday.*

5. ""We have this enormous government and a giant bubble economy that's sustained by the artificial suppression of interest rates. That continues to exacerbate these underlying economic imbalances, that ultimately are going to need to be corrected with a major economic collapse.""

6. ""I want to unchain people from government. I don't want people to have to pay income taxes. I don't want people to keep books and records. I don't want people to have to pay Social Security taxes. I want to free people up to save for their own retirement, not rely on a government Ponzi scheme.""

7. ""The big threat to your liberty and freedom is the government, not Google. If we had fewer barriers to entry, if we had no corporate income tax at all, if we got rid of a lot of these rules or regulations, we'd have a much more competitive free market and you would probably have more search engines.""

8. ""The US economy today is in far worse shape than it was in the year 2000. The imbalances are much bigger, the debts are much bigger. This is going to be a much bigger dollar decline than we had from 2000 to 2008. The next crisis is going to be a US dollar crisis and a sovereign debt crisis.""",cryptocurrency

cardano,Cardano Rumor Rundown May 2 2021,"Hey Everyone!

Let's go....

Newly covered today:

1. I don’t know if everyone watched the last few minutes of the Africa Special. But, I think a lot of people missed the section where John O’Connor said the goal of Cardano in Africa is to issue 100 MILLION digital identities in the next two years. To give you some idea of scale here, adapools.org shows a highest ever daily number of new wallets at around 71k.  If we onboard 100 Million people via digital identity over two years that would be 136,986 people per day. ETH only has 150MM unique wallets to date.

2. John also mentioned that all of the 100k subscribers to World Mobile in Zanzibar this year will have digital identities on Atala Prism.  They will also be offering so-called “RealFi” loans by Q1 of next year that will be made via Cardano liquidity and will act as a bridge to real world value.  [https://youtu.be/yRjj662kJsk?t=8628](https://youtu.be/yRjj662kJsk?t=8628)

Recently Covered Items:

1. Part II of the coverage of the lates Roadmap vid from Charles. [https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM](https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM)
2. Sidechains. They call the main chain the “Cardano Settlement Layer” (CSL) and the side chains are called “Cardano Computation Layers” (CCL). They are looking at having CCLs for the EVM, IELE, Catalyst, and WASM (web assembly). They are trying to figure out how to pay for the maintenance of these side chains. A current thought is to possibly create a mechanism where you can “refine” ADA to get “fuel” for these sidechains. You could even have a Plutus side chain that runs on its own fuel. This year they will propose a Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP) to see if the community wants to update the monetary policy in an HFC event to go in this direction. This could be a good way to include the parachain ideas from Polkadot.  They could also add Hyperledger related permissioned sidechains with this.
3. Layer Two. A lot of deal flow with Prism right now around digital identify for things like authenticated wallets, KYC/AML, regulated DeFi, and human readable addresses. Charles will probably do a full video on this. Hydra is the other piece of off-chain infrastructure for this year. IOHK has a whole team working on this. They’ve already put out two papers on this. Will put out two more papers this year and a prototype will also be on the way.  Hydra will be run by the stake pool operators.
4. “With all this, we’re going to piss all over what ETH 2.0 is trying to accomplish”. I’m paraphrasing slightly, but I almost spit out my coffee when he said this.
5. Quantum Resistance. This will be a big project involving: QR VRF, QR zero knowledge stuff, quantum signatures, and modeling of a quantum adversary. This is a huge amount of work. But this is a whole agenda that is in scope for Cardano 2025.
6. Catalyst &amp; Voltaire. Right now Catalyst is mainly about treasury but it needs to be linked to Voltaire which is all about protocol updates. This will probably mean a bicameral voting model that controls hard fork combinator events.There will be DAO as a service to provide voting rights for your users if you build a dApp or other project on Cardano. They will move from the current plutocracy to something that is hybridized between the current system and “proof of merit”. This is going to require a lot of thinking around the social science behind governance. It will be a more nuanced power dynamic.
7. Approach to the Reference Client.Right now it’s just Haskell, they will probably also build out clients in Python and Rust. Eventually they may have things like Agda, Idris, or Coq at the core. This notion of a “Core Developer” could end up being a digital identity that is authorized through voting.
8. Commercial. On the commercial side they are really going to scale things up to the eight figure level.  There’s a lot of good news coming there. Charles says he is reserving that for the Africa Special.

27. Occam.fi partners with Bitcoin.com as custodian to create an ETH-ADA bridge. According to the article, this will allow for any Cardano native token to seamlessly switch to an ERC-20 token and vice versa. The vice versa part is what the ERC-20 Converter does for us already right?

28. LunarCrush interviewed Charles and he gave us some more details on the Ethiopia deal and Africa:  1) the IOHK office in Ethiopia is merging with the Singularity Net Office (it’ll be 30-50 people...so pretty large presence); 2) Africa special to be announced very soon; 3) they will be doing fintech &amp; govtech, 4) everything on the governance side is going to be upgraded across a wide swathe of African nation states in next ten years, 5) lots of possible use cases including supply chains in agritech, putting land on a ledger, voting, identity, reputation (i.e. credit), &amp; payment systems; 6) Africa is like investing in China in the 1980s; 7) the demographics of Africa make it a really easy call to direct investment there; 8) charles said “Ethiopia, in particular, is very special to us and WE HAVE ACTUALLY CLOSED SOME DEALS...we’ll talk about those at the Africa Special”; 9) there will be security token plays in Africa in the mid 2020s since there are no stock exchanges; and 10) there is a big unannounced partnership called “the DCF” with a brand name consultancy we will recognize.

29. Occam has announced that the Occam Razer IDO (Initial Dex Offering) is completed and that it sold out in 30 seconds.  There was no lack of criticism for the way in which the IDO was carried out.

31. Thought: the crypto knowledge stack as to adoption is really tripartite: 1) technical, 2) crypto sentiment, &amp; 3) legacy sentiment toward crypto (including financial sector, central banks, regulatory, and general public).

43. There is really good information about Cardano’s deals in Africa and its developer adoption strategy in this Cardano Chats interview that kind of flew under the radar. Probably worth a listen if you haven’t heard it. [https://youtu.be/m6TeNLvMTXI](https://youtu.be/m6TeNLvMTXI)

45. We just experienced a big flash crash in price. A prime suspect is the drop in hash rate in BTC due to the Blackouts in China. Is the crypto space ready to accept that Nakamoto style consensus on PoW leads directly to unacceptable levels of centralization? This has been the dirty secret of  PoW crypto and its decentralization loving enthusiasts for years. [https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-mining-hash-rate-drops-as-blackouts-instituted-in-china](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-mining-hash-rate-drops-as-blackouts-instituted-in-china)
46. Charles posted a somewhat cryptic tweet that read “Omega + Hydra + Mithral = GG”.  The Ourobors Omega, Ouroboros Hydra,  &amp; Mithral parts we’ve covered before.  Omega is a capstone rollup of Praos (2017), Genesis (2018), + Redux, +Chronos, +Ledger Combiners, +some other things from the rest of the space. Hydra is layer two. Mithral is trustless light wallets via zk-SNARKs.  Guesses as to the “GG” ranged from “Good Game” (as in game over for competitors) to “Goguen”.  See today’s video at the link above for more discussion on this.  [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1383792375860924424](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1383792375860924424)

52. Africa special going down April 29th, 16:30 UTC!!!!!!! That’s 9:30amPacific; 10:30am Mountain; 12:30pm Eastern, 5:30pm Dublin; 7:30pm Addis Ababa; 11:30pm Bangkok.

53. Shahaf Bar-Geffen, CEO of COTI (the first recipient of a Cardano CFund investment), says he just finished recording his segment in the Africa special which he mentioned was airing at the end of April prior to the IOHK announcement of April 29th. He also said: 1) ADA Pay may be ready in early May or maybe even late April; 2) there will be a big launch for ADA Pay and once the Africa Special airs “everything will connect”; 3) “people are probably not getting how big this is….but you will down the line”; 4) COTI integration with a major exchange is happening, progress is not as quick as they would like, but it’s progressing; 5) last week they released the possible designs for debit cards, they are even considering some designs submitted by the community; 6) and iOS and Android integration is coming along nicely and well on the way.   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EorsiQfEV7o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EorsiQfEV7o)

55. It looks like Yellow Card and Payway are listed on the Africa Special website.  Given their business models, it is easy to guess that they could be valuable in the Pan Africa Strategy.  [https://payway.et/](https://payway.et/) [https://yellowcard.io/](https://yellowcard.io/)
56. Partnership with World Mobile in Tanzania. Credit to Reddit user [/u/ricklepicklemydickle](https://www.reddit.com/u/ricklepicklemydickle/) for originally finding this one.

57. Recap from yesterday:  the Africa Special Announcements revealed some additional puzzle pieces 1) COTI’s AdaPay is possibly the larger payments infrastructure puzzle piece, 2) [payway.et](https://payway.et/) is possibly the local payments puzzle piece, 3)  [yellowcard.io](https://yellowcard.io/) is possibly the local coin exchange puzzle piece, and 4) World Mobile (not mentioned at [africa.cardano.org](https://africa.cardano.org/) AFAIK) may be the network connectivity puzzle piece. I think they are going to connect a lot of disparate pieces for us on the 29th.
58. Once again we are the champions! Not just of github commits this time, but also of total staked asset value. [https://www.stakingrewards.com/](https://www.stakingrewards.com/)
59. Rick interviewed CardStarter which is a Cardano accelerator. The interesting items are 1) it appears they are purporting to somehow insure their community backers against certain financial losses with caveats, 2) they plan to fund projects prior to token launch through token vouchers, and 3) it sounds like they are building a DEX called Card Swap. Notice that the “insurance” comes with caveats.  They were very transparent on that point and people should take notice. Is CardStarter good? Is it bad?  I have no idea.  Watch the interview and form your own opinion.  [https://youtu.be/nIklWKtr\_aY](https://youtu.be/nIklWKtr_aY) [https://cardstarter.io/](https://cardstarter.io/)
60. The Cardano Foundation has adjusted its delegation strategy. This brings up a question:  where does the balance lie between allowing Adam Smith’s hidden hand to work its free market magic and trying to help small pools?

62. We’ve had really good reporting from the community on World Mobile developments with Cardano. I just want to take a second to thank you guys. Reddit user [/u/ricklepicklemydickle](https://www.reddit.com/user/ricklepicklemydickle/) first alerted us to the World Mobile developments and then youtube user [Whiskey 1234](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyBeEq-paultoA127TYcDjQ) (love both usernames btw) let us know that he attended a conference where he encountered World Mobile and “asked them if they knew about Cardano blockchain and the reply was they were announcing partners at the end of this month.” Thank you very much for this intel guys.This is what Army of Spies is all about. Many thanks for your contributions, gentlemen.

64. In Charles’s recent AMA, he mentioned that the Africa Special will be a Pan African event and they WILL talk about various deals they have in multiple countries. So, this tells us they do have multiple deals in multiple countries. That was a little unclear previously.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mP0JSgf9CU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mP0JSgf9CU)

66. Kraken publishes a “What is Cardano?” article.   Says “...Cardano may not promise new ground-breaking features..” Oh yeah?  What about native tokens that don’t require smart contracts?  What about the EUTXO model allowing predictable and accurate local calculation of transaction fees in your wallet before you execute? What about a consensus algorithm that’s so good, another top 10 coin made their system derivative of it? That’s all standard these days?

72. Charles does a big interview with Forbes and points out the huge differences between a bonded staking system (ETH) and a liquid staking system (Cardano). This is highly overlooked. [https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenehrlich/2021/04/26/cardano-and-ethereum-founder-analyzes-the-newest-evolutions-in-crypto-and--blockchain-technology/?sh=6acb258e3e52](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenehrlich/2021/04/26/cardano-and-ethereum-founder-analyzes-the-newest-evolutions-in-crypto-and--blockchain-technology/?sh=6acb258e3e52)
73. Charles also covers his projections about interoperability and the future converging on a “wifi moment” when an interoperable “internet of blockchains” emerges.  In this future, it will be a race to the bottom and the systems that are too expensive to operate will simply be priced out of the game.
74. New Africa Special Trailer dropped.  The narrator: “We are partnering with African governments…”  That was PLURAL governments, guys!  This is getting exciting. [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1386772333902319618](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1386772333902319618)

77. A new Cardano metrics platform has launched [https://cardanowaves.com/](https://cardanowaves.com/)
78. Today is the Cardano Africa Special.  It’ll be at 9:30am Pacific, 10:30am Mountain, 12:30pm Eastern, 5:30pm Dublin, 7:30pm Addis Ababa, 11:30pm Bangkok. 1:30amTokyo.   Go enjoy!  We’ll recap it after.
79. In today’s video we also cover questions about the relationship between Atala Prism and ADA and who will actually benefit from the Cardano Projects with African governments.
80. The Africa Special made it clear that Cardano has a brilliant grand strategy for the developing world. As framed by John O’Connor this would be:  1) provide digital identity; 2) provide digital transfer of value; and 3) provide programmability of that digital value.
81. Mickey Watkins (CEO of World Mobile) added a step zero to the formula above with: 0) provide access to the digital world.
82. As has previously been mentioned, it was officially announced that Cardano is partnered with World Mobile to provide digital connectivity to people in the developing world starting in Tanzania.  They plan to have 100k subscribers in Zanzibar by the end of the year.
83. This is just the beginning in Africa.  John O’Connor had a nice tweet that very succinctly laid out some future plans. [https://twitter.com/jjtoconnor/status/1387919060197855234](https://twitter.com/jjtoconnor/status/1387919060197855234)

85. The Cardano Africa Mini addition gives us more details on the actual rollout of the Ethiopia Ministry of Education deal:  1) all 700k teachers and a subset of the students who will get tablets will be registered in the first year; 2) all secondary school students will be registered in the second year which will bring us to 5MM students;  and 3) the data will be used to analyze both students and teachers.

I wanted to address these factors because I am looking at buying a house within the next couple of years and want to make sure I get the lowest possible interest rate on my mortgage. By the time I apply, I will have stable income history. Will try to contain my new card addiction, in order to lengthen the average account history. But I was wondering what can I use to fix the lack of recent installment loan information on my score? Thought I could maybe use programs like Kikoff, Self, or some other type of personal loan. What would you recommend?

# **More earnings, April’s big jobs report and inflation worries could swing markets in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/30/more-earnings-aprils-big-jobs-report-and-inflation-worries-could-swing-markets-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; April’s jobs report and a barrage of earnings news make for another busy week for markets, as the calendar rolls into May.
*****
&gt; Stocks notched solid gains in April, as REITs, consumer discretionary names and communications services companies outpaced the broader market, all more than 7% higher. However, April finished on a sour note, with stocks selling off on Friday.
*****
&gt; “Since November, there’s been a 30% rally,” said Jimmy Chang, chief investment officer at Rockefeller Global Family Office. He noted that historically the November to April period is historically the strongest for stocks. “There’s the adage ‘sell in May, go away.’ It may be somewhat appropriate this year since we’ve done so well in the last six months.”
*****
&gt; # Big jobs report
&gt; April’s employment report is released Friday, and the market is expecting a big number.
*****
&gt; Economists say payrolls in April could easily reach 1 million, after 916,000 jobs were added in March. Estimates range from about 700,000 to a forecast of 2.1 million from Jefferies economists.
*****
&gt; According to Dow Jones, there is a consensus forecast of 978,000 among the economists it surveyed and the unemployment rate is expected to fall to 5.8% form 6%.
*****
&gt; Fed speakers will also be important after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in the past week that the Fed is still looking for “substantial further progress” in its goals for the economy.
*****
&gt; The chairman emphasized that the Fed is not close to tapering back its bond buying program, a surprise to some investors. Some bond market pros had expected the Fed to start discussing cutting back purchases at its June meeting and begin to reduce its $120 billion monthly bond buying by the end of the year or early next year.
*****
&gt; “Next week is all about the jobs number, because as part of the Fed’s path to ‘substantial progress’ on their two roles, we’ll see how much further along that path they are next Friday” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. The Fed’s mandate is to pursue full employment and a steady pace of Inflation, which it has targeted at 2%.
*****
&gt; The Fed has expected a temporary period of high inflation which it expects to see subside later in the year though Boockvar and others say inflation could be hotter than the Fed expects. The core personal consumption expenditures price index jumped 0.36% in March, with the year-ago rate rising from 1.4% to 1.8%. It is expected to go even higher in April. Headline inflation in the consumer price index is expected to begin running at 3% or better when it is reported May 12.
*****
&gt; Just days after Powell’s comments on tapering, Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan Friday said the Fed should begin the discussion on paring back bond purchases because imbalances in financial markets and the economy is improving faster than expected.
*****
&gt; The market’s focus on the Fed’s bond program makes the jobs report even more important. If the Fed starts to taper back those asset purchases, it would then signal it would be on the path toward raising interest rates. Most economists do not expect the Fed to raise interest rates before 2023.
*****
&gt; “If this jobs number comes in super hot, it’s going to make people up their estimate on when the Fed might taper,” said Michael Schumacher, director rates at Wells Fargo.
*****
&gt; Powell is among Fed speakers in the coming week, but he is not expected to provide any new views when he participates in a National Community Reinvestment Coalition conference Monday afternoon. Kaplan speaks Tuesday and Thursday, and New York Fed President John Williams and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester are also among Fed officials speaking in the coming week.
*****
&gt; # Earnings soar
&gt; So far, a record 87% of S&amp;P 500 companies have beat earnings estimates, and earnings look to be growing by more than 46%, according to Refinitiv.
*****
&gt; Credit Suisse Chief U.S. Equity Strategist Jonathan Golub upped his forecast Friday for the S&amp;P 500 based on strong earnings. “We are raising our 2021 S&amp;P 500 price target to 4600 from 4300, representing 9.2% upside from current levels, and 22.5% for the year,” he wrote.
*****
&gt; Earnings are expected from a diverse group of companies, from General Motors to ViacomCBS. Pharma will be in the spotlight as vaccine makers Pfizer and Moderna both report. Draftkings and Beyond Meat are also on the schedule.
*****
&gt; A host of travel related companies issue results, including Booking Holdings, Hilton Worldwide , Marriott Vacations, and Caesars Entertainment. Consumer brands, like Anheuser Busch Inbev and Estee Lauder also report, as do insurers including AIG, Allstate, and MetLife. (A calendar with some key earnings dates appears below.)
*****
&gt; Chang said the market has discounted a lot of the positive news already.
*****
&gt; “In spite of the really strong reports from the bellwether companies, you’re seeing some of the names starting to peter out a little bit,” said Chang. “I think it’s a sign that so much good news is discounted. I suspect the market is due for a breather. I think in the next couple of months, we’re likely to see sideways movement. There’s likely to be a pullback which will be healthy.”
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was up 5.2% in April, finishing Friday at 4,181. It is now up 11.2% for the year so far. The Dow rose 2.7% in April, to 33,874, and the Nasdaq gained 5.4% in April, ending Friday at 13,962.
*****
&gt; Chang said he expects some of the “boring” blue chips that haven’t participated as much in the rally to do better. Some of those names can be found in pharma, he said.
*****
&gt; Heading into the coming week, investors will be watching for words of wisdom from Warren Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting Saturday.

&gt; # S&amp;P 500 and DJIA Up Last 9 Post-Election Year Mays

&gt; May officially marks the beginning of the “Worst Six Months” for the DJIA and S&amp;P. To wit: “Sell in May and go away.” Our “Best Six Months Switching Strategy,” created in 1986, proves that there is merit to this old trader’s tale. A hypothetical $10,000 investment in the DJIA compounded to a gain of $960,943 for November-April in 70 years compared to just $1,656 for May-October. The same hypothetical $10,000 investment in the S&amp;P 500 compounded to $788,997 for November-April in 70 years compared to a gain of just $10,145 for May-October.

&gt; May has been a tricky month over the years, a well-deserved reputation following the May 6, 2010 “flash crash”. It used to be part of what we once called the “May/June disaster area.” From 1965 to 1984 the S&amp;P 500 was down during May fifteen out of twenty times. Then from 1985 through 1997 May was the best month, gaining ground every single year (13 straight gains) on the S&amp;P, up 3.3% on average with the DJIA falling once and two NASDAQ losses.

&gt; In the years since 1997, May’s performance has been erratic; DJIA up twelve times in the past twenty-three years (four of the years had gains in excess of 4%). NASDAQ suffered five May losses in a row from 1998-2001, down – 11.9% in 2000, followed by thirteen sizable gains in excess of 2.5% and five losses, the worst of which was 8.3% in 2010.

&gt; Post-election Year Mays rank near the top, registering average gains on DJIA and S&amp;P 500 of 1.3% and 1.7% respectively. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have advanced in every post-election year May beginning in 1985. Russell 1000 has been up ten years straight in post-election year Mays.

&gt; # S&amp;P 500 Up Over 10% First Four Months – Preceded Flat May to late-October

&gt; As of yesterday’s close, S&amp;P 500 was up 11.5% year-to-date. Provided these gains hold through the end of April, this year will be just the seventeenth time since 1950 that the S&amp;P 500 has finished the first four months of the year with a gain exceeding 10%. The best January to April span occurred in 1975, up 27.3% (S&amp;P 500 was in the early stages of a new bull market following the bear ending 10/3/1974 in which the S&amp;P 500 declined 48.2%). The next best year was, 1987 (most will remember what happened later that year) and the most recent year was 2019 (a solid year from beginning to end).

&gt; In the above chart we have plotted all 17 previous years in which the S&amp;P 500 was up over 10% January through the end of April. Along side for comparison is “All Years,” “Post-Election Years,” and 2021 through yesterday. In the previous 17 years, gains tended to fizzle in early-May before gaining some additional ground from around mid-June to mid-July before once again stalling out till late September with more weakness lasting until late-October. On average, by late-October arrived, gains from the previous three months were given back and since the start of May S&amp;P 500 gained around 2.5% on average. You don’t have to go away in May but considering the historically modest gains from early-May to late-October, it may not quite be worth sticking around.

&gt; # Here Comes Sell In May

&gt; “The sun was warm but the wind was chill. You know how it is with an April day. When the sun is out and the wind is still, you’re one month on in the middle of May.” American Poet Robert Frost

&gt; One of the best known investment axioms is to “sell in May and go away.” This is largely because the six months from May through October have historically been some of the weakest months of the year for stocks. As you can see below, the next six months have tended to be on the weak side.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/blog-4.30.21.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the next six months have indeed been the worst six months of the year, up only 1.7% on average. To add insult to injury, we are leaving the six most bullish months of the year. In fact, the S&amp;P 500 Index is set to gain close to 30% during these most bullish six months, one of the best six-month gains ever.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/blog-4.30.21-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “Stocks are up more than 87% from the March lows, suggesting a well-deserved pullback during these troublesome months is quite possible,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But with an accommodative Fed, fiscal and monetary policy, along with an economy that is opening faster than nearly anyone expected, we’d use any weakness as an opportunity to add to positions.”

&gt; Here’s the catch, isn’t there always a catch? Stocks have actually been higher during these worst months of the year eight of the past ten years.

&gt; # U.S. Economy Jumps Out of the Gate in 2021

&gt; In what was initially expected to be one of the slower quarters of the year, the U.S. economy jumped out of the gates in 2021, with gross domestic product (GDP) growing 6.4% quarter over quarter. A faster than expected vaccination program, nearly $3 trillion in fiscal stimulus—including direct payments to consumers—and faster than expected job growth helped fuel a surge in personal consumption—the largest portion of GDP.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, personal consumption grew 10.7% on an annualized basis in the first quarter, the second highest level since the 1960’s:

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.29.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “The U.S. economy is off to a great start in 2021, and this should set the stage for solid growth in the remainder of the year as pent up demand continues to flow through the economy,” added LPL Financial Chief Investment Officer Burt White. “Many areas of the country are still facing restrictions on activity, so we don’t think growth will just be limited to the first quarter.”

&gt; However, the growth story in the first quarter wasn’t solely about direct stimulus payments. While personal consumption has understandably gained a lot of attention, federal non-defense spending added the most to GDP in nearly 60 years, a segment of the economy unaffected by transfer payments like stimulus checks.

&gt; Digging into the numbers even further, spending on services grew a modest 4.6%, which should accelerate in the second and third quarters as remaining restrictions are lifted in response to falling cases and rising vaccinations. As of April 28, the US is averaging around 2.5-3 million vaccines administered per day, which has helped over half the adult population receive at least one dose of the vaccine, while nearly 40% of adults are fully vaccinated, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.

&gt; The U.S. vaccination program has helped pull the economy forward, but net trade was a modest drag on growth in the first quarter, where domestic growth pulled in imports at a faster pace than the recovery outside of the U.S. lifted exports. As the rest of the world gets better control of COVID-19, rebounding economic growth overseas should provide an additional tailwind for U.S. economy.

&gt; We upgraded our forecast for U.S. GDP in our recent Weekly Market Commentary from 5–5.5% to 6.25–6.75%, and we expect to see the economy continue its pace in the second quarter as restrictions are lifted and activity normalizes.

&gt; # Where Do President Biden’s First 100 Days Stack Up Versus President Trump?

&gt; President Biden’s 100th day in office is tomorrow, on April 29. Hard to believe it has been 100 days already, but overall the economy continues to improve and stocks have done very well under our new President.

&gt; We’ve heard the question many times: Where does the Biden rally rank? That is what we will look at today. The term “hundred days” was first used on July 24, 1933, on the radio by President Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR). He was discussing the 100-day session of the 73rd U.S. Congress, but over time this term has changed to refer to the first 100 days of a new president.

&gt; Per Ryan Detrick, Chief Market Strategist, “President Biden has been quite kind for stocks, with the Dow up nearly 10%, which is on pace for the best first 100 days in office since FDR in the early 1930s. Then toss in the cherry on top that stocks had one of their greatest rallies ever from Election Day until the inauguration and it is clear that although maybe everyone might not like President Biden, but the stock market doesn’t have many issues with him.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the Dow has averaged 4.3% the first 100 days of a new President, while it has been higher the first 100 days in office for five of the past six Presidents. In fact, President Biden’s return currently ranks as the third best since 1900, with only Taft and Roosevelt better. Lastly, breaking it down by political party and the first 100 days under a Democratic President was much stronger, up 10.3% on average versus down 0.2% for a Republican President.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.28-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Here’s a chart we shared earlier this year that shows that stocks did amazingly well from Election Day until the inauguration under President Biden.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.28-Blog-CHart-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; What can we glean from those first 100 days? Is there any pattern that might suggest how stocks will do during the rest of the time President Biden is in office? You can look for yourself below, but there doesn’t appear to be any clue as to what might happen. President Eisenhower had a weak first 100 days, then a big rally over the remainder of his time in office. Conversely, President Taft saw a big rally during the first 100 days, only to have negative returns for the remainder of his time in office. In the end, fundamentals, valuations, and technicals drive long-term equity returns. The good news is only once since the Great Depression did that mean lower returns for the remainder of time in office after the first 100 days.

&gt; # Wild Data Close To Q1

&gt; Today was quite the day for economic data, with two key releases from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). We'll start with BEA data on personal income and spending in March.

&gt; First, as shown below, the savings rate surged in the month, with households saving 27.6% of personal income net of taxes. That's a huge number, even by the standards of the elevated savings rates that we've seen over the course of the pandemic.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/Eco-Review-1.png))**

&gt; The reason there was so much saving going on is that transfer payments rose by more than $300bn on the month, driven by the delivery of economic impact payments also known as ""stimulus checks"" or even shorter: ""stimmies.""

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/Eco-Review-2.png))**

&gt; Incomes also rose thanks to rebounding labor market activity following winter storms in Texas during February and the longer-term trend of reopening across the economy. As shown, the 13.5% annualized growth of wage and salary income in the month was very strong. It was also helped along by wage growth, which we will discuss later on.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/Eco-Review-3.png))**

&gt; With spending surging thanks to stimulus checks and other factors, core personal consumption expenditure prices surged by the most MoM since 2009, over 4% annualized. The 4% move was in no small part due to the swing in activity from February to March, and isn't likely to be sustained, but it is a helpful indicator that prices may be more robust in this recovery than they were during the low inflation post-GFC period.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/Eco-Review-4.png))**

&gt; For broad inflation that will concern the Fed, one factor that will be needed along with steadily rising prices is strong wage growth. The second big report today was Q1 wages in the BLS Employment Cost Index (ECI). The ECI does a better job of measuring wage growth than other series because it accounts for changes in the composition of employment over time. As shown in the chart below, Q3 saw the strongest sequential wage growth on record, with a 4.6% annualized advance in wages versus Q4. Some of that came from incentive-paid occupations, which benefit from bonuses and related payments, skewing the results. As shown in the chart, though, there was very strong wage growth even excluding incentive-paid occupations. Anecdotal reports of very tight labor markets amidst booming reopening demand got support from this release.

CryptoCurrency,I feel like the Federal Reserve and Pancake Swap are following the same strategy,"So I've been watching the whole $CAKE thing for a while, and threw some money at it in an attempt to understand it more, which I've profited off. The conclusions I have drawn from following the community, seeing how things work, and having skin in the game, are thus:

1) hardly anyone in the community has any idea what the hell is going on

2) the only reason they are able to sustain high APY's is because they keep printing CAKE out of nothing

3) This is, oddly enough, creating demand (for the time being), because people keep wanting to buy more CAKE and stake that CAKE because it is getting really high APYs

4) These high yields are the only thing sustaining the demand for CAKE, because people don't want to sell them when they are getting such good return (and the price is going up). This is the only thing holding up the CAKE ecosystem.

5) this is not that dissimilar to the US stock market being bolstered by the Federal Reserve printing an enormous amount of money in the last year.

35% of all USD was printed within the last year. (source: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/kdpc24/35\_of\_all\_us\_dollars\_in\_existence\_have\_been/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/kdpc24/35_of_all_us_dollars_in_existence_have_been/) )

investing,Inflation yield relation and my expectations,"Nothing has changed over the past week. The Fed remains dovish, and in spite of its transitory speak about inflation, prices continue to soar. Biden calls for even more stimulus, but it’s doubtful all of it will make it through the Senate. Meanwhile, the parameters for Gold  and silver  remain the same. Resistance is at 1800 and support is at 1740-50. 25,60 silver 
Yields are rising again
Real yields are flat to lower recently, supporting Gold’s move off its lows. While Powell says rising inflation is temporary, all evidence is to the contrary. While yields cannot be allowed to get out of hand and risk the collapse of everything, inflation will continue to rise as the printing presses remain plugged in and supply chains break down. This is the foundation for the coming surge in precious metals. I don’t see the 30-Year T-Bond going beyond the 2.75-3.00% resistance zone.

I wish I had more to say , but who wants to hear a running post on how paint dries. We have our levels to watch, and given the long slow grind lower following the slingshot to 2100 in Goldand 40 silver , I’m sure that when they break we’re going to get some rapid moves to the upside, imho.",finance

For context, my parents bought me this car and co-signed for me on this but the loan is in my name to build credit. They send me the money every month and I pay it directly from my account.

ethereum,Ethereum could perhaps be used to resolve geopolitical conflicts,"Just thought about this after listening to the lex fridman podcast with Sergei nazarov

Country A and country B agree to where clear territorial boundaries exist in the ocean

They agree that if either of their territories are violated, the offender owes a 2 billion dollar fine for that action. Navy vessels patrolling in peaceful operations agree to keep GPS trackers on their vessels, and that data is fed through an Oracle network to ethereum blockchain. 

If gps trackers are shut off on purpose, the offender owes a 2 billion dollar fine paid out through the smart contract. If there is a malfunction, and it isn’t reported, 2 billion dollar fine also goes through the smart contract.

Visual drone/satellite data of ships and gps data is fed through oracle network to the ethereum in the smart contract as well. If violated, the fine is instantly fed into the treasury of the country who is the victim. 

No arguments, and the computers don’t lie.

personalfinance,"Excess income, where should I start?","Hello.  I'm a 30 something engineer.  My combined income is around $105,000 to $120,000  a year.  Base salary is around $90k, with an annual bonus (10%-20% of salary every October) and residual income of around $15k a year in monthly installments.  The residual income is for life due to injuries and disabilities from serving in combat.

I have about $8000 in outstanding debt (mostly paid off car + old credit line I've not used in years) but keep around $20k-$25k in savings, so I dont really ""have"" debt.  My thought here is to pay the debt in installments at a rate higher than minimum to establish credit (currently near 700.)  Should I just pay the debt off in one fell swoop?

I am retirement vested from federal employment (10 years service active duty and civilian) but its a very small pension that I'm not eligible for until old age.  I also have a federal TSP account (similar to a 401k) that I've been investing in to for 15 years but haven't kept track of it.  I have a 401(k) through a new employeerI dont really monitor it at all, either, and I suspect I never max it out.  So definitely need to look in to those, educate myself, and monitor.  Any good resources or texts I can read?

I was raised very poor.  I live very cheaply and simply, dont have many fancy things, etc.  Financially I'm doing well but I am behind the time factor to some degree in terms of long term strategy.

What other avenues for investment can I be exploring?  My absolute excess income each month is usually $3,000 to $4,000 and aside from tipping well and traveling its just that: excess.

What should I be doing?  This doesn't seem like a substantial amount to do anything radical with, but I'm ok assuming something a little higher risk than standard ""investment protocol"" (401k.)",finance
CryptoCurrency,The Grumpy Cat drama and how this week is important for Grumpy holders.,"E: TL,DR **Help us get justice for Grumpy holders.** *Grumpy Devs are keeping their community in the dark about a fork which could save their bags because Grumpy devs don't want a decentralized fork they aren't in control of. Community deserves to know their time to claim their airdrop is running out.* 

If you guys don't know the drama behind Grumpy Cat, holy shit is it a doozy. I'm not gonna write the entire novel here. I'll just give you the bullet points but it is important for those 8000 wallet holders who are still being spoon fed BS by the admin team to have some stuff straight as they are about to miss an opportunity to actually re-cooperate their losses this week.

Original devs P&amp;D the coin when they found out the Grumpy Cat was IP owned by someone else. LOTS of people lost money. So some on that team decided to continue the project without the 'bad devs'.

Problem is they have not produced a single real thing since they 'took over'. They are promising CEX listings, charity wallets, forks, lawyers, registered charities. It's always 'coming soon'. Yesterday their big announcement under 'foundation started' was that they... talked to a notary. Of course they made it seem like they 'started a foundation' like they have been promising but that isn't what happened at all. They have been pulling this BS for months. Always claiming to be hard at work behind the curtain but never actually producing anything of value. And always being very secretive about the 'very exciting news!' they can't reveal just yet to their holders.

Unfortunately that BS is working. More people who don't know the real history are being drawn in to the community because of the cat memes. And the price is starting to trickle upwards because of the hype they keep pumping in to the project. Even if you don't believe the admins are going to dump on people the moment the price hits some magic number, the deception of 'so much happening behind the scenes!' is enough to want out for a lot of people.

So some people started a fork... and there was drama.

So there was a fork of that fork... and there was drama... again.

And there was a fork of that fork... because drama.

There are lots of bad feelings and shady shit that happened in all of these splintered groups. Too many cooks in the kitchen type shit. But none of them has actually produced a legit real use-case working fork of Grumpy... **until this weekend.** Out of that chaos a legit project actually came forward. One [whose entire contract](https://etherscan.io/token/0x115b1122C7dd5e18ce5F1Cadc7777Ec3624Ec351) you can read on etherscan to verify for yourself it is not just some other scam. And the thing is the mechanics of the coin are exactly the thing that attracted people to the original Grumpy coin in the first place even though the current Grumpy coin has none of the features they promised. [Read for yourself](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmeC3e7ij6uZMEC8hsJ7KsVQxyvPm9AkW1L67tctkDZNvT).

* Anti-dumping measures.
* Staking rewards.
* Decentralized voting mechanisms.
* Charity wallet.
* liquidity from the community so no rug pulling.

The issue is that there is a 5 day swap window for grumpy holders and that window is closing. (Why a 5 day window? Read for yourself in the FAQ.) The people who can benefit the most from having the coin they thought they were originally getting from Grumpy are being purposely kept in the dark about it by the Grumpy admin team. If you mention the fork under their social media they will ban you as has finally happened to me this morning in their sub. You are permabanned for literally talking about it unless you are trashing it. They are trying to keep their 8000 users completely in the dark and are even actively throwing FUD around about the fork. **They are very open about their reasons, the fork is decentralized and Grumpy teams believe they should have control of the community. If it doesn't come from them then it is 'unofficial'.** That is literally why. In their minds if they aren't at the center of the project, then it isn't legit. Completely betraying the idea of a decentralized charity coin. Even though their team was filled with scammers before and they haven't moved the project forward in any tangible way at all, they think they still somehow should be at the center of the community.

The point of this post is that Grumpy holders should know, there is a fork now and it is truly decentralized. The code, [the grey paper](https://meowdaogovernancetoken.github.io/), and the FAQ are all worth reading because this coin finally delivers the charity promises that all other animal shit coins failed before to do and time is running out to collect on the airdrop. **Don't let the Grumpy Cat devs keep you from collecting what is yours.**",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,"(LONG) OriginTrail - Due Diligence - no price predictions, no cross-postings, no tweet-links. Only published material by OT, their partners, and articles to showcase how big this is! Yet, you are sleeping...","Before you start reading, since this is a long post, grab yourself a cup of coffee or tea, and enjoy the read! I hope you appreciate the time and effort put into this post. I am not trying to hype anything, nor am I providing price predictions. I have a background in ERP systems and know the segment very well and what it does and why without the global standards incorporated within this type of solution (Supply Chains) the supply chain complex will never be standardized! This is why standards such as GS1, W3C, EPCIS/EPCIS 2.0, to name a few, are at the core of OriginTrail's solution. 

For some time now I've been postponing this post because if truth be told, it's time-consuming. Also, so many great posts on OriginTrial have been created under the r/cc subreddit describing OriginTrail only to be deleted by the mods. This is the reason why no one bothers posting anything about OriginTrail here anymore. Posts get deleted and people who are genuinely looking for solid investments miss the opportunity to even get a glance to make informed decisions. After I create this post I will not be able to share it with anyone because if I share it in a Telegram community, and it gets upvoted ""too quickly"", it will get deleted for ""brigading"" by the cc-admins. So, this post will depend more or less on people who actually care about reading its contents and upvoting it because they find it to be useful. Anyway, I guess that belongs to the past now. I am giving this one last attempt for those who truly are searching for a rock-solid project with really great fundamentals. I will not be touching on any price predictions, nor will I crosspost any other Reddit posts here. I will also not link to any Twitter posts, only images of these. In the end, all I will be providing is adoption that has already taken place, and is taking place, within the OriginTrail ecosystem, which btw stretches far outside crypto and has basically gone unnoticed among crypto investors. I'll be providing direct sources to published material and datasets that are being uploaded to the ODN (OriginTrail Decentralized Network).

First of all, to all those who don't know anything about OriginTrail, OriginTrail is not a blockchain. It is a layer-2 agnostic protocol that goes on top of blockchain and is utilizing blockchain for data immutability and decentralization. It's a multichain solution and can be integrated on top of any blockchain. Currently, OT protocol is operating on top of ETH (*not much usage there anymore due to high gas fees*) and xDAI (*currently the main active chain*). OTs own blockchain called Starfleet Chain (SFC) is currently being tested for launch and it's expected to launch in a couple of weeks in mid-May. DOT is also being prepared. In short, ODN will be running on at least 4 chains this year. ETH, xDAI, SFC, and DOT. SFC and DOT integrations have been worked on by TraceLabs (*the team behind OriginTrail*) and Parity Tech (*the team behind Polkadot*). It remains to be seen whether OT will get a parachain/parathread on the Polkadot ecosystem.

Now, over to what OriginTrail is solving. There are many who just throw Vechain, Te-Foods, WTC, Ambrosus, OriginTrail, Morpheus, and other ""supply chain projects"" into the same soup calling it ""supply chain"" projects. To a slight degree, it is correct, but not really. This is because you really don't understand this segment properly. Unless you have knowledge of what supply chains really are and do, understand backend system operations which are basically complex ERP systems that supply chains rely on (Oracle NetSuite, SAP, Microsoft Dynamics, and plethora of other systems), and which allow companies to do their day to day operations, you really don't have much to go with as far as understanding what you've actually invested your money into. Most of these projects are NOT supply chain solutions. They literally just scrape the surface layer of the supply chain ecosystem. Most of these are traceability projects, promising to verify that consumers are getting products that producers say they are. That's it. In no way are the majority of these projects solving the main issue that has been plaguing the supply chain industry for a very long time, which is the lack of seamless and decentralized interoperability and interconnectivity of siloed legacy systems and storages, where all systems are communicating effortlessly, abiding by the strict rules of global standards without the need to create complex customizations each time you are dealing with a system you haven't dealt with before. Here is an example:

*If company A runs system X, company B system Y, and company C system Z, they don't need to create 6-9 different customizations to whatever ERP system they are using in order to communicate with each other. With OT solution, each company uploads their data via the ODN in order to share whatever needs to be shared, keeping their costs down and avoiding expensive expansions into other systems that their clients/vendors/suppliers may demand. This is exactly what OriginTrail is solving, and they are doing it like a boss! Which you will see further down.*

Since I am not allowed to post links to tweets, if you look up ""John G. Keogh"" on Twitter, one of the advisors to OriginTrail and board members of TraceAlliance, you can find tons of information about how important OriginTrails solutions are for solving supply chain issues. John is basically advising governments on supply chains, especially in his home country of Canada and why global standards are a MUST in order to create solutions like these. Unfortunately, in crypto space this is not considered ""sexy"". It's considered heavy, boring, and simply too hard to comprehend. This becomes the sole reason why most will miss OriginTrail:

From John's tweet on May 1st, 2021: ""FoodOn, Top scholar &amp; co-creator FoodOn to join Trace Alliance Data Interoperability &amp; Semantic Web workgroup. More coming soon as the research team formulates their plan &amp; solution providers, NGO's &amp; governments join. Just wow!""  Extract from FoodOn article [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41538-018-0032-6.pdf](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41538-018-0032-6.pdf):

""*The construction of high capacity data sharing networks to support increasing government and commercial data exchange has highlighted a key roadblock: the content of existing Internet-connected information remains siloed due to a multiplicity of local languages and data dictionaries. This lack of a digital lingua franca is obvious in the domain of human food as materials travel from their wild or farm origin, through processing and distribution chains, to consumers. Well-defined, hierarchical vocabulary, connected with logical relationships—in other words, an ontology—is urgently needed to help tackle data harmonization problems that span the domains of food security, safety, quality, production, distribution, and consumer health and convenience.""*

This is what solving supply chain hurdles imply. Not just ensuring product traceability. You solve the traceability problem, sure, but how are you going to ensure that this actually moves through the supply chain seamlessly? You can't unless you solve what was explained above.

Today most people have invested their money into projects which ""sound"" sexy by getting shilled these via crypto youtube ""experts"" and social media shills. This is all great. Some of you may have benefited from all this hype these past 3 months, but in the end, what have you really bought? How much time and effort have you put into learning anything about your investment and how much is just affirmational bias tied to what you've heard? The truth is, what most people are really looking for when investing in anything is to find that one seed that's going to grow into a massive producing tree from which you can reap the benefits for many years to come. Not ""how much can I get in the shortest amount of time possible"", which seems to be the main investment strategy currently.

**PARTNERSHIPS**:

**BSI, British Standards Institute** 

[BSI](https://www.bsigroup.com/) is just one of many serious standardization organizations that consult roughly 84,000 clients in 193 countries. They are creme de la creme within their segment and they consult both companies and governments to create solutions to mitigate risk, brand protection, and compliance, just to name a few. They rely HEAVILY on the solutions made possible with OriginTrail. Just read below:

&amp;#x200B;

* BSI has partnered exclusively up with OriginTrail to solve some of the major hurdles that their clients experience in supply chains. Back in December of 2020, OriginTrail held a 4-hour Liftoff event where BSI, Oracle, and SBB (Swiss Railways) were showcasing their work and solutions they were building utilizing ODN. (*Phil Archer from GS1, was also present there, but more as a commentary. I'll get back to each of these later.*)
* You can watch the Liftoff segment with Dan Putrell, Director of Innovations at BSI [here](https://youtu.be/Ss9pZkVsFpo). The solution being presented here is for BSIs [SCAN members](https://www.scanassociation.com/membership/our-members/) in the US. If you don't know who these are, well, they represent 40% of ALL US imports each year. These companies must ensure that the products they import are from compliant factories outside of the US. You can watch the link I've attached to hear Dan explain this entire process and the importance of it.
* Bono, from U2, who is a co-owner of a distillery called Monasterevin, hired BSI to consult them on a solution to ensure the authenticity of their products. You can read about the story [here](https://www.businesspost.ie/business/bono-whiskey-firm-brands-casks-with-blockchain-tokens-242764c7). The story was available in full when it was released but it seems it is now behind a pay-wall in order to read the full article. Nevertheless, at the end of the Liftoff event, I posted above, if you've watched the whole thing, Dan Putrell is discussing this exact part there without fully revealing what it is. 
* Dan also mentions a solution they are creating for the UK government, which we now know is [Trusted Bytes](https://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/about-bsi/media-centre/press-releases/2021-press-releases/april/bsi-joins-innovate-uk-consortium-designed-to-help-digitize-the-uks-fresh-produce-supply-chains/). This is a solution to ensure the digitization of the UK's fresh produce and supply chains:

1. ""*BSI will leverage various open international best practice frameworks around supply chain data management, trust, and interoperability within the Trusted Bytes initiative. These include GS1/EPCIS, W3C DIDs, and verifiable credentials, ISO 44001 Collaborative Business Relationships,* ***and the open OriginTrail decentralized protocol stack (origintrail.io)****.*""
2. ""*providing seamless real-time digital connectivity to supply chain operators. It will also enable a trusted data exchange that connects the supply chain with central government and other critical partners enhancing cross border transition, compliance and security.*""
3. Lincoln University, shortly after, published [this article](https://www.lincoln.ac.uk/news/2021/04/1688.asp) that explains more about this initiative and who the involved parties are from the UK; ""*The consortium, led by Produce Logistics Limited includes leading fresh produce supply chain operators Fesa UK Ltd; Worldwide Fruit Ltd; Davis Worldwide Ltd; Hain Daniels; FreshLinc Ltd; and ukFPN Lincolnshire, supported by technology companies Contained Technologies UK Ltd; British Standards Institution (BSI); and Excelerate Technology Ltd, as well as the University of Lincoln, UK; the High-Value Manufacturing Catapult's Manufacturing Technology Centre; and the Satellite Applications Catapult.*""

* BSI Healthcare sector team announcing that they've finally created ""*a FULL neutral way to link all internal supply chain systems to drive data, analytics, and ultimately, visibility.*"" You can see the update on this [here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/courtney-foster-8a311512_origintrail-decentralized-knowledge-graph-activity-6785842064576929792-K9-i). This takes us next down the Pharma rabbit hole that started to emerge just this last week:

1. Since this was a series of tweets, and OriginTrail posts have been deleted by mods for posting twitter links, not sure for what reason, I've had to simply snap a shot of this where you can see it [here](https://postimg.cc/Y4tRs9Xd).
2. Next, you can add [2 and 2 together](https://postimg.cc/XBNtP9L7) where this is heading. ""*98% of Fortune 500 Pharmaceutical Clients Partner with BSI to mitigate risk and protect Brand Reputation*"".

**Conclusion:** I think the links and information I've provided on just the BSI part speaks for itself.

&amp;#x200B;

**GS1 Partnership**

This is another partnership that's based on standards. The entire global supply chain runs on standards developed by the [GS1](https://www.gs1.org/) organization. Systems to identify, capture, and share information among supply chain partners (including the ubiquitous bar code), were all developed over the past 45 years by GS1. [These standards](https://www.gs1.org/standards/epcis) allow for interoperability between different systems and supply chain architectures across the globe. Any blockchain-based solution to improve traceability should integrate with these legacy systems, and the OriginTrail protocol was designed from the ground up to do this. 

GS1 Digital Link is next in line creation by GS1, relying on the Decentralized Knowledge Graph, which is the ODN (OriginTrail Decentralized Network). You can watch Phil Archer explain this in this presentation [here](https://youtu.be/jJnahaZ9-Tc) (*If you don't want to spend time listening to a full 8 minutes, then go to 5:20 where Phil points to the Decentralized Knowledge Graph, which is the ODN*). In other words, barcodes and product information stored on the ODN for seamless interoperability, interconnectivity, and decentralization, linking everything together!

**Oracle**

Oracle and OriginTrail partnered up back on Dec. 8th, 2018. As posted by Oracle tweet: ""We are thrilled to partner w/@origin\_trail to deliver secure and trusted data sharing for supply chains using #blockchain technology.   

This solution is related to Automatic Dairy payments. What this is and how it functions can be seen in [this video](https://youtu.be/9-XucYs9FIM).

You can also watch Jens Lusebrink from Oracle [during the Liftoff event](https://youtu.be/UfRWKTKJOFU), where Dan Putrell from BSI was also present, explaining their involvement with TraceLabs creating solutions on the ODN.

Furthermore, one of the most important aspects of the entire OriginTrail ecosystem is the nOS, which stands for Network Operating System. What nOS does is allow companies to spend credits purchased with company fiat to directly purchase TRAC via Uniswap or any other exchange. TRAC is only utilized in the background, is directly purchased when needed, and used in nodes immediately (see [this writeup](https://medium.com/origintrail/the-network-operating-system-liquidity-provisioning-system-part-1-uniswap-integration-b38e7ae75e76) for details). As cryptocurrency never touches the company’s accounting books, it **solves the problem of mainstream companies needing to purchase and hold cryptocurrency to use the protocol**. 

&amp;#x200B;

**SBB CFF FFS** (Swiss Federal Railways)

Also during the Liftoff event, Dominik Halbeisen from SBB was present to explain the importance of utilization of ODN and why they partnered up with OriginTrail. During [this presentation,](https://youtu.be/Rzk-Z9lFaG0) if you watch this entire presentation, you'll remember my example I explained above with ""*If company A runs system X, company B system Y, and company C system Z etc."".*

Just recently Brana Rakic, who is the CTO of OriginTrail, was at the GS1 Global Forum showcasing how 9 European Railways are utilizing OriginTrail. These are just [two images](https://postimg.cc/ppsFDMyn) posted by the OriginTrail team announcing this presentation. 

&amp;#x200B;

**OneAgrix**

OneAgrix is another partnership with OT that isn't getting the PR it deserves and is always sort of forgotten among BSI, GS1, Oracle, and Swiss Railways. OneAgrix and OriginTrail [partnered up back in early 2019](https://medium.com/origintrail/trace-labs-and-oneagrix-partner-up-to-enable-halal-product-traceability-on-the-blockchain-cde5dcb0efd1) with the goal to ensure and tackle the trust deficit in the halal goods marketplace, enabling food safety and transparency. This brings tangible benefits to businesses and consumers in the USD 2.5 trillion global halal markets. 

[Here you can read](https://www.foodnavigator-asia.com/Article/2021/04/29/Tech-ambition-OneAgrix-has-dreams-of-being-the-first-halal-unicorn) about the CEO of OneAgrix Diana Sabrain, who in 2015 established OneAgrix. I would recommend you to read the article because Diana explains WHY and HOW this is made possible by the application of OriginTrail solutions. 

Note that John G. Keogh is also OneAgrix strategic advisor! It's all about complying with global standards. If you do not comply with global standards you can forget about involving your business in global enterprise solutions. There is no other way around this! OriginTrail ticks all of the boxes here. It's been built from the ground up to do just this.

&amp;#x200B;

According to the team, there are many more entities involved with OriginTrail but these are still yet to be announced. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Scientific and Academic Research**

Due to John G. Keogh's involvement with OriginTrail since the OTs ICO launch, he has been actively involved with the solution that the TraceLabs and OriginTrail are developing. As mentioned, John Keogh is an advisor and heavy promoter of OriginTrail's solution. 

Just recently, an assembly of scholars and academics have joined a scientific group in the Trace Alliance data interoperability. You can read more about this [here](https://medium.com/origintrail/meet-the-academics-and-research-institutes-taking-part-in-the-trace-alliance-data-interoperability-e0780ba2cc6b), who these individuals are and which establishments they are representing! If you do not have the time to read through the article, in short:

**Professor Samuel Fosso-Wamba,** Toulouse Business School, France 

**Professor Steve Simske**, Colorado State University, USA. 

**Associate Professor Wayne Martindale**, University of Lincoln, UK 

**Dr. Edward Smart**, a senior research fellow at the University of Portsmouth, UK 

**Professor John Breslin** (7,800 citations), Data Science Institute at the National University of Ireland Galway, previously DERI, a Semantic Web research institute established in 2003 

**Ph.D. candidate Abderahman Rejeb**, author of numerous papers on the blockchain, IoT, AI, and Augmented Reality 

The research team will be jointly coordinated by **Professors of Practice Horia Bradau** and **John G. Keogh**, McGill Centre for the Convergence of Health and Economics, and includes a department research associate 

Also, as linked and mentioned earlier, FoodOn has also joined Trace Alliance for this exact purpose. Solving Data Interoperability and Semantic Web.

&amp;#x200B;

**TraceAlliance**

The [Trace Alliance](https://alliance.origintrail.io/) is a global network of 100+ business enterprises, service providers, developers, and research institutions that share knowledge gained using the OriginTrail protocol. They have direct access to OriginTrail knowledge resources, use cases, and the latest technology releases/solutions. 

Few of the partners may already be familiar to you;

\- Deloitte 

\- [Margento R&amp;D](https://www.margento.com/)

\- Parity Tech, the team behind Polkadot

\- Emurgo, the team behind Cardano

&amp;#x200B;

**The Tokenomics Model**

OriginTrail token is a non-inflationary token. 500 Million tokens have been minted and all are in circulation. If you look at [coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/origintrail) you may notice that it says that the current circulating supply is 361Mn/500Mn. This is due to the fact that 139Mn tokens are tagged for the dev. pool and future development and maintenance of the ODN protocol.

On top of this, additional 10+ Million tokens are currently locked up in nodes and jobs.

Additional 100 Million tokens have been locked up on the new StarFleet Chain that is being launched this month and will be locked up at least until Q3 until the bridge between ETH and SFC is completed.

Meaning that currently 50% of the entire supply is completely locked and unavailable.

OriginTrail token is the life and blood of the entire system. Without it, nothing works. It is what allows the set up of nodes, it is what allows enterprises, organizations, companies, even individuals, to upload whatever data they want to share with the world. 

***How it all works***:

If you are a company and you want to upload the data on the ODN you must provide TRAC in order to do so. (*Remember nOS? Companies will acquire TRAC via nOS in fiat value and will not be interacting with crypto at all. nOS will automatically acquire fiat-equivalent of TRAC for them in order to allow for the upload of data on the ODN to be stored on running nodes.*)

A minimum of 3 nodes are required to hold a ""dataset"", or a ""job"". The length and data size will determine the cost to upload the specific datasets. This will of course depend on the area of business the company is operating within. Food traceability may not need the same length of storage as say train parts. Currently, datasets that are being uploaded to the ODN are mostly between 90 days and 5 years. You can see the live activity on the network [here](https://v5.othub.info/dashboard).

As an example, this is what happens when ""jobs"" are uploaded. I will ignore price mechanics for now as it is too technical to explain, so please disregard this part for now:

1. Data Creator creates a job for a specific size and duration. It's a 1-year job of 500kb.
2. The cost of uploading this job is 30 TRAC.
3. All active nodes on the network will attempt to bid to hold this job, only 3 will win it.
4. Once 3 nodes have ""won"" the auction, each node will provide 10 TRAC each, 30 in total, the equivalent of what the Data Creator offered. This job alone will lock 60 TRAC in total for the duration of 1 year.
5. If for whatever reason one of the nodes fail litigation, meaning the node is unavailable for a longer period of time, say several days, that node may lose the job. This will lead to loss of provided collateral (10 TRAC) and the remainder of the job will be auctioned to another node.
6. If you won a 5-year job, you don't have to wait 5 years for the job to mature in order to ""payout"" your earnings. But in order to get paid the full amount, you'll have to wait for the completion of the job!

As you can see, nodes are providing real utility and are not a wallet that you just put your tokens in and somehow they make you money. This is quite technical, but if you'd like to run OT nodes we have very well-written [guides](https://otnode.com/) to do so. Do mind that it may take you some time to set up your first node!

After ODN launched on xDAI, jobs or dataset uploads have increased substantially. In less than month, 2000 datasets have been uploaded to the ODN network. Before this, while still on ETH, 8000 datasets were uploaded over a period of 1,5 years! Meaning, the acceleration of data being uploaded and utilized is increasing by the day!

&amp;#x200B;

**Social Media Channels**

If you found this information valuable and would like to follow OriginTrail and their development more closely I recommend that you at least subscribe to their Twitter account ""OriginTrail"", as they are very active there and post updates often.

You should also follow OTs CEO Ziga Drev, who is extremely active on Twitter! 

&amp;#x200B;

**Investors and recognition**

A couple of months ago it was revealed that a crypto investment fund Alpha Sigma Capital had invested in OriginTrail. You can see their portfolio [here](https://alphasigma.fund/portfolio). As you can see, they don't have that many projects in there, but they seem to be holding quite a few interesting projects; AAVE, DOT, ADA, CEL, Quant, Solana, AGI, etc. 

They also released what could be interpreted as a ""simple"" report on OriginTrail. You can find this report [here](https://docsend.com/view/vcav3pzz9etmndqw).

World Economic Forum has been actively posting via Twitter their adoration for the OriginTrail solution since OriginTrail is part of the WEF Uplink group. Many of you may have seen this already, if not, just search Google by typing in ""WEF Using blockchain to source high-quality, vital PPE."" As I mentioned earlier, posts have been deleted due to Twitter links.

We also found out that Greg Kidd, an early investor of Twitter, Coinbase, Filecoin, and Square. Again, just use your search skills to locate the Twitter that Greg Kidd himself posted. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion**

I think this should suffice for now. I've tried to highlight what most may find most interesting. OriginTrail is a complex project and requires time and effort to really understand. The team has been around since 2011, which means they didn't start with these solutions suddenly during the crypto hype of 2017. Blockchain became a door-opener for a whole new world of possibilities to what they were creating. You can see their entire interactive progress map [here](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_klDu5PI=/).  


If you like to dip your toes more and do more research, you can navigate to [origintrailexplained](https://origintrailexplained.info/) page and dig in yourself.

Yes, I do hold TRAC myself. This post was more for educational purposes for those who may be interested in the solutions which OriginTrail is bringing to the table.

personalfinance,Advice with Elderly parents and finances UK,"Hi Folks,

Needing some advice on my parent's finances. I only have snippets here and there on the financial situation in their household as my Dad is very secretive and is getting assessed for undiagnosed schizophrenia so I am up against it to get a solid picture. They are in their late 70s now and I am seeing some troubles ahead. Aware most of this is beyond a finance forum for advice. :D

\-   There is a loan/mortgage to free collateral against their house my Dad took out at some point, this seems to be before the point when this sector was given more legislation pre 2015ish. Can this be revisited similar to remortgaging or even if I can pay it off? From the numbers mentioned it was worrying. They want to move but no idea how to approach this with an equity release over their heads.

\- They have £120k in an ISA that has an appalling interest rate. What is a good savings route for them, they don't touch this money and haven't topped it up in 10 years? Ideally, something where they can see a return and use this for something nice. I am also trying to convince them to spend it on themselves, but that's not an option I am told.    


Any help would be appreciated.",finance

So unless you're a high earner, this won't affect you (much). I made these charts about a week or two ago but I heard for the American Families Plan, individuals earning more than $452,700 and married couples earning more than $509,300 (meaning each partners could earn less than $400,000) could see a tax increase.

&amp;#x200B;

**What do you mean, ""won't affect you (much)""?**

If there's tax increases for the rich, what will the rich do? They'll take their stock market gains before the tax increases. 2020 saw huge gains so we may see a correction in the coming months. How much of a correction you ask? I don't know but I would guess 10-15% in the broader market. More if you're into speculative high growth stocks. I say that because I know a lot of you have positions on them. Careful how you invest these next few months.

And if there's tax increases for corporations, obviously they'll do whatever they can to avoid them. However even a 1% increase in their taxes (note below I mention that many corporations pay very little taxes because of loopholes) will affect their bottom line. This means earnings will be less and therefore lower stock valuations.

**So if the rich sell and corporations are being taxed more, how will that affect the stock market?**

1. Less incentive to invest due to more taxes. People will look to other investments or stay cash. (Seriously though, the tax plan won't make a huge difference unless you're a 1%er.)
2. Bonds become more [favorable](https://investor.vanguard.com/investing/taxes/government-bonds#:~:text=Income%20from%20bonds%20issued%20by%20state%2C%20city%2C%20and%20local%20governments,where%20the%20bond%20was%20issued). Income from bonds issued by state, city, and local governments (municipal bonds, or munis) is generally free from federal taxes. You will, however, have to report this income when filing your taxes. Examples: MUB, HYD, VOHIX, VWAHX.
3. ETFs and Mutual funds are more favorable. They both are taxed at the long-term capital gains rate of 0%, 15%, and 20% depending on your earnings. ETFs, however, have an advantage over mutual funds due to three reasons: 1) 2018, 89% of ETFs were passive vs. 4% of mutual funds. Less trading involved with passive. 2) Any high dividend or high interest paying securities will receive more distributions, therefore a high tax bill. 3) ETFs have greater liquidity as they are traded during market hours vs. mutual funds are traded at the beginning and end of market sessions.

\*In 2018, Goldman Sachs did a study that showed 100% of their ETFs did not pay capital gains. Broadly, 90% of ETFs did not pay capital gains compared to 39% of mutual funds.

4. Tax advantaged accounts like Roth IRA and 401K are more favorable. If you're one of the super rich, take a look at the [backdoor Roth IRA](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/backdoor-roth-ira.asp). It's a way for super rich people to put money into retirement without the contribution limits. Roth IRA contribution limit is $6,000 per year. BUT if you make more than $140,000 as a single or $206,000 filing jointly as married then you cannot contribute to a Roth IRA. The easiest way to get by this is converting a traditional IRA account to a Roth IRA account.

&amp;#x200B;

What does history [say](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/tax-hikes-history#:~:text=In%20the%2013%20previous%20instances,the%20data%20in%20the%20calendar) about stock market performance after tax increases?

""In the 13 previous instances of tax increases just since 1950, the S&amp;P 500, the stock index that tracks most of the major companies in the US, has shown higher average returns, and higher odds of an advance, in times when taxes are increasing, according to Chisholm's research, which analyzed the data in the calendar year of the tax changes, plus the year prior and year after. This pattern holds true even when you drill down into key sectors of the S&amp;P 500."" Here's a [chart](https://i.imgur.com/2MaBjOp.png) of the S&amp;P500 performance after tax increases. Not too bad eh?

&amp;#x200B;

**What's happening now with the current tax law?**

* 91 Fortune 500 companies paid $0 in federal corporate taxes. Amazon, Chevron, Halliburton, and IBM are some of those companies. Corporate tax rate is currently 21%.
* 56 Fortune 500 companies paid 0-5% on their 2018 income.
* 2017 tax bill cut the average rate that corporations paid in half from 16 percent to less than 8 percent in 2018. I couldn't find any data on this but its due to loopholes in the tax system.

**The Made in America Tax plan**

* Will raise over $2 trillion over the next 15 years and more than pay for the mostly one-time investments in the American Jobs Plan and then reduce deficits on a permanent basis.
* Increase corporate tax rate at 28% from 21%
* Right now, the tax code rewards U.S. multinational corporations that shift profits and jobs overseas with a tax exemption for the first ten percent return on foreign assets, and the rest is taxed at half the domestic tax rate.
* The proposal will increase the minimum tax on U.S. corporations to 21 percent and calculate it on a country-by-country basis so it hits profits in tax havens. It will also eliminate the rule that allows U.S. companies to pay zero taxes on the first 10 percent of return when they locate investments in foreign countries.
* The United States is now seeking a global agreement on a strong minimum tax through multilateral negotiations.
* Invert the current law in which U.S. corporations can acquire or merge with a foreign company to avoid U.S. taxes by claiming to be a foreign company, even though their place of management and operations are in the United States.
* A proposal that companies can no longer write off expenses that come from offshoring jobs. Instead a tax credit will be proposed to support onshoring jobs.
* Invert a Trump tax law for “Foreign Derived Intangible Income” (FDII), which gave corporations a tax break for shifting assets abroad and is ineffective at encouraging corporations to invest in R&amp;D. Instead the revenue will be used to expand more effective R&amp;D investment incentives.
* Enact a minimum tax of 15% on large corporations’ book income.
* Eliminate tax preferences (worth billions of dollars) for fossil fuels and make sure polluting industries pay for environmental clean up.
* Increase enforcement for tax evasion. Typical workers’ wages are reported to the IRS and their employer withholds, so they pay all the taxes they owe. By contrast, large corporations have at their disposal loopholes they exploit to avoid or evade tax liabilities, and an army of high-paid tax advisors and accountants who help them get away with this. At the same time, an under-funded IRS lacks the capacity to scrutinize these suspect tax maneuvers: A decade ago, essentially all large corporations were audited annually by the IRS; today, audit rates are less than 50 percent.

&amp;#x200B;

**So what should I do to prepare if this bill passes?**

Nothing different honestly. Keep investing. DCA - dollar cost average if your stocks drop. Stay the course in your high conviction names. De-risk if you have to by investing in safer investments like index funds or ETFs. I know a lot of you are into SPAX (special purpose acquisition companies. I spelled it this way in case this sub banned the real acronym) and other speculative companies. There's almost 500 of them out there. 217 of those were from 2020. To be honest, 1% of those companies will moon. Most of them won't see a return for years. Are you willing to hold them without knowing they will moon in 5-10 years? Some may not even make a return. Make sure you understand market conditions. Stocks really do go up but its only the ones that are backed by strong earnings and potential. Don't get burned. Money is not everything but it's a tool to bring you financial freedom sooner in life. You know what they say, ""there's only two things guaranteed in life: death and taxes"".",finance

personalfinance,Thinking about selling my house to OpenDoor.,"Looking for some advice. 

So I've come across OpenDoor after my friend sold his mother in-laws house for an large amount of money for the type of house it was. So I thought hey why don't I check it out since my house is bigger, newer and in a nicer neighborhood. I bought my house for $242k and OpenDoor is saying they will buy my house for about $400k! And maybe even more after a video walk through which I believe will only up the value. I've only been in the house for 2 years and I refinanced last year to drop my interest rate almost 2% so I'm still at $240k.

My thoughts are that I could sell the house and be left with around $135k after closing costs and then get two houses and have money for a wedding. Putting 20% down on both and renting one out while living in the other.

My goal is to own multiple properties so my passive income is high enough that our jobs become optional and can be used to just retire earlier. I have no other debt. 

Am I not seeing something here? Or am I on the right track?",finance
CryptoCurrency,Charlie Munger is a smart guy with dumb criticisms of Bitcoin,"People keep using these same criticisms of Bitcoin that  Berkshire Hathaway Vice Chairman Charlie Munger did Saturday. He's smart enough that he should know better.

I think I should say modestly that the whole damn development is disgusting and contrary to the interests of civilization.""

Are there criminals that use Bitcoin for crime? Absolutely, but percentage-wise, do you think there's more crime being committed with Bitcoin or the dollar? Are the drug dealers refusing to sell heroin unless they're paid in Bitcoin? If you buy a stolen gun, do you think the person selling it you will want cash or bitcoin sent to them from your Coinbase account?

As to, creating a ""financial product out of thin air,"" that's our entire monetary system. The Fed printed 9 trillion dollars last year based on the fact that they wanted 9 trillion dollars. The time when our money was backed by gold is long gone. At one point, even gold itself was a ""new financial product (created) out of thin air.""

You can make valid criticisms of every form of currency, Bitcoin included, but Munger's criticisms don't hold up well under scrutiny.",cryptocurrency

I know it's become a meme at this point but the US stock market looks like it's about to get REKT

People look at the over valuations in crypto and think they are insane; but forget about Theranos and NIKOLA. Worse of all Tesla is probably the most ridiculous out of the bunch.

I'm not saying we about to get Great Depression 2 Electric Vehicle. But at least a pull back maybe in May. Due to all the optimism in the air

Personally  feel that this might kill the ""shit coin market"". But push the Top coins up and some mid caps. Also feel that the Fed and Government can't assist based on that: 

1. No bail out due to massive Covid19 printing; risk of inflation 
2. $ index current downward trend

CryptoCurrency,Is there a difference between Bitconnect and Safemoon? Laymen's Perspective.,"Now that you have downvoted me because i said ""safemoon"", you can use this to judge whether I am as stupid as you think.

After watching the AMA they said they were planning to do an exchange. The first thing that popped into my head was the [BItconnect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitconnect) FUD.

Especially when they said that other tokens would be taxed like safemoon and distributed on their exchange with ""tokenomics"". Then it hit me. 

BItconnect was able to scam people as their ""rewarding"" interest rate was relative to bitcoins FIAT value shrouding transactions 

with Safemoon tokenomics, 10% of the token traded is taxed and redistributed to the community, burned , and about 2.5% goes to dev liquidity.  

if these same tokenomics are applied to an exchange it would be very much like a [SAvings and loan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savings_and_loan_association) would it not? while they could not ""burn"" something like bitcoin, it would still get redistributed to user's wallets and the liquidity would be transparent exchange profits

dogecoin,Negative interest rates and the D(oge).,"Firstly, do only good every day in this big mad world . :-)

No crystal ball here, but negative interest rates in Japan, Denmark, the Netherlands and elsewhere (including some recent announcements) could play into Doge diamond paws. 

According to CFI, negative interest rates are designed to ""increase borrowing during economic recession"" (https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/finance/negative-interest-rates/). Low return on sleepy savings that also face inflation? You borrow from your bank, they do the things, and you pay them the principle and interest. 

Denmark: savings over 100,000 kroner in bank attracts negative interest. 

Swiss National Bank -0.75% since 2015.

But not everyone responds to low/no/negative interest on their savings by wanting to take on debt instead. Many people already have nervous stomachs, or don't have the job security or rootedness to commit to one residential area for the long term. The young are growing up with the internets and are gaining awareness of tiny homes, alternatives to brick and mortar, how too much stuff can stifle creativity and focus, divorce rates, how plans can be disrupted, how workplaces can be flexible with contact time, and, significantly, the value of community.

Could crypto in the 2020s be(come) an avenue that people traverse in an attempt to get a decent deposit down for housing, educating their children or travel in the context of negative interest on savings?  Carries risk, but seriously, the fluctuations we have seen in the last month seem to signal increasing mainstream adoption, so people getting onboard at different times and with different strategies is already disruptive to the status-quo. It's a question of how disruptive.

Wonder how the big banks (and governments tax policy wise) will respond in the next 5 years. Any forecasts? Might they need to work harder to secure their monopoly on holding clients' savings?

Do you think we are in the 'Golden Ages' of crypto as we risk a dark ages in some other respects?

* *Start a government project that encourages citizens to incrementally privatize all the government functions that can be privatized, then start redirecting all the money that's been saved by transfering the expenses of those functions to now-profitable private enterprises, as well as the extra money made on top of that through the taxation of these enterprises, to repaying the national debt. Not only would the GDP rise substantially due to this increase in productivity and afford opportunities for the attainment of wealth to a lot of people, but the tasks that were previously run by the government will likely be run far more effeciently and conveniently in the hands of private citizens (think USPS vs FedEx).*

I am from the US. My fiance and I are looking to buy a house soon. As a result of the pandemic,  our wedding has been postponed multiple times. Our plan was to get married and then buy a house.  However, the wedding doesn't seem to be happening anytime soon. I want to know if there would be a difference in the interest rate(for the mortgage) if we apply jointly as an engaged (legally, 2 single individuals) couple vs a married couple. Trying to understand if being married legally,  helps in any part of the whole house buying process. 

Any suggestion is welcome! Thank you.",finance

CryptoCurrency,These are the risks when ditching your bank account for high stablecoin APYs,"I apologize in advance for the length, but there is a lot to cover here and I’ve tried to be as thorough as possible.

I’ve noticed a lot of folks on this sub asking about crypto-lending platforms and what they should consider before abandoning their APY-challenged, traditional savings accounts and parking all of their money in stablecoin via BlockFi, Nexo, Celsius, Voyager or others. I thought it would be valuable to go over what I think are the most significant risks involved with this approach and thus what people should be thinking about before making the switch and going all-in. This is by no means an exhaustive list, but I do think these are the most material risks. I’ve also included some risk mitigation techniques that I am actively using in hopes that others will find them useful as well.

**Counterparty risk/risk of default**

The reason interest rates are so high on these platforms is because your crypto is not sitting safely in cold storage, but rather is actively being loaned out. People often mistake the personal loans that they can take from these companies as the main type of lending that they do. That is not the case however, and most of these companies are actually loaning your crypto on a much bigger scale. This comes with considerable counterparty risk regardless of what the company has advertised as their LTV. The reality is that there is a non-zero risk of each company not being able to call back its loaned capital (your crypto). This risk is exacerbated by extreme market conditions or tail events which can lead to significant losses for the company. In these cases, it would be you and your crypto on the hook.

A risk mitigation strategy that I practice is to spread my funds across multiple companies to avoid a total loss if one platform experiences issues with defaults. However, given that the risk intensifies with extreme market conditions, it’s possible that several companies could be impacted at once. Continuing to hold at least some funds in fiat further mitigates this risk.

**Cyber risk**

This is the risk of a hack to either your personal account or the platform itself. One broad mitigation technique is again to spread funds across multiple platforms to avoid a total loss if one of your accounts or one platform is hacked.

Account hack: This risk is considerably greater than the same thing happening to your online bank for example, given that once crypto is gone, it’s gone. The mitigation of this risk in entirely in your hands, however. Recommended actions include using a different, non-public email address for each platform that you use, setting strong, unique passwords for each account, enabling 2FA through an app rather than via SMS, and whitelisting addresses where available.

Platform hack: Unlike account hacks, this risk is generally totally out of your control. There have been hacks to platforms in the past with significant losses and there will be hacks again in the future. Although this does not eliminate the risk, it is important to use only companies that you consider trustworthy and that demonstrate their concern for cybersecurity. While requiring that the company has some sort of insurance coverage is a good strategy, keep in mind that in the event of an extreme loss of assets, it is unlikely that their insurance coverage would even come close to making you whole.

One broad mitigation technique for both types of hacks is again to spread funds across multiple platforms to avoid a total loss if one of your accounts or one platform is hacked.

**""Stablecoin risk""**

The question regarding these platforms is often, “Why shouldn’t I put all my savings in stablecoin on &lt;insert platform&gt; and earn 8.5% APY?” Setting aside the first two risks, there is also the risk that stablecoins are USD pegged, but they still aren’t USD. Without going into too much detail here (because you could write a whole post comparing/contrasting stablecoins and each one’s actual stability) what it essentially comes down to is that the value of these stablecoins depends entirely on the adequacy of their reserves and whether they are fully-backed and always-exchangeable for actual USD. Let’s call it the USD-standard. While most are audited, there still exists a non-zero risk that the USD-standard fails either through insolvency, fraud or something else. Obviously your funds held in stablecoin are not insured by any government backed insurance programs, so any risk event leading to those stablecoins not being as stable as advertised would fall on you. A mitigation technique that I practice here is to not hold all of my funds in one specific stablecoin, but rather spread out across USDC, GUSD, BUSD to avoid a total loss given an issue with one of them.

**Investment/FX risks**

We can call this an honorable mention since, in comparison to the first three, its high frequency/low severity nature and ability to be mitigated or avoided entirely make it less significant. Not only that, but there are scenarios where these risks yield favorable outcomes. First of all, by investment risk I’m referring to the option that many platforms have of receiving flex interest or interest not in-kind. You deposit stablecoin and they pay you interest in Bitcoin. There is clear investment risk here as a receiving your interest payments in a volatile asset could negate your gains and could leave you even worse off than the 0.5% APY your bank offered. In terms of FX risk, this impacts a lot of folks outside of the US whose options for stablecoins are almost exclusively USD pegged. Unfavorable movements in the FX rate between your native currency and USD could result in both your capital and interest payments being worth less to you than initial deposit.

Mitigating/avoiding the first is relatively straightforward here. Either earn your interest-in-kind or in assets you believe have upside while knowing that you are taking a risk. In terms of FX, this is harder to mitigate if using USD stablecoin is what’s required to participate. However, you may be offsetting some currency risk to begin with by diversifying your savings across more than just your native currency.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Help with my plan for graduate school loans,"I'm going to graduate school for a healthcare career. The degree will take 3 years (plus a few months as I get certified before I start earning an income). I currently have 100% of my living expenses (plus some cash for books and supplies) saved up in cash. However, I'll need to take out about $111K in loans total strictly for tuition. I will not be able to work during this type of program. Thankfully, the income from this job is a pretty good one, so I plan on paying off these loans as quickly as I can at the completion of my program. I'm writing down my plan below, and I have some specific questions. If you're able to answer these questions, I would appreciate it. Any other input is appreciated too!

My plan goes as follows: I'll be taking a direct unsubsidized loan for each of the three years: $20.5K each year. Additionally in my second year, I'll be taking out a $10K GradPLUS loan. In my third year, I'll also be taking out a $40K GradPLUS loan. I determined this plan based off of an Excel budget I have accounting for my bank account balance, living expenses, tuition, and the loans and fees associated. I made sure this loan schedule plans to have 6 months living expenses minimum in my bank account at all times throughout the program.

I understand that at initiation of each loan, I'll be paying origination fees (1% for direct unsubsidized, 4.5% for GradPLUS). Also, I understand that interest will accrue the second I take each loan out. With my calculations using amortization spreadsheets (given an interest rate of 4.3% for direct unsubsidized and 5.3% for GradPLUS), this results in about $11.3K in interest accrued by the time I end my program.

My questions are:

1) Do you have any comment on the advice of my school's financial advisor? He recommended that I should be looking at direct unsubsidized loans first, which I agree with. However, he stated to take private loans BEFORE GradPLUS loans because private loans are at an all time low interest rate right now (this I'm unsure about because of bad things I've heard anecdotally from family members). He also said to only go for a fixed rate (which I agree with). What do you think about this advice?

2) For the types of loans I'll be taking out, should I be looking at consolidating them after I graduate?

3) Is there any general advice you have regarding either direct unsubsidized loans or GradPLUS loans that you wish you knew about prior to taking them out? What was your personal experience with graduate school loans, if any?",finance
dogecoin,Capital Gains and Inflation.,"So we all want DOGE to be a regularly traded currency. But as I'm sure many of you know, when you do anything except buy crypto or transfer crypto (generally speaking) you have to report capital gains, and currently crypto is considered a property possession.

So let's keep this ""ah-real"" simple.

Say in the future the Federal money printer ends up putting us in a venezuela situation where, let's say, a loaf of bread is $10 dollars but is only 1 DOGE. 
Let's further theorize you have to pay 10% capital gains on that singular DOGE coin. 
Taxes happen yada-yada-yada and you end up having to payback $1 inflated dollar to ol Uncle Sam where it costs $10+ fees to get doge.

So the best way I can put this into a question is:
""If I'm paying 10% tax on every purchase, would it make feasible sense to use DOGE (or any crypto for that reason) as an everyday currency? Wouldn't you be losing money in taxes and having to pay fees just to purchase it and move it around? (This is assuming of course we aren't paying employees/getting paid in DOGECOIN).",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,Stop saying that old Rich dudes are opposed to cryptocurrency because they don't understand it,"They don't like it because they are in a unique position to take advantage of the weakness of Fiat currencies. You can basically short a fiat currency by taking out a large loan when you know that the currency is going to experience significant inflation in the near future and immediately using that Fiat to purchase real estate or other real property. After the currency experiences significant monetary inflation that devalues the currency and drives price inflation that outpaces the interest rate on that loan, you can then liquid those assets you have purchased, you use that inflated currency to pay off that loan, and effectively net a profit.

  


  


  


For example, to keep math simple let's say you take out a loan of $100 and use that to purchase whatever real property. M1 is then inflated by 60% as happened the last 18 months. You wait for price inflation to reflect the devaluation of that currency and now it cost around sixty percent more Fiat to buy the same real property that you already purchased. But the interest rate on your loan was only 15%. So now you sell that real property for $160, pay $115 to pay off the loan ( if we pretend for the sake of Simplicity that you haven't made any payments before that time) and you are left with $45 that you did not have at the beginning. Your loan is completely paid off and you no longer have that real property, so that's a wash. Except you now have $45 that you did not originally have. It only has the purchasing power that a little over $9 would have had prior to the devaluation of the currency, but that is still new purchasing power that you did not have at the beginning.

  


  


  


That is the real reason the wealthy like Fiat currencies and are opposed to the rise of cryptocurrencies. Because they understand the nature of fiat, monetary inflation, and the devaluation of Fiat currencies, and they purchase so much real estate and other real property not only for tax reasons but because they are effectively shorting the dollar and other fiat currencies the same way you or I would short a stock. Cryptocurrencies are resistant to monetary inflation. Even those that are inflationary have a limit on that inflation imposed upon them at a technological level that would require 51% control to change.

  


  


They are not opposed to cryptocurrencies because they do not understand them. They are opposed to cryptocurrencies because cryptocurrencies take away their ability to use the wealth they already control too Short fiat currency ( and take advantage of other Fiat shenanigans) and further enrich themselves as a profit off the collapse of Nations and governments. They hate the idea of transitioning to these cryptocurrencies for the same reason that people who make their living in the stock market are opposed to doing away with options or short selling stock. They are neither ignorant nor stupid.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,The journey of a crypto noob.,"TLDR; The learning curve of getting into crypto is HUGE. No step of the way is easy. Mass adoption seems like it's a long, long way off, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. This is my journey so far, as a crypto noob these past couple of months.

&amp;#x200B;

I got into crypto like many new people within the past couple of months during this awesome bull market.

While still a noob, I've put dozens and dozens of hours into research. I've done a deep dive these past couple of months.

One of my skills in life is learning a new skill through research. I believe it's because I'm a patient and methodical person.

That being said, learning crypto has been one of the hardest things I've ever tried.

The first step of the journey is you have to 'try' to understand Bitcoin, which is not easy for someone new to the space.To understand BTC, you have to understand the blockchain... Another difficult thig to wrap your head around.

Great, now you know WHAT Bitcoin is. Now you really need to understand WHY Bitcoin is so important.

The only way to truly do this is to do a deep dive on the history of the worlds economy. That's right campers, it's time to learn about the massive flaws of every fiat based economy, in human history.

Doing so will lead you to today's economy, which is a dumpster fire(if you didn't already know).

After this understanding of the failure of fiat economics, and what a bad place most modern economies are in right now, you'll have a much better appreciation for how awesome Bitcoin is, and how vital it is to our future.Now you understand what all the hype is! Yes! Now I understand what Bitcoin is, and why it's the future!

All of this was just to understand what Bitcoin is, and why it's important.

Learning about Bitcoin of course leads to other alt coins and Ethereum. Now you have to do a deep dive on all of those things.

Some coins are pretty straight forward, but most others require a special deep dive to understand what they do.Some are fake, but make people thousands, or millions of dollars.This coin was LOVED by all, but turned out to be a total scam and tons of people lost a lot of money.Half the people love a coin, while the other half claim it's shite.

You hear a lot about Ethereum, which is not another coin like you originally thought, but a whole system with layers and layers of new things to know. Ethereum takes just as long to understand as it took to understand Bitcoin. Turns out, it's almost as important as Bitcoin, maybe more depending on who you talk to.Enter DEFI.

I'm not going to lie, I thought DEFI was just another altcoin that people were talking about.

While not as difficult to understand as Bitcoin, grasping DEFI(the system of Decentralized Finance) is it's own deep dive to be able to understand the what and why of it. And you can't just skip DEFI. It's integral to the whole crypto universe.

Eventually, you'll get to the point where you feel comfortable in purchasing your own slice of crypto cake.Time to log into Binance and place an order!Oh wait, I'm in the USA and Binance isn't permitted here. That's a bit weird.

Oh well, luckily there's [Binance.us](https://Binance.us). Which turns out to be a completely different company, and doesn't have many of the coins you were excited about.

Hmm, let's give Coinbase a shot. I'm hearing a lot of promising things about them.Set up wasn't too bad. Linking my bank account was a little odd because the Plaid network doesn't play well my bank(PNC). Apparently PNC hates Plaid and is suing them for using their logo. Ok, that's not great.Let's push through though because I really want to buy some ETH and BTC.

I buy my first few hundred dollars of BTC and ETH on Coinbase. Finally!

First step down. Holy crap, that was a lot. It was weeks to get to this point, and I still feel like a small child in the crypto world.

What's that? Coinbase Pro has cheaper fee's and is a free upgrade to Coinbase? Okkaayy, good to know. Let's start using that now, though it would of been nice to know that little secret before hand.

I had a few others coins that I was interested in. To get these coins I had to create accounts on two other exchanges. I have accounts on 4 exchanges right now which seems a bit silly.

Time goes by a bit, still doing research.

Hearing terms such as Yield Farming, staking, halvings, ETH 2.0, London upgrade, gas fee's, stable coins, cold and hot wallets, SEC lawsuits, proof of work, etc. SO MUCH TO LEARN

I'm currently looking into putting a chunk onto the BlockFi network to get a good interest rate. I'm literally trying to DEFI guys!

Well guess what, they use Plaid and Plaid hates my bank, and they won't let me manually add my account info, like most of the other exchanges. That sucks.

Guess I can just buy BTC on Coinbase and transfer it to BlockFi. What's that? The fee is going to be what? Whoa...

BlockFi uses Gemini, and Gemini will allow you to use your bank if you send them a wire transfer first(then you can do ACH). Ok, that's a lot, but luckily Gemini trades with BlockFi MUCH cheaper because they're pals. Time to sign up for Gemini! They closed my account and blocked me before I even set up payment. What?

That's right folks, Gemini has a long history of just blocking people, without telling them why, ever.I literally have no idea why they won't allow me to have an account.

Well, there goes that idea. Back to using Coinbase to transfer funds to BlockFi and just eating the crazy fee's.

This all leads me to where I am now, today. Trying to figure out to transfer crypto between exchanges and wallets and not paying crazy fee's.

It's a lot my crypto friends.A LOT.And I'm a patient person who likes to research.It feels like I'll never have a good enough grasp on all of this.

Now don't get me wrong, I'm enjoying this journey.I'm a believer. My wife and I have dove in head first.We're excited for this bull run, but also looking forward to the bear market so we can really get in.

It's exciting. It's just a lot.

So much so that I'm worried about adoption. It feels like it's soooo far away. I know mass adoption is key to the cryptoverse.

Things need to change so much. The mass population does not want to do what I'm doing right now. Not even a little.

I know things will get better and easier as time goes on, which is what makes me not too worried about things right now.

Crypto is taking off even with the crazy complexity. What happens as it get's easier and easier? More and more people will dive in. That's exciting.

Sorry for the crazy rant. It's just that I spent all day today trying to do something that should of been super easy, and I had to vent.

I definitely have the crazy Charlie vibe today.

Cheers all.

Forex,US GDP: Sharpest Rise In Almost 40 years,"Preliminary data suggests that growth in Europe’s largest economy contracted more than expected in the first quarter of 2021. German GDP slowed to -1.7% against 0.3% in the previous quarter. Household consumption was the main factor in the decline. Unsurprisingly, the German ifo Business Climate report indicated respondents were more pessimistic about economic conditions, which may be cause for concern especially as exports have driven much of the country’s growth. 

&amp;#x200B;

The U.S. economy fared much better in terms of growth than its European counterpart. GDP registered a 6.4% pace of growth which was slightly lower than forecast but represented the fastest rate of first quarter growth since 1984. Labour market statistics continue to show an encouraging trend, as fewer new claims for unemployment support were filed in the week ending 25th April. A total of 553,000 new filings were made, which is a decline towards levels not seen since March 2020. Federal Reserve Chairman, Powell, avoided talk of tapering current stimulus; reiterating that continuous improvements would need to be seen, primarily in labour markets. Forecasts suggest that inflation may overshoot the target rate, yet the Fed has attributed this to base effects and bottlenecks, which it considers temporary.  

&amp;#x200B;

The pace of recovery appears to be slowing for China’s manufacturing sector, which recorded 51.1% growth in April. Blame for the slowdown was assigned to supply-side disruptions yet demand appears to be cooling in the construction sector. The result may indicate a stall in economic growth for the second quarter. The Bank Of Japan decided to keep current monetary policy measures unchanged, but admitted that the price stability mandate will not be met right through to 2023. The bank also stands prepared to extend the current pandemic stimulus package, if needed.",finance
dogecoin,Attention: you are in possession of a revolutionary coin,"I didn’t think this when I started buying Doge, but the past few weeks have made it abundantly clear: we are dealing with a revolutionary coin. Do not take this responsibility lightly, you must hodl. 

What we have here is an enormously successful currency birthed of love and humor and Doing Only Good Everyday. We have everyone from the chairman of the Federal Reserve (historically the most ponzied of schemes) dissing it, to establishment hacks like Jim Cramer and Bill Maher. Not to knock them I actually quite like all of their personalities, but on a subconscious level we need to understand that this coin is reprehensible to the ruling class and thus truly is the people’s currency. 

So what you must do is simply HODL. The coin is more powerful than you as an individual and you must submit and let it take you where it needs to go. This is no longer an investment it is a symbol of protest. We are showing the world that a functional monetary system needn’t connect itself with implications of enslavement via debt.

CryptoCurrency,"Take gains, but for what?","I only started my journey in crypto a month and a half ago. I’ve been learning as much as I can, much of which is from this community and the advice, discussions, and links you’ve provided (thank you). I’ve been taking the advice seriously, but there is one piece of advice I need some additional guidance on: Don’t be afraid to take some gains.

My portfolio is a little diversified across a few of the major players and isn’t a significant amount (per the advice to only invest what you’re willing to lose), but in this short time I’ve been lucky enough to have a 33% increase in value. So I’ve begun to think about that … to take some gains.

But what should I do with those gains?

Besides our mortgage we’re debt free (as of this year) and we can pay all of our bills. We’ve got IRA and 401(k) and emergency savings. I guess we could contribute more to the IRA since we’re not even close to maxing out those contributions, but that’s essentially moving money from one investment to another. We’re in our 30s, so we can handle a higher amount of risk in our overall financial picture, which is why I felt comfortable throwing some money in the crypto colosseum.

We have all the furniture and kitchen gadgets we need and have room for, but maybe we could save up to redo the bathroom. But I feel like when we actually want to do that we can withdraw from the crypto at that point instead of now and hopefully benefit from further gains in the meantime.

The last thought I had was keeping those gains working for us instead of earning essentially nothing in a savings account. The most obvious option to me is converting a chunk into DAI to take advantage of its stable value and earning the 2% promotional interest for holding it in Coinbase. From what I understand, that’s significantly higher than the going interest rate for DAI, so I’m not sure how long that rate will last.

So what are some other options I’m missing or is converting some to DAI a decent enough idea?

I have no other debt and this would be it . I anticipate that next year the bear market will hit and as soon as it does ,it’s all going into eth and then we hold with diamond hands.

Inflation will hit us hard in the coming years. We literally created 40 percent of circulating money last year. Consequences will come sooner or later. In fact I already see it when I go to the store and a gas hotdog cost me 5 bucks , or a bottle of ranch cost me 4.29

Leveraging my loan and using it to buy crypto , a deflationary asset Seems to be the smart thing. 

Any arguments against this line of thinking ?

The richest people use their assets as leverage to make more money.

cardano,How younger generations in developing nations are turning the tide against corruption and why Cardano is seriously helpful,"Going back to my previous [ramblings](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/n1lut1/real_life_examples_and_the_value_proposition_to/) the other day on this forum, and it would be worth having a read of this to frame the context of what I'm about to discuss here.

Full disclosure again - I swear a lot because, Australia. If you have an issue, hire a therapist to fucking deal with it. 

We can all agree corruption is known to be a big issue with developing nations. Most people think this is just a 3rd world issue but this bullshit happens in all the western world, especially the richest nations. I call it organised corruption, especially here in Australia, the scam is way more fucking convoluted even to the point that John Oliver can't even do a 20 minute segment exposing corruption in one of those seemingly trivial stories about pesticides or some shit - you know the one which ends in a fiery explosion and him yelling ""Fuck you Monsanto"" at the end of the segment so that Buzzfeed can write their latest clickbait about OMG John Oliver dropping a bomb followed by an Obama Mic Drop.gif insert and you feel good even though not much really changes cos the world is driven by ineffectual cunts on twitter, but that's a whole different topic. Fuck I'm too cynical for this shit.  

Anyway...Corruption can be a whole assortment of scales, from the classic ""slip the yellow envelope under the table to the guy at a shipping port"", all the way to the ""establishment of horticultural project awarded to the contractor which happens to be a company owned by the brother of the governor in the province you're wanting to exploit, agreed to on the condition you hold the official state celebration party with a minimum bar tab disproportionately higher than the number of attendees, at the restaurant of the hotel which is owned by the governors son"". 

Point is corruption has the dimensions of being simple in an ecosystem without recordkeeping or convoluted, in an ecosystem that requires too much recordkeeping. 

So why does Cardano help this process?

Well let's first go to IOHK's clear strategy and focus area - the youth. There's a term coined by a Ghanan scholar George Ayittey - ""Hippos vs Cheetahs"" - I strongly encourage you to watch his [TED Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnepHUYFqgg&amp;ab_channel=TED) which explains the historical context along with the future context of how the youth in Africa are fast/vibrant/savvy and more inclined to do the ""right thing"" - i.e want a framework/foundation to operate on, instead of a random blank canvas of nepotism and corruption. He says this cheetah generation is a ""new breed of Africans,"" taking their futures into their own hands, instead of waiting for politicians to empower them. Another prominent point (in his words) he makes is how western organisations come to Africa to help, but outline that despite the well intentions it is the ""blind leading the clueless"". 

IOHK isn't some feelgood bullshit Rich-Family-Trust-Foundation. They're building a solid business long term - by being the platform of use. You look at IOHK's embedding in parts of Africa and you can clearly see they aren't trying to solve problems, they're trying to provide tools for locals to solve problems. HUGE difference. How do we know this works? Google did it to us. We started with a useful search engine, then they started introducing a whole assortment of tools like Email, Shared drives, maps, calendar, Android - an ecosystem which we all have transitioned into. (Which surprises me that they don't already link up with IOHK...) 

The strategy of youth/education as a first port of call is a way of empowering them to assist their entrepreneurial spirits. The youth work faster and are more ambitious and less jaded. 

Once you start registering identity management (Atala Prism), and transitioning to the digital recordkeeping, it starts to become difficult to fabricate paperwork. Recordkeeping creates transparency. Transparency changes culture. Transparency leads to accountability which, through no choice, forces people to do the right thing, like if an American cop was no longer able to turn their webcam off, they'd have to do the right thing ([oooof](https://tenor.com/view/too-soon-western-cowboy-movie-cowboys-wild-west-gif-5359084)).

Rolling in Smart contracts into the private sector means they're all on the same established framework, and templates for agreements and contracts can be made between parties, along with bound equities. I think there's still a long ways to go with this. But the benefits we keep hearing about are Transparency, Traceability, Auditability, Permanency, and Credibility - all introduced as a result of the blockchain and the IOHK applications to offer private enterprise and government, I can see the value add this has to a society in the reduction of a corruption index, and an improvement in credit rating. 

I think of a person named Jeff. Jeff went to an Ethiopian school, eventually to university and now has an ID and his degree on the blockchain. Jeff sets up a business, all his agreements and transactions are on the blockchain, forcing his suppliers and his clients to use the blockchain. Jeff can securely demonstrate his credentials, his track record as a business owner, thus his ranking is up there. Jeff wants to get a loan, the bank gets access to review his records on the blockchain, and see's he's of good standing, and enable him access to further funds - The banks can bet on Jeff. His interest rates are low because Jeff is reliable. Insurance companies can look at Jeff's records on the blockchain and review their premiums. Jeff as a consumer can compete with others. So Health, Insurance, Banking, Education, Transactions are all on this blockchain. If Jeff never leveraged the blockchain, he's restricted to his local connections, and the people that he's engaged with and know him, a longer verification process is required to give him the good standing - His efforts are hampered. So being on the blockchain opens Jeff's market opportunities not just to his town, but anywhere/anyone who uses the Cardano chain as a framework for their own trades/services. It becomes a standard. A guy doing business in Thailand can reach out and leverage Jeff as a reputable supplier, and given both are on the blockchain under varying capacities, they can make customer/vendor assessments reliably and decide if they should engage in an agreement. 

OF COURSE this sort of shit is easier said than done. Adoption requires things to be stable, easy to understand - requiring real life examples, easier to use than the current model, convenient, without barriers of use, and under the context of corruption - more trustworthy. 

Again, just some ramblings, I probably got some shit wrong. I'm still trying to get my head around this, but I can see some real benefits in the approach IOHK is taking. 

TL/DR: 

In the year 2041, Dogecoin becomes the standard currency for entire continent of Africa. Smart contracts done in the form of memes and NFT's. As a result, corruption index in Africa falls to Scandinavian levels. Doge Avatar NFT to star in third Lion King reboot. Cardano eventually becomes a type of pasta manufactured by IOHK Alonzo Foods Inc / Kraft.",cryptocurrency
cardano,Cardano Rumor Rundown MAY 3 2021,"Hey Everyone!

Let's go....

Newly covered today: 

1. Charlie Munger thinks crypto is “disgusting”. That’s a wonderful thing because it tells you how early you are. This is especially true in Cardano which is a project that leads with empathy for the developing world. Will he still call that disgusting if we’ve brought financial inclusiveness to an entire continent in five or ten years.  Probably he won’t say anything because he won’t have lived that long. But, you get the point. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/01/charlie-munger-calls-bitcoin-disgusting-and-contrary-to-the-interests-of-civilization.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/01/charlie-munger-calls-bitcoin-disgusting-and-contrary-to-the-interests-of-civilization.html)
2. The state authorities in Wyoming are so far ahead of the curve it’s scary. Now they’re putting aside $4 million for staking. On the private side, Caitlin Long should be declared a state treasure for making a lot of this happen. [https://twitter.com/Cardanians\_io/status/1388756653311414272](https://twitter.com/Cardanians_io/status/1388756653311414272) [https://decrypt.co/69390/university-wyoming-generate-revenue-crypto-staking](https://decrypt.co/69390/university-wyoming-generate-revenue-crypto-staking)

Recently covered items (complete list at www.armyofspies.net):

1. Cardano is now being used as a traceability solution in conjunction with Scantrust for wine from the nation-state of Georgia.  This is a great use case for the Cardano blockchain! [https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/cardano-reveals-its-first-supply-chain-solution-in-association-with-scantrust/ https://www.scantrust.com/](https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/cardano-reveals-its-first-supply-chain-solution-in-association-with-scantrust/)
2. The latest roadmap video from Charles covered a lot of ground. We’ll tackle it piece by piece. [https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM](https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM)
3. Ourobouros Omega.  Ourobouros Classic 2016 was a “theoretical artifact” that IOHK could build upon.  Ourobouros Praos was 2017 and it’s still running now.  Ourobouros Genesis was 2018. Ourobouros Omega is going to be the capstone. It will be a rollup of all the previous iterations plus Redux, Chronos, Ledger Combiners, and some things they’ve learned from the larger industry. The paper and a prototype will be this year. We want to be there by Cardano 2025.
4. Light Clients/Wallets (e.g. Yoroi). Great way to get a view on the blockchain through a server.  Trouble is that it’s not trustless as to the blockchain since you don’t download it. Protocols currently on the market like Mina are using recursive snarks (“zk-snark” = “Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge”). You can basically have a proof that proves 1) coins exist, and 2) haven’t been double spent with a goal of 22kb of data (very small amount of data). IOHK has been following Mina and “Bulletproofs” (also a type of snark). IOHK will bring out a paper and (hopefully) prototype of the Mithral Protocol this year.  It will be a similar trustless model where light wallet is the default and you can still trust the blockchain on the server is correct without downloading the chain.
5. Today will be Part II of the coverage of the lates Roadmap vid from Charles. [https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM](https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM)
6. Sidechains. They call the main chain the “Cardano Settlement Layer” (CSL) and the side chains are called “Cardano Computation Layers” (CCL). They are looking at having CCLs for the EVM, IELE, Catalyst, and WASM (web assembly). They are trying to figure out how to pay for the maintenance of these side chains. A current thought is to possibly create a mechanism where you can “refine” ADA to get “fuel” for these sidechains. You could even have a Plutus side chain that runs on its own fuel. This year they will propose a Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP) to see if the community wants to update the monetary policy in an HFC event to go in this direction. This could be a good way to include the parachain ideas from Polkadot.  They could also add Hyperledger related permissioned sidechains with this.  
7. Layer Two. A lot of deal flow with Prism right now around digital identify for things like authenticated wallets, KYC/AML, regulated DeFi, and human readable addresses. Charles will probably do a full video on this. Hydra is the other piece of off-chain infrastructure for this year. IOHK has a whole team working on this. They’ve already put out two papers on this. Will put out two more papers this year and a prototype will also be on the way.  Hydra will be run by the stake pool operators.
8. “With all this, we’re going to piss all over what ETH 2.0 is trying to accomplish”. I’m paraphrasing slightly, but I almost spit out my coffee when he said this. 
9. Quantum Resistance. This will be a big project involving: QR VRF, QR zero knowledge stuff, quantum signatures, and modeling of a quantum adversary. This is a huge amount of work. But this is a whole agenda that is in scope for Cardano 2025.
10. Catalyst &amp; Voltaire. Right now Catalyst is mainly about treasury but it needs to be linked to Voltaire which is all about protocol updates. This will probably mean a bicameral voting model that controls hard fork combinator events.There will be DAO as a service to provide voting rights for your users if you build a dApp or other project on Cardano. They will move from the current plutocracy to something that is hybridized between the current system and “proof of merit”. This is going to require a lot of thinking around the social science behind governance. It will be a more nuanced power dynamic.
11. Approach to the Reference Client.Right now it’s just Haskell, they will probably also build out clients in Python and Rust. Eventually they may have things like Agda, Idris, or Coq at the core. This notion of a “Core Developer” could end up being a digital identity that is authorized through voting. 
12. Commercial. On the commercial side they are really going to scale things up to the eight figure level.  There’s a lot of good news coming there. Charles says he is reserving that for the Africa Special.
13. Coinbase now has a Cardano Explainer. [https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-cardano](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-cardano)

19. Dewayne Cameron was on Cardano Live.  Whether you are interested in DeFi or not, this is likely to be one of the big early Cardano based projects.  This interview has all the latest info on Liqwid.  Sounds like the alpha testnet will be end of April/early May with three or four core contracts. Rick does a really good job of asking questions that a large spectrum of listeners will be able to relate to and they get into the details of how the contracts will work.  At 20:01 Dewayne mentions a “Cardano Dex, or the Dex that IOHK and Emurgo are working on...”  Very interesting tidbit there! [https://youtu.be/JhO5iC08xSA](https://youtu.be/JhO5iC08xSA)
20. The Plutus Pioneer program has been open sourced!

31. Occam.fi partners with Bitcoin.com as custodian to create an ETH-ADA bridge. According to the article, this will allow for any Cardano native token to seamlessly switch to an ERC-20 token and vice versa. The vice versa part is what the ERC-20 Converter does for us already right?

32. LunarCrush interviewed Charles and he gave us some more details on the Ethiopia deal and Africa:  1) the IOHK office in Ethiopia is merging with the Singularity Net Office (it’ll be 30-50 people...so pretty large presence); 2) Africa special to be announced very soon; 3) they will be doing fintech &amp; govtech, 4) everything on the governance side is going to be upgraded across a wide swathe of African nation states in next ten years, 5) lots of possible use cases including supply chains in agritech, putting land on a ledger, voting, identity, reputation (i.e. credit), &amp; payment systems; 6) Africa is like investing in China in the 1980s; 7) the demographics of Africa make it a really easy call to direct investment there; 8) charles said “Ethiopia, in particular, is very special to us and WE HAVE ACTUALLY CLOSED SOME DEALS...we’ll talk about those at the Africa Special”; 9) there will be security token plays in Africa in the mid 2020s since there are no stock exchanges; and 10) there is a big unannounced partnership called “the DCF” with a brand name consultancy we will recognize.

49. We just experienced a big flash crash in price. A prime suspect is the drop in hash rate in BTC due to the Blackouts in China. Is the crypto space ready to accept that Nakamoto style consensus on PoW leads directly to unacceptable levels of centralization? This has been the dirty secret of  PoW crypto and its decentralization loving enthusiasts for years.

50. Charles posted a somewhat cryptic tweet that read “Omega + Hydra + Mithral = GG”.  The Ourobors Omega, Ouroboros Hydra,  &amp; Mithral parts we’ve covered before.  Omega is a capstone rollup of Praos (2017), Genesis (2018), + Redux, +Chronos, +Ledger Combiners, +some other things from the rest of the space. Hydra is layer two. Mithral is trustless light wallets via zk-SNARKs.  Guesses as to the “GG” ranged from “Good Game” (as in game over for competitors) to “Goguen”.

57. Shahaf Bar-Geffen, CEO of COTI (the first recipient of a Cardano CFund investment), says he just finished recording his segment in the Africa special which he mentioned was airing at the end of April prior to the IOHK announcement of April 29th. He also said: 1) ADA Pay may be ready in early May or maybe even late April; 2) there will be a big launch for ADA Pay and once the Africa Special airs “everything will connect”; 3) “people are probably not getting how big this is….but you will down the line”; 4) COTI integration with a major exchange is happening, progress is not as quick as they would like, but it’s progressing; 5) last week they released the possible designs for debit cards, they are even considering some designs submitted by the community; 6) and iOS and Android integration is coming along nicely and well on the way.

59. It looks like Yellow Card and Payway are listed on the Africa Special website.  Given their business models, it is easy to guess that they could be valuable in the Pan Africa Strategy.  [https://payway.et/](https://payway.et/) [https://yellowcard.io/](https://yellowcard.io/)

61. Recap from yesterday:  the Africa Special Announcements revealed some additional puzzle pieces 1) COTI’s AdaPay is possibly the larger payments infrastructure puzzle piece, 2) [payway.et](https://payway.et/) is possibly the local payments puzzle piece, 3)  [yellowcard.io](https://yellowcard.io/) is possibly the local coin exchange puzzle piece, and 4) World Mobile (not mentioned at [africa.cardano.org](https://africa.cardano.org/) AFAIK) may be the network connectivity puzzle piece. I think they are going to connect a lot of disparate pieces for us on the 29th.

63. Rick interviewed CardStarter which is a Cardano accelerator. The interesting items are 1) it appears they are purporting to somehow insure their community backers against certain financial losses with caveats, 2) they plan to fund projects prior to token launch through token vouchers, and 3) it sounds like they are building a DEX called Card Swap. Notice that the “insurance” comes with caveats.  They were very transparent on that point and people should take notice. Is CardStarter good? Is it bad?  I have no idea.  Watch the interview and form your own opinion.  [https://youtu.be/nIklWKtr\_aY](https://youtu.be/nIklWKtr_aY) [https://cardstarter.io/](https://cardstarter.io/)

Reddit user [/u/ricklepicklemydickle](https://www.reddit.com/user/ricklepicklemydickle/) first alerted us to the World Mobile developments and then youtube user [Whiskey 1234](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyBeEq-paultoA127TYcDjQ) (love both usernames btw) let us know that he attended a conference where he encountered World Mobile and “asked them if they knew about Cardano blockchain and the reply was they were announcing partners at the end of this month.” Thank you very much for this intel guys.This is what Army of Spies is all about. Many thanks for your contributions, gentlemen.

68. In Charles’s recent AMA, he mentioned that the Africa Special will be a Pan African event and they WILL talk about various deals they have in multiple countries. So, this tells us they do have multiple deals in multiple countries. That was a little unclear previously.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mP0JSgf9CU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mP0JSgf9CU)

71. Kraken publishes a “What is Cardano?” article.   Says “...Cardano may not promise new ground-breaking features..” Oh yeah?  What about native tokens that don’t require smart contracts?  What about the EUTXO model allowing predictable and accurate local calculation of transaction fees in your wallet before you execute? What about a consensus algorithm that’s so good, another top 10 coin made their system derivative of it? That’s all standard these days?

77. Charles does a big interview with Forbes and points out the huge differences between a bonded staking system (ETH) and a liquid staking system (Cardano). This is highly overlooked.

78. Charles also covers his projections about interoperability and the future converging on a “wifi moment” when an interoperable “internet of blockchains” emerges.  In this future, it will be a race to the bottom and the systems that are too expensive to operate will simply be priced out of the game.

84. In today’s video we also cover questions about the relationship between Atala Prism and ADA and who will actually benefit from the Cardano Projects with African governments.
85. The Africa Special made it clear that Cardano has a brilliant grand strategy for the developing world. As framed by John O’Connor this would be:  1) provide digital identity; 2) provide digital transfer of value; and 3) provide programmability of that digital value.
86. Mickey Watkins (CEO of World Mobile) added a step zero to the formula above with: 0) provide access to the digital world.
87. As has previously been mentioned, it was officially announced that Cardano is partnered with World Mobile to provide digital connectivity to people in the developing world starting in Tanzania.  They plan to have 100k subscribers in Zanzibar by the end of the year.
88. This is just the beginning in Africa.  John O’Connor had a nice tweet that very succinctly laid out some future plans. [https://twitter.com/jjtoconnor/status/1387919060197855234](https://twitter.com/jjtoconnor/status/1387919060197855234)
89.

The Cardano Africa Mini addition gives us more details on the actual rollout of the Ethiopia Ministry of Education deal:  1) all 700k teachers and a subset of the students who will get tablets will be registered in the first year; 2) all secondary school students will be registered in the second year which will bring us to 5MM students;  and 3) the data will be used to analyze both students and teachers.

92. I don’t know if everyone watched the last few minutes of the Africa Special. But, I think a lot of people missed the section where John O’Connor said the goal of Cardano in Africa is to issue 100 MILLION digital identities in the next two years. To give you some idea of scale here, adapools.org shows a highest ever daily number of new wallets at around 71k.  If we onboard 100 Million people via digital identity over two years that would be 136,986 people per day. ETH only has 150MM unique wallets to date.

93. John also mentioned that all of the 100k subscribers to World Mobile in Zanzibar this year will have digital identities on Atala Prism.  They will also be offering so-called “RealFi” loans by Q1 of next year that will be made via Cardano liquidity and will act as a bridge to real world value.

Bitcoin,How to hedge a bitcoin position,"In this interview, Mike Novogratz recommended shorting the 5 year treasury bond to hedge a bitcoin position: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-06/crypto-billionaire-novogratz-says-he-s-shorting-interest-rates](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-06/crypto-billionaire-novogratz-says-he-s-shorting-interest-rates).  I was curious why this was actually a hedge on a bitcoin position, so I did some research and found the following: 

  
How fed actions can decrease the price of bitcoin: 

* Starting point: assume that a bitcoin position represents an inflation hedge 
* Let’s also restate that the fed’s goal is to achieve stable prices and maximum employment  
* As people get vaccinated and go back to work that can’t be done remotely, the fed may decide that it no longer makes sense to keep the [fed funds rate low](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDFUNDS), which is what was incentivizing borrowing to keep the economy going. 
* Therefore, the fed may decide to raise the fed funds rate by [decreasing the money supply](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8Eb4-Wz27A) by selling treasury bonds. 
* With less money supply, there is a lower risk of inflation, which would push down the price of bitcoin. 

How to hedge against this: 

* Since the fed funds rate is the rate of overnight lending (1 day), extrapolating that rate out a year sets the price for other short term treasury bond yield like the 1 year treasury bond yield.  Therefore, higher fed funds rate means [higher short term treasury bond yields](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2017/october/increases-fed-funds-rate-impact-other-interest-rates). 
* [Higher bond yields means that the bond price decreased](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond-yield.asp#bond-yield-vs-price), which is why one would want to short treasury bonds. 
* In summary, we would want to short treasury bonds because we are betting that treasury bond prices will decrease. 

Why would we want to short the 5 year treasury bond vs. other time horizons? 

* **I don’t actually know.**  If anyone can explain this point, plz lmk. 
* Since we know that the shape of the yield curve changes, we don’t want to bet on yield curve movements. 
* Therefore, one would want to **short a basket of treasuries.** 

Mechanics of shorting a treasury bond: 

* [Investopedia article](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/051915/how-short-us-bond-market.asp) explains that ETFs are a good way to do this 

Which ETFs to pick? 

* From [this list of inverse ETFs](https://etfdb.com/etfs/inverse/bond/): TBF, TBX, DFVS

personalfinance,Should I take out a larger student loan this year to pay off an older loan with a higher interest rate?,"So I’m working on financing this upcoming school year. I’ve been approved for up to $17,000 at 9.376% fixed for 120 months from Sallie Mae. I have an older load from them at $9,425 at 11.75% fixed for 72 months. So I’m wondering if it makes sense to take more than I need for tuition and pay off the majority of that 11.75% loan because the interest rate would be lower.  Or should I just stick to the lower amount I need for tuition and fees and leave the 11.75% loan alone until payments begin?

CryptoCurrency,Question: Crypto and relation with inflation,"I am pretty new in the crypto world and please apologies if this is a dumb question but there is something that I don't understand.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's imagine for a moment that we live in 2035 and crypto has been massively adopted. A new virus surfaces and it's worse than COVID-19. Countries are struggling to keep up and are in need of big loans to keep businesses alive. Usually, from my understanding, the local authorities (ECB, Fed...) will lend money to country or make it available at cheap price as they have the ability to create money.

&amp;#x200B;

In a crypto world how would that translate to? And also is there a concept in crypto related to loans?

CryptoMarkets,Long Term Potential Of DeFi - Analysis,"Many in the industry have taken notice and are starting to wonder whether Decentralized Finance (DeFi) a long term solution. With inflated transaction fees, network congestion, and a wide call for regulation from both within and outside of the industry, what is the long term potential of DeFi remains to be seen. With its massive short term increase in market value, it is starting to look a lot more like a bubble than a viable financial solution: [What Is The Long Term Potential Of DeFi?](https://www.oobit.com/blog/what-is-the-long-term-potential-of-defi/)

The concept is generally consistent: a pool of consumer investors (lenders) deposit their assets into a DeFi protocol and earn interest on the asset. The interest rates are attractive, and the risk is shared amongst the pool. At the same time, there have been several exit scams where investors have lost their money.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Synchrony Bank says my credit was below 400?,"I recently attempted to apply for an Amazon store card to secure financing for a personal gym, after filling out the form they denied me. A few days later I was sent an email explaining why. Their reasons were 

1. Number of inquiries on my account
2. Applicant associated with several phone numbers
3. Limited history of consumer at phone number
4. Number of telecommunication inquires 

They also explained that I was given a credit score of 393. My problem is that all other credit bureaus rate me as having a 700 credit score. I have no debts besides on my one credit card but it is below 30% usage and I always pay on time. I only have two inquiries from a card dealership. I changed my phone number but that was almost four years ago and I have had the same phone number since and always use it for any interaction. I don’t know what it means by telecommunication inquires. Credit Karma doesn’t explain that.

I am a full time student and I want to build my credit because when I’m done with school I want to get married and I’ll obviously need good credit for getting my own vehicle and possibly a house or apartment. Why did they report my credit as being that low and what is with all those other reasons? Do I need to open more credit card lines? I don’t want to get a crappy card with high interest rates though.

Edit: Apparently the agency they went through was Sagestream, who is notorious for low balling credit and using their own model to project scores. There's even a local news story on it. I've already filed for the free report from them and I will probably end up filing a dispute.

CryptoCurrency,Gold tokens a future currency?,"Greetings to all Reddit users who will read this post. In this post I would like to present some ideas about the future of currency but first I would like to mention that I have not financial background, I work as a dentist but for the past two years i've been attracted to the financial aspects of the world or the ""economic machine"" as Ray Dalio likes to say. 

First of all, I think we can all agree that everything that happens with the markets is abnormal and at least one of the thing that led to this situation is money printing that started in 1971 when Richard Nixon severed the dollar from the gold. Since then we had some incredible bailouts, encuragement of zombie companies, free cash, low interest rates all with very low repercussions and know that without repercussion there is no pain and without pain there is no reflection which means there is no progress.

 Almost every time we want to take a look in the future, first we have to look at our history but the thing is that we never had a similar situations so we cannot connect any dots here. Yes, we had countries that lost everything because of inflation but none of those countries had the power to ""force"" its currency as a global one. Every time a country wanted to get rid of petrodollar something bad happens. But now the repulsion of the dollar is getting bigger and bigger while the printing machines are heating up and people are starting to loose faith in FIAT.

 In my opinion whole economic machine is plagued with bubbles, and every administration wants to avoid to be the whistleblower because as soon as the whistle will be blown all the euphoria will be gone and it will be gone in a society that has gathered 300 trillions as debt. How much is a trillion ? You can spend 1 million each day for 3000 years. that much. 

The case for blockchain tech &amp; gold as a new technology:

 We know that historicaly, gold was used as money since 700 BC. It does not rust, it cannot be replicated and most of all gold is scarce. 

But some of the gold's biggest problems are: 

1) Hard to transport and make fast payments Today we prefer cash which means that is stackable, you have various denominations (1 usd, 10 usd, 100usd). With gold you have OZs and grams, I would be difficult to buy a bread with a fraction of a gram of gold. To make gold payment you would have to transfer the asset which is very complicated. 

2) Being limited, if everyone would use it as currency, value would increase a lot which would make small payments impossible

 3) Gold attracts bad blood, thiefs making it difficult to store in your home 

\--- Few notes on gold. China, Russia, Turkey, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan bought gold like crazy the past years, and most of the countries are looking to repatriate gold.

 \--- USA Has the largest amount of gold stored. 

When/if things will get ugly some countries will meet and create a new global system? What countries will be and how would they decide who is at the table since fiat is dying? What would be the criteria? Would it be the highest military power? Would it be the countries with largest population? maybe with the largest surface of land? I think that at the rule-making table you will have all the countries with largest stock of gold which for some reason the same countries have the most power (influence, military, financial) USA leading them all [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcOYWn3o9Po](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcOYWn3o9Po) 

IMO they will adopt a system of gold tokenization from which all global countries will have to benefit. The blockchain technology will solve all gold's current problem. You will be able to make instant payments, you will be able to store it safely(not under the furniture/couch) and most of all it would be divisible. You already have tokens for 1oz, 1 gram and for central banks it would be really easy to create 0.001 gram tokens, You would be able to make instant small transaction from anywhere to anywhere. All the tokens could be issued by regulated entities like FED, JP Morgan. Australian Perth mint already issued gold tokens. 1 OZ of gold is OZ everywhere. 

While i was writing this post, I stumbled upon this article from FED which for me was mindblowing: ""Established financial institutions proposed to tokenize securities to speed up settlement and enhance collateral mobilization. Technology startups proposed digital tokens tied to fiat currencies and other assets (for example, gold, diamonds, and other commodities). As work in these areas progressed from speculative ideation to concrete technology development, central banks began actively researching digital tokens through distributed ledger technology (DLT) experiments.""

CryptoCurrency,"Crypto Capital Gains Taxes Explained (Federal, US only)","There is a lot of talk in various subs about taxes and taking profit when selling crypto. Some of the information flying about is mostly accurate, but other is not. So I wanted to discuss the what’s and how’s of federal cryptocurrency taxation in the US. 

First off, nothing is taxable until you sell your crypto. Buying and holding any cryptocurrency is not a taxable event.  But if you sell (the action of transferring value from crypto to fiat (BTC to Dollars) OR selling one crypto to buy another (VET to ETH) then you are subjected to capital gains tax. 

First the WHEN:  There may be some younger folks who haven’t had to deal with filing taxes yet - or have help from there parents or friends when tax season rolls around. That said, I want to clarify that you don’t need to pay taxes when you sell your crypto - you only pay capital gains tax when you file with the IRS, once a year.

So what is capital gains tax and how does it work? Capital gains tax is the tax you pay after selling an asset that has increased in value. You pay tax on the profit you made from the sale of asset. There are two types: 1) Short Term and 2) Long Term.

Short Term Capital Gains: Tax you pay on assets that you sell within one-year of acquiring.  (This means less than 12 month, so buying in December and selling in January is still Short Term).

Long Term Capital Gains: Tax you pay on assets the you sell after owning for more than one-year.
 
Deductions/Losses: It’s hard to believe, but there are some individuals who lose large sums of money trading crypto. The IRS takes some of your losses into account to help you realize value lost. You are allowed to deduct up to $3,000 in losses per year to lower the amount you may be taxed on the sale of cryptocurrency. As an example let’s assumed you made $5,000 from selling MATIC, but then bought into DOGE and lost $4,000. Your short or long term capital gains tax would be based on $2,000 (even though you only have $1,000 left. $5,000 - $3,000 = $2,000.) Keep in mind that this deduction does not need to come from one sale - meaning if you buy and sell daily or weekly, you can tally all those small losses you accrued and use to offset your total taxed amount up to $3,000.


The Federal Tax Rates for Capital Gains vary. Short Term Capital Gains Tax is equal to income tax rates and depends on you total income. We will be discussing only tax rates for those who file SINGLE. Rates shown below are for Adjusted Gross Income **(rates for 2022 may differ)

SHORT TERM CAPITAL GAINS TAX RATES:
10% for income up to $9,950
12% for income from $9,951 to $40,525
22% for income from $40,526 to $86,375
24% for income from $86,376 to $164,925
32% for income from $164,926 to $209,425
35% for income from $209,426 to $523,600
37% for income over $523,600

As an example, let say you make $40,000 in salary a year and after deductions from losses are accounted for you make $2,000 by selling crypto. You’ve made $42,000 for the year as far as the US Government is concerned. You will then owe 12% on the first $40,525 and 22% on the remaining $1,475. In total you will owe $4,863 + $324.50 = $5187.50 in Federal Taxes.

Long Term Capital Gains Tax are lower than Short Term, but still depend on you total income. Again will be discussing only tax rates for those who file SINGLE. Rates shown below are for Adjusted Gross Income **(rates for 2022 may differ)

LONG TERM CAPITAL GSINS TAX RATES:
0% for income up to $40,400
15% for income from $40,401 to $445,850
20% for income over $445,850
(Note this will be changing based on Biden’s revised tax plan in 2922)

Let takes the same example as above as assume you make the same $42,000. You will then owe 12% on the first $40,400 but only 15% on the remaining $1,600. In total you will owe $4,848 + $240 = $5088 in Federal Taxes.

As you can see - the tax rate is lower if assets are held over one-year. But that doesn’t mean you should be scared to take profits on the sale of your crypto from time to time. The best way to determine what kind of tax implications you’ll be subjected to is to keep detailed records of all your trades, each year. I myself keep a spreadsheet where I manually input each purchase and sale of crypto, organized by coin, each day I trade. A running tally of gains and losses at the bottom helps me understand what my current tax exposure is, how much my current losses are to offset, and how much I can expect to be taxed. 

There is also a variety of software out there that can help you track your trades if you don’t have the time (or energy) to keep up with logging.

I hope this helps everyone better understand Capital Gain Taxes, and emboldens you take profit when you see fit. Cheers and good luck out there!",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,"Need to know total student loans interest paid, but Cornerstone no longer exists.","Hi all. I'm not sure what to put for my student loans interest paid in 2020 as I'm in a weird scenario.

So Cornerstone was my previous student loan provider; they stopped in mid-2020 and my loan was transferred to [myfedloan.org](https://myfedloan.org/). I paid $364.83 ($121.61 in Jan, Feb, &amp; Mar prior to student loan forbearance started last year) to Cornerstone. Now here's where it gets fun. I obviously paid less than the $600 threshold for a 1098-E to be generated, so instead I should just be able to go on the loan issuer's website and that information should be available somewhere on my account, right? But the issue is Cornerstone didn't tell [myfedloan.org](https://myfedloan.org/) that information, so [myfedloan.org](https://myfedloan.org/) doesn't have it. And Cornerstone doesn't exist anymore. I called [myfedloan.org](https://myfedloan.org/) explaining this issue and they told me they have literally no idea what to do or where I can get that information, but also told me the fact that I called and asked would at least be documented (in case I got audited).

So anyway, my question is how do I know how much of that $364.83 is toward interest? I graduated in May 2019 and only started payments in November 2019, so that coupled with the fact that the loans are all unsubsidized makes me think that most, if not all of the $364.83 was toward interest.

I have 3 unsubsidized loans each between $3,600-$4,100, but what's really weird to me is that the Principal Balance is higher than the Original Balance. So for example one of the three loans has:

Original Balance $3,750

Unpaid Interest: $1.14

Principal Balance: $3,979.34

...which makes me think there was an error in how the loan information was transferred b/w Cornerstone and [myfedloans.org](https://myfedloans.org/). So am I crazy or does this not make sense?

Also curious if it's even worth obsessing over. Is the IRS even going to care as long as I'm in the right ballpark on an issue like this? So maybe I just report $350 and pay the extra few bucks for [freetaxusa.com](https://freetaxusa.com)'s Audit Assistance?

personalfinance,Dependent Care FSA Nanny Tax question,"We plan to hire a nanny for the summer, and to utilize my wife's dependent care FSA. She's a federal employee, so this would be through the FSAFEDS system. I know that ""nanny taxes"" are an eligible expense for the FSA, but my question is about the proof needed to be reimbursed for the taxes. I assume one option would be to wait until next year and simply be reimbursed based on Schedule H, but our plan is for my wife to quit her job before then, so no more FSA by that time. Since the FSA claim form looks pretty generic, I'm wondering if it would also work for us to just include the amount for payroll taxes in the ""out of pocket cost"" and have the nanny sign that.

For example:  
Nanny worked 10 hours at $20/hour = $200  
Employer share of payroll taxes $200 x 7.65% = $15.30  
Total out of pocket cost: $215.30

So the nanny would verify that $215.30 is the total cost of her services, though she only received $200 herself.

We will pay estimated taxes for the payroll tax (and thus could submit that info showing that we actually did pay the taxes), if that would make any difference.",finance

2) Do all bank statement loans require at least a 10% deposit?

3) are their any home buying incentives/grants that are possible with the bank statement loan 

4) are their any bank statement lenders that are better than others?

Conventional loan
5) what income should I claim after deductions on taxes to qualify for up to 350k

6)around about how much taxes would I owe if I had one Adult dependent, and 1 child dependent?

7) how much would I owe with no dependents 

8) if I went conventional would I save enough money on lower interest rate compared to the bank statement (alt-doc) loan to justify paying more in taxes?

9) if I file the taxes and setup a payment plan would that show up on credit report during underwriting process?

personalfinance,Question on what to do about a lender that seems to be yanking our chain on the interest rate.,"Wife and I are in the process of moving from a 30 yr, to a 15 yr mortgage with a cash option.

Was going well. Due to some of their messages going to the junk mail folder on the wife’s email account, it’s been stretched out longer than either of us wanted.

Get the first offer, but it was only an estimate. Then the real offer came, but without the cash option. We then get it and it’s the highest interest rate yet.

We weren’t ecstatic about it but it’s better than the current rate, so we asked to lock the loan in. They came back and said they need this years tax info first. We got it back a few days later and sent it that night. Basically they reviewed it before the government even did.

They are now saying that due to everything taking so long, they “need to re-lock the mortgage” which means starting the process over to them, *but to no charge to us*.

This seems to be a beat around the bush and raise the rates more type of scenario.

Questions:
- Is there anything we could look at to help us combat things like this? 
- Is their any laws pertaining to these type of practices? 
- Any advice on the 15 year. They seem to offer less of a deal I’m guessing due to the shorter pay term.

House Cost: Looking for something between 170-200, but could go higher if we wanted I think. 
Salary: $130,000 (this includes two of our side businesses, so this number will likely decrease as we feel burnt out by one of them). This time next year I could see that number dropping by $20,000 
Savings: $108,000 - this includes our emergency fund and house fund. We are adding about $3,000 a month to this account. 
Rent: $400 total (including utilities). We currently live really cheap and actually don’t mind where we live, which is why we aren’t in a rush to leave. 
Credit Score: Anywhere between 776-802 depending on what service I look at
Location: Midwest, small market 

Here are a few small pieces of info that could be relevant 

-We currently have two cars - one is a 2001 Ford sedan and one is a 2013 Kia sedan. The Ford has 102k miles and the Kia has 96k. Both seem to be running perfectly fine at the moment

-We are maxing out two 401ks each month 

-We have about 60k total in retirement (across all accounts) 

I guess my question is, should we be buying a home right now based on the low interest rates? We’ve been waiting (for no particular reason), but I hate to wait a couple years and then see interests rates jump up another 1.5% and then us lose money in the long run. We have some friends looking for a home right now and they’ve put in offers over asking price and didn’t get it, so our small market isn’t immune to whats happening everywhere. 

We are adding about $3,000 a month to our house fund, so I’m not sure if it’s worth it to just keep saving and living cheap or go ahead and buy.

personalfinance,Question about federal gift tax in the US,"My father (divorced) passed away last week. Since he left no will, the estate is to go to probate to be split between me and my late brother's children. (Per nevada law)

However, one of his bank accounts was still listed jointly with his ex-wife. Now with his passing, she is the sole owner of that account and that money is free from probate. 

She had already said she has no desire for the money and wants to make sure that everything went to me and my brother's kids. She wants to close the account and wire the money to us. 

Now, the amount of the account in question is over 30k, and that is where my question comes in. The federal gift tax doesn't kick in unless it goes over 15k per recipient (if I'm reading it correctly).  Say the account is 35k, split 50/50 is 17.5k, triggering the need to file paperwork. 

Since I am married, could she do 15k to me and then 2.5k to my wife? And obviously split the other 17.5k between the two kids?

Or does the 15k limit apply to married couples as well as individuals? 

The reason I ask is because they have been divorced for 4 years and she moved on with her life. I don't want her to have  do any more legwork dealing with dad's mess.",finance

personalfinance,Add a co-borrower to mortgage when already approved with good rates? We both have excellent credit; she would add an additional 65% income to the application,"I'm approved for a mortgage above my budget range with a low rate (2.780% APR).

My fiancee was unavailable at the time I completed this application, so we used my information only. The lender says I can add a co-borrower to our existing application, but we cannot take them away once added without starting the application over.

I have excellent credit (middle score was around 780) and we do not know my fiancee's exact scores at this moment but they should also be excellent -- we think at least 750, possibly higher.

Is there any realistic possibility that adding the additional income would unlock a lower rate? OTOH if her credit brought down our average a little bit, but it was still in the excellent range, should we be concerned about that?

Does anybody know ""how the sausage is made"" in these scenarios?

TLDR: How much do interest rates depend on income? Can our rate change if we add an additional 65% income to our mortgage application? Or should we be more concerned with a potential very slight decrease in average credit score?",finance
personalfinance,Has anyone experienced loan settlement with ConServe to repay tuition/student loan balances?,"Hello! I have outstanding debt to a community college that I attended 5 years ago that has since been sent to collections.

My debt has been contracted to ConServe and I was wondering if anyone has experience with negotiating with them or negotiating debt settlements in general. 

I have around 20 credits left so it would be cheaper in the long term (assuming the federal government doesn't make 2 year schools free) to settle the debt and finish than it would be to start over at a different 4 year or 2 year school.

I have $3000 in savings that's on top of my emergency fund, as well as $2300 for my student loans that are set to be paid off once interest expires. I also have around $3000 in a stock account and $40k in my 401k that I prefer not to touch.

personalfinance,"Should I buy a new car, used car, or certified pre-owned? My 08 Honda Civic costs more than it's worth to fix the engine crack.","English isn't my first language, please bear with me.

My 08 Civic, bought used 3 years ago with 87k miles on it, has an engine crack and leaks coolant. The car is very well-maintained and the first owner passed down all the maintenance documents to me. It now has about 101k miles on it. (All of these are not relevant anymore, I know.)

The car overheated yesterday and that's how I found out there's a crack on the engine block. The car is 3 years past Honda's extended warranty (they know their engines have defects), and from what I've researched online, it's going to cost at least $5-7k to replace the engine block. By ""replace"", it probably means the dealership is going to swap my engine with another used engine from a newer model that doesn't have the defect. My car's current mileage will then become irrelevant.

The good thing is, I'm working from home and I'm in no rush to get another car, or get my car fixed. I can wait for good deals for months, and I can drive my gf's car during the weekend. I'm planning to buy a Toyota Corolla/Prius Prime, unless it is more reasonable to fix the car.

I looked at some options last night, and these numbers are from the dealerships in my area. There aren't much on craigslist:

|Car Type|Cost|
|:-|:-|
|(Used) 3-4 years old Corolla (30-70k miles)|$15-19K|
|(New) Corolla base model|$20k|
|(New) Corolla Hybrid|$24K|
|(New) Prius Prime|$26-28k|

A used Corolla is so expensive it makes me wonder if a used car is even worth it.

Here's my situation:

1. I can work from home. I don't need a car until COVID is under control and the company starts requiring people back to the office for meetings.
2. I've always preferred used cars not just because they're cheaper, but because I feel like no matter how good my car is, someone is gonna ruin it for me anyway - by crashing into me, or breaking into my car. My few years of driving experience have taught me that I can't trust other drivers, at all.
3. I'm 25, don't have a house, but I planned to get married and buy a house with at least 20% down payment in 3-4 years. This was before I thought my car would last me another 6-7 years.
4. There's still a Federal tax credit of about $4500 for the Prius Prime. I don't own a house yet so I don't have a place to charge my car. My plan was to buy a house, drive my Civic till it can't be driven anymore, and then get a Prius Prime.
5. I preferred plug-in hybrids as I believe this is where our society is moving towards. And of course, for its fuel economy. In fact, I was pretty sure I will get a plug-in hybrid as my next car as I expected my Civic to last me another 6-7 years. Now that these plans obviously need to change.
6. I have no other monthly payments - rent and car insurance are the only thing I have to pay, and since I'm living with relatives, the rent is cheap ($300-600 depending on utilities bills). I pay my car insurance in full every 6 months.
7. I will drive my car until it can't be driven or when it becomes a money pit. Reliability is everything and I will only consider Toyota.
8. I recently started investing for retirement, I put half of my ""savings"" on mostly index funds. I don't foresee myself pulling money from those investments. But if I need to take loans, that will affect my budgeting for these investments, which I don't prefer.
9. I have enough savings in my bank to buy a used/new car with cash (and have money left for emergency). Not a fan of taking loans for car payments, but I will pay off my car in 2-4 months if I do need to take loans.
10. I have less than 5 years of credit history but my credit score is very high, if that matters.
11. I haven't taken car insurance into my consideration - my current insurance is cheap because the Civic is old.

Getting married, buying a house, and not trusting other drivers are my main issues - I do really want to have a place for myself, and this is the worst time for my car to fail me as it heavily affects my budgeting. Hell, I don't even have a place to store my tools or work on cars, I literally had to work on my car in front of the house on the road...but a used Toyota is too damn expensive I really don't know if that 5-10k is worth saving.",finance
personalfinance,Emergency Fund vs Cash Car vs Credit Card Debt,"Hey PF,

I searched the Prime Directive for this - and am kinda right on the threshold so looking for input.

**I currently have:**

* $10k emergency fund (~3 months of emergency expenses only)

* Pay bills 1 month ahead (Used 2 April paychecks for 100% of may bills, May for June, etc.) 

* Contributing JUST enough to my 401k to get my company match

* ~$11k in Credit Card Debt - 8.99% APR consolidation loan ($620 monthly minimum + pay $500 monthly snowball)

* Lease on my truck expires in August, so I need to buy the truck (For ~17k) or buy a different vehicle and have ~$8k down payment saved


**I'm to decide what to do here - and would love input if my preferred option is a bad plan**

* **Option 1 (Conservative):** Keep as is, pay the credit card loan off in ~11 months, use the $8k as a downpayment to buy my truck out for $17k. Strictly speaking this is what the prime directive says to do, since my loan is &lt;10% APR.

* **Option 2 (What I want to do):** Cash out the $10k emergency fund and use it to pay off my 8.99% APR Loan this month, then use that $1,100/month payment to bring my down payment up to $~10k to buy the truck. Then go back to funding Emergency Fund.

* **Option 3:** Pay only the minimum on the credit card debt, use the emergency fund + snowball to buy the truck cash. Don't like this as much as option 2 because interest rates will definitely be better on a car loan vs my debt consolidation loan.

FWIW - when I came to PF 2 years ago I had $42k in credit card debt from a bad breakup/money stolen from Ex.  I've paid off $31k since, and am not all worried about job layoff or splurging. So I love the idea of just paying off that loan and being done with all the credit card debt.  And I consider paying 100% of my bills with last month's income to be a 1 month emergency fund - so I think I'm ok to be a little risky here and use that $10k for a purpose instead of it just sitting there.

But would love input if anyone thinks this is a bad idea, or if there's an option 4 I'm missing.

**tl;dr** I have ~4 months of emergency savings, I'd like to use 3 months of that to finally be 100% credit card debt free, is it worth the risk?

Thanks!

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, May 3, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, May 3, 2021**

Stocks traded mixed, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) ticking higher while the tech-Nasdaq (QQQ) declined. The SPY rose 5% in April, for the best performance since November of last year. Following a rotation into cyclical and reopening stocks at the beginning of the year, April saw the communication services and consumer discretionary sectors lead gains in the SPY, returning to the leadership position. Growth stocks continued underperforming, paring recent gains after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said some sectors of the market appeared “frothy”. Looking ahead, market participants continue to monitor corporate earnings and wait for more economic data, particularly the April jobs report that will be released May 7th. 

A wave of stronger-than-expected earnings, especially in banks and mega-caps like Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT), have fueled the latest rally in the market. In the US, effective distribution of the vaccine and the gradual reopening of the economy have led to a surge in consumer spending, driving corporate profits way past analyst estimates. As of Friday, 86% of S&amp;P 500 companies had beaten first-quarter earnings expectations, according to FactSet data. This would mark the highest proportion since at least 2008, if the current rate holds through the end of first-quarter earnings season.

The Labor Department will release its April jobs report on Friday, which is expected to show a staggering nearly 1 million payrolls came back last month, accelerating March’s gain. As a reminder, in March, the Department of Labor reported nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 for the month while the unemployment rate fell to 6% (unemployment rate was 14.6% in April 2020). Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 675,000 and an unemployment rate of 6%.

Last week, President Biden addressed a joint session of Congress, during which he said “America was back on the move again” following the coronavirus pandemic.. In his address, President Biden touted his $2 trillion infrastructure plan and unveiled a new $1.8 trillion proposal aimed at supporting children, students, and families. This proposal, called the American Families Plan, would be funded in part with the newly proposed tax increases on the wealthy.

personalfinance,Federal tax lien - take lien or take personal loan to pay half?,"In 2019 I received a large bonus. Due to federal tax code changes during the last administration I lost nearly all of my deductions and withholdings are calculated differently so I now owe over 100k in taxes from that year. Since the money was paid going through full-time employee status and had taxes withdrawn when I received the money I had no idea I was going to owe anything, let alone a heart-attack inducing amount. I used the money to pay off all my debts thinking I was fine. 

Now, two months ago I received a letter about a federal tax lien. I hired a reputable tax attorney in California, but the best they could negotiate is paying half to the IRS and then going on a payment plan. The problem is: I don’t have half. Also, my calculated taxes for 2020 will be another $50k due to the same loss of deductions and change in withholdings that I was unaware of. I’ve since fired my last tax attorney for the lack of awareness. 

So do I:
A.) take personal loan to pay the half they want from 2019 and then go on an installment plan for the rest to avoid the lien and then scramble and panic to come up with an additional $50k by October (Through filing an extension for 2020 taxes) 

OR

B.) Take the lien, work out a payment plan for 2019 AND 2020 combined?

What does it do to my credit? How bad is a lien?

Any advice is greatly appreciated. The tax attorney says the lien “isn’t that bad” if we can’t come up with the money. Is that true?

I need to either pay by this week or they will apply the lien. I’ve been having a panic attack for two months now.",finance

ethereum,Upside/Downside of ETH2 staking (and APR) over traditional savings,"I'd be interested in hearing the perspective of others regarding the upside or downside of putting a significant amount of my savings into ETH2 staking and earning 6% APR as opposed to leaving it in a traditional savings account.

I currently have a traditional online savings account where I've parked enough money to give me roughly 1 year's worth of savings. I'm currently earning .5% interest (down from 2.5% when I signed up thanks to the pandemic and falling interest rates).

Recently, I started dollar-cost-averaging into Ethereum and was then given the chance to stake my ETH in ETH2 through Coinbase.  I'm getting 6% APR at the moment which is obviously a ton better than my savings account.  I'm fortunate to have a very stable job where I'm not in any jeopardy of getting laid off/fired and I don't have any plans that I would need a significant amount of money for in the next 6-9 months.

I'm also a believer that the price of ETH is going to continue to rise, especially when the new protocol upgrades and EIP 1559 are released.

So, I'd like to hear some perspective from others in terms of the upside/downside of staking some portion of savings in ETH2 in order to benefit from the increased interest rate and the overall rise (hopeful... of course this is not guaranteed) in ETH. What are the downsides to doing this (such as not being able to use the funds until ETH2 is released, potential fall in the price of ETH, etc)?",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,"25, been living at home for a year, moving to LA in August for work. Should I pay down student loans or save up more?","Hello everyone, thank you for reading! I appreciate any and all advice you might have.

Here's my situation.

* I was supposed to move across the country, from NY to LA, in August of last year.  I postponed it due to COVID and I decided it would be best to hold off until I felt better prepared and safe. I'm now going to move in August of this year with roommates and have been living at home trying to save up as much as I can.
* I have been unemployed for the majority of 2020, but I collected unemployment, saved every penny and recently started a new freelance job and made a side hustle. I have about 12k saved right now. 
* I have a large amount of student loans. About 80k right now. I know, I'm not happy about it either. I had 5 Sallie Mae loans, paid off the smallest one earlier this year at 8k, which felt great. My next lowest one is 14k and I'm thinking about throwing money at that one next because it has a high interest rate.
* I'm moving to work in the film &amp; animation industry. I have some connections and the skills I need to land a job in my field, so it's not a complete shot in the dark. If all goes well and I land the job, I'll be bringing in $50-70k/year, which would put me in a good position to pay a LOT toward my student loans (especially splitting rent with 2 roommates). While I'm going to work very hard to get my job lined up, it's very possible there will be a lapse in my income when I move out there trying to get that job nailed down, so my savings may be paying my rent for a bit if I'm unable to find anything right away.
* I am working a short term contract right now which will bring in about 10k more between now and August.
* I can not refinance these loans yet due to the extended unemployment I had last year (a lot of places want to see steady proof of income which I don't have).

Here's my question. 

For that short 10k contract, is it smart for me to save that in case the job search goes poorly and I need a bigger buffer? Or is it smarter for me to throw everything I've got at my student loans, even though it won't even pay off my lowest in full? What is more prudent for me to do right now as a young person taking some risks in the career and move department? I don't want to count my chickens before they hatch and count on landing that job, but in the hypothetical that I do, I would be able to pay off my loans much more comfortably then. 

Is it better for me to throw money at my loans, have less of a monthly payment down the line, and potentially be stretched thin during the job search...   
Or is it better for me to save it, have more loans to pay off later, but wait until I have a steady income to start putting toward it?

personalfinance,"Move to a lower-interest loan now, or forgo doing that so there are fewer hard credit pulls when I apply for a home later this year?","As of about a year ago, I had about $54,000 in debt, spread out over five debtors(four credit cards and an installment consolidation loan, from previous education and medical expenses).

&amp;#x200B;

As of today, I have about $28,000 in debt. The credit cards are all paid off, and all that remains is the installment loan, with an interest rate of 10%.

&amp;#x200B;

My credit score is just over 800.

&amp;#x200B;

I have budgeted things out, and given my current expenses and rate of paying off debt, I would expect to reach zero debt in late February, 2022.

&amp;#x200B;

I have about $10,000 in a checking account and a savings account, with reasonable cash flow, a strong career with frequent new opportunities, and significant available credit in case of emergencies. Although I am nowhere near retirement age, in addition to the (more substantial) retirement account I have that I can't withdraw, I have another retirement account with about $7,000 that I could withdraw without penalty in case of emergency.

&amp;#x200B;

I had been considering contacting my credit union, whom I've been with for about 15 years, about getting a lower-rate loan from them to pay off the 10% loan.

&amp;#x200B;

But I learned that I will be inheriting some money, about $20,000, and should be able to get about $10,000 as a gift in addition, and I should be able to look into using that \~$30,000(along with anything else I will have saved by that time) as a down payment on a house.

&amp;#x200B;

The $28,000 loan is currently being reduced by about $1250 per month(meaning that's not the total payment, but the amount of debt reduction from month-to-month). I have a chart of my expenses and income, and I know that I can safely make those payments while also increasing my money on-hand, and that as of February 2022, it will be safe for me to completely pay off the remainder of that large loan.

Realistically, I would like to buy a home around October. My current lease ends in November of this year.

&amp;#x200B;

My concern is whether I should talk to my credit union about getting a lower-rate loan now, or whether having that hard pull on my credit now would affect my ability to get the best rates on mortgages, knowing that it currently looks like I will be able to pay off the current loan within a year anyway, and knowing that a home loan is typically a much longer term investment.",finance
personalfinance,How much should I set aside for savings?,"I tried looking this up online but got mixed results. I'm wondering if I currently have enough in savings or if I need to contribute more for an ""emergency"" fund. I'd much prefer to put into investments so that I'm not just losing value to inflation, but if my savings are inadvisably small I'll work on contributing more to it each month. Right now I make 31K/year but expect to start making 34K soon, have $11K investments and $11K in savings. My monthly expenses are around $2100. I also have $17K student loan debt, but since it's federal subsidized I won't be paying it off until it starts collecting interest once I finish my PhD in 3-4 years. I have no other loans or debt.

Is $11K enough in savings given my expenses and given my debt? 

More details: I don't really own too many major assets. I don't at all anticipate losing my job, but if I do it may take longer than average to find one due to my career field and location restriction.",finance
personalfinance,What to do with my inheritance?,"My father passed away last year and left everything to me and my two siblings. We officially sold his house today and will be looking to each have roughly 25k+ each after privately selling the remaining furniture and other items that we do not want. Financially,  I am in an ""ok"" spot of my life, I can afford to pay off my bills and rent with a couple hundred dollars left over after each month but nothing remarkable due to supporting my significant other while she finishes college, 2 years left. As far as debt goes, I have a 23k used car loan 3.9 APR that I recently purchased and a 30k federal student loan. Lastly, I have a 4k emergency fund.  My first thought was to either buy the car out right or refinance it and dropping an additional 10k - 15k to lower my payments even further while using the remainder to replenish my emergency fund. I would consider paying off some of my student debt but I am waiting to see if that 10k to 50k student loan forgiveness actually holds true. However, another idea crossed my mind, I am currently on track to being promoted to the next level at my current position bumping me up from 60k a year to 80 to 100k in a year from now. I questioned if I should hold out until then using my inheritance when needed if at all. Afterwards,  I could easily maintain the life style I live and pay off my remaining loans in 1 to 2 year time frame while using my inheritance as a down payment for a house in the next 3 to 4 years. Any thoughts? Thank you!

TLDR: Father passed away splitting roughly 25k each with my siblings. I could either pay off my 23k car or refinance my car with an additional down payment / replenish my emergency fund. Currently waiting to see if student forgiveness will become a thing so holding out on my 30k student debt. Or wait until I get promoted within the following year making significantly more which I could maintain my current lifestyle to pay off my current debt and then use my inheritance for a down payment on a house.",finance
CryptoCurrency,No single financial institution should be so large that its failure would cause an entire nation's economy to fail,"This is a very real issue and it worsens every day. Monopolies (not just banks) do control many parts of our economy and it's a problem. The failure of one can result in the ruin of a local town all the way to a  collapse in the global economy. We have been seeing this sort of thing get a lot of attention on this sub recently, most notably from countries that are run by corruption. However, this issue can be found in first-world countries, as well. There, the rich can still help each other get richer if they have enough power to begin with.

Here is a snippet of an audit from 2011 that was done on the U.S. Federal Reserve showing how important it is for them to keep the leaders in place:

&gt;The first top-to-bottom audit of the Federal Reserve uncovered eye-popping new details about how the U.S. provided a whopping $16 trillion in secret loans to bail out American and foreign banks and businesses during the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. “As a result of this audit, we now know that the Federal Reserve provided more than $16 trillion in total financial assistance to some of the largest financial institutions and corporations in the United States and throughout the world. (...) This is a clear case of socialism for the rich and rugged, you’re-on-your-own individualism for everyone else.”

Maybe crypto can't address a monopoly in the trash hauling business, but it can certainly take more power away from financial institutions. One day, we'll all be able to be our own bank, managing our own money without ridiculous fees. We'll be able to collect interest on our holdings by whichever means we want, like staking or receiving interest from stablecoins. If one wealthy individual risks their entire networth and goes broke, it alone won't be a burden on the economy.

Bitcoin,Observations from a late 30 year old,"This is not to be pro or con bitcoin. It's observations. I hope it's helpful.

I started work in May 2007. For the first few months, things just got better and better. Then, in a matter of months, things changed. Here's what I learned:

Most people in the system, especially those less mobile (big mortgages, families, lack of flexibility, lack of savings, low net worth) will deny most disasters. They simply do NOT want to talk about it. 

There can be humungous changes that are laughed at by the majority. Though I like most of his stuff, Bill Mahr did a skip ripping bitcoin. There is a clip from him years ago about how the phone ""is not a swiss army knife"". Generally the more entrenched, the more you don't want to see new possibilities.

The people with the most advice tend to (but not always) have the least money.

In late 2007, it was apparent that things were spiraling out of control. When you did some research, you found that everyday Joe owned 10 houses, and successful Tim had 20. I knew people carrying 3x their annual income in credit card debt.

In 2016, and especially 2017-2018, the housing market had to crash. Right?

In February of 2020, I asked a coworker who used to work at a publicly traded scientific company about covid. He laughed it off.

So what do I see today. I do not know. I see the traditional crowd laughing, but it's nervous laughter. I see a fed chairman continue to mumble through nonsense. I see a bank of america report about ""transitory hyperinflation"". I see 6 trillion of debt, and tons of debt in europe, and no clue how the bill will effect us. My take-it will actually drag down the economy and create even more debt.

The biggest financial mistake most of my peers made was waiting for a crash that never came, of not taking the time to research what is going on. I don't believe anything is crazy. The stock market isn't crazy, it's a reflection of bank balance sheets. 

I am no Guru, and I am a terrible trader. But I'll tell you this-it's not about this crisis. It's about the next one. They are going to make rates negative.",cryptocurrency

cardano,Cardano Rumor Rundown MAY 4 2021,"Hey Everyone!

Let's go....

Newly covered today: 

1. I will be in a tent in a beautiful place where there will be very limited internet access.  So, no text format Cardano Rumor Rundown until Saturday. The youtube version has been pre-recorded and is scheduled to come out on the normal daily schedule: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWnSP49DJf-G9E0VfqDdBCA.

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. The latest roadmap video from Charles covered a lot of ground. We’ll tackle it piece by piece. [https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM](https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM)
2. Ourobouros Omega.  Ourobouros Classic 2016 was a “theoretical artifact” that IOHK could build upon.  Ourobouros Praos was 2017 and it’s still running now.  Ourobouros Genesis was 2018. Ourobouros Omega is going to be the capstone. It will be a rollup of all the previous iterations plus Redux, Chronos, Ledger Combiners, and some things they’ve learned from the larger industry. The paper and a prototype will be this year. We want to be there by Cardano 2025.
3. Light Clients/Wallets (e.g. Yoroi). Great way to get a view on the blockchain through a server.  Trouble is that it’s not trustless as to the blockchain since you don’t download it. Protocols currently on the market like Mina are using recursive snarks (“zk-snark” = “Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge”). You can basically have a proof that proves 1) coins exist, and 2) haven’t been double spent with a goal of 22kb of data (very small amount of data). IOHK has been following Mina and “Bulletproofs” (also a type of snark). IOHK will bring out a paper and (hopefully) prototype of the Mithral Protocol this year.  It will be a similar trustless model where light wallet is the default and you can still trust the blockchain on the server is correct without downloading the chain.
4. Today will be Part II of the coverage of the latest Roadmap vid from Charles. [https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM](https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM)
5. Sidechains. They call the main chain the “Cardano Settlement Layer” (CSL) and the side chains are called “Cardano Computation Layers” (CCL). They are looking at having CCLs for the EVM, IELE, Catalyst, and WASM (web assembly). They are trying to figure out how to pay for the maintenance of these side chains. A current thought is to possibly create a mechanism where you can “refine” ADA to get “fuel” for these sidechains. You could even have a Plutus side chain that runs on its own fuel. This year they will propose a Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP) to see if the community wants to update the monetary policy in an HFC event to go in this direction. This could be a good way to include the parachain ideas from Polkadot.  They could also add Hyperledger related permissioned sidechains with this.  
6. Layer Two. A lot of deal flow with Prism right now around digital identify for things like authenticated wallets, KYC/AML, regulated DeFi, and human readable addresses. Charles will probably do a full video on this. Hydra is the other piece of off-chain infrastructure for this year. IOHK has a whole team working on this. They’ve already put out two papers on this. Will put out two more papers this year and a prototype will also be on the way.  Hydra will be run by the stake pool operators.
7. “With all this, we’re going to piss all over what ETH 2.0 is trying to accomplish”. I’m paraphrasing slightly, but I almost spit out my coffee when he said this. 
8. Quantum Resistance. This will be a big project involving: QR VRF, QR zero knowledge stuff, quantum signatures, and modeling of a quantum adversary. This is a huge amount of work. But this is a whole agenda that is in scope for Cardano 2025.
9. Catalyst &amp; Voltaire. Right now Catalyst is mainly about treasury but it needs to be linked to Voltaire which is all about protocol updates. This will probably mean a bicameral voting model that controls hard fork combinator events.There will be DAO as a service to provide voting rights for your users if you build a dApp or other project on Cardano. They will move from the current plutocracy to something that is hybridized between the current system and “proof of merit”. This is going to require a lot of thinking around the social science behind governance. It will be a more nuanced power dynamic.
10. Approach to the Reference Client.Right now it’s just Haskell, they will probably also build out clients in Python and Rust. Eventually they may have things like Agda, Idris, or Coq at the core. This notion of a “Core Developer” could end up being a digital identity that is authorized through voting. 
11. Commercial. On the commercial side they are really going to scale things up to the eight figure level.  There’s a lot of good news coming there. Charles says he is reserving that for the Africa Special.

18. Dewayne Cameron was on Cardano Live.  Whether you are interested in DeFi or not, this is likely to be one of the big early Cardano based projects.  This interview has all the latest info on Liqwid.  Sounds like the alpha testnet will be end of April/early May with three or four core contracts. Rick does a really good job of asking questions that a large spectrum of listeners will be able to relate to and they get into the details of how the contracts will work.

56. Shahaf Bar-Geffen, CEO of COTI (the first recipient of a Cardano CFund investment), says he just finished recording his segment in the Africa special which he mentioned was airing at the end of April prior to the IOHK announcement of April 29th. He also said: 1) ADA Pay may be ready in early May or maybe even late April; 2) there will be a big launch for ADA Pay and once the Africa Special airs “everything will connect”; 3) “people are probably not getting how big this is….but you will down the line”; 4) COTI integration with a major exchange is happening, progress is not as quick as they would like, but it’s progressing; 5) last week they released the possible designs for debit cards, they are even considering some designs submitted by the community; 6) and iOS and Android integration is coming along nicely and well on the way.

60. Recap from yesterday:  the Africa Special Announcements revealed some additional puzzle pieces 1) COTI’s AdaPay is possibly the larger payments infrastructure puzzle piece, 2) [payway.et](https://payway.et/) is possibly the local payments puzzle piece, 3)  [yellowcard.io](https://yellowcard.io/) is possibly the local coin exchange puzzle piece, and 4) World Mobile (not mentioned at [africa.cardano.org](https://africa.cardano.org/) AFAIK) may be the network connectivity puzzle piece. I think they are going to connect a lot of disparate pieces for us on the 29th.

62. Rick interviewed CardStarter which is a Cardano accelerator. The interesting items are 1) it appears they are purporting to somehow insure their community backers against certain financial losses with caveats, 2) they plan to fund projects prior to token launch through token vouchers, and 3) it sounds like they are building a DEX called Card Swap. Notice that the “insurance” comes with caveats.  They were very transparent on that point and people should take notice. Is CardStarter good? Is it bad?  I have no idea.  Watch the interview and form your own opinion.  [https://youtu.be/nIklWKtr\_aY](https://youtu.be/nIklWKtr_aY) [https://cardstarter.io/](https://cardstarter.io/)

77. Charles also covers his projections about interoperability and the future converging on a “wifi moment” when an interoperable “internet of blockchains” emerges.  In this future, it will be a race to the bottom and the systems that are too expensive to operate will simply be priced out of the game.

83. In today’s video we also cover questions about the relationship between Atala Prism and ADA and who will actually benefit from the Cardano Projects with African governments.
84. The Africa Special made it clear that Cardano has a brilliant grand strategy for the developing world. As framed by John O’Connor this would be:  1) provide digital identity; 2) provide digital transfer of value; and 3) provide programmability of that digital value.
85. Mickey Watkins (CEO of World Mobile) added a step zero to the formula above with: 0) provide access to the digital world.
86. As has previously been mentioned, it was officially announced that Cardano is partnered with World Mobile to provide digital connectivity to people in the developing world starting in Tanzania.  They plan to have 100k subscribers in Zanzibar by the end of the year.
87. This is just the beginning in Africa.  John O’Connor had a nice tweet that very succinctly laid out some future plans. [https://twitter.com/jjtoconnor/status/1387919060197855234](https://twitter.com/jjtoconnor/status/1387919060197855234)

91. I don’t know if everyone watched the last few minutes of the Africa Special. But, I think a lot of people missed the section where John O’Connor said the goal of Cardano in Africa is to issue 100 MILLION digital identities in the next two years. To give you some idea of scale here, adapools.org shows a highest ever daily number of new wallets at around 71k.  If we onboard 100 Million people via digital identity over two years that would be 136,986 people per day. ETH only has 150MM unique wallets to date.

92. John also mentioned that all of the 100k subscribers to World Mobile in Zanzibar this year will have digital identities on Atala Prism.  They will also be offering so-called “RealFi” loans by Q1 of next year that will be made via Cardano liquidity and will act as a bridge to real world value.

93. Charlie Munger thinks crypto is “disgusting”. That’s a wonderful thing because it tells you how early you are. This is especially true in Cardano which is a project that leads with empathy for the developing world. Will he still call that disgusting if we’ve brought financial inclusiveness to an entire continent in five or ten years.  Probably he won’t say anything because he won’t have lived that long. But, you get the point.

Bitcoin,Charlie Munger is spot on!,"Maybe it’s time for the crypto world to take another look at its valuation, because I  remember specifically it’s purpose to be a new a economy for people to purchase goods free of fees and inconveniences of middlemen. Instead it’s become a wild speculative market, free of federal regulations and oversight, because nobody understands it. It’s  a powerful  tool for charlatans and human traffickers, specifically for those reasons because who else would want access to an economy free of federal authorities? CRIMINALS! That’s who! I value Bitcoin and pretty much any other crypto items at $0 it’s a fucking joke! And anyone into it should reevaluate their priorities.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,The idea of a recurring alt season is a myth.,"The myth started when CME futures were opened on Bitcoin in mid-December 2017. The dastardly elites took this as an opportunity to short Bitcoin and it precipitated a load of liquidations. Bitcoin dropped nearly 50% over the course of 5 days.

ETH also took a hit, but it was only about 20% or so, and then it recovered strongly along with BTC for the next 3 weeks.

Then, in early January, the Fed started to signal that they were going to tighten the money supply and there was a general market correction. Nothing was spared, not even crypto. Both BTC and ETH were hammered, and didn't recover until 2020.

Alt season is deemed as the period in between these two events.

Personally, I think it's crazy to think that just because it happened before, it will necessarily happen again, given that the two major external stimuli (CME futures opening and Fed tightening) were nothing to do with crypto. The reason why Bitcoin was hit harder earlier was due to targeted shorting, not due to some innate characteristic of crypto that says Bitcoin has to peak first.

IMO, if this bull run ends due to something like a rates rise, there will be no alt season because alts would be immediately and ruthlessly destroyed much more than Bitcoin and would not recover until the next bull run.

Edit: clarified last sentence.",cryptocurrency
gaming,Looking for a game i played long time ago,"I can't remember the name of the game and I wanted to play it again, i hope someone can help me find it! Here is what i remember about it:It was an online PVP game where one team were the aliens and the other were soldiers (futuristic/sci-fi style).The objective of each match was to destroy the enemy's base. There were classes for both human and aliens (for example engineers, soldiers, big slow aliens, small fast aliens, builder aliens). Most of the alien type of characters looked ant-like with differing sizes. I think one of the classes of aliens was called Tyrant and it was this huge-ass very high hp and dmg ant. Throughout the match bot teams were building their bases with different defense systems and building that buffed you up. For aliens some building allowed to spawn as a different type of alien (like the big Tyrant guy).

EDIT: It was a FPS style game, so not Starcraft :)

CryptoCurrency,Unpopular opinion about moon and doge,"I've seen so much hate for dogecoin here, and extreme love for moon, and both are shitcoins according to definition(and by shitcoin I don't mean deserving to be hated, just mean having no real discernible prupose). Some guy commented that some people are being fed by moons, and we can't hate that. My point is yes we shouldn't, but other shitcoins also deserve a better reaction too. 
I can understand their community may be blindsided, but that's mostly because they are new to crypto, and do we want to treat new people like that in our community? Also if someone is profiting with doge what's the harm in that? I for one don't see any.

CryptoCurrency,VISA will focus on 5 key crypto areas!,"This is just the start but it is progress towards the solidification of the crypto movement! 

The first of the five areas mentioned by the VISA CEO is enabling consumers to purchase these currencies or Bitcoin, noting that they are exerting effort to ensure that they are facilitating the use of Visa cards to buy.

The second one is allowing digital currency cash-outs to fiat, which means converting digital currency to fiat on a Visa credential, making the funds available for shopping at any of the 70 million Visa merchants.

The third area is enabling financial institutions and fintech partners to offer crypto options for their customers. Kelly said they have created APIs that give customers of financial institutions the ability to purchase, hold and even trade digital currencies held by the first federally charted digital asset bank in the U.S., Anchorage.

Meanwhile, the fourth area is settlement. With this regard, Kelly said, “We’ve upgraded our infrastructure to allow a financial institution to settle with these in a digital currency with stablecoin, starting with USDC.”

Kelly said the last area of opportunity and, perhaps one of the most challenging, in the crypto space that they are focusing on is working with central banks.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Down payment vs fully finance new construction?,"It’s a long story but I’ll try to keep this to the point.  My wife and I own a 50-acre farm, of which the land is worth approximately $400k (no mortgage).  We plan on building a new home on the land, which will likely cost us about $700k.  We also currently live in and own another home/land worth approximately $700k total ($390k mortgage balance) which we plan to live in until the new home is built, then we will sell.  We have about $50k in liquid savings/investments, and another $300k in retirement (which we obviously do not want to touch).

We are considering fully financing the construction loan with the land value as collateral rather than putting any extra money down, and not refinancing after we sell our current home.  The thought process is we could invest the cash from our current home and likely cancel out the interest on the new mortgage considering how low interest rates are right now.  We also could always throw more money in later and refinance but, honestly, we have bought/sold three homes in the last 10 years (this will make #4, we had to relocate several times for family/work reasons but this is going to be our “forever home”) and the thought of going to closing one more time makes my skin crawl.  The one downside I can think of to not making a larger down payment is that our new mortgage payment will exceed 40% or our current take home pay, and we also have two car payments of about $600/month combined (no other debt).  This should only be a temporary issue though since my wife is taking time off for maternity and is currently between jobs until she decides to go back sometime in the next 6-12 months.

I don’t know, I’m very debt-averse and do not like to over-extend myself, but we would likely have about $350-400k in savings/investments after we sell our current home that we could tap into as-needed, and wouldn’t be tied up in equity.  On paper it seems like a reasonable plan, but any feedback would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!",finance
investing,Persistent high inflation won't happen,"The Fed can raise interest rates to infinity in lock step with rising prices to tame inflation when they want. This Fed power is far more effective than money printing. Right now, they *want* asset inflation, which through a wealth effect, stimulates aggregate demand. Powell doesn't want or need to spook markets. Markets obey him.

The lessons from the 18/19 market tantrums, Europe after the 08 crisis, and Japan's lost decade were that stagflation (moderate inflation, rolling recessions) has a gravitational pull. It is better to risk moderately higher average inflation in the short to medium term to reach escape velocity.

Current sources of inflation are tied to asset inflation (housing inputs) and only seem dramatic in the the short to medium term. The Fed is comfortable with this because they want the wealth effect from asset inflation. This will make people feel rich so they spend freely as COVID goes away.

Also, the Fed has orders of magnitude more data and gets it at speeds that were unimaginable four decades ago. Why four decades? That's how long it's been since we had an inflation problem!

The Fed will coast or feather the brake pedal to slow down, instead of stomping down on repurchases. They've learned how to do so from the 2018/2019 market tantrum. The Fed is correct to be much more concerned about escaping stagflation.

CryptoCurrency,Could crypto actually benefit monetary policy?,"I apologize up front as I am probably wording this in a weird way..... but something I've started thinking about recently is if crypto might actually benefit our governments, or at least benefit monetary policy in the sense that we know it. 

What I mean by that is........ in the United States the Federal Reserve has basically said that they are ok letting the money printers go brrrrrr and that they will do everything in their power to keep the economy afloat which means they are going to keep introducing new dollars into the system. Obviously this is going to increase inflation. Once the average person is aware of crypto I would imagine it could be commonplace for people to throw money into crypto to keep from losing out to inflation.

With that said..... is it possible that with the introduction to crypto in the mainstream that it would give the Federal Reserve more incentive to keep printing money since they know that people have options to protect themselves from inflation? I'm curious to know everyone's thoughts on this.",cryptocurrency

And because economy is booming, to cut down overheating, they must increase interest rates. This means that all tech stocks, Nvidia, Amazon, Netflix etc become even more overvalued. And having overvalued stock is very risky play.

And of cause second thing is summer season and Covid-19. Covid-19 is about to end , people start traveling, shopping etc. This means that we don't need to use Netflix so much. And amazon. People are going to spend their money on other things. Tech becomes even more overvalued then.

personalfinance,Paying extra principal on mortgage vs. NOT investing it.,"I'm well aware of the mathematics behind not paying off a mortgage early. At low interest rates it makes more sense to invest in the market based on historic returns than to throw extra at a mortgage. Despite this, we've still been paying a few hundred extra each month - my reasoning being that the thought of a house paid off early is REALLY appealing, and even though 3.25% is pretty low, our mortgage is a 15/15 adjustable so I was hedging my bets in case rates went way up after the first 15 years.

With the super low rates this past year though I took advantage and am in the process of re-financing to a 20 year (automatically cutting five years off our timeline) at only 2.5%. Due to a lower balance and lower rate, our minimum payment will go up less than $100. With the interest rate being so low and locked in, I'm wondering if I should bother continuing to pay extra each month. Here's the thing - I wouldn't plan on investing that extra money since I already max out my IRA, my wife has a small 403B as well as a solid pension and (not to count the chickens prematurely) we likely stand to inherit not a small amount at some point down the road. With no early retirement plans we feel pretty solid and don't feel the need at this point to stick money in a taxable account, so that extra 2-3 hundred would probably become flexible spending money since we currently don't really spend on anything other than necessities.

What would you do? Continue the poor returns strategy of paying the house off early (planning on being here for the foreseeable future), start a taxable account with a few hundred a month, or give ourselves some fun money?",finance

personalfinance,Trying to set-up a plan for my parents,"Backstory to preface my question:

My parents receive their income from two sources
1. Private S-Corp Dividends (~7.5k/month)
2. Disability (~2.2k/month)

Both have terrible spending habits and purchase unnecessary items. (&gt;$5k in online purchases each month.) I have tried for years to stop them, and they always fold, going right back to their old ways. Most of their purchases are from eBay and Facebook so you can gauge the quality of these purchases.

Over the past year they have stopped paying their mortgage, their bills in general and have still continued their spending habits. If anything, exacerbated them. 

They have asked for money from me, my brother, my grandparents when I’m reality they should have more than enough to live a comfortable life. We are all fed up with it and want to make a change. I am calling to you for some guidance on how to properly do this.

Their current debt:
440k in mortgage
~100k in cc debt
~50k in misc debt I don’t know about but is probably there.

Currently we are trying to sell their home which would pay off their debts entirely and then some. (~900k post taxes) Surely if the leftovers go to them, they would spend it all in a matter of a year on invaluable things.

So what do I need guidance on?

1. I have been looking into a guardianship program so that they no longer would need to budget for bills, etc. I believe that having a third party manage the money would help them become financially responsible for the time being. Is that a good idea? If so, how would I go about initiating that as I would like it to be in place, prior to the sale of their home.

2. How do I find them an apartment as a transition home for the time being so that their home can sell? (They cannot stay there as obvious repairs need to be conducted.)

I currently have a mortgage with Wells Fargo with a maturity date of 04/45 with $171,466.76 principal balance and a 3.625% interest rate.  The monthly payment on this is $1,351.36 once the escrow is included.  

I also have a solar loan with LoanPal with a maturity date of 11/2039 with $20,001.94 principal balance and a 3.99% interest rate.  I have to make a payment in the next few days to bring the principal balance down to $13,896.15 in order to avoid reamortization.  Currently the monthly payment on this is $88.62 but if I don't make this $6,105.79 payment from the solar tax credit the payments will jump up to $127 a month.

LoanPal is offering to combine my solar loan and mortgage together with a 30 year $194,000 combined loan at a 2.99% interest rate.  They explained that the monthly payment for this would be close to $1,226 per month, a savings of $213/month from what I'm paying for my mortgage and my solar loan currently.  If I take this offer I also don't have to pay the $6,105.79 fee.

That sounds great on the surface but what I can't wrap my head around is if I would be paying more in the long run by taking this offer and if so by how much?  The lender was explaining to me that I would be saving money by doing this but I can't help but feel like I will be paying significantly more in the long run, and he's just trying to do his job.

Is the lower interest rate worth it?  Should I stick with the current loan that I already have 5 years on?  Any help understanding my options here would be greatly appreciated!

dogecoin,My theory on the power of Doge 🚀,"So here’s what I’ve been thinking for awhile, maybe someone else out there feels the same. I first learned of our beloved crypto at the end of January and have been on this rocket since $.025.

With Robinhood not allowing customers to hold their own crypto, they don’t technically have to sell the crypto at the same rate/amount as their users are selling. 

So the collective human consciousness buying and selling dogecoins on RH is like an unbeatable hedge fund with limitless liquidity working for RH. When RH’s numbers don’t line up to keep things working, they halt customer trading so that they can dump excess doge for USD. All the while the RH wallet still slowly grows in the background and Doge increases in value while the demand rises exponentially and the supply only leaves the paper-handed. They’ve essentially created a money printing machine just like the FED.  The good news is that the value for RH lies in maintaining this monopoly (and if they ever give users wallets like they say, Doge will be even stronger). This is probably causing most Doge miners to also start hodling as well. 

The Network effect has already gone parabolic with Doge, and companies/wealthy investors FOMOing into it seems insane but is probably a smart move while it’s under 50 cents. Maybe someday I can say the same but for $5. Hyperinflation can lead to scary numbers for the no-coiners. 

The worldwide pandemic opened so many eyes to how corrupt and manipulatable fiat currency is, and I believe Doge has passed the tipping point now. It’s community is so strong and many of us won’t sell our Doge because we know that the US dollar is the real shitcoin.

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, May 4, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, May 4, 2021**

Stocks fell on Tuesday following a mixed session yesterday, as the selloff in technology stocks accelerated following remarks from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Market participants wait for the next set of corporate earnings reports and economic data, particularly the April Jobs report due to be released May 7.

Stocks fell after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen suggested she thought interest rates in the US might need to rise in the near term in order to prevent an economic overheating as recovery continues. Rising rates would weigh on the valuations of growth companies and could slow down the recent rally to fresh highs. Janet Yellen said, “It may be that interest rates will have to rise somewhat to make sure that our economy doesn't overheat, even though the additional spending is relatively small relative to the size of the economy. It could cause some very modest increases in interest rates to get that reallocation, but these are investments our economy needs to be competitive and to be productive. I think our economy will grow faster because of them."" This somewhat contradicts recent commentary from members of the Federal Reserve, will have to see how this story unfolds.

Earnings season continues to exceed even the most optimistic expectations, with more than 85% of the companies that have reported exceeding expectations by an average of 22.1%, according to data from FactSet. These strong earnings beat, however, many companies did not see their stocks pop up. Analysts largely chalk this up to the already elevated expectation Wall Street had coming into this earnings season. Hilary Kramer (no relation) said, “The numbers were good but Wall Street's response was neutral at best. When the best earnings growth since 2010 spawns a yawn it's pretty clear that perfection is priced in. While there's no seasonal sell signal flashing, there's no immediate reason to buy either. This is a great opportunity to review your positions, make any adjustments, and then retreat to the sidelines for the next few months.”

The Labor Department will release its April jobs report on Friday, which is expected to show a staggering nearly 1 million payrolls came back last month, accelerating March’s gain. As a reminder, in March, the Department of Labor reported nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 for the month while the unemployment rate fell to 6% (unemployment rate was 14.6% in April 2020). Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 675,000 and an unemployment rate of 6%.

personalfinance,Wrong routing/account number input on tax return. What are my next steps? (USA),"I filed my tax return in the beginning of April, and requested direct deposit. A family member did it for me; this same family member has always done taxes for our family and I've never had an issue previous to this. 


Both the federal and state (Michigan) were accepted within two days of filing, and the estimated deposit date was April 24th; in that time, I received a *Notice of Change* letter from the Department of Treasury making an amend to my Home Heating Credit. I understand that there's a bit of a delay with the IRS, especially when there needed to be corrections made, so I wasn't concerned that the refund hadn't come yet...until I was looking over my tax return and noticed that both the routing number and the account number were wrong. The routing number is way off, and the account number is a single digit off (the same one repeated twice). The family member who did my taxes via TurboTax apologized profusely, and told me that the site wasn't letting them change the routing number from the information put in last year (my bank merged with another, so the routing may still be associated with the old bank), and that they must've accidentally hit the number twice when putting in my account information.


I contacted my bank and they told me they have no way of knowing if an attempt was made by the IRS to deposit the funds. I got in touch with the IRS, but haven't been able to get ahold of a live person in order to speak with them and see about cancelling the direct deposit in favor of a paper check.


What I'm wondering is, is there anything I can do at this point to ensure I get my refund? Will the IRS just send me a paper check to the address on the return when the account proves invalid? I also moved last year, after tax time (July of 2020), so the address on this year's return is different from the one I filed last year. I'm really hoping, if they do send a paper check, they would send it to my current address (which was input correctly on the return I just filed) instead of the old one. 


I know this is a little bit of a mess, and I'm sorry if it's confusing; I'm just trying to make sense of this and hopefully gain some reassurance. Like many people, COVID hit my family finances hard and I'm counting on getting this refund to help rebuild our financial stability.

I'm starting graduate school in the fall, and am debating whether or not to take out loans or pay up-front. My wife and I are expecting our first child, and have enough saved up for my school plus expected baby expenses.

I want to keep as much in savings/brokerage as possible. I'm convinced it can make enough in a brokerage account for it to be worthwhile, and I like having access to it in case we have big unexpected expenses. We would then pay down the loans aggressively once school is done. My wife wants to avoid taking on debt.

*“It’s not something I’m predicting or recommending,” Yellen, a former Federal Reserve chair, said during an online event hosted by the Wall Street Journal. “If anyone appreciates the independence of the Federal Reserve, I think that person is me.”*

altcoin,A Paradigm Shift; how can we use it? (Charity Tokens and Sustainable/Ethical Cryptocurrencies),"I believe we're a part of a paradigm shift occurring globally and am posting this because I want your ideas, I want to learn about new projects that are doing good and making positive changes to peoples lives and the environment, and that you will share what you've learned along the way.

***What is the paradigm shift?***

We're moving to decentralized technology. The shift aims to remove a central authority and create immunity to government interference or manipulation. Currently, this is fueled by cryptocurrencies such as BTC, Eth, etc shifting the store of value from FIAT, ultimately, allowing these cryptocurrency communities to become the decision-maker.

...so my question is if we're becoming the decision-makers; how do we leverage the capital inflows to change people's lives for the better and help mitigate the impact and risks of climate change?

***What I've learned?***

**1) Why there is so much capital flowing into assets and increasing the price of cryptocurrency:** The world has seen governments ramp up quantitative easing measures across most major countries globally. For example, the U.S with $1.9T, which has resulted in significant capital flowing through the systems; reserve banks buy bonds from gov (which means the government borrows money from the Reserve Bank), who use the borrowed money (bond) and spend it on citizens (stimulus packages, COVID relief, etc), this goes into the hands of citizens.. Governments also buy company bonds (lend companies money) that invest this money into new investments, products, services, or goods to create GDP or simply, pay their staff, etc - which means more people get hired and have money and invest...interest rates are also very low, which means companies (and people) can borrow easily. In layman's terms, a lot of people globally now have discretionary funds to invest, which is why most asset classes (including Crypto) are seeing all-time highs.

**2) Mining is energy-intensive and often bad for the environment**.. with some studies claiming the electricity needed to mine bitcoin is more than used by 'entire countries'.

**3) There has been a recent rise in self-generating liquidity tokens** that redistribute transaction fees to holders to 'moon which seems to be focused mostly on wealth creation - but what about governance, charities/the environment?

**Summary:**

With so much capital inflows into Cryptocurrencies, a major paradigm shift occurring globally to decentralized ways of living we should be starting to think about how can we use this momentum to do better, right?

***Charity Tokens (here is an awesome one I recently found!):*** [***https://www.milktoken.net/***](https://www.milktoken.net/)

**1) Milk and Butter Token (charity token)** that has already raised $25k (which is awesome given they only have a \~$1m market cap) with Food for Life Charity Global (which has projects occupying over 60 countries and volunteers who provide up to 2,000,000 free meals daily!). 

Looks like the token gathers fees on every Butter transaction and the holders of the Butter token can then use their tokens to cast their vote on which charity should receive the next donation.. Tokens are also deflationary so it looks like holders will be rewarded over time.

**2) Sustainable Coins based on Kilowatt hour (KWh) consumed per transaction**

dogecoin,Its been a crazy ride!,"So, just for fun, I bought 500 dollars worth of dogecoin at .03. I didn't expect much.

Let's just say I am impressed...but what impresses me more is the Doge movement that has been created around this ""Joke cryptocurrency.""

I have been so impressed by this community. I see so many of you guys paying things off, buying dream toys, and most importantly...Doing Only Good Everyday.

Personally, I have had more fun watching the price go up and down and the incessant optimism of the Doge Evangelists than I will from spending the earnings when and if I actually cash out (10.00 is my cashout price). This is not a high stakes thing for me. At 50 years old, I have made enough good investments to keep me fed and sheltered for life when and if I retire PLUS leave a good inheritance for my kid...yet...I keep the price on an open browser on my desktop and check in every 10 minutes or so, in spite of only risking 500 bucks. Never have I had this much fun.

So, I say to you, good job! You have managed to turn cryptocurrency and (once again) the financial community on its head.

CryptoCurrency,I was wrong about Doge,"I think like most investors, when I first heard of Dogecoin I scoffed. “How could an inflationary coin named after a meme be valuable?”. 

I vividly remember this was when Doge was at $0.01 for the first time in 2018. Like most, I looked at it and moved on to never think about it again.

As of writing Doge is at $0.55. I believe the coin has reached a point of legitimacy - even if it’s named after a confused Shiba. To be honest I don’t know why we, as investors, scoff at different investments. I mean, in theory everything we own was once a Doge.

So here I am, I guess I’m admitting defeat - but in a celebratory way. Congratulations to all who saw the potential in doge, I hope the gains are as good as I can imagine!

personalfinance,What is the best way to approach closing on my mortgage with the goal of getting my monthly payment at a specific value?,"My wife and I are about two months out from closing on a mortgage and we'd like our monthly payments to be a specific value that we feel we can afford on my salary only. This will be the house in which we plan to live and raise our family.

The borrowed amount is about $650,000. About $50,000 has been paid upfront to the builder to cover upgrades which will be credited at closing. This is a VA loan. We are purchasing 2.875 points and ending up with an interest rate of 2.25%. Our closing costs are around $37,500. Our P&amp;I is about $2,500 and escrow is about $1,200. I think their property tax estimates are a little high, but I've never owned this much house or land and never been in this area, so not sure if that will go down at all. They did overestimate our homeowner's insurance by about $85/month, so escrow will be closer to $1,115. This is leaving us with a monthly payment of around $3,615. We'd like to get this number closer to $1,800.

We have about half of the borrowed amount in savings, though we're intending to use some of this cash to pay for a fence, pool, and a detached garage. We also own enough cryptocurrency to pay for the house without a loan, but would like to maintain as much of that investment as possible.

Our best guess is that we should put about $300,000 down to get the monthly payments to where we want them, but I've read that putting close to 50% down on a house is unusual and may be a bad idea. We don't think we can pay for any more points. Are there any other options?

tl;dr I want to put 50% down on my house to get my monthly payment to a specific number. I could just buy the house, but I don't want to sell a large portion of my investments to do so. The internet suggests that making such a large down payment might be a bad idea, but I'm not sure why or if that advice applies to my situation.",finance

personalfinance,Does it make sense to make additional mortgage payments if we plan to sell?,"Hello. Current mortgage is $1235 per month, currently applying an additional $335 to principle per month, for a total of $1570.

So this is a ""starter home"" for us, we plan on selling in the next 2-5 years, and use the proceeds from the sale of this house as the down payment for our next house. I am not sure if we should continue to apply the additional $335 per month to principle, or if that amount should be saved elsewhere? It is intended to be used toward the down payment on our next home. 

Our thought process is, we are paying down the balance and will get it back when we sell. Is this the best thing to do?

CryptoCurrency,"A common misconception around ""unlimited supply"" versus ""fixed supply"". Know your coin.","So, yes, a kind of Doge related post, but more generally about unlimited supply versus fixed supply. 

**WTF is doge?**

My understanding so not FA. Dogecoin was meant to be a meme coin before ""memecoin"" was a definitive term. 
I might be wrong on the actual original project but I remember the early days the idea was for Dogecoin, with a fixed supply of 10,000, to bond to real life memes as some form of value, and meme creators could receive Doge for their content... It seems like although the project never had established such a system, in another way memes have driven the coin to become itself a great meme.

Anyway enough about memes, in actuality a fixed supply coin is much less prone to inflation. Also the larger the overall quantity and market cap increases on the coin, the less the supply rate becomes an issue. 

Think of it, you own 10k of all 100k dogecoins, and in a minute the total doge coins increase to 110k, you lost around 10% of total ownership of the asset, bringing your ownership from 1/10th to 1/11th.
But if you own 10k doge and the total in circulation (or held) is 126b as in 2020, that same minute of supply has a diminishing effect of only 0.0000079395%. 

Long term even if the hype and buyer interest subsides, the general nature of unlimited supply isn't a deal breaker. In coins that offer staking / interest, the coin you receive is from supply to generously counteract the coin's supply mechanisms. Just like interest in a fiat savings account.

The fiat currencies we currently use to buy our groceries, cars, rent etc. is unlimited supply where the supply is unfixed and increases with, or faster, than inflation, and evidently increases with inflation, what was a $200million stimulus cheque in 1980 is a $3trillion cheque today. Additionally the interest rate we receive in from savings in banks is only arbitrarily tied to inflation.

In short, unlimited-cap fixed-supply isn't really a valid argument against an alt coin. Its not really unlimited supply, its unlimited cap. The supply is actually fixed. The point of crypto is to rethink finance, and a fixed supply is a pretty promising long term model. 

Anyway, an ability for project managers to increase supply of a coin based on personal greed would change my opinion. But as a basis built in mechanism of alt coins or DeFi, it stands strong.",cryptocurrency

stocks,You should be happy about an interest rate increase!,"As soon as someone from the FED or the Treasury comments on the topic of interest rates and inflation, all hell breaks loose here on Reddit. People are asking why the market is losing so much and others are writing ""stay strong"" messages.

You have to remember that interest rates in the US are at an unhealthy low level. Look around the world: Japan has had zero interest rates for decades, Europe for about ten years. And that's not going to change there anytime soon. Italy and other southern European countries have immense mountains of debt, and the ECB cannot raise taxes under these circumstances. The average person in Europe still tends to have his money invested in bonds or in a savings account, and his money is worth 2% less there every year thanks to inflation. Zero interest rates are robbery! The states in Europe deleverage themselves for 10 years at the expense of their citizens.

At the moment it looks like zero interest rates are a one-way street. The U.S. should return to a normal interest rate level as soon as possible to avoid such conditions. Even if you have to accept that the market will drop 10% (if you are *somewhat* diversified).",finance

financialindependence,Few tips for people who DONT make 150K a year and are pulling a REGULAR salary like me (America),"While I am young (21), I have MANY friends who are already financially independent and FIRE'd at 30 - 35. I am living the way they did and it is GLORIOUS. It made me truly realize how much of a ""Consumer culture"" and not a ""Responsible culture"" we are as average Americans. 

Here's what I've learned about being financially independent while on a 50K - 80K *household* budget. For an individual budget, this would be making around $15 an hour or above. The KEY to all of it is: 

1. **Reduce consumption** 
2. **Go without for a time so you can save for things that last**
3. **Be as humble as possible with your possessions** 
4. **Reduce your living space to what you use**
5. **Don't sacrifice lasting peace for instant gratification**

I'll explain each one: 

1. **Reduce consumption:** American *households* spend a **median amount  of 18K a year** on ""Elective purchases"". The criteria for the study was vast. And I don't want to get into it. But essentially ""Elective purchases"" is anything that isn't adequate housing, food, transportation, utilities, and communication devices. For example, American households making the median amount of income of $65,712 in the US spent around **28% of their income on elective purchases**. If you cannot learn how to save your money and resist the urge to spend extra cash when it is there, **you will never be financially independent**. This applies to **EVERYTHING BELOW**. 
2. **Go without for a time so you can save for things that last:** For this example, I'll use a computer. I work in the entertainment industry as a composer. I had a choice around 1 1/2 years ago. I could have taken my $800 and bought a mid-grade laptop, or I could have saved for somethig that lasts longer by going without for another 8 months. Basically, had I bought the $800 laptop, it would have lasted me around 2 years with the heavy lifting I do on the PC. However, if I instead saved twice as much, in the long run I would be spending around half as much on equpiment. I instead decided to build a desktop for $1,300 with 4X as much storage, cooling power, RAM, and vRAM. My PC now will last me a minimum of 6-8 years. I will end up saving THOUSANDS over the course of my career by making this choice instead. You can do this with **anything**. Don't buy that offbrand pot set for $25 that's going to warp in 2 years. Save up another $25 and buy the $50 pot set that will last you 10 years. Don't buy the cheap clothes that will only last 1 - 2 years. Save up for the clothes that are twice as much that last 5 - 10 years. It's that sort of future thinking that makes a difference and reduces cost of living over time. 
3. **Be as humble as possible with your possessions:** Think about something. How much money do we spend, to impress people who don't care, and who we don't even like? **Why** do you need to spend the extra $2,000 on the guest room lighting for your forever home? Is someone really going to care? Do you **really** need that new dress or will people honestly not remember what you wore to the last Christmas party? Why not do a Christmas sweater instead? Is **$300** for one dress you only wear once a year really worth it in the long run? These small decisions seriously impact your overall financial health. Why do people buy fancy cars when they can't afford them? Because they don't realize that impressing people only brings temporary happiness. Even if it's buying little ceasars for the kid's birthday party instead of Dominoes, these little decisions add up into the thousands over time. And those thousands could be the seed you need planted for future financial independence. 
4. **Reduce your living space to what you use:** A study was done on a regular middle class family with a 2,200 square foot home. They found that the family only consistently used around 600 square feet of the 1,200 square foot first floor. The formal dining room, the formal living room, the front porch, (The two biggest rooms of the house) were unused. The family could have easily purchased a home that was around 1,500 square feet instead and hardly noticed a difference. **Just because you CAN purchase $100,000 more of house due to low interest rates doesn't mean you SHOULD.** That's the mistake our generation and millenials keeps making. Why not do what our parents did? Live in a house 1,200 square feet or less and pay $500 a month for our mortgage instead of $1,500 - 2,000 a month for a mortgage? You will save on utilities, maintenance, and most imporatantly, you save around $100,000 - 150,000 over the course of 30 years that you didn't have to pay to the bank. Or you could go extreme and do a tiny home. I know tiny home owners who pay less than $300 a month. That includes utilities, mortgage, renting the land or property taxes, and everything else. $300 a month plus food and gas is REALLY cheap. It's possible. 
5. **Don't sacrifice lasting peace for instant gratification**: $15 here, $20 there, $10 here, $25 there. That shit adds up. And it adds up fast. If you spent $15 a day on bullshit you don't even need, that's over **$5000** a year and over **$100,000** in 20 years. Think about how many times you walk into dollar tree looking for a pair of tweezers and walk out with $15 worth of bullshit you don't need. Think about what happens when you go to the grocery store hungry. **$15 a day for 30 days is nearly $500 a month, which would be close to maxing out your ROTH IRA.** So if you made $15 an hour, and you could afford one hour a day, or even could afford putting in the few hours of extra overtime a week in order to be diligent with your IRA, that's as close to garanteeing you to one day be a fucking millionare when you retire as you're gonna get. Many people get by with almost nothing because it's necessary, and then the moment they catch a break and see some extra cash in their bank account, it's gone before the weekend ends. Don't be that guy. That extra break is a seed to grow. Don't eat the seed now. Plant it and eat the fruit from the tree later. 

Now for those of you making $30,000 - 40,000 as a household. that's rough. I guess y'all already do what I explain above out of necessity instead of choice. Your best bet is to gain more income in however way you can. Grind the fuck out of life and don't let your head go below the financial waters. 

But for everyone else, if you're pulling $50,000 or more a year as a household, try out some of the tips below. Because if you consume less, you have more capital to invest and make your real dreams come true!",finance

stocks,Some thoughts about the current state of the market.,"*This is a weird market right now.  Markets are at the whim of Yellen and Jay Pow, there's uncertainty due to Covid, inflation fears, lots of new money and retail coming in.  Is this sustainable?  Are we headed for doomsday?  Here are my thoughts on all of this.  (Originally meant as a response to the daily thread so it may seem kind of comment-y)*

Me personally I have decided that even if we have a major correction I still like the fundamentals.  There are things to watch out for like high levels of federal and corporate debt, but I don't realistically see that as being an issue at least in the next 10 or so years.  Not all the debt is being put to good use but a lot of it is... the US economy still looks strong and growing.  Inflation is a concern as well, but one can hedge against that and I don't think we'll experience anything truly terrifying like hyperinflation.

The economy is opening back up.  There's pent-up demand for consumer goods and for travel, which encompasses various industries itself.  Biden is pumping money into infrastructure.  High-growth opportunities exist, as we all know, with tech in AI, cloud computing, EVs, renewable energy, etc.  The outlook looks healthy IMO.

Uncertainty around the corner, for sure.  Geopolitical tensions with China (not expecting war but this is a new dynamic).  Climate change.  Inequality and rising debt.  Definitely unprecedented challenges here.  But again, I don't see this as being a serious issue at least for another 10 years if not further out.  An optimist's take would be that, despite a lot of BS in dealing with Covid (anti-masing, anti-vaxxing, etc.), it seems like humanity did alright.  We could have done a lot better, for sure, and I'm sorry for anyone who lost loved ones to this.  But we could have done a lot worse, too.  That makes me somewhat optimistic even in the face of these long-term challenges.

I like the way Biden is handling things, too.  I didn't vote for him.  I actually didn't vote (shoot me).  But from the madness in the Capital to the way things are looking now... this looks like improvement.  It's may not be major, but at least we're headed in the right direction now.  This makes me optimistic for the future as well.

But again, folks.  In the next 10 years or so I'm not really worried at all.  Longer-term, let's see.

This is coming from a new investor who was hesitant about putting his money in to the market this year.  I did the research and I've gotten a handle on things, and my conclusion is what everyone has always said: ""time in the market beats timing the market"".  Now is as good a time as any to invest.  Even if the market falls off a cliff tomorrow, as long as you're accumulating good assets then you're good to go.  I'm sure we've all heard of ""Bob the world's worst market timer"".  He made it out alright.  (If you don't know about him, see [here](https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2014/02/worlds-worst-market-timer/)).

I recommend diversification, too.  I'm mostly in index funds and that includes VXUS, also.  I also like dividend paying stocks (more than bonds at the moment).  Nothing wrong with alternative assets like real estate or precious metals, either.  Be smart, be safe, and I think we'll be good to go.

This is just what I've gathered over the last few months of diving into all this and doing my research.  I'm new but FWIW my degree was in economics and I've been using that as a launching point to really dive into trying to understand what's going on right now.  The outlook to me looks good... just be smart, and reevaluate a little later on down the line.

And do your own research, of course. =\]",finance

personalfinance,Mortgage lender seems shady,"After shopping around a bit I picked this lender that promised lower rates.

btc,Feature requests for Bitcoin Cash Register app,"I just onboarded my first merchant to Bitcoin Cash! :) 

It's a health &amp; wellness center in Vancouver Canada that offers massage &amp; chiropractic services. They're not quite ready for me to reveal their name in this subreddit yet, because they still need to train the staff on how to accept Bitcoin Cash.

By onboarding this merchant, we discovered 4 killer feature requests that they would like to see in the Bitcoin Cash Register app:

1. Imagine a wellness center where there are multiple massage therapists &amp; chiropractors, and each one of them is their own independent contractor. In other words, each one of them receives their own independent payments for the services that they provide (so they're just paying monthly rent at the wellness center for their space). However, there is one receptionist at the front who takes payments for all the therapists. It would be killer if the Bitcoin Cash Register app allowed the ability to have DIFFERENT QR codes on the home screen, and each QR code fed into a different personal wallet. Each QR code could be listed with a different therapist's name on it, so the receptionist who takes payments would just tap on the QR code of the massage therapist by clicking on the therapist's name, and that payment would feed into that massage therapist's personal wallet on their own personal phone.

2. To take that idea to the next level, some of these massage therapists DON'T pay monthly rent, but instead, they share a percentage split with the business. So, for example, if I come in and pay $100 for my massage, 20% goes to the business owner and 80% goes to the massage therapist. It would be amazing if the Bitcoin Cash Register had different buttons for each therapist (see #1 above) — but the business owner could specify a % split between wallets"" for each button on the home screen. So the business owner could specify that ""this person's QR code on the home screen would split incoming payments — 80% to the therapist's wallet and 20% to the business owner's wallet"".

3. It would also be very cool &amp; convenient if the home screen of the Bitcoin Cash Register — where you type in the payment amount — had some basic math calculation functions on it. I know that this is expected to be done in the business owner's POS system instead, but it would be really convenient to just quickly type up some quick math. For example, if I bought 2 services (massage + chiropractic), they could just quickly type into the Bitcoin Cash Register home screen: $100 + $40, and it would total $140.

4. Long-term, 5-year vision for Bitcoin Cash Register app: Completely replace other point-of-sale apps altogether (such as Jack Dorsey's Square app) by allowing basic line item functionality that could provide basic receipts or invoices. For example, the receptionist could just select the line items of the services that I paid for: She would click on ""Massage"" on line item #1, and the price $100 shows up. Then she would click on ""Chiropractic Adjustment"" on line item #2, and the price $40 shows up. Then, the total would be $140, I pay with the QR code of the therapist of choice, and I receive an email with the invoice of what I've purchased. And then, the chosen therapist would receive their percentage of the BCH that I paid, while the business owner receives their percentage of the BCH that I paid.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Refinancing Advice,"My husband and I are considering refinancing our home to take advantage of the lower interest rates.    
We have two options: 30 years at 3.125% or 15 years at 2.5%  
We have been in the house for 6 1/2 years and are currently paying 4.25% interest on a 30 year loan and the principal is $80k.  
If we went the 30 year route our payment would reduce by about $165 per month. If we went the 15 year route our payment would increase by about $25 per month, which is insignificant.  
Our end goal is to eventually own land. However, we need a significant down-payment for it. We're considering taking out a HELOC loan at 3.25% variable interest in order to make that down-payment once we find the land. Then we'll eventually sell the house once we are finished with the remodels. We are expecting this to happen within the next 1-3 years or sooner. 

If we went with the 30 year loan we'd have more money to invest in a safe index fund. However, if we went with the 15 year loan we'd have less in principal and would therefore potentially make more on the sale, but that's only if the housing market continues the way it is. We're looking for advice on what our best option is. Thanks!

personalfinance,"Saving, Checking and Investing Accounts. How to manage","So I'm a little late to the party but have been getting serious about saving and investing. I don't really know how to start but here we go. 

I'll start with what I have now and then what I am looking for. 

I have a 401k through my company with Charles Schwab. I also opened an investing account with Charles Schwab because originally I wanted to keep everything in one place, including saving, checking and investing (chose Schwab only because that is where I had the company 401k). 

I have a local federal credit union account that I use for cash transactions and nothing else. 

Everything else is with Chase. I have all my direct deposits and credit cards through chase. 

I am looking to keep my money in one spot as much as I can but am hitting a wall and hoping for some advice or insight on what other people of reddit do. I am thinking now that I may keep everything set up with Chase just because it would be easy to keep everything as it is. The only thing is, Chase has a .01% apy for their savings account, which is absolutely terrible and I know I can move my savings to another bank that makes around .5% apy. I have also been using think or swim by Td Ameritrade and it's awesome, I love seeing everything right there and being able to trade on the spot. 

This is the problem I'm facing, having money in multiple different accounts and multiple different banks. I'm wondering if I'm just overthinking this whole subject and it isn't too bad to just have a Chase checking, an Ally Savings, a local credit union for cash (not near a Chase), a Schwab employer 401k and a personal TD investment account. What I'm worried about with having multiple accounts is having money spread out everywhere and maybe needing it in one account but having to go through the hoops of transferring or pulling it out of other accounts for another. Hoping for some advice and maybe some personal experience from other people. Thank you! Also it's a mix of multiple flairs so I hope it's okay I chose other.",finance

CA / AZ (I now live in AZ but CPA had me file CA for 2019 after moving), TL;DR at the end.

Hello! I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/mthgls/surprise_21k_bill_from_the_irs_acct_says_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) a few weeks ago, that I had received [this](https://imgur.com/02k2WRj) 21k bill from the IRS, despite my amended 1040 showing 0 federal due, and having no debt to the IRS or anyone else. I sold some stock to take advantage of tax gain harvesting since I had a low income in 2019, and filed taxes through a CPA.

This subreddit figured out that this was likely because I used the non-filer tool for the stimulus last year, which created a 2019 tax return, and then when I filed the [real](https://imgur.com/a/W64UvOH) (amended) return through my CPA, the IRS seems to have *mistakenly* used the original return instead of the amended one. Since the automatically generated return doesn't include the 1099 brokerage numbers from that year reflecting the correct cost basis for the stock I sold, the system thinks I owe them 21k.

I eventually got through to a rep at the IRS, and after some investigating she said that she saw no reason why they would have reached the number they did, and **confirmed that they have my amended 1040** which shows the correct numbers. She said that I needed to write a letter and return it with the notice I got, stating that I disagree and asking for a full explanation of how they reached that number. She also put a 180 day hold on any action taken against me, which I thought should be plenty of time.

Here's what I returned with the notice the next morning certified, assuming that a human might see and process it:

""Hello,

I am disagreeing with the CP22A notice included, and would like it either just corrected, or if the IRS disagrees then a detailed explanation of how they arrived at the increase for 2019.

Those I've consulted with believe the error stems from the fact that I used the non-filer tool for the stimulus check, and because of that my CPA had me write ""amended EIP return"" on the paper 1040 when I filed it.

The IRS has my amended 1040, and we believe it reflects the correct numbers.

Appreciated, sincerely"" blah blah.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the beginning of the response I got today:

""Thank you for your inquiry of Apr. 20, 2021.

We accept your proposal to pay the amount you owe by Oct. 17, 2021.""

&amp;#x200B;

I definitely did not propose or accept any agreement to pay anything. This must be in reference to the 180 day ""hold"" that she put, but it bothers me that they're calling it an agreement because it implies that I acknowledge the debt as mine. The rest is basically 4 pages of threatening language, describing all the ways they're going to collect. There is

&amp;#x200B;

\-No explanation of how they reached that number

\-No indication that they saw the CSR's notes or took a look at the amended return.

&amp;#x200B;

It's signed by an operations manager, ""op 3.""

&amp;#x200B;

What is going on? I did what the IRS rep told me to do, and it seems like they just ignored it. - It has occurred to me that this might be an automated response to the 180 day thing that she put in place, but considering the amount, and the time frame, I'm now getting nervous and would like to proactively iron this out.

What's the next step? Thank you very much.

**TL;DR: Received IRS notice saying I owe 21k for 2019, from a return generated by the non-filer tool. amended 1040 does not reflect this. CPA agrees, IRS agent agrees, reddit agrees, yet written IRS response didn't address anything and they just plan to bulldoze ahead and collect. I am in the right, and I did what they asked. Now what?

CryptoCurrency,Crypto may be creating non-crypto investment opportunities.,"I want to propose a hypothesis and would appreciate economists or similar to comment: 

*Capital flight from stock markets into crypto, driven by FOMO, fundamentals, or as an investment trend, will deflate demand for traditional equities, as people rebalance their portfolios to include more crypto and less equities. Deflated demand, caused by less capital in equities, means lower prices for traditional equities.*

The crypto market cap is $2.89T today. The market cap of all stock markets is $49T. So the stock markets are collectively 17x that of crypto, and of the two investment types, crypto has about 5% of the total liquidity of the both combined.

I see this as an indicator that crypto still has massive potential to see an influx of money from stock markets, especially as boomers and similar underrepresented crypto users find cheap and easy and reputable ways to jump into the crypto gold rush.

As crypto projects come online, I expect they will become integrated into our lives in many ways, like tokenized interactions, which will drive crypto prices up as crypto becomes as useful a commodity as fuel is in your lambo(s).

Interest rates are historically low because the money supply is high. There are arguably not enough traditional investment vehicles to accommodate all of the money, leading to overvaluation of the stock market, and investment vehicles like mortgages around 1.7% on a five year fixed term, at least in my country. Stock market’s been roaring up since 2016, right? Because of the levers Trump pulled? Or because boomer wealth needs somewhere to be parked. And the boomers have heard of Amazon, so that’s what they want, never mind its trailing P/E ratio of 62.

Not all of the influx of money into crypto will come from the stock market. A lot of crypto investors seem to be young, and navigating crypto trading is much easier than stock trading. Young people are probably putting more cash into crypto from their paycheck-to-paychecks. Lots of people are dabbling, using “spare cash.” However! It could easily be the next level of crypto adoption: rebalancing portfolios to include crypto. That trend will mean huge gains for crypto.

I’m not saying stock markets will crash from the coming sector-wide investment portfolio rebalancing... but the markets will invisibly correct themselves based on the amount of money that happens to be in them.

All this to say, if we believe in crypto’s increasingly deflationary effect on the stock market, caused by siphoning trillions of dollars out of the markets and into crypto, how to capitalize on that in the stock market? Short SP 500? Doesn’t seem all that smart or elegant. How say you, financial experts?",cryptocurrency

At \~1M, we were hoping to keep our current home and perhaps rent it out, but at 1.3-1.5, I would feel more comfortable selling it and perhaps recasting half of the return into the new home to drive down the principal.

I’ve looked at various rules of thumb (25/36, 4x net, 5x gross, etc.) with mixed results. It seems like a $6K monthly PITI is the absolute max we could do, but it feels pretty high. If we targeted a home in the 1.3-1.5M range (expected total monthly of \~$5.5K) would that be stretching our net income too much? Our family doesn't spend much (cheap local vacations, affordable hobbies, etc.). In our  estimates, we’ve been omitting our cash bonus and vesting RSUs to stay conservative — is that the right thing to do here?

Any advice from this community would be appreciated. Thanks in advance!",finance
CryptoCurrency,A Historical View of Modern Threats,"This has taken a lot of reading for me to understand. Whether it’s been books, podcasts, classes, or internet articles, it took me a lot of different sources to piece together what really represents our money in this world. People often say, “money is fake” and I guess that they’re not wrong, but there is a real system behind our money that has evolved over thousands of years. Our history is riddled with events that tend to repeat over and over. If you believe that your crypto is a store of value, there are some historical events that you should be aware of that could repeat again in your lifetime. 

I’m not telling you that it’s doomsday, but just making you aware of some things that you might not have had a chance to read about in the past. People often get wrapped up in profits and losses and it becomes easy to forget about all of the instances like Mt. Gox that wiped out so many wallets. There are more things in this world to worry about than hackers and terrible exchanges, and I’ll try to break down some things I’ve learned that I think more people should know.

***Currency Vs. Money***

I’m sure most people on this sub understand the difference between currency and money, but for those of you who don’t, I will hit the basics. Although “money” doesn’t have a specific definition, it’s safe to say that “money” can be thought of as whatever asset or commodity a country deems as most suitable to maintain its currency’s value. Throughout history, we saw this mainly take the form of precious metals. This is because precious metals were the original decentralized network. Nations didn’t trust each other as they do now, and items like gold and silver wouldn’t lose their international value just because a country collapsed. This ensures that debts could always be repaid through the end settlement of precious metals if a currency fell. 

A common misconception people have is that gold has been the money of choice since the Egyptians, but it wasn’t until the 1700s that gold reclaimed its throne as the money of the world. You can thank Isaac Newton for that…. Yes that Isaac Newton, Master of the Royal Mint.

A currency is the primary form of trade in a nation that is representative of the “money” that they hold in their reserves. As citizens, we are very far from the sound money in society. This means that any debasement of the currency hurts us the most. This is magnified in our modern times since we don’t have a hard asset to turn to that will maintain our currency’s value. If our Dollars were backed by gold, you could theoretically buy gold yourself to maintain purchasing power regardless of the debasement. 

***What is Our “Money”?***

In the modern world of floating fiat currencies, the only thing backing our money is trust. Anyone exchanging a currency, whether it be Euros or Yen, do so because they believe that the nation controlling that currency will manage it appropriately and not default on their debts. This is why United States Treasury bonds are considered one of the last forms of “sound money,” since we’re supposedly the global superpower in trade with a healthy economy (lol). 

This framework also gives governments unlimited control of the money supply. That control that nations desire used to be sought after to maintain strength in the world. Now, it is because the economists working at the Fed understand that if they lose control of their nation’s currency, the system they are keeping held up on toothpicks is going to collapse. 

We do have historical evidence of what would happen to sound money when the citizens needed it most, and it almost always involved the government *removing* access to a store of value. 

**Executive Order 6102-**

In 1933, 4 years after the beginning of the great depression, President Roosevelt passed Executive Order 6102. This Executive Order required Americans to turn in their privately held gold to the government. The citizens were paid their gold’s fair value at the time of sale, but the whole reason for the buyback was to allow the Federal Reserve to more easily debase the currency and promote economic growth. 

**The Bank Restriction Act of 1797-**

Stemming from a war with France, the Bank of England faced a real threat of having its gold reserves depleted. To combat this, the British government suspended the convertibility of their paper notes to gold. This ban lasted over 20 years. Although they convinced citizens that the action was for the greater benefit of their country, it instead highlighted an issue with their financial system.

***What’s Changed with Our Crazy Modern World?***

In short, nothing has changed for the better. The United States government’s mismanagement of the money supply has had a rippling effect throughout the world. Starting years ago, countries were forced to debase their currency regardless of whether or not they wanted to. Why? As highlighted by Jeff Booth in his book *The Price of Tomorrow*, the global economy is a give-and-take. There is no nation’s economy that exists on its own. Similar to Jeff’s depiction, let’s dissect the relation between China and The United States. These two nations obviously have some issues with each other but are still forced to share economic relations. The economic ratio between these two massive nations has to either stay constant or change in small increments. A massive shock to either of these economies would negatively impact the other nation as well. This same idea is why you have seen Russia and China trading in non-USD currencies in recent years. Their divergence from the US economy would have to be a slow process to minimize the economic impact. 

***What does this all mean?***

In essence, be prepared for anything. Whether you want to use crypto as a store of value or gold, just remember that your country is going to be pretty unwelcome to whatever it is when you need it most. This conversation doesn’t really need to be had with gold because you could leave it in a shoebox under your bed if you wanted to, but the same can’t be said with crypto. I’m not here to give you advice, I’m just a believer that history tends to repeat itself. Our global economy is backed by a “promise to pay” system. Currently, we’re over a 3:1 debt to GDP ratio globally. 2020 should have highlighted that you need to be prepared for anything to happen. If you’ve never looked into a safe form of cold storage, it might be a good idea to familiarize yourself with it a little.

Just remember, every day is just a normal day until it’s not. If you’re into investing or trading but don’t get into the economics of the world, I’d recommend doing some research. The United States economy is at a very interesting point in history. Sadly, the reasons that make it interesting are not good things. 

***PS: I don't use Reddit often so I'm sorry if this is trash.***

stocks,Drone Delivery Canada – FLT.V (DD),"Drone Delivery Canada – FLT.V (DD)

**tldr;** Drone Delivery Canada isn’t here to replace postal workers in the next 10 years but has many use cases and a lot of revenue potential. It is currently an unprofitable growth stock that seems very promising. At $1.33 (CAD) this is a buy and I have a price target of $6.87 5 years out based on a 10 price to sales ratio.

&amp;#x200B;

*All numbers are in Canadian Dollars unless mentioned otherwise*

**Basic Stats: - (as of May 4, 2021)**

Price: $1.33

Market Cap: 279.38M

EPS: -0.08

Float: 209.61M

&amp;#x200B;

**Description**

Drone Delivery Canada (DDC) provides a drone delivery platform targeted towards various corporations including retailers, service organizations and government agencies and are capable of transporting up to 180kg over 200kms. They have a patented hardware/software platform. DDC has been developing its drone delivery technology since 2014. They are currently trading on the TSX.V Exchange under the symbol FLT, on the U.S. OTC Q B market with Nasdaq International Designation under the symbol TAKOF. As a venture company that is not profitable it is a risky investment but there are many upsides to investing in this innovative technology.

&amp;#x200B;

**Financials**

The company has reported assets worth $29M and $2.27M worth of liabilities so there is currently little worry of insolvency. With $23.4M in cash and yearly operating expenses of $14.5M, assuming no change, the company can operate with no financing for 1.6 years. This isn’t much of a worry due to increasing revenue and ease of financing.

2020 revenue was $265k and their total operating expenditure was $14.5M totaling a loss of $0.08 per share in 2020. Operating expense dropped in 2020, some key differences is an increase in advertising and marketing spend, a reduction in consulting expenditure, and an increase in personnel expenses. Research and development expenditure was almost the same which is good to see as they are still investing heavily in their technology.

Analyst estimate 2021 revenue of $6.59M which is over 2000% increase. While it is also expected for operating expenses to increase it’s good to see extreme revenue growth to match their high valuation of 271M. The current price/sales ratio is 1,021, assuming the same stock price and sales of $6.59M the price/sales ratio decreases to 41 which is much more reasonable, though realistically share price will increase this year. But even at twice the share price the price/sales ratio is 82 (which is still very high but much more reasonable than current, goes to show markets value future earnings). 2021 estimated EPS is -0.05 and profitability is expected in 2022.

The last thing to point out in DDC’s financial statements in they continue to invest heavily in patents. $140k in spent on patenting and trademarks in 2020 and $221k in 2019. With patents worth $750k as of December 31, 2020.

&amp;#x200B;

**Ownership and Leadership**

0.2% of shares are held by private companies, 0.48% by individual insiders, 7.08% by institutions and the rest by the general public. The low insider holding is often seen as a bearish factor, but the low institutional holding can hold potential upside as once the stock is up listed, we can see large purchases as companies start adding shares to funds.

Leadership:

The CEO Michael Zahra has been the President of Staples Business Advantage (B2B supplies), the president of Yahoo, and has been on the board of directors for Oak Ridges Moraine Land Trust and on the board of governors for North York General Hospital. So, while this is a start-up, they have a veteran leader. They have a strong lineup of C-Suite executives with experienced CFO and CTO. On top of this their board of advisors include the VP of Cargo at Air Canada, and a medical director for Sunnybrook Centre for Prehospital Medicine which is an important strategic piece. The downside of their leadership is they have very high salaries for a company not making any profit.

&amp;#x200B;

**Current Factors**

These are 3 current small factors that are worth mentioning

Partnership with DSV:

DDC entered in an agreement with DSV through its sales agent Air Canada that provides its drone delivery platform back in October 2019. The program became operational in March which was big for DDC as it is their first source of revenue. In which customers pay DDC a monthly fee for each drone route deployed. DSV provides and manages supply chain solutions for thousands of corporations. Which is a perfect partner for DDC. The initial agreement is for 15 months, with additional 1-year terms following the success of the first agreement.

Partnership with Edmonton Airport:

This partnership creates the world’s first airport drone delivery hub at Edmonton Airport using DDC’s platform. DDC and Edmonton airport will implement promote and market DDC’s delivery services. The agreement is for 5 years initially with the possibility of an extension unless the agreement is terminated

Patents:

DDC currently holds two US patents, one for its “FLYTE management” and one that covers aspects of its drone delivery technology and processes relating to controlled access zones for UAV landing and takeoff

&amp;#x200B;

**Future Use Cases and Catalysts**

Medical Response:

In 2019 researchers tested the speed of drones vs the speed of ambulances to respond to a 911 call. The drone carried an AED to the location which was approx. 8km away. The drone was allowed to fly at speeds of 80km/hr and arrived at the scene an average of three to four minutes before the ambulance. Those few minutes could make a life or death difference in a cardiac arrest patient’s outcome. This is why having the medical director for Sunnybrook Centre for Prehospital Medicine on the board of advisors could be a key to implementing their services to the medical field in the future.

US Expansion:

DDC has expressed their intention to expand to the United States in the past, which is in line with them filing US patents. Expanding into the US will open tons of new opportunities for them but will also be a large challenge.

Potential to move to TSX:

Moving up from the venture exchange to the TSX can pose many benefits. A big one that we care about is increase in share price. “An observation of 34 companies that graduated between October 14, 2005 and August 10, 2006, found that almost sixty per cent of the companies had an average share price over the thirty trading days post-graduation that was higher than the thirty trading days preceding graduation. On average, the share price of all 34 issuers went up over three per cent in that time frame, with four companies showing an increase of over 25 per cent”.

&amp;#x200B;

**Market Size**

In Ark Invest’s *BIG IDEAS 2021* report they talked about the delivery drone market. They predict that drone delivery platforms will generate nearly USD50 billion in revenues, USD14 billion in hardware sales, and USD3 billion in mapping revenues by 2025. And by 2030 drone delivery platforms will generate nearly USD275 billion in revenues, USD50 billion in hardware sales, and USD12 billion in mapping revenues.

For a total market cap of $67B USD by 2025 and $337B USD by 2030.

&amp;#x200B;

**Air Canada Cargo Partnership**

In Canada, 150K routes have been identified with their partner Air Canada Cargo. DDC’s revenue per route is $10,000/month. They are not even close to operating 150K routes so let’s start with 100 routes and build up.

|**Routes**|**Revenue/month**|**Yearly Revenue**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|100|$1M|$12M|
|1,000|$12M|$144M|
|10,000|$120M|$1.44B|
|25,000|$250M|$3B|
|150,000|$1.5B|$18B|

&amp;#x200B;

**Valuation**

Now let’s take that estimated yearly revenue and calculate share price based off price/sales ratio (assuming a 10x p/s which is a lot lower than current p/s).

|**Yearly Revenue**|**Market Cap**|**Share Price**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|$12M| 120M|$0.57|
|$144M|1.44B|$6.87|
|$1.44B|$7.2B\*|$34.35|
|$3B|$15B\*|$71.56|
|$18B|36B\*\*|$171.74|

^(\*reduced P/S ratio to 5)

^(\*\*reduced P/S ratio to 2)

It’s important to note that the bottom 3 numbers are highly unrealistic in the next 5-10 years and require perfect execution and market factors to reach that point even past 10 years. A more realistic target would be a share price of $6.87 5 years out (furthest out analyst prediction is $116.8M of revenue 4 years from now). This is assuming a 10x p/s which aligns for an emerging technology company. A 5 year prediction of 120M in revenue is also falls in line with the previously mentioned $67B drone delivery market size by 2025 predicted by Ark Invest.

A $6.87 price estimate 5 years out at present value, assuming an 8% return found in index funds, equals $4.61.

&amp;#x200B;

**Bear Case(s)**

Currently DDC is fitted for serving remote areas as there is a lot of regulation surrounding flying drones in urban areas. It’s also unrealistic to have dozens of drones flying around a city anywhere in the near future We need to see a shift in regulation for this to really take off. Big players such as Amazon and FedEx have been investing in delivery drone technology for years and most likely have very developed technology and infrastructure too. This does leave potential for a buyout if a company is trying to catch up to its competitors who have been investing in drone delivery. While financing will be relatively simple for this company this poses the risk of share dilution as they continue to spend money on research, patents, and other the expenses the company will need to sell more shares for cash flow.Lastly, their technology currently only allows delivery on predetermined routes that are from point A to point B and require a launch and landing pad so more technological development needs to happen.

&amp;#x200B;

This technology isn’t here to replace postal workers in the next 10 years but has a lot of different use cases now and will have more in the future.

CryptoCurrency,Theory on the current market state,"First off, if I used the wrong flair my apologies. 

Second off, this meant to be a strategic discussion based off of my limited understanding of current market trends, my experience in trading securities and crypto as a fundamentals investor looking at long term growth, and lastly hopefully some decent chat and discussions.

As always, DYOR, I'm not a CFA, I'm just some dude on the internet posting while taking a shit. If you listen to me, well, you'll probably lose money. So don't.

Background Points:
We've seen a fairly strong bull market in both securities and crypto.

Stimulus relief from various countries around the world, vaccine availability in some countries, and sentiment trending toward positivity (of course minus in some places like India, not trying to play down the catastrophic situation there).

However, we're seeing something that piqued my interest a fair amount, on the first instance, I wasn't sure if it was a one off, it's now happened over 100 times that I've documented in various discords, telegram groups, etc. that are generally not places I'd expect. I'm seeing a ton of people using home equity, stimulus checks, etc. to take out loans for the purpose of investing in securities and crypto.

The only data available is up to Q4 2020 via FRED for the US in terms of credit amounts and the distribution of where credit is held, so this is all speculative / I'm looking to see if this is a trend people have noticed as well.

Assuming one is to take out a loan from a bank for investing in the markets, the only way to make profit is to ""beat"" the interest rate of said loan.

If we see the market lose steam either or both in crypto or securities there's a finite chance that will cause a fair amount of overleveraged folks to panic.

No matter what, these people have to pay the loan bill, become insolvent, etc.

Either these overleveraged folks choose to hodl and lose more and more then sell for major losses to try and cover some future payments of the loan. Or they immediately panic sell and cause further downtrends.

I've seen enough people and been asked by enough people IRL if they should Yolo into doge, into GME, into TSLA, into (just today) ETC. I've seen people on discords dropping 10-20k on some shitcoin or security at ATHs, where those people should not have the liquid capital to enter that position. If it's one off, I'd write it off as someone who has a trust fund or something dumb like that. But it's starting to seem like a trend, and it's giving me food for thought.

As a reminder not a CFA, don't listen to me.

Please dear god though if you're taking out loans to invest in ANYTHING, be fuckin careful.",cryptocurrency
Bitcoin,"No, BTC isn't a problem with energy. Ignorance, and Selfishness is.(P.S. I don't mine or Hold BTC outside of dust)","In fact, I'm not even a huge supporter of Bitcoin.  I respect Bitcoin for what it has brought.

It kinda sucks that all other cryptos tank when it tanks.  I'd like to see Cryptos be their own market not depended on bitcoin's stability  to be stable themselves. 

It's like owning stock in a company that's  completely unrelated, and unreliant on google but watching your stock dip because google stocks dipped. 

That said, I'm not making this post to Shill against the FUD around bitcoins energy usage.   I'm gonna lay down a well informed post that shows you how IGNORANCE wastes more energy than Bitcoin ever could.

It's a long read, and even longer if you are fact checking it.

###So who am I? 


###What are my qualifications to talk about energy usage?

I'm a small business owner, I Run a Commercial HVAC/R Company (Heating Ventilation Air Conditioning Refrigeration).

Unfortunately I started this company a month before lockdowns hit and lost pretty much all my contracts.  (Non essential)   Worst part about it Is I actually started it to specialize in Indoor Air Quality, and Curing Building Sickness(Viruses, chemicals In the air).

 You'd think I'd be booming but since Asia bought out all our available products, most companies were stuck on a 6 month waiting list to get a products for one job nevermind enough to last through the pandemic.  You couldn't even find them online at the time even if you were willing to rip yourself off and pay 10x the price. 

Anyway. Being a high quality HVAC tech requires you to have a great understanding of electricity as 90% of repairs require you to troubleshoot...

- Electrical circuits both AC and DC running off 5V/12V/24v/120V/208V/230v/240V/460v and 570Volts.

- Electro-mechanical components such as compressors, Variable frequency Drives, ECMs(Electronic Communicated Motors), LED driven Motors, floating shaft drives that are suspended in air by EMF(Electric magnetic force) fields to prevent friction and lower energy usage.

- Completely up to date with Local, state, and federal electric codes


- System Harmonics


 Newer more energy efficient systems are getting more and more complicated, and some are known to send harmonics through the buildings electrical systems. Which can set a building on fire.

It's not surprising that an well experienced, well educated HVAC tech knows more about electricity than your everyday electrician.


I also have to have a decent understanding of plumbing on top of all this, Manual J(Heat load calculations) for permits, Manual D(Air flow dynamics).


You have to be very efficient in all this stuff..At least if you're looking to get paid Top dollar by a company. But even lower end average joe hack and slash cold beer can techs that replace your home AC unit have some understanding of this stuff. I'd stupid how much you have to know. One fuck Up and you can not only get sued out of business, you can actually get yourself killed. 


Ok enough of this.  These are my qualifications. I know a lot about energy usage. 

Now let's talk about How Ignorance, and Selfishness for that matter wastes way more energy than Bitcoin ever could.

###Let's start off with selfishness

Rich people who own huge unnecessary homes. I've done HVAC service for plenty of these homes. I've seen enough. 

More than 10% of homes in America are values at $1,000,000 or more. 

There are 850,000 Primary residential homes valued at over $1,000,000+

now of course not all of these are bigger than an average home. A regular sized house in NYC running just one HVAC system can cost MILLIONS. I'm not talking about those.  I'm talking about outside of the big cities. 

Let's take homes in and around Alpine, NJ where Chris Rock Lives.  Bergen County, NJ I believe the second richest county in the US. Ho-ho-kus NJ is close.  I've seen and worked on many of these homes. 

###The amount of HVAC equipment that's needed to heat and cool these completely unnecessary oversized homes is equivalent to running 10 Antminer S9s a day. 

1 Antminer S9 running 24hours a day is using a total of 36KWH 

1 5 Ton central AC unit running 12Hrs a day is using 60KWH

Rule of thumb is 1KWH per ton. 5 TON = 5KWH x 12 = 60KWH.   The average home in these areas are running FIVE 5 ton ACS and a couple 3 Tonners.   You know..to keep the guest house in the back cool at all times in case you get an unexpected guest. No most of the time they aren't ""Energy efficient 16 Seer(Seasonal energy efficiency Rating)"".

I'm not even considering poorly maintained systems that are older still running off O-Zone depleting R 22 Refrigerant.  A lot of these homes still have older systems like that aren't properly maintained to run as efficient as possible.  Let's not forget all the add ons these people get to their systems.  Those numbers are just Bare bone systems. Most have Humidifiers (for winter) attached, zoning controls, alarms , condensation pumps.  

It's stupid. 

Sure, most people who are rich want a big mansion.  But at the end of the day, rich or not if you cared about the environment so much, you wouldn't need an stupid oversized home like that and most of these people are never home but they have their systems running all the time.  They have house sitters to watch their homes when they're on vacation. Yes. House sitters.   Usually a friend to just come by and live in your home.  God knows why you need that shit but you're rich. Why not hire someone to put your shoes on in the morning?


Guess who has huge stake in the news networks that tell you BTC is wasteful???   It's not people on this sub hoping to go lambo one day that's for sure.  


Now enough complaining about rich people. 

Let's talk about the Ignorance part of regular folks that waste more energy than a Bitcoin miner.

###Ignorance 

Most average homes not occupied by rich people run one 3-5Ton HVAC unit at least 10hrs a day and again many homes are still running O-zone depleting R22 (CFC) systems that are easily using at least 50% more power than new systems. 

Let's not even consider the amount of copper needed for these units. Which is around 30lbs of copper.  That's more copper in one system than is needed to make 100,000 pennies made after 1982.    I'm also proficient in melting metals. We have to understand melting points of metals for various reasons not getting into it though.   There's 100,000,000 air conditioned homes in America and like mentioned above , not all are running just one system.  That's enough copper to make 10,000,000,000,000 pennies and like I said. That's considering 1 per home and not considering how many system replacements each year.  That's also not considering the AC in your cars which run a 3 Ton system on average.    

Yes, your average car needs enough tonnage to cool a home because it has to have the ability to bring the temp down from 100 degrees to 75 degress in a minute where is a home needs a gradual decrease in temp over the course of a few hours. 


So where's the ignorance part? 

Most of these people are pumping their ACs when they don't need it.   I know this from experience and also understanding of psychrometric charts.    Yes, I also have to have an understanding of meteorology basics.  

Again. It's stupid how much things you need to know to be efficient in this field we don't get enough credit for it.    The human comfort zone is 70-75 degrees 45-55% RH(relative humidity) 

Most people are setting their thermostats to 68° to 72° on a 70-75 degree day when really they only need to have their window open because....

*meh...it's just a little too stuffy in here honey...btw did you read that article on how Bitcoin wastes energy? What greedy selfish people they are*

Not only that.  Most of these older systems are leaking that CFC refrigerant. 

Did you know 1 chlorine atom can destroy up to 100,000 Ozone molecules??? 

That is stupid pollution. 

*Honey, call the HVAC guy...we need to top off our system with refrigerant again...it's 77 degrees in here I can't sleep like this* 

###maintenance

Most systems are not properly maintained even if you get a maintenance on your system every season.   

The reason why a properly maintained system needs updated electrical components to run as energy efficient as possible.  Most have ""pitted contactors"" that arch.  Pitted contactors can be compared to pitted spark plugs in a car.    Yeah, these pitted contactors are driving up everyones electrical bill $50-$100 a month.   But most people aren't going to pay the extra $100 on top of a $150-$200 maintenance to get this done. 

The convo goes like this 

Hvac guy: *Sir, your contactor should be replaced as well. It's causing your system to use more energy then it needs and it's hurting the longevity of your system*

Home owner : how much

Tech : I will put it in for $100

Know it all Ned: can it run through this season without replacing it?

Tech: yes it could but..

Owner: ok fuck it ..I will take care of it next year.


Point here.  
You don't need to run your air conditioner when it's 75° in your home.  The key to comfort is low humidity.  You can spend an extra few hundred bucks and get a dehumidifier attachment to your system that lowers the humidity in your home and uses only 10% the electricity that the system needs the run.   Being outside in 100° and high humidity and walking into a home that's 77° with low humidity is a huge difference in feels very comfortable.  You don't need to pump your AC down to 68° all freaking day.


Another common misconception is that people think they're saving energy by completely shutting off their systems when they go on a day vacation and then coming home to a house that's 85° and then running the system.     That actually uses more energy than running the system to maintain a temperature.  Because now this system has to pump hard for the next few hours to get that temperature down to where it needs to be so you can sleep properly without rolling around and sweat.  


*But...its common sense to turn it off when I leave*

No it isn't.  If Common Sense was all that was needed to save energy we wouldn't need scientists we wouldn't need high qualify technicians to work on things. 


So there you have it. Selfishness, and Ignorance wastes WAY more energy that bitcoin can ever.       In fact if you used half the world's energy to mine Bitcoin at the current hash rate all the bitcoins would be mined and exactly 68 days.     So no it's not a problem half the world's energy is not going to be used to mine Bitcoin.

EDIT Part 1:. It's kinda really really selfish That Rich People in the US Alone waste more energy than the world does mining Bitcoin Yet they want to use their Financial power , and their stake in major News networks to blame you...the regular working citizen that you're not allowed to use a little extra energy for a quick buck?

Want to make a real change in energy usage?  Instead of protesting to fight other people who aren't the real cause of issues, march into these 20 million dollar home areas and demand everyone to stop running their HVAC units equivalent to running 10 miners 24/7/365 when they only spend 20 days out of the year in the home. 

If you can get those people to abide to this somehow then you will have plenty of energy saved for Bitcoin usage. 

Don't be a hypocrite.  Don't waste energy equivalent to one miner and then complain about mining.      Old saying still holds true to day...

 - ""Put up or Shut up""  

- ""Do onto others as you do to yourself""

- ""Practice what you preach""

Keep that on repeat in your head until You stop knocking others for how they choose to use energy....",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Is it worthwhile to refinance our mortgage if we don't know when we'll be moving?,"We've been wanting to move since the end of 2019, but then 2020 happened and we stayed put. The market in our area is still pretty dry for what we want, so I have no clue if we'll actually be able to move this year now that we're ready to start looking again. Our realtor is confident that when we do find a place, our current house will sell very quickly.

Meanwhile, our mortgage interest rate is 4.125%, which isn't terrible, but isn't as low as it could be right now. I also keep putting extra money into our savings account rather than investments with the idea that we'll be able to do a much larger down payment when we eventually move (we can do more than 20% at this point).

Would there be any point in refinancing if we don't know how long we'll be here? I haven't looked into it yet, so I don't know what kind break-even point we would have and if we'd just waste money if we did it.

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, May 5, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, May 5, 2021**

Stocks reversed from yesterday’s technology-led selloff, with the Dow Jones (DIA) reaching a new intraday record high. Continuing the recent bout of volatility, the three major indexes sold off in the last few hours of the market session, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) turning negative.   Market participants continue to look towards the slew of corporate earnings, new economic data, and commentary from key monetary policymakers. 

The sharp move lower in stock yesterday came, ostensibly, after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen suggested that interest rates may need to rise in the near-term to prevent the economy from overheating, with the recent economic data and corporate earnings showing economic activity recovering much faster than expected as effective distribution of the vaccine in the US allows states to gradually reopen. Yellen said, “It may be that interest rates will have to rise somewhat to make sure that our economy doesn't overheat, even though the additional spending is relatively small relative to the size of the economy. It could cause some very modest increases in interest rates to get that reallocation, but these are investments our economy needs to be competitive and to be productive. I think our economy will grow faster because of them."" In later remarks, she added that raising rates was not something she was predicting or recommending and that the decision ultimately rests with the Federal Reserve. She said, “Let me be clear, that’s not something I’m predicting or recommending. If anybody appreciates the independence of the Fed, I think that person is me.”

With the major indexes hovering near record levels for many consecutive days, equities were due for a pullback at the slightest mention of bad news. Kevin Mahm, chief investment officer at Hennion and Walsh Investment Management said, “I do think there's a potential for a short-term bounce in volatility due to those excessive valuations and all of the uncertainty that currently stands with respect to the infrastructure spending bill, ultimately how it’s going to be funded, and certain taxation policies. But, beyond the short-term bouts of volatility, there is continued reason for optimism, whether it’s consumer confidence, whether it’s the strength in earnings, recognizing that thus far we have an 86% beat rate for the companies that have reported.”

The Labor Department will release its April jobs report on Friday, which is expected to show a staggering nearly 1 million payrolls came back last month, accelerating March’s gain. As a reminder, in March, the Department of Labor reported nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 for the month while the unemployment rate fell to 6% (unemployment rate was 14.6% in April 2020). Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 675,000 and an unemployment rate of 6%.

**Highlights**

* As a reminder, the April Labor Report will be released on Friday. Will be important in gauging how the labor market is doing
* Shares of Peloton (PTON) sold off sharply after the company issued a recall of its Tread+ and Tread treadmills following a slew of accidents, including the death of a child. A few weeks ago, John Foley, CEO of Peloton, resisted calls from the US Consumer Product Safety, something he called a “mistake”. He said, “Peloton made a mistake in our initial response to the Consumer Product Safety Commission’s request that we recall the Tread+. We should have engaged more productively with them from the outset. For that, I apologize.”
* Tomorrow, May 6, EV maker NIO will hold a news conference where the company is expected to talk about its plans to expand to the European markets.

Anyways, about a year ago I purchased my first vehicle with only a year of credit with a decent credit score, and the only loans behind me being student loans. That being said, I was smacked with a little over 12% interest rate on my loan. To say the least I wasn’t surprised as I knew first time borrowers usually don’t get off easy. It has now been one full year since I purchased the vehicle and I’ve began looking at re-financing the loan. However, I’m not sure if this a smart idea as to whether it could save me money on my interest. It was difficult to even find a place to give me a loan at the time so I’m hoping if I did this it would be a lot easier. I will mention that my monthly payment is not at all a budget breaker so it wouldn’t be the end of the world if I didn’t refinance it’s just a idea to save a little money. My car is also worth more than the loan currently with 4 years of payments left.

CryptoCurrency,Why Dogecoin Isn’t Going Away (Even When It Dumps) And This Community Needs To Accept That,"(Repost from yesterday because my post got deleted because 2 other Dogecoin posts were in the top 50) 
This is a revised version of my previous article. 

Maybe this community won’t down vote me to crap now that everything I’m about to tell you have been proven correct based on empirical evidence. 

Maybe you guys will actually read my entire post instead of saying it’s “too long” - 

if after you read this post - you still disagree with what I’m about to tell you - we will do the ultimate test. The ultimate end all be all of if Dogecoin is truly a shitcoin or not. 

Simply comment - a remindMe for 4 years and we will see who is correct in 4 years. 

Since I got hated on for no TL;DR last time - here you go. 

TL;DR - (I will explain mathematically or economically why every point below is true in more detail)

EVEN WHEN DOGECOIN INEVITABLY DIPS - IT’S STILL NOT GOING AWAY. 

1. Dogecoin has an 8 year track record of success - even if the price hasn’t necessarily shown it until recently. Dogecoin has survived every major Cryptocurrency bear market and will survive the next.
2.	⁠the myth behind Dogecoin having an unlimited supply is just that, a myth. Dogecoin is not unlimited it has 128 billion supply and 4% Inflation rate
3.	⁠all POW and POS cryptocurrency are also inflationary. Cryptocurrency is inherently inflationary and that is a good thing. Inflation is negligible when under 20%
4.	⁠Dogecoin’s price is not dependent upon Elon musk or Mark Cuban. The price rise has been evident for approximately 8 months. Elon and Mark just sped up a process that was already happening
5.	⁠Dogecoin still have plenty of room to gain price, but due to the relatively high supply don’t expect bitcoin levels per coin. Realistically Dogecoin can reach between the $1-$10 range.
6.	⁠Dogecoin is accepted by more businesses than 99.9% of other cryptocurrency
7.	⁠dogecoin’s mining reward of 10k per block is a great reward for mining and helps to ensure that the cryptocurrency will continue to survive
8.	⁠Dogecoin has cheap transaction fees and has a very good utility at Cryptocurrencies intended purpose of exchanging goods.
9.	⁠the economic fundamentals behind Dogecoin are sound and great for its intended purpose of being a currency
10.	⁠the meme aspect of Dogecoin has absolutely zero impact of the functionality of the cryptocurrency

Almost every single argument against Dogecoin has one of the following flaws

a) lack of understand of economics - misconceptions about the supply, mining rate, and inflation and how none of these are actual issues

b) not understanding that the meme aspect has nothing to do with the fundamentals of the cryptocurrency

c) lack of actual research - just repeating information they heard from someone else on the internet

Below is an answer to every common misconception regarding Dogecoin. 

1. Question: Dogecoin was created a joke/meme, how can people realistically take something created as joke seriously? 

Answer: 
There are plenty of examples of a product, idea, or technology being created with one intention, and then growing and evolving into another.

Parody’s are a perfect example of this. In fact, one could consider Dogecoin to be a parody of bitcoin/Litecoin. Just because something is a parody or joke does not take away the quality of what has been created. There are plenty of examples where parody’s out grew in popularity or, in fact, were better than the original. 

Dogecoin was created In 2013 and has survived 8 years which is WAY longer than 99% of other cryptocurrency that die out in 1-2 years or less. It’s had 8 years to develop as well an active development team working on making improvements right now. The code is being updated all the time and you can check the code on GitHub. 

Bitcoin was created to be used as exchange of goods and services - yet 60% of all bitcoin haven’t been spent in over a year. Is bitcoin a failure because it’s terrible at was it was CREATED for? No. It’s utility changed. Which is okay. Just because something was created for one thing, does not mean it’s use cannot change. The meme aspect of Dogecoin absolutely zero impact on its functionality as a legitimate cryptocurrency. It’s literally just the name. Ironically enough, the fact that the creator named the cryptocurrency after the doge meme is actually HELPFUL to its success. Cryptocurrency has notoriously been a complicated subject; by embracing novelty and giving Dogecoin a name that is easily recognizable to the general population actually allows for dogecoin to be a great entry point for new comers into cryptocurrency. 

We have all witnessed the power of a meme, the depths it can reach in society, especially in recent years. We have seen it many times before with video games, consoles, Oreos, or as of late even toilet paper... A meme has inherent value in the form of “widespread information”. A meme can spread an idea across diverse communities, and even entire countries literally overnight. This can bring about lasting effects on culture and society. If correctly taken advantage of, Doge can become the dominant meme currency of the internet, and amass real-world value just by being a popular, recognisable meme itself. This is where the saying “Dogecoin is the people’s coin” comes from. This is marketing 101. If your idea, or product is too complicated or not enough people know about then it doesn’t matter how technologically sound it is. Dogecoin have the best technology? No. Can it be improved upon. Definitely. In fact, the original developers have started working on the project again. An analogy I like to use is this. McDonald’s makes hamburgers. They have a clown as a mascot. A literal personification of a joke. Does make McDonald’s make the best hamburgers? No. Does McDonald’s have “value” in their industry? Undeniably so. So what does McDonald’s do correctly? They provide a cheap, easily accessible, and brand able product to the masses. Which is what dogecoin does for cryptocurrency. 

2. Question: is Dogecoin a shitcoin? What is a shitcoin and why are people calling Dogecoin one?

Answer: shitcoin is a term r/cryptocurrency created to describe a cryptocurrency with little to no value or digital currency that has no immediate, discernable purpose. The term is often used to describe altcoins or cryptocurrencies developed after bitcoins became popular. 

There are literally thousands of shitcoins. There are approximately 4,000 Cryptocurrencies in existence and pretty much anything outside of the top 30 are indeed, shitcoins. 

Dogecoin is not one of those shitcoins.

The people who say dogecoin is a shitcoin have done absolutely zero research, or if they have are misinformed. Most of the time they are just repeating some BS they heard on Twitter or Reddit without checking if what they’re saying is true. Pretty much every misconception about Dogecoin has been to over wrong. (I am going to discuss these misconceptions in detail below) Dogecoin may appear at first glance as just a joke or a meme, and therefore valueless due to its name. However, the name aspect of Dogecoin has absolutely zero impact on its viability as a cryptocurrency. Dogecoin actually has great utility (usefulness) to be used for exchange of goods and services. 

Some people will never take it seriously.  That's just the facts of it. DOGE is the ""crypto"" of cryptocurrencies in that none of the ""boomers"" believe in it but it's just steadily chugging along, gaining value.  10 years from now maybe they'll pull a Peter Schiff and be like I guess I was wrong or they'll still be cursing it. It doesn’t change the fact that Dogecoin is successful, has value and useful at Cryptocurrencies intended purpose to exchange goods and services. It's accepted as a method at payment at more places than 99.9% of cryptocurrencies.  That should be all the validation you need.  It's the Official Joke Coin and people can hate but it's official status will keep it around and always in the picture. 

3. Question: Why Dogecoin? What is Dogecoin useful for? What is its utility 

Answer: For the Lolz. Well, not quite. Initially as a purely meme-driven alternative to the likes of Bitcoin and Litecoin, Dogecoin in-fact boasts very low transaction fees and fast transaction times, very little network congestion, and most importantly, is designed to be used as a daily means of exchange, like your morning cup of coffee. Also, it is really fun, and who doesn't like the Dog ?!
		
Think of it like this: to exchange goods and services without currency, one must barter. I can barter a service (a haircut, for example) towards someone who needs a haircut, and in exchange they can barter a good or service to me.Currency then becomes an ""IOU"" (I Owe yoU) so that, if somebody needs me to cut their hair, they can give me an IOU for a good or service they control. When enough people begin adopting this, a centralized currency eventually takes hold. Crypto seeks to take this a step further and, instead of relying on building up a centalization in terms of valuable metals or debt, it is built up solely on the exchange of goods and services. Dogecoin, compared to other cryptocurrencies, finds itself in a strange position where the origins did NOT see it soaring to the moon in any situation. Funny how things can change in time. Dogecoin has pros and cons to it. Comparing it to other cryptos, it does not face a supply cap like Bitcoin does. It is not a directly equated asset, such as how Bitcoin can be attributed as a digital gold asset. Mining dogecoin is also much simpler (comparitively) and does not face difficulty spikes, a source of Bitcoin slow-down. It however, does indeed have a purpose and is very effective at its intended purpose 

4. Question - 100 people own the top wallets which account for 65% of the total supply of Dogecoin. How can Dogecoin be a decentralized currency or a solid investment if 100 can negatively impact the market
Answer: 
The people who say this are just repeating what they’ve heard from someone else without doing research. They are trying to spread fear, uncertainty and doubt or they just don’t realize what they are saying is misinformation. 

While the statement 100 wallets own 65% is true, A lot of those top wallets are exchanges. What this means, is that legally speaking, these exchanges are holding a supply either to exchange with their customer base, or their customer base out right controls those coins. The majority of these wallets are not single individuals who can just sell off 2 billion Dogecoin at once. There are definitely some whales, but not every single large wallet is a whale. On top of that, this issue does not apply specifically to Dogecoin; but is in fact a problem with the majority of cryptocurrency yet people only point it out with Dogecoin. 

With just a bit of research you can find out which wallets are more than likely exchanges. 

DH5 (#1) is almost for sure RH. A lot of people think that. And it would make sense. They do not allow wallets, making the prices within the platform, so they'd need a much bigger wallet than everyone else.

DCUrda (#4) is an exchange for sure (tracked down several TXs to that same source). it's most likely Binance.

#7 is the burn wallet for Doge Party.

#18 is an exchange (Crypto.com based on the first transaction date?)

#21 *might* be an exchange or someone trading with a Bot.

#22 is an exchange.

Once you take this into account it becomes clear that this is just a misconception and a non-issue 

5. Question: Mining Dogecoin. How new Dogecoin are created and enter the market/supply. It there an infinite supply of Dogecoin being produced? Comparison to Bitcoin and the US dollar. 

Answer:
mining is the process of creating new cryptocurrency by solving a computational puzzle. mining is necessary to maintain the ledger of transactions upon which cryptocurrency is based. Miners have become very sophisticated over the last several years using complex machinery to speed up mining operations. Approximately 600,000 dogecoins are produced per hour and 5,256,000,000 (5.26 billion) per year and there are currently approximately 128,000,000,000 (128 billion) Dogecoin. Now let’s compare this information to what we know about Bitcoin. Bitcoin currently has a supply of 18.5 million. Currently 900 Bitcoin are mined per day or 328,500 per year. However, unlike Dogecoin, Bitcoins mining rate is not fixed. Bitcoin has something known as a Bitcoin halving which means at some point in the future instead of 900 per day being mined 450 are mined. Now let’s compare Dogecoin and Bitcoin to the US Dollar. The US Dollar has an estimated paper money supply (more on this covered in a later section) of approximately (1.2 to 2 trillion) and in 2019 the federal reserve printed 188.3 billion paper dollars. This means that there is 10 times more supply of dollars to Dogecoin and the government prints 37 times more dollars than Dogecoin is mined per year. It is also important to note that this increase in supply of Dogecoin is fixed. It never changes. The federal reserve can change how much they print any given year. Many people think that this means that the supply of Dogecoin is infinite or infinitely increasing. That is not true in the span of our life time. It will take approximately 24 years for the supply of Dogecoin to double and it will take 360 years for the supply of Dogecoin to reach the current supply of the US Dollar. That’s without taking into account the fact that federal reserve adds more dollars each year than Dogecoin adds to its supply each year. Technically speaking the supply of Dogecoin will eventually reach infinity if given enough time but you have to remember that infinity isn’t an actual number. You can’t mine “infinite” dogecoin because infinity isn’t a number. It’s a mathematical concept to describe something that is boundless. Dogecoin doesn’t have a boundless increase. It has a fixed increase a set amount added at a specific interval. So in practical terms for the purpose of using Dogecoin as a legitimate currency, this infinite argument against Dogecoin doesn’t matter. In fact it’s actually way better than Bitcoin at exchanging goods and services because of this fact. That is why the price per Bitcoin is in the ten thousand range the price per Dogecoin is in the cents range That is why it costs .00012 Bitcoin for milk but only 50 Dogecoin for that same commonly traded commodity. That’s why Bitcoin will be treated like digital gold. That is why Dogecoin will be considered the next dollar. The price per coin are inherently different because their supplies are different.


6. Question: Should Dogecoin have a cap on its supply. What does having a cap mean, why do some cryptocurrency have a cap and other don’t? How does it affect the price? Will adding a cap increase the price per Dogecoin. Comparing bitcoin (capped) Dogecoin (no hard cap)

When people say they want a supply cap - what they are saying is that they want to place a limit on the total possible supply of Dogecoin. They point to bitcoin as having a cap, and since bitcoin has a cap, that must be why it is valued so high. Through scarcity. That is partially true, but it’s not because of the cap. The scarcity doesn’t come from having a cap, it comes from having a low supply and mining amount which reduces over time. Known as a bitcoin halving. 

Bitcoin and Dogecoin are two completely different cryptocurrency. Their supplies are different. Their utility is different. Having a cap does nothing in terms of the actual value of Dogecoin or bitcoin at the current moment. The cap only matters once that limit has been reached. The cap for bitcoin doesn’t happen until 2140. The price of bitcoin is due to the limited supply (18 million) relative to the global population, the bitcoin mining rate and bitcoin halving. All things that Dogecoin does differently. That doesn’t mean Dogecoin doesn’t have value. It doesn’t mean Dogecoin is infinite. It just means that they’re different.

Adding a cap won’t automatically increase the price because the cap isn’t the problem. You can’t reduce the 128 billion supply (unless you burn them or lose them). They already exist. People get confused because they don’t understand inflation and continual growth and why they are necessary for Dogecoin to a successful cryptocurrency based on the core parameters made when Dogecoin was created. They also don’t understand infinity. Dogecoin is not infinite. It can never reach infinity because infinity isn’t a number. As long as Dogecoin exists and is being mined it is not infinite. 

Even if they DID add a cap it would actually be LESS beneficial for Dogecoin as a currency. 

Here’s some Basic economics explaining why. Inflation and deflation are common economic terms used to explain the change in the inherent value of a currency. This means that that 1 US Dollar today does not have the same value or “worth” as it did, for example, in 1950. Inflation is a situation of rising prices in the economy. A more exact definition of inflation is a sustained increase in the general price level in an economy. Deflation on the other hand occurs when the inflation rate falls below 0%, that is a negative inflation rate. While inflation reduces the value of a currency over time, a sudden deflation of a currency increases its relative value. This would allow more goods and services to be bought than before with the same amount of currency. Deflation can be a factor in leading to a recession and also result in a deflationary spiral.

Common follow up question:
What does all this mean with regards to cryptocurrency specifically Dogecoin?

All proof of work and proof of stake cryptocurrency 

The difference is that EVENTUALLY (year 2140) bitcoin will become stagnant or deflationary over time, while Dogecoin will remain inflationary overtime.

The price is based on current supply and current demand.

Bitcoin has a 18 million supply 
Etherem has a 115 million supply
Dogecoin has a 128 billion supply.

What really matters is mining rate and overall supply

Bitcoin - 1.76% yearly inflation 328,000 bitcoin added per year - constant rate - halves approximately ever 4 years - decreasing rate of inflation (with a fixed halving interval) 

Etherem- 8% maximum annual issuance of 12 million coins - decreasing rate of inflation 

Dogecoin - 4% a 5.28 billion per year - decreasing rate of inflation 

All of three of these cryptocurrency have inflation rates that reduce over time because every year the inflation rate is calculated based of the following equation

Inflation rate = (Amount of coins mined per year / current supply) * 100

IR = (M / CS) * 100

The order of magnitudes are different and therefore based on supply and demand the prices are also orders of magnitudes different.

The inflation rate for all three are negligible for the foreseeable future. The important thing is the supply.

The demand can outpace each Cryptocurrencies inflation rate so the price can increase - but it can only increase by a certain amount because the supply has to be taken into account. 

That is why Bitcoin is in the $10,000 order of 
magnitudes range in price 

That is why Etherem is in the $1,000 order of magnitude range in price

That is why Dogecoin in the .10 range order of magnitude range with a realistic possibility of being in the $1-10 order of magnitude range in price based off of current demand.

IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH HAVING A CAP OR NOT. Bitcoins cap doesn’t take into effect until 2140 - THAT is when having a cap matters.

Dogecoin will not have a price per coin of ETH and ETH will not have a price per coin of BTC.

But that’s okay - because their supplies are different

That is why price per coin is not a determining factor in a cryptocurrencies success. 

That is why all three cryptocurrency are successful even though they have different prices per coin.

Price per coin needs to stop being used as a metric of success and instead focus on utility and brand recognition 

BTC utility - store of value (due to interval halving Dogecoin and ETH cannot compete)

ETH utility - Smart contracts and technology (bitcoin and DOGE cannot compete with this) 

DOGE utility - exchange of goods and services. (Due to high gas fees BTC and ETH cannot compete)


7. Question: Is a Dogecoin increase to the equivalent of one US dollar possible? Could and will it potentially happen? What would change if it does happen? How high could Dogecoin realistically rise in price? | Market cap explanation, and comparison to US currency and global FIAT currency. 

Answer: 
Economically speaking Dogecoin can rise to the whatever value the market dictates based off of supply and demand. As long as demand out paces the supply then the value will rise. 

However, I see people asking what’s stopping Dogecoin from going to bitcoin levels? Well, The short answer is the supply of Dogecoin is high relative to the supply of bitcoin. Dogecoin has a current supply of 128 billion, which is why the price is lower and harder to change in value. It is easier for bitcoin to rise $1 in price because the supply of bitcoin is so low and the supply of Dogecoin is so high.  It doesn’t mean that Dogecoin can’t rise in price - just that it’s harder. 

This is the long answer.
First, It is important to note that demand does not necessarily equate to adding dollars to the system in 1 to 1 ratio. Demand can increase without ever having to add money into the system, however, adding new money into the system does help. I see people saying Dogecoin requires X million dollars per minute to account for the increase in supply. That is just completely wrong, and not how demand works. Increased Demand just means more people willing to trade Dogecoin at a higher price than people willing to trade at the current price. No net increase in fiat currency needs to be added in order for demand to increase. 

Despite not having a capped supply, using the current supply known, as well as the mining rate to account for new coins entering - you can make comparisons to other cryptocurrency to get an idea of the demand required in order for Dogecoin to reach a certain price.  The way to do this is through market cap comparisons 

Mathematically speaking market cap = price multiplied by supply
MC (Market Cap) = P (Current Price) x S (Current Supply)

Before moving forward, I want to explain market cap and the misconceptions behind its as well as how to correctly use it. 

Market cap just means how much the total supply is “valued/worth” at a certain price. The exact definition applies to stocks; not cryptocurrency how ever for our purposes the mathematics still apply.
I see people saying how Dogecoin has a current market cap of $X billion market cap and what the market cap needs to be for Dogecoin to be $1 is $128 billion. Then they say if 100 million people put $1000 in doge then doge will = $1.

THAT’S NOT HOW MARKET CAP WORKS.

*MARKET CAP DOES NOT MEAN TOTAL AMOUNT OF MONEY IN THE SYSTEM - A 6 billion dollar market cap does not mean there’s 6 billion dollars in the system. It means that the entire supply is “worth” 6 billion at the current price. When I originally wrote this people got confused so I wanted to clarify that. Market cap is a comparison tool that I use in this example to show how Dogecoin would look at each price point* 

Simply adding money to the system does absolutely nothing to affect market cap in the same way it does not necessarily change the price/demand. The only two variables that change the market cap are price and supply nothing else can change the market cap. 

Market caps REAL use is a comparison tool. It’s used to compare how successful a market is compared to other markets. 

If Dogecoin were to reach $1 today it would have a market cap of about 128 billion dollars ($1 x 128,495,957,919 circulating supply). Bitcoin (the most successful cryptocurrency) currently has a market cap of approximately $898,761,019,333 (~ $900 billion). This means that at $1, the total supply of Dogecoin would be “worth” about 1/7th of Bitcoins total supply. 

The take away from this comparison is that in order to reach $1 Dogecoin would require approximately 1/7th the current demand of bitcoin due to the differences in supply between Dogecoin and bitcoin. This is definitely not impossible, and an achievable goal. If Dogecoin were to reach the demand bitcoin has currently - its price would $7. Since bitcoin is the highest performing cryptocurrency, $7 dollars is the most realistic possible goal at current market conditions. Anything past $7 dollars per coin means that Dogecoin is reaching uncharted territory for cryptocurrency as it will have surpassed bitcoin.

Now for the hypothetical extension of this comparison. Everything after this point is hypothetical since we don’t have a true comparison available in the market

The estimated supply of the US dollar is about $2,000,000,000 (2 trillion), thus the market cap of the US currency is $2 trillion. If Dogecoin were to reach the equivalent market cap ($2tn / $128bn), the price per Dogecoin would have to be $15.60, thus matching the entire short-term US currency (M0 money supply in economics).

This is definitely not impossible, but it is highly highly improbable to reach such value any time soon. If that were to ever happen, it would take years. Now, the entire supply of the entire worlds fiat (short-term liquidity / paper) currency is $37 trillion. You can apply the same logic from above and see that the value of Dogecoin would have to be $288.60. If it was valued any higher than that amount, Dogecoin would be ""worth"" more than the entire world’s short-term liquidity currencies combined. It could technically go past this point, but what that would mean is that the economy behind Dogecoin would be stronger than the entire global economy of today. At that value you wouldn’t even compare it to the dollar anymore because it already surpassed all fiat currency. It’s not impossible- but is is highly unrealistic to pass that point. It is important to note that this number is not static. Which means if the market conditions change such as an increase in supply or change in price the numbers will change.


8. Question: Elon Musk - Is he important for Dogecoin? The impact of celebrities and big business supporting Dogecoin Celebrity/Influencer Involvement

Answer: (shortened to save room) Elon musk is a supporter of doge and his comments have weight but he does not control the price of Dogecoin. It was on a rise before he joined the hype train and started tweeting about it. 

9. Question: What is a 51% attack? Can it realistically happen? What are the implications if it were to happen?

Answer: A 51% attack refers to an attack on a blockchain most commonly bitcoin. Such an attack is possible but still just hypothetical. It requires group of miners to control more than 50% of the network's mining hash rate or computing power.

The attackers would be able to prevent new transactions from gaining confirmations, allowing them to halt payments between some or all users. They would also be able to reverse transactions that were completed while they were in control of the network, meaning they could double-spend coin. 

They would almost certainly not be able to create new coins or alter old blocks. A 51% attack would probably not destroy bitcoin or another blockchain-based currency outright, even if it proved highly damaging.

You may have seen an article going around talking about the 51% attack and why it will cause Dogecoin to go to zero. Regarding the 51% Hashrate attacks, Yes, they are real, and have been ever since cryptocurrencies aka Bitcoin started. The article even mentions an example. Now, if a large group of people with a lot of resources very effectively coordinated, they could indeed make a 51% attack on Dogecoin happen. But not just on Dogecoin, but also on many other, small cryptocurrencies. This is nothing new, this has basically been known for the last 10+ years. But the author of the article needs clicks, so there goes the horror-scenario headline... Possible - yes, absolutely. Likely, not very. Unless you have a large sum of people with a few resources each coordinating perfectly - that is in my honest opinion very unlikely - you could have governments, very large hedge funds, or maybe Elon Musk build a vast array of mining farms and do said 51% Hashrate attack. But again, that effort would only be worthwhile if those groups had a definite interest in destroying Dogecoin. There are probably other cryptocurrencies that would be more interesting from that perspective, such as litecoin. Of course, despite the sensationalist headline, for them clicks, the author covers their own backside by stating the following:
""In conclusion...Pretty much all the crypto besides Bitcoin and Ethereum are at material risk of a 51% attack, and it's not just a theoretical risk."" This problem is not tied specifically to Dogecoin, but to every single cryptocurrency. Now let’s do some math to calculate exactly how much it would cost in order to succeed in pulling off a 51% attack on Dogecoin. Dogecoin has a hash rate of 299.17 TH/s or 299,170,000 MH/s. If you were to use an RTX3090 which costs $2,000 US Dollars, and has a hash rate of 121 MH/s. You would need 1,260,964 RTX3090 at a cost of $2,521,928,926 dollars ($2.5 billion). Is it possible? Yes. Is it likely? No. 

10. Question: Dogecoin can only process 33 transactions per second - if Dogecoin wants to truly be a successful means of exchanging goods on a mass level it this transaction speed is not enough

Answer: the problem with this line of thinking is that they are making an assumption that the transactions per second is a permanent issues. At the current demand the transactions per second works perfectly fine and when it gets to a point where this needs to be improved, the technology is available to do so. 

Dogecoin is moving to a multichain future. There's no reason point of sale settlements would need to be conducted on the main network. Cryptocurrency is an advanced technology and there’s no reason that asset (dogecoin) and chain (main dogecoin network), are bound to each other in a way that the asset (dogecoin) cannot be enhanced by other chains.

A really good, present day example of this sort of crosschain stuff is thorchain. it's based on some work on cosmos, and it essentially gives the ability to run smart contracts, trade, do defi and liquidity pools - all without actually taking any of the other networks coin off the main chain. Bitcoins lightening network is another example. Smart network chains like flare network and thorchain will support doge. 

If transaction speed is even an issue, the solution can be provided without changing a single thing on the mainnet. It's really a non issue brought up by people just trying to find any possible reason to doubt doge. They usually bring this point up after their other arguments have been proven wrong. The only real question is what chain will develop an easy solution for doge POS payments, and which one will become standard.It's kind of amusing too, because in their 'criticism' is the implication of doge becoming a mainstream point of sale currency 

11. Question: There is a lack of developer support for Dogecoin. The technology is outdated. Why would anyone come work as a Dogecoin developer when there are thousands of other cryptocurrencies? 

Answer: the original Dogecoin developers have already began working on the project with the new found support of the community and companies accepting Dogecoin as payment. The short answer is there is already development being done due to recent weeks bringing Dogecoin back into relevancy. Two Dogecoin developers are very active in the community. You can see their posts and reach out directly. However, remember they are extremely busy working on their personal lives and adding upgrades to the underlying technology behind Dogecoin.

12. Question: if all of the above information is true why are so many people such as r/cryptocurrency and others are trying to discredit Dogecoin as legitimate cryptocurrency.  

Answer: The r/cryptocurrency and the majority of people are horribly misinformed. They find out about Dogecoin and take their biases and apply them Dogecoin before researching. R/cryptocurrency is a specific subset of society who has an extremely knowledgeable background in computer science and technology behind cryptocurrency They may have a solid understanding of the technology aspect of cryptocurrency but the reason why Dogecoin will be successful is based on economics, mathematics, social theory and statistics as WELL as the underlying technology. Each of these topics is extremely intricate and each field requires years to fully master. No one person has all of the knowledge of all aspects of a cryptocurrency so when someone is attacking Dogecoin on why it won’t be successful is probably misinformed. Dogecoin is already successful. It’s been proven already. The question is HOW successful. Which nobody really knows the answer to. A large majority of r/cryptocurrency are gatekeepers who horde their knowledge while the Dogecoin community is focused on explaining and educating new people. R/cryptocurrency is notorious for being extremely serious and a lot of them feel threatened that something that started at as a joke/meme has the potential to be better at cryptocurrencies intended purpose - exchanging goods and services - than Bitcoin or any other popular cryptocurrency with “better technology”. Others will try to discredit it because Dogecoin because it is novel and has gained popularity. There’s a lot of people who will discredit Dogecoin/cryptocurrency in general just because it’s new(ish) technology or because they don’t understand how it can be used. 

13. Question: Will cryptocurrency replace fiat currency. Will cryptocurrency be the next world currency. Will the next world currency be Dogecoin?

Answer: 
Cryptocurrency is in its infancy. People don’t realize the worldwide paradigm that is taking place right in front of our eyes. People are starting to see that traditional fiat (paper) currency back by centralized governments and debt are flawed and can be improved upon. Cryptocurrency is the future whether the people who can’t see it or try to disagree believe it or not. It’s inevitable. I knew it was inevitable in 2013 when I first heard about Bitcoin. A cryptocurrency will replace fiat currency in the future. Will it be Bitcoin? ETH? Dogecoin? Ada? Some other cryptocurrency that doesn’t exist yet? I don’t know. Cryptocurrency is taking the financial sector by storm - odds are there’s going to be a few key cryptocurrency for each aspect. - ones replacing fiat, ones replacing precious metals, ones replacing the banking system through deFi.

CryptoCurrency,History Repeats Itself,"Currency predates modern man and can even be traced back to primates, who traded food for peace between tribes and even sex which we can see replicated in today’s bonobos and other great apes.

Throughout the city-states of Ancient Greece, you’d see various currencies pop up with little to no value other than that which applied to their locality. Some currencies were worth more above the rest like gold and silver of course and were largely accepted. This also happened in the US while the colonies were still new. States had their own currencies as well as the federally backed dollar. Regulations only made this better because it was backed by something tangible.

Years later in the US, there was a huge gold rush, where boom towns were created around the industry, but we have no recollection of the people who made the most money mining gold, only those who built industries around the gold like Levi’s and Wells Fargo.

We as a society only put value to what we deem to be valuable. This is what makes history and the concept of value so great. There will always be new ventures to invest in, so don’t let your fear of missing out now endanger your finances today. As we look into these things and understand the history behind every step we make, we can understand without a single doubt that there’s no value in dogecoin and that you’re trading wooden nickels because cyberpunk Thomas Edison said so.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Refi on townhouse I bought with 0% down,"I bought my first townhouse in 2016 with 0% down using a VA loan, purchase price of $525k

Currently owe $495k and my interest rate is 3.875%

House is in Seattle and other properties on my block that are part of the same development (so exact same house) are selling this month at $550k and $560k. So I am making an assumption that this is where my house would be assessed at.

I would like to refi on a Traditional 30yr fixed so I have the option to buy another house with a VA loan in the future (as a primary house) and be able to rent this house out.

I now have money saved up which I could put towards my principle  to lower it so I would be over 20% equity which would be around $55k I suppose.

Main goal of the refi is to get a lower interest rate and lower my monthly mortgage bill.

Advice that I'm looking for is if this sounds reasonable to switch to a traditional home loan and put at least $55k into my principle when doing a refi?

Additional context,

Right now buying another house is more of a dream than a reality because of how expensive WA is, so I would say that is 5 years out. Which means I'll be living in this house for at least another 5 years.

I also have an interest in buying a piece of land next year in the $40-50k range. The goal is to eventually put a modular house on it. This is a longer term plan that would take years. But putting it out there in case it affects opinions on what I should do about refinancing now.

dogecoin,What you need to understand about Dogecoin! (this isn't a hate thread!!),"Definition of market cap for crypto currency.

Within the **blockchain** industry, the term **market capitalization** (or **market cap**) refers to a metric that measures the relative size of a **cryptocurrency**. It is calculated by multiplying the current **market** price of a particular coin or token with the total number of coins in circulation.

This being said, let me do some math for everyone out there.

The total amount of dogecoins out there is = **129,475,242,412\~** with a maximum of, well, there is no cap.

The current overall market cap of Doge is = **$81,392,444,963**

Now lets do some math...

For doge coin to reach $1.0000 USD you would need to do the following, its pretty simple.

Take the total amount of Dogecoins out there, **129,475,242,412\~** (and this number grows by 10,000 Dogecoins every minute; 5,000,000 Dogecoins a year) and times it by the price you would like to see, so lets start with $1.0000 USD. Meaning...

You will need to see a total amount of $**129,475,242,412\~ USD** (and growing) in market cap for it to reach a dollar.

This 1:1 ratio is because their is no cap on the amount of Doge that can be mined. if you wanted Doge to be $2.0000 USD the market cap would have to double the amount of coins in circulation and so on.

The reason I want to bring this to peoples attention is there is a lot of people who are going to ""get wrecked"" by this movement and I don't want to see 77.7 Billion dollars leave the crypto space, I want to see invested into real projects that are changing the world and not a meme.

I love the meme but I'm not one for making a whole financial institution also into a meme. I understand there are a lot of success stories out there with Doge right now but just be safe with your money and do your research, understand crypto and the usefulness it provides for the world. Invest into something that is actually going to change the world as we know it, not a meme guys. All crypto takes power away from the government but also increases in value as time goes on because it is deflationary, Doge isn't.

If there is enough interest in ""What should I be doing if I'm new to the crypto World?"" I'll make an edit on this post to link you too 1000 different threads, videos and informational sites to get you started and get a grasp on what the crypto universe is.

This isn't a hate post, this is just bring awareness to people who might not be getting fed wrong facts and I want MORE people involved in crypto, I would rather there be more and more millionaires who are going to change lives rather then take advantage of the poor.

I wonder if $LAKE could also benefit from potential infrastructure spending, as most of the jobs created will require some sort of protective clothing or gear. Already the stock seems undervalued, but with this potential boost, it could be primed for further growth.

I'm a very new investor, so I wanted to post my thought process to see if it seems logical to others, and to make others aware of this potentially undervalued company. Any thoughts or comments would be very welcome!

**EDIT:**

With help from the comments from others on this post and a bit more thinking, of course, $LAKE posted massive profits in 2020 because of COVID, since they provide protective equipment. The surge in need for PPE likely drove their earnings. Increased demand for protective clothing in infrastructure industries might offer some revenue, but it likely will not have nearly as large an effect as COVID and the need for PPE.

Investors have probably realized this, and given that lockdowns are winding down and vaccines are getting out there, they're thinking about the forward projected earnings per share, and not the outlier earnings of 2020. I'll hold off on $LAKE for now.",finance

personalfinance,Living in a trailer in College,"Hi, so I’m a rising junior at a university in San Diego. Rent prices are pretty nuts and it’s hard to even get a place anywhere decent has 50+ applications the day it’s posted. So I’ve been looking at alternative living situations and it’s kind of come down to buying a trailer and parking it at an RV park. If I were to live in an apartment to get a room to myself it would probably be 700-800 and to split a room it would probably be around 500 not including utilities and probably live with like 3 other guys. From what I’ve seen trailer parks charge around 750 up to 1100 for the more boujee rv “resorts”. So my question is if I were to buy a trailer should I look at financing or just buy it outright. I have about 19,000$ saved up so I could buy a decent trailer out right but I don’t really want to tie up a bunch of cash into it but I also may not be able to get a loan on a older trailer. My credit score is ~740 so I’m not worried about interest rates I think they’d be around 4% which isn’t the worst thing ever. So from the month to month renting could be cheaper but I would have roomates and even maybe split a room to afford it or I could have my own trailer and maybe even fix it up a bit and try to sell for a small profit in 2 years when I graduate. If anyone has any advice or experience or if my numbers are way off please let me know. Thanks",finance

dogecoin,Doge on leverage (margine trading doge),"hey guys 

u really need to learn the margine trading stuff 

maybe we can make predicitons together 

cuz stuff life yesterday's 5 pm drop are like tresures 

statisticly if u set the margine trade to borrow 5x 100 usdt when doge hits 0.56 and use it to buy doge 

then set it to sell enough at 0.66 to pay the debts u will end with about 130 doge profit 

it's basically free doge given to us from the ppl who don't hold 

and the risk is too low considering that the  Interest Rate is about 0.14% a day so theoritically u would still make profit even if it take days or weeks for the doge to spike again 

and you can also short doge during those spikes too (u borrow doge when it's expensive and sell then use that usdt to buy even more doge when it drops since everyone is selling) 

free doge for you and since your trading then doge will go to the moon. it's a win win, right? 

what u think guys?

Bitcoin,My Argument to Boomers,"Was on a Zoom call with my family, several of them age 60s, and the topic of Bitcoin being bad for the environment came up... this was my text response the next day:

Good morning! On our Zoom call we talked about Bitcoin being bad for the environment.  I though I would provide a brief counter argument.  Bitcoin's original philosophical purpose is to remove the nation states control over our method of exchange, money.  We have a method of exchange because it's too hard to physically trade 14 carrots for 3 potatoes or 3 cows for 80 chickens.  Today, all monies are nation state sponsored, generally in the form of a federal reserve or central bank (the fed).    When nation states have problems, or feel threatened economically or philosophically, they employ violence (war, police, etc...) Violence is funded in two ways... 1. Taxes and 2. Creation of more money (federal bank prints more money).  Bitcoin is a finite supply, meaning no more Bitcoin can ever be created by anyone, not even nation states.  Bitcoin also cannot be seized or taxed unfairly meaning you don't have to support war and violence or whatever else the nation state you live in decides to do.  Bitcoin does use energy, but the argument is that it shifts energy use away from potentially corrupt and historically violent nation states.  This is important for us in America but even more important for most of the humans that live in poverty under extremely corrupt nation states, such as in Africa, Turkey, El Salvador, the Philippines, the Middle East etc... anyway... most people get into bitcoin to invest and make money and that's fun too, but ultimately it is the digitization of the counter culture anti-war movement that you lived through during Vietnam... but on a worldwide scale... because of the internet... for the first time in the history of humanity.... food for thought!!!",cryptocurrency

And analysts are finally coming to their senses and raising estimates of steel companies, because:

-----------------------------------

**Steel prices are obscenely high**

These are literally record high steel prices. This mean serious profit. Imagine if people were willing to pay Apple 2 to 3 times as much for an iPhone. [Price of steel 2009 – 2021](https://i.imgur.com/2sRd8M1.png) 

And this is not just for the moment, but for the rest of the year and beyond. There are record high steel futures as well, and they are only rising. [Future steel futures](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/ferrous/hrc-steel_quotes_globex.html) 

This means that people expect steel prices to be high in the future. They are paying these prices right now for steel months away, because they expect this locked-in price to be cheaper than the actual price of steel (however many months/years away).

--------------------------------

**Inflation**

The hot topic right now.  [Global economic rebound is fueling a blistering commodities rally.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-01/the-price-of-the-stuff-that-makes-everything-is-surging?srnd=premium)  Will the Fed be able to control inflation?

And even if inflation doesn’t cross 3%, the fear of it will drive people to hedge part of their portfolio in commodities.

**China's rebate**

In 2020, China produced 56.5% of the world’s steel. This was helped by a 13% rebate on all steel exported. Sell steel for $100, get $100 from the buyer and $13 from the government.

But now China wants to cut their steel production to deal with smog. 

Starting May 1st 2021 (6 days ago!), there is a now 0% import tariff &amp; 20-25% export tariff on materials. This is great news for vertically integrated steel companies like CLF and MT than mine their own ore. Not great news for other steel companies that need to buy iron ore- the price of ore is already high and now it’s getting a lot worse.

Starting May 1st 2021, the Chinese rebate for exported steel will be cut from 13% to 0%. If China is cutting their steel production, they still want to grow and build, so they want to keep as much steel inside China as possible. This is amazing news for steel companies outside of China, as their major competitor’s product just got the equivalent of 13% more expensive.

**Where in particular to invest?** 

Steel in general will make a killing in 2021 and beyond. A commodities [supercycle.](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1r0r28fl471c5/are-we-witnessing-the-start-of-a-new-commodities-supercycle#:~:text=Commodity%20super%20cycles%20are%20decade,their%20long%2Dterm%20price%20trend.)

There is good reason to look more closely at CLF (US company) and MT (European company). CLF recently jumped 10% a few days ago and is now consolidating. CLF is generally more of an upward pointed rollercoaster while MT is a gentler climb.

CLF and MT are vertically integrated and mine their own ore. For the most part they have better financials than many of their competitors, and have invested more into their futures. MT is actively buying back shares while CLF's CEO LG said on his last call they will ""look after shareholders"" after aggressively paying down their debt. It won't take long, they are making a ton of money.

CLF has the benefit of a firebrand CEO, Lourenco Goncalves, who actively looks out for investors. Additionally, the U.S. infrastructure bill is going to require an incredibly large amount of (US) steel. In the short term, speeches involving this bill and the passing of the bill will be major catalysts, and in the long term the profits from the bill will be reflected in earnings reports for years.

As people seem to put (far too much) weight on short interest, some might want to know that CLF has short interest of 11.26% as reported by Ortex. Those shorters are hurting and are going to need to buy their way out soon. 

MT released quarterly earnings today and did amazingly, beating already sky-high estimates by an additional 20%. Their best quarter in a decade. [Commodities Boom Grips Steel](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-06/arcelormittal-reports-best-quarter-in-decade-as-steel-joins-boom) 

And these amazing Q1 numbers don't even fully account for the new record high prices. Steel's day is just beginning. This is not a buy-today and sell-tomorrow play, this is a buy-sometime-soon and hold-for-a-long-time play.

Because of the housing boom and the fact that we have no interest in moving, we did a cash-out refi to reduce our rate and leverage the sizable equity in our house.  The idea is to eventually do an addition, but with building material cost having skyrocketed and since we're not in any hurry, we figured we'd sit on the money for a while.

The ""safest"" place is obviously something like a savings account or money market, but I want the money to be ""free"" in that it earns enough of a return to cover the mortgage interest rate (2.25%) and any taxes we'll pay.

I'm not a risky investor, and while I am open to some combination of investing that mitigates the risk, I mostly just want to know that the money is there when we want it in a year or two when building costs come down some (with the understanding that costs will almost certainly not go back to pre-pandemic levels).

Thoughts?  TIA!

EDIT: to be clear, I am willing to take *some* risk, I just want to take the bare minimum to get the 2.5-3% necessary to break even on the cost of borrowing the money.  I realize no savings account or MM is making anything near that and so therefore some risk is required.

EDIT2: I'm also willing to acknowledge that my understanding of ""investing"" may be woefully incomplete.  I envisioned taking $150k, giving it to a company to handle for me in a ""low risk / low yield"" portfolio, and then getting the money back 1 or 2 years down the road.

Pertinent info:

Original value of the loan was $504k, taken out four years as a traditional 30 year mortgage at a fixed 3.5% interest rate.

Current monthly P&amp;I is $2263.  Escrow is about $1,750, for a total of right about $4,000 a month.  Every month we pay an additional $600 against the principle, for a grand total around $4,600.

$435k is currently left on the loan.  The loan is four years old, but I think these additional payments have shortened it from 30 years to roughly 22 years or so.

The refinance offer is for a 15 year fixed interest rate of 2.375%, with the APR being 2.405%.  If we elect to roll the closing costs into the loan, the monthly P&amp;I is $2,981.  Escrow doesn't change, giving a total of about $4,750, or less than $200 more than what we're currently paying with that additional $600 payment.

We plan on being in this house at least another twenty years.

Both my wife and I have stable union jobs with strong security.  Annual income is around the $250k area or so.  We have a healthy savings fund to which we'd still be able to contribute.

We can comfortably absorb the additional monthly cost, so it seems like a pretty good move, but the only mortgage I've ever gotten in my life is our current one and it's not a topic I'm particularly knowledge about, so I'd love any additional input.",finance

Let me pull up a scenario. A bank has the fundamentals to charge borrower high interests because they pay for your loan upfront, or at least in batch without the need for you to maintain more than you are loaning in your bank account

&amp;#x200B;

With DeFi, averaging 85% collateralization value, I will need to have almost 2x the value of my loan in my hard wallet for a loan, which begs the question, if I had the cash, why would I not just pay for it?

&amp;#x200B;

Because I need the cash flow if I am running a business, to sustain the day to day cost. If I am purchasing a car, which is a liability, I would not pay for the whole vehicle upfront. And if I am paying for a $500,000 property, I wouldn't have enough cash up front anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

All bank asks for is the proof that you are able to service the loan. With DeFi, your cash flow is locked in the asset you are borrowing against. My question really is, how does DeFi tackle this problem, when this is clearly the largest issue facing the average joe today. Obviously, I do not expect DeFi to be able to finance my loan upfront, completely, just by a piece of paper stating my monthly income ...

&amp;#x200B;

So if it (DeFi) can't do that then the high return from lending out your crypto asset is a paradox itself, it will never have the demand to propel it to said interest rate

&amp;#x200B;

I believe that the high interest rate from lending currently comes from traders who believe that the asset they hold can and will multiply in the future, which is why they are borrowing against it. What if, say, 15 years from now and crypto asset is widely adopted, prices has stabilized, where will the demand come from then?",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Should I cash out 401K to pay for law school living expenses?,"I'll be attending a T1 regional law school in the fall with a full tuition scholarship. I'm looking to minimize the amount of debt I'm taking on and after calculating my living expenses, books, and fees not covered by my scholarship, I think I would only need to take out the $20,500 Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan per year. The current interest rate is 4.3% starting from when the loan is disbursed. 

Now I currently have ~$11,000 in a Rollover Roth IRA from a 401K I had a few years ago. I imagine after taxes and fees it will be a bit less but still a decent amount. My original plan was to just let it sit there forever. 

I also have ~$9,000 (hoping to get that to $11-12,000 by fall) in a savings account. The plan was to use that for the school fees and the rest for small emergency fund. 

I'm also applying for outside scholarships to help a little bit, but I don't like including those since they're not sure things. 

This amount will only help out for my first year, but hopefully my 2L and 3L I'll be able to get a part-time job to lower my loan a bit. 

Would it be better to cash out my 401k, combine it with my savings, and then decline the loan (or at least take out a much smaller amount)?",finance
personalfinance,Taxes: Claim head of household on W4 but file as single?,"apologies for the confusing topic, was unsure how to phrase this but have been racking my mind about what to do. this is all based on the old form W4, i have been at my job for a few years so haven't had to update to new W4.

In short, in tax year 2019, i updated my W4 to claim 2 federal and 1 state. Technically on federal I selected ""1"" for myself and ""1"" for HoH (although i am not). I did this as I was planning on purchasing a home and wanted more in each paycheck for that calendar year.

When I file at the end of the year, I clearly file as ""single""

I haven't filed yet, but turbo tax says i owe $269. I'm okay with this, as I prefer more in each check and to owe a few hundred or so each year. I prefer to not give the government an interest free loan and don't care about a refund each year.

I guess I am confused, because I would think the delta between 1/2 would be much more than $269, or did my job just over-withhold?

Is this an okay model? It's my understanding the IRS doesn't care about your W4 as that is only for your internal payroll and all that matters is how you file at the end of the year compared to how much tax was withheld. So, regardless of what I select on my W4/withholding, as long as I correctly file at the end of each year as 1/single and pay whatever is owed, am I okay?",finance

personalfinance,Complicated Recharacterization &amp; Backdoor Roth IRA Tax Question,"My wife and I are trying to understand how to complete our 2020 taxes due to an error we made in 2019 of contributing to a Roth IRA when we were ineligible to contribute.

**The situation:**

We each contributed $6,000 to our Roth IRA’s and had filed MFS for 2019 (filing status due to high student loan debt). We realized in early 2020 that we could not contribute to a Roth IRA directly (for 2019), because our income exceeded $10,000. To fix this issue, we both had to recharacterize our 2019 Roth IRA contributions to a Traditional IRA funds, we did this in March of 2020. After the recharacterization to the traditional IRA, we did a backdoor Roth IRA a few days later, but before April 15, 2020.

Additionally, on April 30, 2020, we each contributed $6,000 to a traditional IRA and did a backdoor Roth IRA for tax year 2020 as well, because we still needed to file as MFS.

**The problem:**

I am using H&amp;R Block Tax software to prepare our 2020 taxes and am having a hard time navigating the 1099-R forms that Vanguard has provided. The original $6,000 (corrected 2019 contribution) that went to the Roth incorrectly, was valued at $5,483 when it was recharacterized to the Traditional IRA. The 1099-R is lumping the $5,483 and the $6,000 (2020 contribution) to total $11,483 on one line. The form marks Gross Distribution (Box 1), $11,483, and Taxable Amount (Box 2a) as also $11,483. The form also marks Box 2b as Taxable amount not determined. No Federal or state tax was withheld from this amount. The Distribution code is marked as 02.

**It seems to me like H&amp;R Block is taxing me on the $5,483, when it should not be. How am I supposed to denote that the $5,483 was a recharacterization from a Roth IRA to Traditional, and then as a Backdoor Roth IRA, and for Tax Year 2019? AKA, how do i tease apart the $6,000 and $5,483 when the 1099-R has them lumped together as $11,483.**

If this is beyond the scope of H&amp;R Block software, please let me know and we can try to see a tax professional. We are worried though that with the deadline fast approaching, if anyone would have availability. The problem is further complicated by us needing to run taxes both ways, MFJ and MFS each year to see which is the greater benefit when also considering the student loan payments.

Market Cap: $3.73B

**Description**

Genius Sports ($GENI) recently reverse merged with DMYD to become a publicly traded company. GENI provides sports data and solutions in multiple ways. Recently, they centralized all of the NCAA’s sports data and stats. This would be 1,100 universities and colleges among three divisions. As such, they were able to provide sports data for 50,000 events in their first 18 months of going live. NCAA basketball, football, volleyball, ice hockey and soccer leagues all use the Genius Sports LiveStats software. 

Furthermore, Genius provides media solutions for both sports teams and sportsbooks. For example, the Vancouver Canucks hired them to target ads to fans for special offers on tickets. This led to an 875% return on investment for the Canucks, so it’s a service they’re likely to keep using. The media department is just getting started as Genius just [doubled their revenue in that department](https://sbcnews.co.uk/sportsbook/2021/04/28/genius-sports-returns-to-profit-as-nyse-journey-begins/).

Most importantly and what amounts to 74% of their revenue, Genius Sports provides sports betting data in a variety of ways. First and foremost, they supply 40% of the sportsbooks with their betting lines, and this includes live betting. DraftKings, FanDuel, bet365, and many other Sportsbooks use GENI’s software and data for line setting. What this means is that it doesn’t matter which sportsbook does the best, as GENI supplies data to many of them.

Genius Sports is currently the leader in their field, and they have exclusive rights with multiple leagues. Among those are FIBA (pretty much every basketball league not in the USA), the NCAA, NFL, English Premier League, and many more. GENI actually has employees in attendance at the games to ensure they get the data in real time. Genius currently covers more than 240,000 events each year of which 110,000 are exclusive, and they have more than 650 long-term partnerships with sports leagues and sportsbooks.

Their operations were sourced from the SEC 4K below. Look specifically at pages 154-170 and 205-221 for the business and products.

**Sports Betting Outlook**

Sports betting hasn’t even come close to hitting its peak in the United States. In 2018, *Murphy v. NCAA* ruled that the federal government couldn’t make sports betting illegal; that decision was in violation of the 10th Amendment since those powers are not delegated to the Fed explicitly. Since then, [22 states have launched sports betting, 3 just had bills passed recently, and 22 have introduced bills](https://www.espn.com/chalk/story/_/id/19740480/the-united-states-sports-betting-where-all-50-states-stand-legalization). That means that ***only 3 states have not attempted to legalize sports betting in some capacity*****.** Everyone has been talking about the impending legalization of marijuana and which companies will skyrocket because of that, but sports betting is already here, and no one is talking about what the plays are outside of DKNG and PENN.

Sports betting is less morally gray than marijuana to politicians, so full US legalization of sports betting is literally a couple years away. Also unlike the marijuana industry, sports data companies have already been established and operating in the legal sector for some time. There’s more to sports data than just sports betting. NFL nerds like myself can browse Football Reference for hours and look at OJ Simpson’s stats from his 2,000 yards season. Pro Football Focus has revolutionized the NFL with analytics. Genius Sports distributes stats for FIBA and has their media department.

Live betting has been seeing an increase in popularity and is actually more popular than pregame betting, especially in Europe. For this reason, it’s crucial that the data is as accurate, fast, and reliable as possible. Most of the states that legalize betting also legalize mobile betting, meaning that people can bet all day every day from their phone. In-game betting is huge and is expected to grow in the US much like it has in Europe. I’m unable to find the source, but I’ve read that roughly 60% of bets placed in Europe are live bets. Genius Sports gets a cut of each wager placed, which means the more live bets taking place means more money for GENI.

**Consistent Customers**

Genius Sports has only lost one customer in their history, and that customer ended up coming back to them. They always seem to be in the headlines for acquiring new deals. Recently they partnered with [Major League Rugby](https://www.majorleague.rugby/news/genius-sports-betting/) to be their data distributor, acquired [FanHub](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/genius-sports-acquires-fanhub-leading-110000827.html) for the media solutions, and signed a deal with the NFL.

GENI has a habit of signing contracts with customers for a minimum of 4-5 years, but sometimes longer. Their deal with NCAA is for 10 years and was signed in 2018. In 2019 they signed with FIBA for 15 years. Their contracts have guaranteed minimums with escalators as well.

Most exciting and the cherry on top for Genius Sports is the aforementioned [deal with the NFL](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/01/nfl-agrees-to-data-rights-deal-with-genius-sports.html) to be their exclusive data distributor. The NFL dominates ratings, as Monday Night Football, Sunday Night Football, and Thursday Night Football were the [top 3 most popular series](https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/most-popular-tv-shows-highest-rated-2019-2020-season-masked-singer-last-dance-1234612885/) according to TV ratings. Oftentimes a random Thursday Night Football game will have higher ratings than games from the NHL Finals, World Series, and NBA Finals. 

The fact of the matter is that the NFL is king when it comes to viewership, and Genius is set to capitalize. Additionally, part of the NFL deal was that the NFL would get an equity stake, so it’s in the league’s best financial interest that Genius Sports also does well financially. Making this an even sweeter deal is that GENI’s main competitor, SportRadar, was the official provider of the NFL prior to this. In other words, Genius Sports was able to steal their biggest competitor’s big fish client right when the league has finally started to fully embrace betting.

**Financials**

Financially this company has room for improvement. They have $391M in assets but $530M in liabilities. However, this is for the 2020 year, and they’ve since gained extra capital from merging with DMYD and now being publicly listed. $350M of their liabilities are preferred securities, meaning that companies with equity stakes (like the NFL) are buying those special shares for a dividend. This isn’t a huge deal because those investors believe in Genius to stay afloat and grow, otherwise they wouldn’t expect a dividend.

According to the investor presentation linked above, they should now have a debt free balance sheet upon completion of their merger with DMYD. GENI’s upcoming earnings report will be big to see if that is actually true. In 2019 they reported an EPS of -0.23. I can’t find EPS for 2020, but their EPS in Q4 2020 was -0.08, so I’d have to imagine that they did slightly worse.

They reported positive EBITDA of 8% this last year, and they’re projecting an EBITDA margin of 18% for 2021 and 29% for the 2022 fiscal years. Additionally, revenue is fast increasing, as their 2020 revenue of $149M was a [30% increase](https://sbcnews.co.uk/sportsbook/2021/04/28/genius-sports-returns-to-profit-as-nyse-journey-begins/) of $114M the year prior. Considering they were able to increase revenue in a year where sports practically didn’t exist for a quarter of the year, this is wildly impressive. Genius believes that a 30% CAGR is more than doable, and they expect revenue to be $190M in 2021 and $238M in 2022. DKNG won’t be profitable for a few years *at least*, but profitability is right around the corner for GENI.

It must be noted that the numbers in the above paragraph are from their investor presentation which was released ***before their deal with the NFL***. 

**Valuation**

I’m not great at valuation, but if someone else is please feel free to chime in. For what it’s worth, Simply Wall Street says that this company is priced [roughly at fair valuation](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/media/nyse-geni/genius-sports#valuation). Additionally, analysts have set price targets anywhere from [$25-30](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/GENI/research-ratings). This is probably flawed logic, but if DraftKings is roughly $55 a share right now with a market cap of $22 billion, I gotta imagine the company that they rely on for their product is worth more than $3.73 billion. In fact, according to Niccolo de Masi, CEO of dMY Technology (the company GENI merged with to go public), DraftKings listed in their prospectus that Genius Sports going out of business is a risk factor.

**Bear Cases**

There are a handful of risk factors, and most importantly is that they have one main competitor in SportRadar. As stated earlier, Genius provides data for 40% of sportsbooks. SportRadar provides another 40% of the books with data, and the remaining 20% is split among a handful of other companies. SportRadar mainly does data for the NHL, NASCAR, and NBA (for which they have exclusive rights). 

SportRadar runs Cleaning the Glass, Sports Reference, and Stat Head, websites where you can look at stats dating back to the inception of each league (really cool stuff if you’re into that). With that being said, I believe there’s room for two companies even though they’re competitors, which is a thought that de Masi also backs. SportRadar is rumored to merge with HZON, and full disclosure I do own only a small position as it’s not actually official yet.

As with anything, the Fed could decide they don’t like it and make it illegal. I believe that to be unlikely, as sports betting provides a great amount of revenue for the State, and the government more than likely will take any extra avenue of money considering all the cash recently printed.

Financially they’re not exactly the most sound at the moment, so that risk is obviously there. A downside to their deal with the NFL is that it’s pretty damn expensive: $120M a year. Half of that will be paid through equity, so Genius is really paying $60M a year. A value investor (which I mainly try to be) would look at GENI’s balance sheet and free cash flow and say “no thanks”. 

I believe the opportunity for huge growth is so great that I can’t resist. Profitability looks like it’s around the corner. Plus, if I”m gonna sports gamble I may as well invest in what I’m losing my money in.

If you have anything to add, any questions or critique about my DD (this is my first one), I’d love to hear it. If I’m flat out wrong about something, please correct me, especially when it comes to explaining the financial stuff.

I’d also love to hear other sports betting stocks of interest. Thanks, and let’s make money from sports gambling.

**tldr;** Sportsbooks such as DraftKings, Bet365, FanDuel and more outsource all of the sportsbooks lines. When you bet against “Vegas” in sports, international basketball, the NFL, March Madness and more, you’re actually betting on the lines provided by GENI. Sports betting is being legalized rapidly, and GENI is the pick and shovels for the industry. I’m shook this hasn’t been getting more coverage, either here or from the general media.

stocks,New Investors: The average return of the stock market is 10% per year over time.,"2020 was an unprecedented year. New investors (of which there are tens of millions now) need to know that on average the return of the market is around 10% (it ranges from 7%-11% depending on your metric, but for simplicities sake we'll average it to 10%).

If you have gone beyond that 10%, that is a good thing, but it is not the average, and in the long term few investors beat the market as time goes on. Generally, beating the market is an anomaly and hard to replicate over 10 and 20 year periods.

I think as a whole investors have been spoiled by the last year. The market was so awash with cash (and continues to be) from FED action that a monkey could throw darts at a board and make a lot of money.

I make this post only to say that for newer investors, those who have been investing just in the last few years, don't be disappointed when your performance doesn't match that of 2020. As far as statistical returns show us, that was far and away an anomaly.

I think it's prudent to temper your expectations. I don't mean sell, I don't mean you won't beat the market in the future, I just mean to say temper your expectations so that you don't become disenchanted with investing as time goes on. If you beat 10% in your portfolio it is a GOOD thing. However, expecting 30%-500% growth in less than a year is only going to make you feel disappointed when your stocks don't meet that expectation.

Keep your head high, stay invested, let your investments compound, just don't be saddened when your returns are at or slightly below average moving forward. You're still doing better than those that don't invest at all.",finance

personalfinance,Choosing a good checking/savings/brokerage account combination,"Hi, PersonalFinance. I am 23 years old and live the US. I am starting to think there are better options than my hometown bank. The problem is I have no idea what I'm doing and need some help considering my options. In my brief reading, it seems that it is very common for people to have multiple accounts at different institutions. I have come up with this:


**Charles Schwab High Yield Investor Checking:**

* 0.03% APY

* No Account Fees

* No International Fees

* Unlimited ATM rebates worldwide

* No minimum balance requirement

* Attached Brokerage Account

This is an attractive option for me due to the lack of fees and minimum balance. I do not need a high interest rate and I use my credit card for all of my purchases. This seems like a decent fallback in the very few cases I would need a debit card.

**Marcus by Goldman Sachs High Yield Online Savings:**

* 0.50% APY
* No minimum to open
* No fees
* Can link other banks (I can link it to my Schwab Checking?)

This is a pretty straight forward account for me. I want access to lump sums of money that I have stored away for emergency. This account has a maximum transfer of 100k for same-day transfers. It seems to have a great interest rate that can only benefit money sitting in an account doing nothing for possibly months and years on end.

**Vanguard Brokerage Account:**

I would like to eventually start investing in the S&amp;P 500. I want to invest in a way that is low-effort and long-term (think consistent month deposits over the cost of 20-40 years). Vanguard seems to align with what I would like. I would most likely take advantage of their Roth IRA for this purpose.

Those are the three accounts I am currently considering. I could really using some help analyzing if this is a good setup.

Bitcoin,'Bitcoin to Fiat' still a bit like 'Uber to Taxis',"I would love to believe in Bitcoin...(actually I mean '*cryptocurencies*'... there should never be just one of them, and it certainly should never be bitcoin... the Winklevii alone hold 5% of them... and there are *other 'whales'*... it be **wealth inequality all over**!!!).

Additionally... I see Bitcoin as massive **deflationary** as now there are only a limit amount of tokens that would go only to the most productive and needed sectors of the economy (good!!!!), but given that things are now tokenized and in limited supply, hoarding will become a real thing and that will kill billions and billions of jobs. (One could argue that the jobs lost would be BS jobs to start with... not my point here).

In any case, nature will love it:  the energy consumption to run bitcoin will be completely offset by millions of factories closing and people being out of work, preventing them from consuming/driving.

Alas... **the moment Central Banks around the world start dumping their gold reserves and switching to crypto's, I am all in!** Till that moment I think there is this huge regulatory risk out there that needs to be addressed ASAP.

What I mean with 'Uber to Taxis' is specifically in a city like NYC. To operate a Taxi in NYC, you need a medallion. Those ""tokens"" are in limited supply and hence the price has gone up big time over the years. It used to be a 1-1 type thing: 1 driver, 1 medallion, but they have gotten so expensive that groups of drivers needed to buy one....

**Enter Uber**....""Bwwwahahahaa you fools and your dumb medallions!!!"" Who needs those? They are hard to get and wayyy to expensive""... Well, yeah they were for a reason, to regulate the nr of taxis. Due to intense lobbying by Uber to not regulate Uber like a taxi service, the value of the medallion has necessarily dropped BIG TIME. Win for Uber for sure!

Now.. will that same thing play out in 'finance'?

Just last week I got this notification from Venmo: You can no longer keep a *balance* in your Venmo account **if you don't give up your personal details**. You can still *use* Venmo, but Venmo can not become 'a holding place for money' any longer.  You can also still pay people with it, but that will come directly from a bank account backing your Venmo account.

    Why are you asking me to do this?
    Venmo is required by federal law to collect certain information from all its users that have access to a balance.

Ahhhhh..... Federal law....

**Enter Bitcoin:** ""Bwwwahahahaa you fools and your dumb Federal laws!!!"" Who needs those? Just annoying. With Bitcoin I can just send money to whomever I want... ""I don't need a middle man, or some entity *clearing* the transaction""... No you don't indeed, but that middle man still would like to know...?

The price of Bitcoin is about 1.000.000 too low if that 'middle man' says it's OK and the price of Bitcoin is ZERO when they eventually say it's not ok.

Sure, they can never prevent you from sending someone some coins but they can prevent 'their' banks and currency systems to do business involving Bitcoin... then it's game over.

The Government **does not like competition when it comes to money/currency**... Bitcoin's price is betting on them allowing it.

The best rate I have right now is 2.25% for a VA IRRRL loan. Navy Federal put my rate at 3.375% which is quite a bit higher.

&amp;#x200B;

NF keeps telling me they have a rate match guarantee, but I can only submit for that once I lock in my currently offered rate (3.375%) with them. Once I lock in a rate am I obligated to go with that company at that point?

Furthermore, the fine print says that if they can't match the rate then they will give me $1,000. That money isn't worth it if I have to stick with the higher rate for the next 20yrs.

Additionally, I haven't completely filled out their application yet since they are now asking me for $40 to run my credit. The credit has been ran twice now, I'm wondering if running it once again just to find out if they match this much lower rate is worth it.

I'm guessing they won't match it since it's a 1.125% difference. Veterans United already said they couldn't match it. So yeah, I might get a $1,000 out of it but I'll also take another hit to my credit. So I'm wondering if anyone used the rate match in the past and how it went?",finance

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, May 6, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, May 6, 2021**

Remarkably, despite many individual companies pulling back steeply today, the three major indexes finished the day positive, driven by gains in financial stocks and stability in mega-caps. Growth stocks and more speculative plays have been hit hard by a combination of inflationary fears and recent suggestions by monetary officials that the interest rate should be raised. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed the day 0.81%, less than 1% below it’s record high. The Dow Jones (DIA) recorded a new intraday record while the Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 0.76%. Market participants continue to monitor commentary from monetary officials, ongoing earnings season, and new economic data, particularly the April Jobs Report set for release tomorrow morning.

After reclaiming the leadership in April as the best performing sector in the SPY, so far in May we have seen investors rotate out of big tech stocks and into financial stocks, with many big banks pushing all-time highs today. Market participants are worried that a suggested raise in interest would affect the already stretched valuation of some companies. Given the rally the market saw in April, some analysts are worried that positive catalysts for equities are getting harder to achieve and may be running out. The economy in the US is recovering faster than initially predicted by analysts, with this earnings season seeing 86% of companies in the S&amp;P 500 that have reported earnings  beat estimates, according to data from FactSet. 

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen suggested that interest rates may need to rise in the near-term to prevent the economy from overheating, with the recent economic data and corporate earnings showing economic activity recovering much faster than expected as effective distribution of the vaccine in the US allows states to gradually reopen. Yellen said, “It may be that interest rates will have to rise somewhat to make sure that our economy doesn't overheat, even though the additional spending is relatively small relative to the size of the economy. It could cause some very modest increases in interest rates to get that reallocation, but these are investments our economy needs to be competitive and to be productive. I think our economy will grow faster because of them."" In later remarks, she added that raising rates was not something she was predicting or recommending and that the decision ultimately rests with the Federal Reserve. She said, “Let me be clear, that’s not something I’m predicting or recommending. If anybody appreciates the independence of the Fed, I think that person is me.”

The Labor Department will release its April jobs report on Friday, which is expected to show a staggering nearly 1 million payrolls came back last month, accelerating March’s gain. As a reminder, in March, the Department of Labor reported nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 for the month while the unemployment rate fell to 6% (unemployment rate was 14.6% in April 2020). Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 675,000 and an unemployment rate of 6%.

**Highlights**

* Weekly unemployment claims fell to 498,000 last week—a new low since the Covid-19 pandemic began more than a year ago. The four-week average of initial claims is also at the lowest point since the pandemic began. Read more [here](https://www.wsj.com/articles/weekly-jobless-claims-coronavirus-05-06-2021-11620247798).
* The Bank of England upped their growth estimates for the economy of the UK, anticipating GDP will grow 7.25% in the country, up from its forecast for 5% growth in February. The BOE also now sees inflation averaging 2.5% in 2021, up from its prior forecast for 2%, but said the rise in price pressures will likely be ""temporary."" 
* NIO announced the company will expand into Norway, with the group’s first service and delivery center set to open in the capital Oslo in September.
* A lot of stocks pulled back despite posting better than expected earnings. The market is very narrow right now, with gains concentrated in the financials, energy, and mega-caps.
* IBM introduced what it says is the world's first 2-nanometer chip making technology.

CryptoCurrency,Why most cryptocurrency will never truly be used for everyday transactions: The Lack Of Privacy and Fungibility.,"# Privacy

For most cryptocurrency projects out there, every transaction is fully traceable. Anyone can paste your address in a block explorer, and see the addresses where you received your coins, and the addresses where you sent your coins. Anyone can also see your balance. 

For example when you buy something in a shop, the owner can see how much more coins you've got left in your wallet. Or, if you're a robber, you go to the shop and buy something, immediately you have the receiving address of the shop's cash register, and you can choose to ask for a ""refund"" at gunpoint if there's more in the cash register than it's worth the trouble.

If you're a company, your competitors can track your addresses and see where and when and for how much you purchased your materials, and who bought your products.

Most projects lack any privacy whatsoever and in that regard they’re worse than fiat payments for everyday things through a debit card.

# Fungibility

Fungibility is a bit harder to explain. Fungibility literally means that 1 unit of account isn't equal to any other unit of account. Think of physical art, cars, houses, etc.

A lot of crypto projects aim to be money, and money by definition must be fungible. One gold coin is equal to another gold coin of the same mass and chemical composition. You might say that it's the same with crypto, but transparency of the chain leading to lack of privacy ruins the fungibility. Why? Because every single coin has a history that's forever stored on the blockchain.

Consider this: FBI catches a criminal who used your favorite crypto. His wallet is seized, and all addresses that he stored his coins in are blacklisted. That also means all other addresses which transacted with his own addresses are also suspicious and under investigation. Some even become blacklisted. Exchanges refuse to accept blacklisted coins, so suddenly your candy shop's wallet is effectively blocked from fiat ramps and centralized exchanges because that criminal bought a chocolate 3 months ago, and now you have tainted coins in your wallet.

But you still have to spend your tainted crypto, to pay your workers, to pay suppliers, etc. You think you're innocent, but Binance or Coinbase would still freeze your deposit for months until the feds clear you, because you sent them tainted coins, which once belonged to a convicted murderer. So what that means? Effectively, your coins are now worth less that ""clean"" crypto, because not everyone accepts these coins as equal. So unfortunately it sells at discount.

A real life analogy would be you going to a bank and depositing dollar bills that are stained by blood. Surely the teller would raise the alarm and security would apprehend you for questioning. Or going to a convenience store to buy a beer, and giving the merchant a dollar bill covered in mayonnaise. Would they accept your tainted bill? Surely not. Now your mayo dollar is worth less because it's different from other dollars.

The opposite also applies: super-clean coins sell at premium. ""Virgin Bitcoins"" are a real thing--these are the coins which have never moved once they were mined, so they have no history. To buy these virgin BTCs you have to pay more than for ""ordinary"" BTC on an exchange. Real life analogy would be walking to FED building and getting brand new freshly printed dollar bills, which have neither blood, mayo, or traces of cocaine on them.

personalfinance,Filing taxes on time but paying late; trying to figure out how much I'll owe in full,"Due to some unique circumstances my tax bill is very, very large this year (exercised a lot of ISOs without knowing what AMT is). The only way I'd be able to pay it off is by selling shares that I exercised; unfortunately they're subject to long term capital gains until August. Thus, I want to wait until they ""mature"" so I can save 9% in taxes

I'm trying to figure out what I'll owe the IRS when I eventually re-pay. From my understanding there are two factors with late payment (I'm not considering a late filing penalty since I'm going to file on time): interest and failure-to-pay.

Interest is a daily compounding interest where the interest rate is the current short term federal interest rate + 3%. All I could find on the current short term rate is 0.13%, so the interest rate I'll be charged is 3.13%.

The failure-to-pay penalty is 0.5% of the total taxes owed charged every month. I'm planning on waiting until 4 ""cycles"" to pay, so I'll owe 2% of my total tax bill.

Thus, to calcuulate how much I owe in full, this is what I have:

x + interest + (0.02 * x)

where x = my tax bill. Is this correct? It honestly seems a lot less than I was expecting ultimately and it's not that bad. I want to make sure I'm not missing something or if I'm oversimplifying it

and if you want to know, x = $79k...",finance

Since the loan relief program started I've saved about $15,000.  Right now it's just sitting there earning zero interest. (FYI, I've also got another $10k saved for a rainy day &amp; a retirement account.)

I plan on using that money to pay off the loans, but there's no reason to do it until the interest kicks back in. SO, what should I do with the money until then? I've been considering a CD, an ETF, or a mutual fund, but don't know much about any of this. Open to other ideas too.

In its semiannual Financial Stability Report, the central bank said that while the system overall has remained largely stable even through the Covid-19 pandemic, future dangers are rising, in particular should the aggressive run on stocks tail off.

“High asset prices in part reflect the continued low level of Treasury yields. However, valuations for some assets are elevated relative to historical norms even when using measures that account for Treasury yields,” the report states. “In this setting, asset prices may be vulnerable to significant declines should risk appetite fall.”

personalfinance,How do you invest for non-specific future life events after maxing retirement accounts?,"Some background - I am single 33 years old, no children. This is the first year I am track to max out my 401k and Roth IRA.  I want to start to invest in taxable accounts and I may want to use some of this money before retirement (i.e. buying a bigger house, maybe a child/wedding one day, etc.), but I don't have a specific goal or timeline in mind - none of these things may happen, for example.  How should I invest this money?  

I have a well stocked emergency fund and ""house/car repair fund"" in an HYSA, as well as the entire balance of my student loans (plan to pay off as soon as 0% waiver is up). I also have a mortgage with a 2.75% interest rate that I have no desire to pay off early (I am fine carrying debt at this very favorable rate). Going forward I don't think I need to save any more cash and feel I am missing out on growth opportunities.  I would like to start investing any excess monthly savings.    

I completely understand we are in a bull market, and any investments have no guaranteed returns, but with a variable timeline and moderately conservative investments, I am not as afraid of a downturn because nothing is set in stone - I can potentially wait it out.  I am leaning towards something like Vanguard Wellesly or Wellington, or even just trying to replicate these funds through a combination of VTSAX and conservative bond funds (Currently, retirement is all in a few Vanguard stock index funds).

I also have a new nephew (yay!), and have been considering as 529 Plan for him as well, but I need to do some more research on this first.

CryptoCurrency,Tips to reduce your spending and start stacking those coins from your friends at r/Frugal_Jerk,"Hello from your friendly neighborhood FatCat and all the other FatCats over at r/Frugal_Jerk! (btw I'm posting this from the library computer because who in their right mind would pay for a personal computer these days??)

**We all thought we could offer some tips and tricks for you to cut down on expenses to increase those portfolios. Let's start with the basics:**


1.) Cut out coffee/caffeine - This is a bonus because while you're bed-ridden with a splitting migraine from quitting cold turkey, you'll be physically unable to look at a computer screen and won't be able to FOMO into any coins that are mooning! 
No more chasing candles!
Only downside is that you might miss out on a few buying opportunities, but what's a few percentage points between friends?


2.) Shut off your heater and replace it with mining on your PC or laptop - Maybe more useful for the southern hemisphere crypto fiends, but in the winter time or cold nights, you can slash that heating bill because those sweet, sweet fractional coins will actually create so much heat you'll be sleeping in the nude in no time. 
Plus, those cooling fans are a built in white noise maker for uninterruped slumber.


3.) Stop getting haircuts - Embrace the mane. Who cares if you're a greasy little gremlin with hair down to your butt if you spend all of your free time in front of the computer screen anyway. Thanks to covid, social lives and leaving the house are a thing of the past! A good haircut can be upwards of $40 every 2-3 months. 
Annually, you'd be saving over $150 that you could instead be investing into shitcoins. 
Sure, you might be missing out on the opportunity to shill your coins to your barber/hairdresser, but chances are their measly investments won't mean a lot for the overall market cap anyway.


**Now onto some of the more advanced tips and strategies:**


4.) Collect aluminum cans from friends/family/strangers on the street - I'm assuming most of you are already doing this, I mean an empty aluminum can can be worth $0.05 in a lot of places, that's 1/4 of Vet... 3% of an ADA... the possibilities are endless. 
For those who like havings goals to work toward, you'll only need to collect 1,140,000 cans for a whole Bitcoin. Before you know it, you'll be scrounging through public trash cans and dumpster diving to collect them all! 
Better get started now!


5.) Learn how to hibernate - Channel your inner NatGeo documentary and when the next bear market comes along, hibernate like a bear! 
Make sure you've staked your coins, set your auto-DCAs, all that fun stuff because if done properly, it will be impossible to wake you from your slumber. 
It's a hard skill to learn, but you will need very little sustenance during this time, allowing you save TONS on food and water. I can personally, highly recommend this one.


6.) Sell your body for cash - Not like that... but also, maybe like that... Anyway, most people don't know how valuable the human body really is. 
Right now, you can earn hundreds for selling your plasma (US only) or becoming a sperm/egg donor. 
I've even read some stories in newspapers and online that kidneys and livers fetch a high price on the black market just in case anyone thinks you can get by with less than what you have now!


7.) Get rid of your pets - This was a tough one for me, I loved my dog. He was truly my best friend. But what kind of best friend makes you spend $100+ on them a month on food, insurance, etc.? Now, you've got a few options here: you could sell your pet, but that might only work for purebreds. 
What I ended up doing was trading my dog for some chickens. I can hear you already: ""Wait a minute, he just told me to sell my pet and now he wants me to get another one?!"" Here's where it gets interesting, chickens lay eggs... and eggs are sustenance. Free food! 
All I have to do is feed them some corn or other stuff, I don't really know, I've only had them a couple days now. The eggs have already started piling up, I plan on opening an egg stand to sell them to my neighbors and at the farmers market when those start back up again and reinvesting those egg dividens back into my crypto portfolio.


Looking at each of these individually, you might be thinking: ""Is it worth it to give up my perfectly coifed hairdo &amp; daily grande frappe with whipped almond milk?"" I can say with 100% certainty that yes, it is worth it. The best time to plant a crypto tree was 15 years ago, but the second best time is today.

CryptoCurrency,My first rug pull experience; what I learned and my story,"Crypto is not guaranteed to make you money, and there are a lot of people who know how to steal money and exploit gambling, eager or uneducated investors. If you know how to read and understand code then you are ahead of the curve. I don't know how to read code and rely on other sources to trust a project. There were a few warning signs that I ignored and cost me a small investment. I am sharing my experience and I hope there is something valuable in my story for you.

Who are the devs? Investing in anonymous teams is more risky than teams that are transparent. There are legit projects with anonymous teams so just be aware of your appetite for risk. But there are stories I've heard with a team that turned out to be fake so it's no guarantee either.

Where do the devs and project team communicate with investors? I personally rely heavily on a projects forums, reddit, Discord, Twitter and Telegram when getting information on the status of a project. I am sure there are other great methods out there. 

If a project doesn't communicate when there is something concerning going on within a reasonable timeframe, might be a red flag. 

Is the project brand new? Is the project a clone? Is the website clean and high quality looking? In my case, it was a brand new project with a lot of hype. It was a clone of another project. And one thing on the website that was a red flag I ignored were some low resolution graphics. A critical eye and high standards might save you some headache. If a project is serious, then the website presentation will probably be pristine. Not always true, but something to consider. 

Are you buying into the hype? In my case, I saw this random tweet show up for a random project with a good look to it. I looked into it and it was really under the radar. Maybe a gem? It showed up on the heels of Polygon gaining a lot of attention and it was a project being built exclusively on Polygon. 

I am not throwing shade at Polygon, any new platform gaining mass attention will likely have a bunch of new projects materialize since it is a great opportunity to generate hype. 

Buying into hype for a brand new project is a dangerous game. Emotional trading and investing is extremely risky. Greed is easy to get caught up in. 

When the token finally launched, I didn't see what it's ath was, but the tokenomics looked solid. I don't know what the initial supply was (more on this in a bit) but the supply was well below 10k at launch. Someone told me they bought their bag when the token was $5k+. I happened to tune in a day after launch and thought I was getting a good deal at $84 per token when I heard it was around $500 earlier. Next day the price fell to $10. Next day $5. Now siting around $2.60. 

What is the community saying? Who is critical and who can you trust? Before I bought my first tiny bag @ $84, someone in the telegram pointed out a huge flaw with the inflation rate. The supply was growing at an uncontrolled rate. The person predicted (accurately) that the current at the time supply of 10k coins would be over 350k in a weeks time. Numbers might not be 100% from my memory. It's been 4 days since I picked up some tokens and the supply is currently at 200k. 

Be careful out there friends! We are in the wild wild west still and people can easily steal your money if you don't do your due diligence and see the flaws of a project before hand. Pay attention to red flags, and if you buy in anyway, be ready to get effed. 

DYOR and educate yourself as best you can before going deep in the alt forest. I am happy I didn't invest much since I knew it was a risky play. I went into this project knowing I could lose all my investment. This is my first rug experience. Someone in telegram refered to this type of rug pull as a ""Soft Rug Pull"". 

I will delete this post if I am proven to be wrong, but the dev has been missing for 3 days now, the burn mechanism for the token is broken. They hired a person to communicate with the community and only paid for 1 weeks worth of work to that individual. Market cap is $650k.

* $1.9 trillion COVID stimulus. Which contained much more than just $1,400 checks. It contained policies that will free people to join the workforce who otherwise would not, to start businesses, to direct capital towards areas long beaten down.
* \~4 trillion infrastructure, part 1 and part 2. Investment in R&amp;D, Nationwide BroadBand, EV charging, Electrical Grid, Education, Renewable Energy, Childcare, Eldercare. These investments will allow for a huge increase in the number of people who can participate in the workforce.
* Booming Jobs growth. Expect to see sustained jobs growth over 1 million jobs a month in 2021, expect to see a long term jobs growth story of 300,000-400,000 every month for years and years.

* [Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index | U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)](https://www.bea.gov/data/personal-consumption-expenditures-price-index) It is true that there is some increasing inflation showing up, even in personal consumption, but mainly due to isolated commodity supply chains. It hasn't shown up in food, despite what anyone thinks. Not in rents (increase 1.7% YoY, negative in many places). (40% of Americans rent), it hasn't shown up in the electric bill, in electronics, in cars, the one pain point has been gas prices. Which, continue to be offset by improving efficiencies, and in context, gas prices are lower than 2010. As far as buying a house, people paying up to buy homes are making discretionary choices that they can afford to make. People in existing homes (the by far vast majority of the 60% of households who own a home) are not experiencing much inflation, they have mortgages.
* So no. The Fed won't be raising rates. Commodity inflation will work it's way thru the system. Ala 2010. Oil prices dropped to $20, then bounced back to $110+. And many other commodities that were low in the financial crisis, only to rise very quick in the recovery.
* Stocks. So, the economy and the stock market aren't directly connected anymore in the US. See the financial crisis recovery. Stocks boomed, the economy chugged along gradually. See 2020. It was a hard real economy for 10s of millions. The stock market did not care. So, will a roaring economy mean a roaring stock market? I think, in the context of creating new retail investors during COVID, and now post COVID, who will be joining the workforce with substantial growth, an exaggerated inflation prediction that never comes to fruition in the long run, meaning low rates, and trillions more in spending, it's going to be a very good stock market.
* Taxes. Oh get over yourselves. High taxes have never meant the economy can't grow or the stock market can't grow. People (even the wealthy) adjust to tax changes and then keep doing what they were doing. The impact is short lived, both on tax cuts and tax increases. ""Tax increases"" happened in the 90s and the 2010s. That did not stop the stock market, or the economy.
* And it's laughable to call them high. The United States has one of the lowest tax to GDP ratios of any advanced country. Yet trails in aggregate measures of education, healthcare, infrastructure, quality of life, environment. There's such a thing as lowering taxes for wealthy capital gains non labor earners too much. The US past that point in the 80s.

Yet, if that money I would be putting into principle went into crypto, hypothetically a safe booming one life Ethereum, than that would well outweigh the benefit of less interest, because the dollar debt would be decreasing and ether seems to be mooning. I could perhaps pay my mortgage off faster using the money that grew from crypto investments.

defi,Open letter to Big Banking and its Boomers.,"*read at own risk, grammar unchecked*

The sad truth, is that massive corporations, amd the career politicians that live in their pockets, are crying out like school children “no fair! How come we are regulated and Cryptocurrency isn’t! It’s not fair! Bind them with red tape too!”

1. The purpose of regulation is to protect the public, and prevent lawlessness from uprooting civilized society.

2. Regulation is historically merited when an individual, collective, or corporation has caused harm to the common man either directly or indirectly. When the trust of the many is violated for the gain of the few. At such a critical juncture it is the duty of our government to enact the minimum effective intervention required to rectify the issue and prevent its reoccurrence.

3. The motivations in the above scenario are ethical and reasonably expressed.

4. The banks, wallstreet, the “1.0%” (etc..) are currently so tightly bound by regulation primarily because they historically demonstrated that they can not be trusted to act with integrity, accountability, and transparency. They lost their autonomy gradually as scandal upon scandal marred the face of lady liberty and exploited her people. 

5. The effect of this over time being the creation of a clumsy, inefficient, bloated, lethargic, socioeconomically oppressive, and incredibly powerful white collar collective. Whose sole purpose is now self-preservation not serving the public.

6. The death of centralized finance is clearly visible, and inevitable.

7. Rather than adapt, reprioritize, or reflect on how this happened; we witness the stomping of feet and  holding of breath. 

8. They desperately claw at the system to crush this new movement, demanding the liberty of the decentralized finance community be strangled.
They spread fear, horde big accounts, buy in just to dump and destabilize the newborn system.

9. They are arrogant knowing the previous generations have been conditioned to trust banks as if they were public servants and not businesses created to profit on the wages of every day Americans. 

10. Ce-Fi, big banks, lobbyists have gravely undersestinatef the resolve of an oppressed generation. They underestimate the perpetual March of Cronos and the future he carries; the past he pushes further and further from view.

11. This is a conflict of wounded pride.
Of fear, and self centered ness.
The ignorance of miserly old men and women, who are terrified because they thought they could keep their heel upon the throats of the proletariate with the power of their money .

I'm 20 years old making $47,500 a year with no debt of any kind other than a car payment of $230/month. My SO is making about $17,000 a year and she has no debt whatsoever. Our net monthly income sits at roughly $4500.

Would it be a bad idea to take out a 30 year fixed mortgage on a home for $269,000 with a 3.5% down payment at a 3.4% interest rate?

Mortgage calculators give me a monthly payment of around $1700/month including taxes and fees.

I would just like to know if anyone has any opinions on how livable this is. We really want to start working towards owning something and would consider possibly renting out a room to help with the costs.

Thanks all for the help!",finance

“Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) saw new registrations fall 24% year-over-year in April in Germany, while Volkswagen AG's secured a 108.4% rise.

Tesla new registrations in Germany totaled 484 in April, while in the preceding month the tally was at 3,703 - a fall of 86.93%, according to data released by the country's federal motor transport authority, Das Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt.

Comparatively, Volkswagen saw registrations totaled 43,230 in April 2021; in March the number was 56,550, indicating a month-over-month fall of 23.5%. The automaker secured the largest share of new registrations in April at 18.8%.”

Anyone ignoring VW as a serious EV player is missing out on a significant upside. From the valuation perspective, “Tesla is worth more than twice as much as the two companies that sell by far the most actual cars — VW and Toyota, whose market caps are $102 billion and $213 billion respectively. Tesla delivered 499,550 vehicles last year. By comparison, Toyota sold 8.5 million vehicles just through November, and VW sold 8.3 million.”  

I am all in on VWAPY and POAHY. I am a bit biased - drive Porsche Macan and love it. Will be switching to Taycan within 12-18 months but apparently they are already back ordered for months. 

And no, this isn’t intended to be a detailed DD, so don’t come at me for that. :). Just sharing what I read this morning.

EDIT:  in terms of EV only sales, here is how these two companies sold world-wide. As you can see, in 2020 VW already sold almost half as many cars as Tesla. That’s three times as many as in 2019. Not too bad considering COVId.

CryptoCurrency,Widespread correction incoming,"Ya hate to hear it. 

Look guys I'm not a financial advisor. I look at the news, I read the stories, and I make a judgement. (This is specific to the US as that is my home country, but it effects/ is relevant to most of you anyways) 

Things are a lil bit crazy in finance today. The pandemic has spurred shortages like.... everywhere, while also pumping a shit ton of money into the system. Everyone knows low supply and more money chasing less goods equals inflation, but we all know that so I'm gonna stop talking about it. 

I do however want to talk about the absolutely irrational exuberance happening in almost all sectors of the market. We've got skyrocketing prices in both the commodities and their corresponding stonks (just read that steel is up 120% in the last year). Gold is still struggling because of all the price manipulation (I'm not a gold bug, but since everyone looks to the price of gold when inflation starts to get hot, it makes a lot of sense that this would be manipulated to make sure it stays low).

Then there's like garbage, literally garage, like AMC, doge, gme, going to the fucking moon every other week because people are gambling like there's no god damn tomorrow. Berkshire Hathaway's Class A price literally broke Nasdaq's computer it is so high ( I find it funny it settled at $420,421). And I'm sure there's many articles or news you've seen about how absolutely ridiculous things are.

Now my aim here is not to spook anyone. I'm still very much all in and haven't sold a thing. However, there's gonna be a SEVERE correction. I don't know when. I don't know what will spark it. Maybe the fed will swoop in and save the day. I really hope they don't though, because that literally NOT THEIR JOB, and they've already put the US in a very vulnerable place, literally using tax payers money to incentivize people to take risks in ridiculous stonks cuz the fed will just swoop in and save the day and sing lullabies to us. And I'm not even going to start at housing prices. Let's just say the American dream is dead for a lot of young people. 

This post is going on forever, so I'll get to my point. Start thinking about an exit plan. If you've made a nice profit, thinking about DCAing out. If you're like me and still waiting on your Lambo, please understand that you are treading on very dangerous ground and that any day can be the day that disaster comes. Research, start saving some cash, and never ever invest more than you can afford to lose. 

TLDR, the financial market is shooting out warnings that we are getting too hot too fast. Please don't ignore them. 

Edit: Calm down no one said sell. I'm not selling. Exit plan doesn't have to mean sell 100% and hide in your bunkers.  My exit plan is to start selling some of my bigger gainz, and maybe pausing my dca for a bit if we start to see significant selling pressure. But am I leave?? Fuck no.  Time in the market beats timing the market!

dogecoin,Musk's Real Perspective Revealed,"Elon's latest tweets are really eye-opening. 

1. He tells everyone to be careful; and
2. He said he views his DOGE support as ""the people's stimulus"" 

Both of these things are good, prudent, and true. The key point, however, is that these comments indicate that he views all of this as a bit of good fun. People can make some much-needed money while having fun.

The concerning part of this is that he's admitting it's basically a pump. Also, it's important to remember that prices don't simply rise on their own. Price fluctuation for DOGE (and everything else) is based on supply and demand. Prices only go up when people keep buying. However, the stimulus that Elon is promoting will only help people once they sell.

CryptoCurrency,Economist cover this week : Govcoins,"The issue is about the future of the banking system. A lot worth reading in here, especially for everyone who hopes their crypto of choice will topple the worlds' financial institutions.

Some quotes ""...govcoins could cut the operating expenses of the global financial industry, which amount to over $350 a year for every person on Earth. That could make finance accessible for the 1.7bn people who lack bank accounts. Government digital currencies could also expand governments’ toolkits by letting them make instant payments to citizens and cut interest rates below zero. For ordinary users, the appeal of a free, safe, instant, universal means of payment is obvious.""

""Once ascendant, govcoins could become panopticons for the state to control citizens: think of instant e-fines for bad behaviour. They could alter geopolitics, too, by providing a conduit for cross-border payments and alternatives to the dollar, the world’s reserve currency and a linchpin of American influence.""

personalfinance,Take out a unsubsidized student loan or dip into own savings to pay for school.,"Hi all, I am wondering if it is better to accept the unsubsidized loans I am getting offered through my public school or use my savings to pay for my school. Going back to get a second bachelors. Have nearly enough saved to pay for 3 years of schooling. This is assuming I do not get a part time or paid Internship which would offset having to use my savings.

Loans being offered would cover about all the tuition, I would still have to pay for nearly all my housing and other costs ( thankfully in a Low cost of living area).

I know that if I take the loans I would have to pay the interest monthly to keep them from compounding which would be a few dollars every month. is it better to do this or to just pay cash for everything? 

Thanks!

Edit: I am going back for a Computer Science degree, i did look at a masters in Computer science but I would still have to take a lot of prerequisites for the masters which would prob even out at about the same time frame or even more time in school. Figured I could get a masters down the road if I really want one.

dogecoin,They say Dogecoin is diluting its value by indefinitely putting more coins every day. Let's talk about that with simple math.,"Current amount of dogecoin in circulation: 129 billion

Daily amount of Dogecoin entering in circulation: 14.4 million (10.000 per minute)

Now, for the fun part:

new coins per day / circulating x 100 = % inflation per day

14.4m / 129b x 100 = 0,01116% inflation per day or 4,07% APR aka 4.07% year/inflation

&amp;#x200B;

Now, let's do this same operation with the US dollar and I'm gonna use a governmental source to do this ([https://www.uscurrency.gov/life-cycle/data/circulation](https://www.uscurrency.gov/life-cycle/data/circulation)):

Most recent data is from 2019 so I'll take 2019 vs. 2018 for this comparison. Amount of notes/bills of different denominations (in billions):

[$500 to $10.000 bills are left out because no precise information is provided, then again the amount of those bills is so small we can confidently assume its impact is negligible](https://preview.redd.it/tj51urdpgqx61.png?width=1484&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34df5a6a381f60bf370d972fe3e0d2ac66060850)

Now, we just have to multiply the amount of each bill with the correspondent value and we get this:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/n5qt1d9eiqx61.png?width=2452&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=995e21a711b664e4dfd9999b588fbd490caf5ad9

Now the difference between 2019 and 2018 is: 1752,3 - 1668,5 which equals to: 83,8

So, new B dollars per year / circulating B x 100 = % inflation per year: 83,8 x 100 / 1668,5 = 5,022%

**US Dollar vs Dogecoin (Inflation)**

**5,02% --- 4,07%**

**So, the truth is the Federal Reserve is diluting the value of the US Dollar FASTER than Dogecoin.**

**Finally, dogecoin's inflation will decrease over time as there are more coins circulating vs the same amount of new doge introduced every year (5,256 billion). So, by 2022, Doge's inflation will be less than 4% and will keep slowly going down.**

CryptoCurrency,A short view into the future: How blockchains will change our lives.,"Most people here still don't realize how blockchain will fundamentally change how we live our lives.

We argue whether we are early or late. I believe both are right. In terms of cryptocurrencies, we're not really early, but we're also not late. In terms of blockchain integration into into our lives, we are super early. And that's much more exciting than cryptocurrencies.

We haven't even begun to scratch the surface. In 30 years from now, young teenagers won't be able to even comprehend how humans were able to survive without blockchain. Just like the young generation of today can't understand how we survived thousands of years without internet or mobile phones. Blockchains will not only make our lives easier, they will exponentially accelerate the evolution of humanity.

For example, right now, in order to profit from our assets or buy new assets, we need to either have the resources to purchase them and then again having a way to sell them. Moving all the world's assets onto the blockchain will give us possibilities that we've never before had. Small businesses that need extra cash flow can just put shares for sale on the blockchain. You could easily own part of a restaurant or store within minutes without having to go through lengthy negotiations.

If you quickly need some extra cash because you have to pay an emergency medical bill, you could borrow money within minutes because your home's value and ownership is on the blockchain. You can use it as a guarantee and immediately see and accept the interest rates. You could even sell a fraction of your home to someone who wants to invest in it. No need to sell the entire house.

Elections will eventually move to the blockchain, eliminating voter fraud, provide transparency and real-time results for everyone to see. And perhaps most importantly, when we finally become an inter-planetary species, blockchain will be one of our most important tools. There is no way we are taking paperwork, money printing machines or coins with us to Mars.

As I said, the possibilities are endless. We haven't even begun to scratch the possibilities of how blockchain can and will change the way we live our daily lives.

I hope to still be alive 30 years from now, look back at this post and say ""wow, we were *so* early"".",cryptocurrency

investing,Gold Has Best Week Since October on U.S. Payrolls Shock,"Gold was headed on Friday for its best week since October as a shockingly low U.S. payrolls number for last month, coupled with the yellow metal’s belated catch up to inflationary trends, put it on a course to a weekly gain of 3.5%.

Price-wise, gold was nearing peaks last seen 12 weeks ago, closing in on the $1,850 per ounce level, that could set up a return to $1,900 and ultimately the $2,000 record highs attained in August.

“Gold’s short-term momentum could make a run towards the $1,857 level, which could be followed by a move towards the $1,925 resistance level,” said Ed Moya, head of research for Americas at online trading platform OANDA.

Benchmark gold futures on New York’s Comex were up $15.45, or 0.9%, to $1,831.15 an ounce by 1:40 PM ET (17:40 GMT). The session high was $1,844.40. For the week, gold futures showed a 3.2% gain, the highest since the week ended Oct. 29.

The spot price of gold rose by $15.36, or 0.9%, to $1,830.54, after a peak at $1,843.36. For the week, spot gold printed a much higher gain of 3.5%.

Traders and fund managers sometimes decide on the direction for gold by looking at the spot price — which reflects bullion for prompt delivery — instead of futures.

“Gold appears poised to hit $1,850 which will be the 200-Day Simple Moving Average,” said Sunil Kumar Dixit of D.K. Dixit Charting in Kolkata, India. “From there, it could head up to $1,877, which would mark as a 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the move from the $2,075 record high to lows of $1,676.”

After months of anemic prices, gold suddenly broke out on Thursday, playing catch-up to the rally in a horde of commodities from oil to copper, and even coffee, that had reacted to inflationary pressures building since the start of the year.

Friday’s rally in gold came after the Labor Department reported that the U.S. unemployment rate rose to 6.1 percent in April as the country added a sharply lower-than-forecast 266,000 jobs in a pandemic-suppressed market.

The United States lost more than 21 million jobs between March and April 2020, at the height of business lockdowns forced by the coronavirus. More than 8 million of those jobs have not returned, officials say.

Economists had expected as many as 1 million new U.S. jobs for April, building on March's gains of 916,000. That made what the Labor Department reported disappointing to many.

“There's a bit of disbelief around this number,” said economist Adam Button, commenting on a post on ForexLive. “I wonder if this is a game-changer and shifts the conversation towards the Fed's baseline about rates staying very low for a very long time along with only-transitory inflation.”

The Federal Reserve has kept U.S. interest rates at between zero and 0.25% since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic last year, with Chairman Jerome Powell arguing that the rise in price pressures in recent months were temporary trends that would abate over time.

Analysts said while the latest U.S. jobs report itself was a damper for inflation, it nevertheless kept up the theme of monetary accommodation by the Fed, which was positive for gold.

“Gold’s best friend is Fed Chair Powell and other doves that remain committed to the idea that temporary inflation won’t persist,” said OANDA’s Moya.",finance

personalfinance,Understanding car loans?,"A while ago I tried to shop around for a car loan worth around $25,000 and I wanted to pay it off in 4 years. Although I have a good credit score above 750, the best interest rate I could find was 5% since I have never taken out an auto loan before (this was explained by the teller at the credit union that they look at auto credit history as opposed to regular credit history). They also mentioned that the best way to get low interest auto rate loans is to either get a co-signer with a great credit score and a history of paying off auto loans, or simply take out a loan now and pay it off on time. 

Now there is no way I'm ever taking out a 4 year auto loan at 5% interest on a car worth $25k, and I don't want a co-signer. So here's what I plan to do...

I'd like to take out an auto loan for a cheap used car that I can 100% pay for in cash and use it as leverage for the loan, lets say it's a $5,000 car. I know from shopping around that interest rates for used cars are higher than for new, so realistically I'm probably getting a 6% interest rate loan or higher. I take out the loan, and I would immediately pay off half of it therefore shortening the time left on the loan, and then just simply continue making the payments until it's fully paid off. This way I'm not paying too much on interest for the car.

I know there are other things to consider, like will the amount I paid for on this loan reflect the total value of the car at the end? Probably not, but I am ok with that. Do I have the capital to cover the costs of this loan? I absolutely do, I can afford this. My goal is to keep the time spent on this loan short and simple, around a 2 year period.

**So my questions are**

* Will this plan help build my credit score and help me get better interest rate? 
* Are used car loans dangerous territory? 
* Is there a 3rd option here that I don't know about that will help me get better interest rates as someone who has never taken out an auto loan?

CryptoCurrency,BEWARE: Coinbase Fake Email Scam,"https://imgur.com/a/KIDf3Sv

Posting this for awareness. First post was removed due to the auto-bot assuming the images I shared were a meme! Anyway luckily I spotted within a second of opening this email (linked to screenshots of the email via the imugr link above!) that it was a scam, before clicking any links. Now you will know it’s fake too. 

There’s been a huge number of new crypto investors the last 6 months, and so scammers will try and use this lack of experience to their advantage and try and steal your coins. Without testing the email links for obvious reasons, I’d imagine they have “spoofed” the Coinbase login page. So that when you enter your details, they will take copies of them for the criminals to try and break into your account and steal your money.

Other ways to protect against this will be to where possible have 2-factor security on any exchanges you use.

personalfinance,Trapped in a terrible auto loan. Can’t refinance now that I have better credit because car is older than 10 years.,"Just before covid hit I financed a 2009 Acura TL. 

My credit was pretty bad at 540. My previous car motor blew and I needed reliable transportation immediately. I had decent income but not much for savings. 

To justify the 24 percent interest rate I told myself I was getting a quality car. It’s an Acura. It was very very well maintained and only had 82,000 miles. They were asking 10000. My research at the time showed that the same year make and model we’re going for as much as 12-14k with 40-50k more miles. 

If I end up going to full term at this rate I won’t be terribly upset. 

BUT. My credit has rebuilt back up to 660 I have completed a year of on time payments but nobody wants to refinance this thing. The monthly payment is 311 and I have 44 payments left. The monthly payment isn’t too bad but also it isn’t worth 17,000 dollars. I discovered this subreddit a little while ago and have learned that my money can be better utilized if it wasn’t tied up in a 24.99 interest rate. 

I’ve checked three different companies. They won’t refinance because car is more than 10 years old. Is it possible there are banks that do? Do I have any options? Thanks in advance.",finance

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, May 7, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, May 7, 2021**

Keeping up with current volatility, the stock market jumped up today to new records, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) reaching fresh intraday records, driven higher by a swift reversal to the upside by tech-stocks. Market participants continue to digest corporate earnings reports and the disappointing April Jobs Report, which showed the US economy added fewer jobs than expected even despite the easing of social distancing guidelines. 

The Labor Department showed that the US only brought back 266,000 jobs for the month of April, far less than the gain of at least 1 million that was originally expected and a big deceleration from the numbers seen in March. The unemployment rate unexpectedly increased to 6.1%, widening further from its pre-pandemic level of 3.5%. 

This new economic data serves to bolster the argument that monetary officials have been making that, despite significant progress, the labor market remains well below pre-pandemic levels and that more support from the Central Bank is needed to bolster the momentum of the recovery. Altogether, the US remains roughly 8.2 million jobs short compared to pre-pandemic levels, and both the unemployment rate and labor force participation remains well below January 2020.

In the past, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has suggested the Central Bank wants to see a “string” of strong labor market gains totalling more than 1 million before any adjustment to the current policy is made. With the April report disappointing, it appeared the labor market remains far below the Central Bank targets, meaning it is unlikely to change its current accommodative policy anytime soon.

Seema Shah, Chief Strategist at Principal Global Investors said, “The smaller rise in payrolls should at least assuage some concerns around the Fed policy outlook. As we have heard several times in recent days, even a very strong jobs number wouldn’t have caused the committee to formally discuss changing the pace of bond purchases, so today’s number certainly won’t be giving the Fed cause for concern. They will be in no rush to bring forward tapering plans.""

We are trying to put as much into retirement as possible and are wondering what our best options would be for a mortgage. We have no debt but 3k on our car.

Since were going with investments instead of paying off the mortgage early then shouldn't we go with what allows us to put the most into investments (hence the lowest monthly payments option would be best)? Or should we choose a different option?

personalfinance,Student loan repayment strategy,"Currently a junior in college and trying to optimize my loan repayment strategy before I have to start paying. I have \~$15k in federal loans at 5-5.25%. FICO \~750, but if I pay off some interest on the loans I can probably raise it to 770-800 before I graduate. I expect to have a mid-high 5-figure signing bonus when I graduate based on my current career trajectory+return job offers. I see 3 options:

1. Pay the minimum and toss the money that would've been used to repay into the market. High yield (junk) muni bonds, EM debt, whatever is decently safe from substantial loss of principal and yields enough to pay the interest. If the Democrats ever cancel student debt without means testing, this is a win. If they cancel with means testing it's a loss since I probably won't qualify. I'm fairly confident the federal government won't allow any city to default in the current political environment. The 2018 tax cut allowed 10k in gains of 529 plans to be used towards student loan repayments tax-free and interest paid on student loans is tax deductible, so tossing the money into the market would reduce my taxable income from what I can tell.
2. Pay it all off when I graduate. Probably what most people would recommend off the bat, but I'm not sure if this leaves potential gains on the table and the chance at making $15k from forgiveness is definitely not something I feel can just be ignored.
3. Refinance to private loan and toss money into the market. I think with my FICO I can probably get a 2.6-2.9% rate, which is low enough that paying the minimum makes sense. Not sure whether private loans would end up qualifying for debt cancellation, especially since the interest cancellation from COVID only applied to federal loans.

Obviously a lot here is speculative and hinges on how well very liberal Democrats do in elections, but what do you guys think of my reasoning?",finance

CryptoCurrency,Crypto is the best investment for your future,"Yes Crypto really is the best investment you can make.

With how shit interest rates are with the scumbag banks it is literally pointless putting money in a savings account. Plus the world is waking up to the shit banks/investment companies pull.

**PLEASE** bear in mind there is a  risk that the crypto project you invest in will not succeed. There are thousands of blockchain projects, and competition is fierce. Regulators could also crack down on the entire crypto industry if more governments begin to view cryptocurrencies as a threat rather than just an innovative technology ( IMO it is already too big for this but it is a possibility ) This is the risk you take in any investment. 

The plan I am currently employing is to put as much as I can every month in to crypto ideally I would love to be paid in crypto but not a possibility yet.  The to hold for ** minimum ** 5 years but looking to more likely be 10 then consider selling. People are constantly trying to get a quick win it may well happen but it is rare you need to be realistic. 

**Other Tips:**

**Never**

Tell anyone how much crypto you have cause.. you will be targeted by scammers imo don’t even tell family and friends makes life easier.

Don’t keep your crypto on an Exchange  unless you don’t trust yourself but if that exchange goes down your crypto is too!  Get your self a Ledger device  off load the crypto and put your mind at rest.

Ideally you want to have a device you only use for crypto ( never used for anything else not even email ) if this is not something you can do make sure to update your machine  for security patches also  virus scan daily if not weekly scans and install various anti virus softwares as they help cover the gaps some virus scanners miss.
Make sure to use 2FA **DO NOT USE TEXT**as this can be spoofed by hackers always make sure you are using an app such as google authenticator.

Cover all areas of research before you invest. 
  * what is the purpose of the crypto?
  * what is the marketcap of the crypto?
  * look at the plans for the future
  * go directly to the their website just to make sure all looks legit.
—-
 
Use a well known exchange to purchase crypto I recommend :

* Binance 
* Binance US ( if in US)
* Kraken 
* Gemini 
* Coinbase ( make sure it is pro)

I don’t really use anything else and these are well established in the industry.

——
Set an end goal... some people call it “ your moon” but what is your purpose you need an end route out if this.

Finally I hope you become prosperous on your endeavours and if you are a noob to crypto I am more than happy to answer any questions.

CryptoCurrency,Central Bank Digital Currencies: the new crypto-killers?,"# TLDR 

Though at first glance CBDCs and cryptocurrencies seem interchangeable, the two are strikingly different both in ethos and design. Cryptocurrencies were founded on the idea of decentralization, privacy, and inclusion. CBDCs are under centralized ownership by the government, traceable (but so are most cryptos), and are inclusive only within the realms of the government’s chosen boundaries. 

While crypto empowers individuals to take control of their own finances and creates new boundaries of financial privacy, CBDCs do not deviate too far from the status quo except for the central bank’s increased presence in the financial system.

The sector most at risk is commercial banking, who currently perform the function of intermediary between central banks and private citizens. CBDCs would disrupt this dynamic, granting central banks direct monetary influence over citizens.

\*\*

# Why have I written this absurdly long post?

Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are the next big thing, with governments scrambling to test and assess all kins of different types. Before i did any reading on the subject, i was a bit confused about them and the perceived threats to my bags.

So i thought i'd conduct a mini SWOT analysis and deep dive into what they are, what (and who) they're good and bad for, and how they might impact our cherished shitcoins.

All credit to this [Kraken report on CBDCs,](https://blog.kraken.com/post/8688/cbdcs-preparing-for-central-bank-digital-currencies/) which i read end to end and have shamelessly plagiarised.

Here we go.

# Introduction

**CBDCs are digital currencies proposed and issued by the central bank of a sovereign country.** Generally, they take on a digital form of the nation’s existing fiat currency. While the concept of CBDCs was inspired by cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, the ethos of CBDCs show a stark contrast from the ethos of cryptocurrencies in that they are issued by the state as a centralised form of digital money.

**Retail CBDCs,** or ""general purpose CBDCs"", refer to digitised fiat money that will be used as a mode of payment or legal tender for wider retail transactions by a broader group of people, like citizens and corporations. 

**Wholesale CBDCs** are for restricted groups, such as financial institutions that hold reserves with a central bank. The purpose of wholesale CBDCs is to facilitate efficient value transfer between a sender and a receiver without the need for intermediaries, especially in transactions involving securities and derivatives. 

Many countries are exploring CBDCs for their merit with both retail and wholesale digital tokens.

# What and who are CBDCs good for?

Retail CBDCs may help overcome the limitations of national payment systems and act as a convenient and affordable payment method of transferring funds across accounts held at different Payment Service Providers (PSPs), while reducing the costs and inefficiencies associated with low interoperability.

Retail would be able to update their CBDC balance directly with the central bank. Essentially, CBDCs could be interoperable with private sector retail payment platforms while the central bank assumes the role of settlement and record of change. This seamless integration of CBDCs into existing payment systems could lead to mass adoption of the digital currency, depending on the popularity of chosen retail payment platforms. 

CBDCs could also provide governments the ability to track or trace transactions effectively and provide real-time updates of economic activity within a given jurisdiction; payment systems could also operate seamlessly and efficiently while offering near-instant settlements at lower costs. 

All opportunities that are too appealing for central banks to ignore. 

# So are CBDCs crypto-killers? 

Probably not. 

Let's take Bitcoin as an example. Despite it's volatility, it's been increasingly seen as a hedge against inflation, a store of value and a long-term high appreciating asset. 

In countries experiencing rampant hyperinflation, people are flocking to Bitcoin in an effort to mitigate the devaluation of their fiat currency. Since CBDCs are governed by a central bank and are likely to be subject to the same restrictions imposed by governments as fiat, they will be unable to become a store of value or a means for transferring money internationally for those facing such economic instability. Cryptocurrencies in general still have powerful and attractive attributes that central banks would never dream of incorporating in their CBDCs (e.g. trustless &amp;amp; permissionless P2P exchange, capped supplies, privacy etc.)

**However, stablecoins are a different story altogether.** 

Fiat-pegged stablecoins retain their value because the holder trusts that the issuer owns the fiat that they claim to be backing the stablecoin, and in enough quantities. This means that CBDCs will directly compete with fiat-pegged stablecoins. With DeFi, stablecoins offer returns to investors that people holding CBDCs will only dream of; however, CBDCs won’t come with the regulatory scrutiny and pressure of fiat-pegged stablecoins. 

There's clearly a potential conflict to come. Indeed, President of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, has stated that stablecoins, particularly those owned and issued by big tech firms, [pose serious risks](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/inter/date/2020/html/ecb.in201130~ce64cb35a3.en.html):

&amp;gt;""if widely adopted, they could threaten financial stability and monetary sovereignty.

She added that 

&amp;gt;""using stablecoins as a store of value could trigger a large shift of bank deposits to stablecoins, which may have an impact on banks’ operations and the transmission of monetary policy.” 

This means CBDCs may not be a simple ""nice to have"" for nation states, but vital for national security to combat external threats inherent in the new future of money.

It's clear that whatever happens, CBDCs are a game changer. Many people will choose CBDCs over (or alongside) crypto, even if they recognise the former as inferior, simply because they'll feel safer: stable, legal tender. 

Domestically, governments could use CBDCs as a monetary-policy tool, where stimulus can be directly delivered to individuals. With CBDCs, central banks can assume the role of a provider and act on behalf of the government to provide funds, which would theoretically give the central bank greater and quicker control over economic activity, especially in times of financial crisis. Because CBDCs would theoretically reach anyone with an e-wallet, they would allow for an efficient and widespread transfer of money even to those who may have historically been unable to benefit from such payments or who have not been able participate in the traditional banking system. With greater transparency in payments, central banks would aid governments in providing targeted relief to select areas or people groups. Direct payment using CBDCs could also resolve some of the current existing inefficiencies (and corruption) with emergency payments or stimulus checks from governments.

The cheaper, frictionless movement of money would be even more welcomed on an international level, if CBDCs become interoperable and allow people to make low-cost transactions on a real-time basis across countries and e-currencies. Traditionally, cross-border transactions rarely go directly from sender to receiver and instead rely on several intermediaries and transactional accounts to facilitate the transfer, which is slow and expensive. With CBDCs, transfers could go through wallets directly from sender to receiver seamlessly and at little-to-no cost.

In addition to the simplification of cross border payments, interoperability of CBDCs, or multi-CBDC arrangements, could tackle friction between banking systems, such as differences in opening hours, communication standards, exchange rates, and fees.

Ripple are laser-focused on international interoperability between currencies and have been [piloting a private ledger for central banks to test and launch CBDCs.](https://ripple.com/insights/ripple-pilots-a-private-ledger-for-central-banks-launching-cbdcs/) They've even released a [white paper on the future of CBDCs](https://ripple.com/lp/cbdc-whitepaper/), that provides Central Banks with a framework for implementing CBDCs and guidance for ensuring global interoperability. The good news for Ripple is that it's unlikely that any one government or central bank would make their own internationally interoperable CBDC, since that would invite regulatory complexities involving the application of banking and payment laws, data privacy laws, and the relationship between law and a country's ability to affect monetary policy domestically and across borders. Furthermore, nations that restrict the inflow and outflow of its national currency with strict capital controls make international transactions via CBDCs highly unlikely. All of which present Ripple and xrp with an opportunity to be that international intermediary - however, it's anyone's guess whether Ripple will be successful and what impact that would have on the price of xrp.

# So who should be freaking out?

To my mind the sector most at risk isn't crypto, it's commercial banking. If a large number of people flock to CBDCs and choose to store their wealth in these digital assets, the commercial banking sector or other deposit collecting institutions could see their balance sheets shrink as bank account deposits shrink.

And in times of crises, it’s possible to see a further run on bank deposits as individuals will be incentivised to flock and hold onto “risk-free” CBDCs and further undermine the commercial banking sector. For example, Such risks *could* be mitigated by paying interest on CBDC holdings at a lower rate than the rate paid on commercial bank reserves at central banks, or by imposing limits on the amount of CBDCs that can be held by individuals and firms. Clearly, central banks and commercial banks are on the same side, so it's likely that central banks would introduce CBDCs in a way that either didn't compete with commercial banks, or allowed banks to adapt to the new normal and not become redundant. 

# Conclusion

CBDCs and cryptocurrencies clearly serve very different purposes, which is why I believe the two will coexist. In fact, CBDCs could lead to a wider adoption of cryptocurrencies, as CBDCs familiarise the average person with the idea of a digital money and the corresponding ecosystem, including digital wallets; and also raise new challenges that could be addressed by cryptos (e.g. Ripple, xrp and CBDC interoperability). The rollout and wide usage of a CBDC could also have a knock-on effect with businesses, increasing the number of retailers or merchants equipped with the infrastructure to accept and handle payment methods in the form of cryptocurrencies.

personalfinance,Drowning in Debt - Need Help With A Plan to get out,"Hi r/personalfinance,

So I 26M am drowning in debt due to poor choices. I borrowed for nearly 3 years of my undergrad education. 

I need a plan to get out. I asked my dad if I could move back in with him and pay a small portion of rent but he told me no and to figure it out. So I'm on my own.

With student loan forgiveness unlikely I need a plan to get out and find a career that I enjoy.

Here is my financial situation -

Sales Job: $1800 per month after tax + commission.

Side hustle: $200-$400 per month. I post ads and pickup used/damaged electronics and then flip them on the internet.

Savings / Retirement: 

Vanguard Roth IRA - $2980

Wealthfront Savings / EF : $4090 

Checking: $2600 

Expenses: 

Rent - $800 per month

Utilities - $100 per month

Food - $150-$200 per month

Amazon Prime - $12.99 per month 

Spotify - $9.99 per month

Gym membership - $29 per month

Health insurance through my work  - $70 per month

Car insurance - $139 per month 

Gas: $200 per month - commuting in a fuel-inefficient vehicle.

Debt: 

Car - 2007 Nissan Frontier Nismo with 100k miles financed at 3.29% apr. I owe $8100 on it. 

Nelnet Student loans - 

$23,452.71 @ 6.41% apr

$3,075 @  7.21% apr 

Fed Loan Student Loans - 

$23,846.93 spread across 4 loans with varying interest rates from 2-5%. I've never paid on these since I graduated 4 years ago. 

Credit cards: I have two of them put I pay them off every month so $0

Total Debt: $58, 474.64

On top of all of this, I hate sales and I want to go back to school for something else. Something that pays me a good wage and that I get some sort of career satisfaction from. I'm thinking nursing through my local community college.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm drowning and scared for the future. One mistake and I could end up homeless. 

I know that if I make a plan I can get out of this and live a good life. 

The local hospital is offering a CNA training program which is 4 weeks and then you start working as a CNA at anywhere from $16-$19 per hour. 

If you guys could give me some advice on how to dig myself out that would be awesome.

personalfinance,Better to upgrade house in a buyer's market or a seller's market?,"Been thinking about this for a while, but hoping you can lend your expertise here.

If you wanted to upgrade to a nicer house, would you prefer to buy and sell in a buyer's market or a seller's market?  Assume price of house is doubling, so $300k to $600k, and there's no time pressure to move now. Also planning on living in the new house for long term, at least 10+ years and likely the full period of the mortgage.

My gut reaction is it's better in a buyer's market because you would lose equity in your current house (let's assume 10% or $30k) but end up with more than that off the mortgage in the larger (also 10% or 60k).  Would generally lower rates in a seller's market offset that?

Upgrading in Buyer's market:

* Less equity but even more off mortgage on new house
* Higher interest rates? 
* Easy to buy, hard to sell.  Think that's generally a positive?

Upgrading in Seller's market:

* More equity from current but new house will likely grow even more
* Lower interest rates? &lt;- is this the most important point over the length of a mortgage?  Or would it not matter because you can always refinance if an extremely low rate comes along.
* Hard to buy, easy to sell

Safe to say it's worth more than $5 usd now. So there are two questions. First, I have not done my own taxes (dad did it all for me, I just had to sign paperwork) until this year. I doubt he listed it as an asset. Doing my own taxes this year I saw the cryptocurrency question but answered no because honestly I was still ignoring/nearly-forgetting I had any. Will this come back to bite me or is this something that I can claim next year with relatively no issues aside from possible back taxes?

Fedloan of course doesn't accept bitcoin directly, but if anyone else out there has used it to pay off federal loans, how did you go about it?

personalfinance,I regret buying my car!! Any advice???,"Let me try to make this simple:

I love driving my car. It's the best car I've ever driven. I drive everyday and I wanted a car that would last me a decade of daily driving.

However, I really do think I made a mistake with buying such a new car.

I bought the car 1 year ago. 2013 prius with 88k miles on it. Good condition.

Total cost after fees and taxes: WHOPPING $11,200. This is where I think I went horribly wrong.

I put around 3k money down for a down payment and got a bank loan for about 8k for the rest.

The interest rate on it: WHOPPING 5%. But the reason I keep the debt is because I have assets that outpace the interest rate.

I'm paying $240 a month for 36 months. Which is 3 years. Since it's been a year, I have 24 months left.

But the thing is: I ONLY MAKE $1,000 A MONTH. I bought a car WAYYY out of my budget.

My car payment is 25% OF MY TOTAL MONTHLY INCOME.

If I had bought an older 2009 prius with more miles or something I'm pretty sure I could've EASILY AVOIDED THIS MESS.

As of right now: I owe a little bit under $6k left on the car loan. I have about $60k saved but I don't want to get rid of the debt. Should I get rid of the debt?

The only reason I want to get rid of the debt is because the loan is 25% OF MY MONTHLY INCOME. But at the same time I want to keep the debt because my particular asset has outpaced the 5% interest rate consistently over the past year.

Should I sell the car? It's now at 110k miles. Would it be worth the time and money to sell the 2013 prius and hunt for a 2009 or below prius? Or in terms of practicality, do you think the 2013 prius would last longer and have a longer life span?

Did i overpay for the car? Did I get scammed? How was I so foolish to fall for such a trap?

The monthly minimum payment is $224 so I pay $112. The loan it self is about $11,800, so it will not be paid off in full for 5 years. So currently I am in $11,400 in debt when it is added all together. 

As of right now I am not sure how much my next school year will cost. I have a job on campus to cover my housing fees and because I am a low income student, I am expecting to receive a decent amount in federal/state grant money but because I do not receive the bill from the school until mid-july I am just left with trying to guestimate how much money I'll have to pay.  My goal is to avoid taking out any more loans the next three years. 

I also have a credit card but i only use a max of $250 of it month to pay for food or gas. I pay it off fully each month to help establish a good line of credit. 

I do not currently have a job or a job planned for over the summer (but I want to try and break into door dashing or Uber eats) I have $4,000 in my savings with another $1400 check that I need to cash. (I received the stimulus check late and haven't had the chance to cash it yet). 

I'm trying to make some educated moves since I know that I'm in a bit of precarious situation but I feel like I could use some fresh eyes to help me reevaluate everything. When making big purchases I always make sure that they are necessities and I can take responsibility of paying them. I am just looking for some suggestions of what else I should be doing right now. I will he applying to a plethora of scholarships over the summer (even though the odds of winning ONE are very slim) and I am planning on trying to find a job to work as well. 

I know I'm at the age where learning the different ways of investment are essential and starting a small retirement fund would help to benefit me in the long run but I am not sure if I am in the financial position to do either of those things. 

Any and all advice are welcome. I know I've made some mistakes in the past but I want to try and move forward with a better grasp of money and financial planning.",finance
dogecoin,Ahead of the curve,"Dear retards

Ahead of the events that will happen today:

Scenario 1: Elon Musk talks openly and positively about $doge. Price goes up, and everyone will sell at $1, dropping the price for a nice buying dip, henceforth the price grows evenly.

Scenario 2: Elon Musk doesn't say anything. Just think on how dangerous it could be for Elon to get into a federal investigation for manipulating the market! Speaking on TV about a commodity is no little business, he could face some serious legal issues! So this scenario is quite possible, and if I had to put my money on what will Elon say, this would be the case.

Scenario 3: Elon tells everyone to calm their anusses on $doge and the price drops.

Whatever happens remember that this started as a meme. Most of us have invested very little and some have been lucky and made some serious $$$$$, DON'T GET CREEDY, remember where you're coming from! $doge was coming from nowhere and now is in the league for the long run. In this community alone we are 1.4m apes! The world is bigger than Elon Musk or whatever other celebrities that support us. I've been saying this from the beginning. Since the first ""Elon Musk supports doge"" meme appeared, WE MUSTN'T PUT ALL OUR EGGS IN ONE BASKET, having his support is nice, but if the price drops, then each of you apes should go forth and buy $10 of doge, or $1 or 50c, whatever you can afford, but we are in a position to make a change ourselves.

personalfinance,Questions about loans and potentially financing a home,"Questions about loans and financing a home

So this may be a semi-long post. I am going to be entering in-state medical school this upcoming August. I have been awarded a generous scholarship that will cover part of my tuition. Since I will not be moving far from home but will be moving out (due to personal reason), I have been thinking that my best option is to buy a townhouse/apartment . I have been looking at 3 bedroom townhouses where I can have two roommates that will rent out the other two rooms. Some questions will follow:
1. One of my best friends wants to go in on a place with me. He is a brother to me, I am lenient though because a. I know it is foolish to ever buy a place with someone that’s not your spouse and b. Due to potential conflicting interests in the future (I want to keep he wants to sell, etc)
2. For the remainder of my tuition for medical school + living expenses, I will be taking out a federal loan. I have already been approved for a federal loan, but my question is whether it would be intelligent to use my federal loan to finance my inevitable loan for a place. My thought process with this is that if I’m going to be using a federal loan to pay for my living, it would be more beneficial to rather buy a place and have renters in my place cover the financing of the home+ potential profit every month. 

If i have been too vague on this post, I will provide more specifics if possible. If anyone can guide me to some resources regarding this topic that would also be appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,How do taxable tax refunds work?,"Suppose that in 2019 you withhold $10k in state taxes, but your state tax liability is only $9k. Also suppose that you itemize, so you deduct state taxes off your federal return.

You get a state refund of $1k in 2020 for the 2019 tax year. As I understand it, that refund is supposed to be taxable in 2020 (reported via 1099-G), to avoid over-deducting money you didn't actually pay. Effectively, you defer the tax on the $1k by one year instead of bypassing tax altogether.

For that to make sense, you'd have to have reduced your 2019 federal income by $10k rather than by the actual liability of $9k. But why? I suppose it's because your $10k in withholding is what's reflected in your W-2. But don't we have all the information we need at the time the federal return is filed, so couldn't we have somehow corrected the deduction to $9k? Is it that federal return numbers feed into state numbers but not vice versa (to avoid cyclic calculations)? And if it were only based on withholding and not actual liability, how do you get credit for the full deduction if you under-withheld?

Finally, what if you itemize but you hit the SALT cap so that the difference between state withholding and state liability doesn't impact your federal return?",finance

Bitcoin,The Basics of Bitcoin,"TLDR or Video version: [https://youtu.be/18lbumfiLw0](https://youtu.be/18lbumfiLw0)

**What is Bitcoin?**

The digital gold, the future of currency, or, simply, the Federal Reserve's nightmare. Bitcoin and its satoshies (essentially, satoshis are to Bitcoin what cents are to a dollar. 1 Bitcoin = 100 Million satoshis = 100 Billion millisats) are the biggest and most established cryptocurrency with a market cap of roughly $1 Trillion. Bitcoin's main use is for peer-to-peer payments, although it's increasingly being used as a store of value (literally think of it like digital gold) and there are better payment-focused cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is based on a blockchain which serves as a decentralised ledger of transactions. Whenever a new block is verified and added to the existing blockchain by miners, that specific lucky miner is rewarded with a specific amount of Bitcoin which happens roughly every ten minutes. When Bitcoin was released, the reward per block was 50 Bitcoins, but right now, it is 6.25 Bitcoins per a verified block and that amount continues to halve every four years with the next halving happening in 2024. To keep it short, I will not get into the details, but there's a lot more to it really.

**Why buy it?**

1. Limited supply unlike gold for example. You can always mine more gold, but there are only 21 Million bitcoins and that's it. Out of those, roughly 18.6-18.7 million have been mined, also known as the circulating supply, which leaves us with roughly 2.3 million Bitcoins unmined although it is projected that it will take another 100 years before they are all mined.
2. One of its best features is that it is unregulated and decentralised so no banks or middlemen are involved in a transaction, purely P2P which ensures anonymity to an extent. Why is that good? Again, unlike gold, the price cannot be enforced. Unlike paper money, no government can decide that they suddenly want to print $3 trillion to ""boost the economy"". (\*Biden, Powell stay in the background\*) This separation from government and other official currencies is why a lot of people are interested in Bitcoin although that applies to most, if not all, cryptos.
3. Diversification. I personally think it makes a lot of sense to have cryptocurrency in your portfolio to negate the effects of inflation, currency devaluation, etc. How much to hold depends on what is your risk tolerance. 
4. Bitcoin is established so it is the cryptocurrency that is least likely to be worth nothing. If you want crypto, but are worried, this is one of the safest choices. A very important feature of Bitcoin is that it is impossible to forge and nobody has been able to hack it, compromise it or interfere with the blockchain so far.

**Why does it go up?**

Two main reasons.

1. Currency devaluation. Only last year, the Federal Reserve printed 20% of all dollars ever! This year, they want to print even more. The more dollars there are in circulation, the less valuable the currency become and the more valuable real or limited supply assets start to be. 
2. Mainstream acceptance. While it's still got a long way to go, it is becoming very much mainstream. One of the most popular companies right now, Tesla, bought a lot of Bitcoins and started accepting them as payment. Other companies include Microsoft, AT&amp;T, Expedia, local branches of Burger King, KFC Canada, Overstock, some Subway branches, Twitch, the Dallas Mavericks, Zynga, etc.

*Honourable mention:* Elon Musk's tweets. Jokes aside, I'd honestly recommend making a twitter account and following some of the influential names in Cryptocurrency like Elon Musk, Michael Saylor, Anthony Pompliano, Scott Melker, the Winklewoss twins (yes, from the Facebook Social Network movie), Brian Armstrong, etc.

**How do you buy it?**

A lot of ways! Binance, Coinbase, eToro, even online banks like Revolut. Whichever way you choose, make sure that you are the one who owns the cryptocurrency, not the broker or platform. Binance and Coinbase are two of the biggest players in the market so most people choose to use them. I personally own my cryptos through eToro, but it's up to you to decide.

Hope that covers the basics (sort of)! There's a lot more to talk about, but I think this is the bare minimum. What do you guys think?",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,Why the world desperately needs CryptoCurrency: The Failure and Corruption of Fiat Money.,"Fiat currency, a system by which a currency only retains its value by “fiat” or decree by a government, leaves a central bank free to create money from thin air, reducing the value of the currency already in circulation. [According to a study of 775 fiat currencies](https://www.dinardirham.com/the-rise-and-fall-of-fiat-currencies/), there is no historical precedence for a fiat currency that has succeeded in holding its value. Every single one of them has failed. And all for a single fundamental reason: Unsound monetary policy i.e. overprinting of the fiat currency to fund deficit spending. This is mind blowing to me. 

The issuers of FIAT money always print more of it in order to try and solve other problems other than just being money. Whether it is printed for social welfare, to pay for wars to bail out banks or to manage markets, we are currently witnessing government issuers of paper money attempting to solve more of the world’s problems with printed money. This inevitably leads to its failure. It gets much more sinister though. Due to [the Cantillion Effect](https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/the-cantillon-effect-why-wall-street), that basically states whoever is closest to the money printer benefits the most from inflation, basically the elites print money and give it out to their rich friends who yield the most benefit from the freshly printed money *before* it gets devalued. Look at what’s happening in Venezuela, Argentina, Zimbabwe, Turkey and so many more places. The Fed printed 40% of all dollars in existence last year. It’s not a question or if inflation is coming, it’s when. This is why we need crypto. No one has centralised control, no one can unfairly manipulate it.

This is why Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin. And this is why he included the message \*“Chancellor on Brink of Second Bailout for Banks”.\* Cryptocurrency solves this age-old problem of allowing the common plebs like us to have a mathematically verifiable technology to preserve our wealth over time.

tl;dr - Fiat currencies are the real shitcoins.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Unpopular Opinion: TurboTax is worth the money,"I've always used TurboTax to do my taxes, and each year I paid \~$150 for Federal &amp; State plans. I've always read on r/personalfinance that it's waste of money, and doing your taxes is easy, yada yada yada.

Welp, I tried using FreeTaxUSA and CreditKarma this year, ultimately returned to TurboTax. 

For what it's worth, I'd say my taxes have medium complexity - Married, each with a W2, 401k, &amp; HSAs. A couple 1099's and a couple K-1s. No dependents or anything crazy. This was my first year filing jointly, with an HSA, or a K-1. 

First of all, turbo tax is by far the most intuitive - It asks you what has changed over the years, and tells you what forms you *should* have. This feature does not exist in either of the other two apps I tried. TurboTax also has an 'import' feature - if you add a few key fields from your W2, it will pull information for the entire document. For 1099's, I could log into my accounts (Charles Schwab, Ameriprise, Marcus). This is a huge time saver - I spent about \~10 hours combined trying to figure out the other two pieces of software, and I was very concerned that I entered something wrong, or forgot to check a box. I spent about 1.5 hours in TurboTax tops, and didn't have these concerns (due to the integrations/import features I mentioned before).

Anyways, all this to say that (1) cheaper isn't always better, and (2) there's something tough to quantify about being confident that your tax return is correct. It was well worth the $150.",finance

personalfinance,Looking to buy a home with my low income. Is this a smart move and is my budget reasonable?,"I'm currently still living at home with my mom, but because of health reasons I've been looking to move out. I dont trust my mom to give me good financial advice so I'm wondering if you all think this is a good decision.

I make about 36k pre-tax per year (1409.80 every 2 weeks) and after taxes, insurance, and 401k (12%) I bring home about 900 per paycheck. For simplicity's sake, I'm just going to say I make 1800 / month and I'll treat the extra paychecks as savings. 

I live in a LCOL area, but a non renter friendly one. At the low end, 1 bedroom apartments are 800 / month not including utilities and with a pet fee (we've had them for years and there's no way I will get rid of them now) so, at the very least, I'd be paying about 1000 per month. Way out of my budget. 

So I was looking to buy a house for no more than 140k, this gets me a 2-3 bedroom starter home even in the current market. With 10% down, 3% interest rate (I have a 800+ FICO according to experian), and taxes/ins I'm estimating a payment of 750. Does this seem correct? I wasn't sure about taxes/ins so I just added about 200. 

My monthly budget would be:

1800 net income

-750 mortgage

-200 utilities (based on our current expenses w wiggle room)

-200 car (gas and ins, I don't currently have a car so this is an estimate. Gas is based on what my mom spends)

-200 groceries + eat out (again LCOL plus I cook a lot)

-100 fun/misc

-15 subscriptions

-20 phone (after Verizon contract ends I plan on switching to mintmobile or similar)

= 315 for savings (95 is for short term sinking funds, 220 will be long term savings and/or investments)

I feel like I won't be saving enough money, but I'm trying to keep in mind that A. I dont really make that much money and B. Im currently saving 700 every paycheck so anything less than this will feel like a failure. 

I am on track with my 401k, Im contributing 12% and my employer matches 2% plus an additional 1080 per year. Currently, I have about 30k in the account.

I've saved up 31k so far. 10k of that is my EF which I won't be touching so this leaves 14k for the down payment (at most) and 7k for closing fees and other costs. Plus I'll be saving an additional 700 every 2 weeks that I delay.

Oh and I forgot to mention that I don't have any debt. I've already paid off my student loans and I have always paid off my credit cards. Also when I buy a car I will be buying used with my savings.

I'm trying to put a lot of thought into this and not be stupid. What do you all think? Am I missing anything? Do you think it's a good idea? I can't forsee myself moving anytime soon and I won't be having any kids, so as long as I find a house I like I definitely think I'll stay long term.",finance

- it's still fun and does not have a community that tell you that you are stupid or makes fun at you for being born in to this world without rich parents. 

- it's ten times faster! 10 times, that's a number ten times greater than 1.Numbers are important. 

- good balance between inflation and deflation makes it a better currency. It's less a threat to the dollar so more likely to be supported by the FED. One of the most important things about Bitcoin is how much governments like it, the more they like it .. the better it is! 

- fees are higher now but not as high as Bitcoin and maxis love paying fees. It's their favorite thing about Bitcoin! Fees mean security! Security means that when you don't receive or make payments and your coins are kept safely by somebody else because withdrawing them is to taxing on the network, well security means that everything will be okay as long as somebody you know has your Bitcoins. With dogecoin everything will be okay. It is  decentralised! Decentralised means that there is security and security means it's very decentralised! 


- It has Elon Musk while Satoshi left. (also Satoshi was a amateur coding noob that did not really know what he was doing and did not even buy a single lambo, while Elon Musk started his own electric lambo company!) 



- BTC has not done 2x in at least 4 months now, while dogecoin does 2x almost every couple of weeks and the markets don't lie of course. 

- It has as 100 billion supply, this number is far greater than 21 million. Almost 5000 times greater! 

- 40% of Tether volume is now flowing in to Dogecoin, anything with the support from Tether will go to the moon!  Support from Tether is essential in the world of Bitcoin. Whoever they are or what exactly they do nobody knows but everybody agrees, you don't talk bad about Tether because then Tether will pump you! 

- You make more money with Dogecoin then with Bitcoin and we are talking REAL MONEY HERE, not just paper gains! Dogecoin has excellent liquidity so if you want that lambo faster than you need REAL money and the fastest way of getting more REAL money is to buy some dogecoin and then hodl it till it's more real money. And unlike the maxi community, the dogecoin community will not excommunicate you for selling.  

- It has merged mining with Litecoin and maxi's love Litecoin. In fact many maxi's only mine litecoin and dogecoin already because of how merged it is.  Litecoin has excellent security otherwise maxis would not mine it or promote it when Bitcoin fees are high. This means dogecoin security is supported by the maxis.  Even Greg Maxwell has said that dogecoin security is much great and very very secure against all kinds of attacks and cats. 

- It has a picture of a cute looking shiba inu, rather than just a B (which stands for adam Back, the real inventor of Bitcoin) 

- When you make more money with dogecoin then the maxis do then they get really angry at you, and that's very entertaining to watch. 

- You are more likely to lose your virginity with a shiba inu on your t-shirt then that B. 

- Dogecoin devs are working on Lightning Woof.

personalfinance,Taxable IRA Distribution Massachusetts,"I’m currently filing my taxes using freetaxusa. I received a 1099-R for $13,000 after a family members death. Code 4. No taxes were taken out. I received a 1099-R from a retirement account of $450 that I did an indirect rollover with so it was Code 1 and in box 2a had the full amount of $450 but I had to change that to $0 on the tax website to make it continue. I changed it because it was a rollover into a Roth IRA so I believe that’s not taxable. Taxes were taken out of the check I received but I added them back. I don’t have any document other than the check image to prove I did an indirect rollover. For 2020 I also contributed $6,000 to the Roth IRA. For my federal return I listed the $6,000 contribution but it didn’t affect my return at all, I believe my income is above the retirement savings credit limit. When I got to the state portion of my filing it asked for my Taxable IRA Distribution and had the $13,000 listed from my federal filing. It had this semi confusing form to calculate what it should be. I believe my taxable amount would be 13000-6000-450=$6500 as I had already paid taxes on the 6000 as it was a Roth contribution and the 450 I had been charged taxes on from it being an indirect rollover.

CryptoCurrency,Question: How will Federal Tax on Cryptocurrency effect the virtual economy ?,"I'm trying to understand-  so it seems that a platform, especially a currency, that is decentralized (or trying to be) from a government and central banking system but that is now Federally taxed is almost a paradox or a step backwards in what we are trying to achieve in crypto - right?

What is a possible outcome for a scenario like this?

Will this have a strong negative effect overall for the future of crypto ?

And lastly, was this expected?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: US Citizen here - sorry shouldve mentioned originally.

Edit 2: This is NOT a question on tax evasion, more an interest for better understanding the atmosphere of cryptocurrency in the US and the technology and what the future looks like for crypto!

cardano,Cardano Rumor Rundown MAY 9 2021,"Hey Everyone!

Let's go....

Newly covered today:

1. There is supposed to be some kind of mid-month update on Plutus.   Charles hinted in a recent update that everything is going really well on that front. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=786mOp2Xq7s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=786mOp2Xq7s)
2. There will be an update on Mithril at the end of the month. You will remember from previous coverage that Mithril is a means to create trustless light wallets via recursive snarks similar to Mina.   ZK-SNARK = zero knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge.   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=786mOp2Xq7s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=786mOp2Xq7s)
3. Charles is setting aside $9MM to be shared by two research labs to be set up: one at University of Edinburgh and one at an undisclosed institution.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=786mOp2Xq7s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=786mOp2Xq7s)
4. Doge Mania might be hitting a new peak (as a cultural artifact at least) last night with Elon’s appearance on SNL.  There are many different perspectives you can take on how this might impact ADA.  I find the following two the most interesting: 1) if the Doge pump is followed by an inevitable crash it could sour a giant group of new adopters on crypto; or 2) it might be a gateway drug that will turn a large group of new adopters on to better projects. [https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1390774840135766019](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1390774840135766019)

Most Recently Covered:

1. The latest roadmap video from Charles covered a lot of ground. We’ll tackle it piece by piece. [https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM](https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM)
2. Ourobouros Omega. Ourobouros Classic 2016 was a “theoretical artifact” that IOHK could build upon. Ourobouros Praos was 2017 and it’s still running now. Ourobouros Genesis was 2018. Ourobouros Omega is going to be the capstone. It will be a rollup of all the previous iterations plus Redux, Chronos, Ledger Combiners, and some things they’ve learned from the larger industry. The paper and a prototype will be this year. We want to be there by Cardano 2025.
3. Light Clients/Wallets (e.g. Yoroi). Great way to get a view on the blockchain through a server. Trouble is that it’s not trustless as to the blockchain since you don’t download it. Protocols currently on the market like Mina are using recursive snarks (“zk-snark” = “Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge”). You can basically have a proof that proves 1) coins exist, and 2) haven’t been double spent with a goal of 22kb of data (very small amount of data). IOHK has been following Mina and “Bulletproofs” (also a type of snark). IOHK will bring out a paper and (hopefully) prototype of the Mithral Protocol this year. It will be a similar trustless model where light wallet is the default and you can still trust the blockchain on the server is correct without downloading the chain.
4. Today will be Part II of the coverage of the latest Roadmap vid from Charles. [https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM](https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM)
5. Sidechains. They call the main chain the “Cardano Settlement Layer” (CSL) and the side chains are called “Cardano Computation Layers” (CCL). They are looking at having CCLs for the EVM, IELE, Catalyst, and WASM (web assembly). They are trying to figure out how to pay for the maintenance of these side chains. A current thought is to possibly create a mechanism where you can “refine” ADA to get “fuel” for these sidechains. You could even have a Plutus side chain that runs on its own fuel. This year they will propose a Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP) to see if the community wants to update the monetary policy in an HFC event to go in this direction. This could be a good way to include the parachain ideas from Polkadot. They could also add Hyperledger related permissioned sidechains with this.
6. Layer Two. A lot of deal flow with Prism right now around digital identify for things like authenticated wallets, KYC/AML, regulated DeFi, and human readable addresses. Charles will probably do a full video on this. Hydra is the other piece of off-chain infrastructure for this year. IOHK has a whole team working on this. They’ve already put out two papers on this. Will put out two more papers this year and a prototype will also be on the way. Hydra will be run by the stake pool operators.
7. “With all this, we’re going to piss all over what ETH 2.0 is trying to accomplish”. I’m paraphrasing slightly, but I almost spit out my coffee when he said this.
8. Quantum Resistance. This will be a big project involving: QR VRF, QR zero knowledge stuff, quantum signatures, and modeling of a quantum adversary. This is a huge amount of work. But this is a whole agenda that is in scope for Cardano 2025.
9. Catalyst &amp; Voltaire. Right now Catalyst is mainly about treasury but it needs to be linked to Voltaire which is all about protocol updates. This will probably mean a bicameral voting model that controls hard fork combinator events.There will be DAO as a service to provide voting rights for your users if you build a dApp or other project on Cardano. They will move from the current plutocracy to something that is hybridized between the current system and “proof of merit”. This is going to require a lot of thinking around the social science behind governance. It will be a more nuanced power dynamic.
10. Approach to the Reference Client.Right now it’s just Haskell, they will probably also build out clients in Python and Rust. Eventually they may have things like Agda, Idris, or Coq at the core. This notion of a “Core Developer” could end up being a digital identity that is authorized through voting.
11. Commercial. On the commercial side they are really going to scale things up to the eight figure level. There’s a lot of good news coming there. Charles says he is reserving that for the Africa Special.
12. Coinbase now has a Cardano Explainer. [https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-cardano](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-cardano)

18. Dewayne Cameron was on Cardano Live. Whether you are interested in DeFi or not, this is likely to be one of the big early Cardano based projects. This interview has all the latest info on Liqwid. Sounds like the alpha testnet will be end of April/early May with three or four core contracts. Rick does a really good job of asking questions that a large spectrum of listeners will be able to relate to and they get into the details of how the contracts will work. At 20:01 Dewayne mentions a “Cardano Dex, or the Dex that IOHK and Emurgo are working on...” Very interesting tidbit there! [https://youtu.be/JhO5iC08xSA](https://youtu.be/JhO5iC08xSA)
19. The Plutus Pioneer program has been open sourced! Lecture #1 has an extremely good explanation of why the EUTxO model in Cardano is so much more conducive to security and much greater predictability than the account balance model in Ethereum.

30. Occam.fi partners with Bitcoin.com as custodian to create an ETH-ADA bridge. According to the article, this will allow for any Cardano native token to seamlessly switch to an ERC-20 token and vice versa. The vice versa part is what the ERC-20 Converter does for us already right?

31. LunarCrush interviewed Charles and he gave us some more details on the Ethiopia deal and Africa: 1) the IOHK office in Ethiopia is merging with the Singularity Net Office (it’ll be 30-50 people...so pretty large presence); 2) Africa special to be announced very soon; 3) they will be doing fintech &amp; govtech, 4) everything on the governance side is going to be upgraded across a wide swathe of African nation states in next ten years, 5) lots of possible use cases including supply chains in agritech, putting land on a ledger, voting, identity, reputation (i.e. credit), &amp; payment systems; 6) Africa is like investing in China in the 1980s; 7) the demographics of Africa make it a really easy call to direct investment there; 8) charles said “Ethiopia, in particular, is very special to us and WE HAVE ACTUALLY CLOSED SOME DEALS...we’ll talk about those at the Africa Special”; 9) there will be security token plays in Africa in the mid 2020s since there are no stock exchanges; and 10) there is a big unannounced partnership called “the DCF” with a brand name consultancy we will recognize.

48. We just experienced a big flash crash in price. A prime suspect is the drop in hash rate in BTC due to the Blackouts in China. Is the crypto space ready to accept that Nakamoto style consensus on PoW leads directly to unacceptable levels of centralization? This has been the dirty secret of PoW crypto and its decentralization loving enthusiasts for years.

49. Charles posted a somewhat cryptic tweet that read “Omega + Hydra + Mithral = GG”. The Ourobors Omega, Ouroboros Hydra, &amp; Mithral parts we’ve covered before. Omega is a capstone rollup of Praos (2017), Genesis (2018), + Redux, +Chronos, +Ledger Combiners, +some other things from the rest of the space. Hydra is layer two. Mithral is trustless light wallets via zk-SNARKs. Guesses as to the “GG” ranged from “Good Game” (as in game over for competitors) to “Goguen”. See today’s video at the link above for more discussion on this. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1383792375860924424](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1383792375860924424)

56. Shahaf Bar-Geffen, CEO of COTI (the first recipient of a Cardano CFund investment), says he just finished recording his segment in the Africa special which he mentioned was airing at the end of April prior to the IOHK announcement of April 29th. He also said: 1) ADA Pay may be ready in early May or maybe even late April; 2) there will be a big launch for ADA Pay and once the Africa Special airs “everything will connect”; 3) “people are probably not getting how big this is….but you will down the line”; 4) COTI integration with a major exchange is happening, progress is not as quick as they would like, but it’s progressing; 5) last week they released the possible designs for debit cards, they are even considering some designs submitted by the community; 6) and iOS and Android integration is coming along nicely and well on the way.

60. Recap from yesterday: the Africa Special Announcements revealed some additional puzzle pieces 1) COTI’s AdaPay is possibly the larger payments infrastructure puzzle piece, 2) [payway.et](https://payway.et/) is possibly the local payments puzzle piece, 3) [yellowcard.io](https://yellowcard.io/) is possibly the local coin exchange puzzle piece, and 4) World Mobile (not mentioned at [africa.cardano.org](https://africa.cardano.org/) AFAIK) may be the network connectivity puzzle piece. I think they are going to connect a lot of disparate pieces for us on the 29th.
61. Once again we are the champions! Not just of github commits this time, but also of total staked asset value. [https://www.stakingrewards.com/](https://www.stakingrewards.com/)
62. Rick interviewed CardStarter which is a Cardano accelerator. The interesting items are 1) it appears they are purporting to somehow insure their community backers against certain financial losses with caveats, 2) they plan to fund projects prior to token launch through token vouchers, and 3) it sounds like they are building a DEX called Card Swap. Notice that the “insurance” comes with caveats. They were very transparent on that point and people should take notice. Is CardStarter good? Is it bad? I have no idea. Watch the interview and form your own opinion. [https://youtu.be/nIklWKtr\_aY](https://youtu.be/nIklWKtr_aY) [https://cardstarter.io/](https://cardstarter.io/)
63. The Cardano Foundation has adjusted its delegation strategy. This brings up a question: where does the balance lie between allowing Adam Smith’s hidden hand to work its free market magic and trying to help small pools?

65. We’ve had really good reporting from the community on World Mobile developments with Cardano. I just want to take a second to thank you guys. Reddit user [/u/ricklepicklemydickle](https://www.reddit.com/user/ricklepicklemydickle/) first alerted us to the World Mobile developments and then youtube user [Whiskey 1234](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyBeEq-paultoA127TYcDjQ) (love both usernames btw) let us know that he attended a conference where he encountered World Mobile and “asked them if they knew about Cardano blockchain and the reply was they were announcing partners at the end of this month.” Thank you very much for this intel guys.This is what Army of Spies is all about. Many thanks for your contributions, gentlemen.

What about the EUTXO model allowing predictable and accurate local calculation of transaction fees in your wallet before you execute? What about a consensus algorithm that’s so good, another top 10 coin made their system derivative of it? That’s all standard these days?

76. Charles does a big interview with Forbes and points out the huge differences between a bonded staking system (ETH) and a liquid staking system (Cardano). This is highly overlooked.

77. Charles also covers his projections about interoperability and the future converging on a “wifi moment” when an interoperable “internet of blockchains” emerges. In this future, it will be a race to the bottom and the systems that are too expensive to operate will simply be priced out of the game.

80. We’re getting reports from Army of Spies member /u/[ ricklepicklemydickle](https://www.reddit.com/user/ricklepicklemydickle) that World Mobile is reporting in its telegram group that it will be dropping some news tomorrow!
81. A new Cardano metrics platform has launched [https://cardanowaves.com/](https://cardanowaves.com/)
82. Today is the Cardano Africa Special. It’ll be at 9:30am Pacific, 10:30am Mountain, 12:30pm Eastern, 5:30pm Dublin, 7:30pm Addis Ababa, 11:30pm Bangkok. 1:30amTokyo. Go enjoy! We’ll recap it after.
83. In today’s video we also cover questions about the relationship between Atala Prism and ADA and who will actually benefit from the Cardano Projects with African governments.
84. The Africa Special made it clear that Cardano has a brilliant grand strategy for the developing world. As framed by John O’Connor this would be: 1) provide digital identity; 2) provide digital transfer of value; and 3) provide programmability of that digital value.
85. Mickey Watkins (CEO of World Mobile) added a step zero to the formula above with: 0) provide access to the digital world.
86. As has previously been mentioned, it was officially announced that Cardano is partnered with World Mobile to provide digital connectivity to people in the developing world starting in Tanzania. They plan to have 100k subscribers in Zanzibar by the end of the year.
87. This is just the beginning in Africa. John O’Connor had a nice tweet that very succinctly laid out some future plans. [https://twitter.com/jjtoconnor/status/1387919060197855234](https://twitter.com/jjtoconnor/status/1387919060197855234)
88. Coindesk editor refuses to acknowledge that Cardano has a deal with a national government, gets relentlessly trolled, then finally capitulates and decides to cover the Ethiopian Ministry of Education project.

89. The Cardano Africa Mini addition gives us more details on the actual rollout of the Ethiopia Ministry of Education deal: 1) all 700k teachers and a subset of the students who will get tablets will be registered in the first year; 2) all secondary school students will be registered in the second year which will bring us to 5MM students; and 3) the data will be used to analyze both students and teachers.

90. If you don’t believe that Atala runs on Cardano please watch this video which lays out definitely and exactly how Atala runs on Cardano. Please feel free to wantonly debunk anyone on the interwebs who says otherwise. Thank you to IOHK technical architect Alexis Hernandez for this video!

91. I don’t know if everyone watched the last few minutes of the Africa Special. But, I think a lot of people missed the section where John O’Connor said the goal of Cardano in Africa is to issue 100 MILLION digital identities in the next two years. To give you some idea of scale here, adapools.org shows a highest ever daily number of new wallets at around 71k. If we onboard 100 Million people via digital identity over two years that would be 136,986 people per day. ETH only has 150MM unique wallets to date. [https://youtu.be/yRjj662kJsk?t=8615](https://youtu.be/yRjj662kJsk?t=8615) [https://adapools.org/analysis-query/wallets](https://adapools.org/analysis-query/wallets) [https://etherscan.io/chart/address](https://etherscan.io/chart/address)
92. John also mentioned that all of the 100k subscribers to World Mobile in Zanzibar this year will have digital identities on Atala Prism. They will also be offering so-called “RealFi” loans by Q1 of next year that will be made via Cardano liquidity and will act as a bridge to real world value. [https://youtu.be/yRjj662kJsk?t=8628](https://youtu.be/yRjj662kJsk?t=8628)
93. Charlie Munger thinks crypto is “disgusting”. That’s a wonderful thing because it tells you how early you are. This is especially true in Cardano which is a project that leads with empathy for the developing world. Will he still call that disgusting if we’ve brought financial inclusiveness to an entire continent in five or ten years. Probably he won’t say anything because he won’t have lived that long. But, you get the point.

94. The state authorities in Wyoming are so far ahead of the curve it’s scary. Now they’re putting aside $4 million for staking. On the private side, Caitlin Long should be declared a state treasure for making a lot of this happen.

personalfinance,Paying off student loan debt lowered FICO score by 45 points; why is this and how to fix it?,"Between Feb 2020 April of 2021 I paid off my remaining student loan debt ($71k). My score ranged from an 790-810 before doing so and recently dropped to a 755 after doing so. 

My guess is that 40+ open accounts technically closed out after paying them off. My first thought to fix this was to open more credit cards, etc. to offset that.

I'm planning on buying a house in a competitive sellers market in 6-months and would like to be able to plan for an 800+ FICO score when getting approved for a home loan to take advantage of the lowest interest rate. Curious if anyone has any insight here that would help.",finance
CryptoCurrency,"Get mad with it or go mad for it, Dogecoin wants us to be conflicted. Whether you find it more cryptic than crypto, being populist and polarising is it’s use value and purpose. All you have to do is reverse it.","Not having got in on Dogecoin, at a timely moment, is maddening to some, while others capitulated and did so lately, or are still avoiding it altogether. 

But it is hard to pick berries while riding a high horse. 
 
You might think you’re sensible and analytical - I work in museums, and I do. Might be ‘dismayed’ by the casino mentality, upset by blazen stupidly of Doge investors, nannying or genuinely empathetic around risk and future losses of the unwitting, or mad about the defiance of ‘fundamentals’ and what’s perceived as the underserved win, and it would be a cold day.. etc etc, when might stoop so low as to buy Dogecoin anyway, apparently. So there’s that.

You may have simply embraced it.
Yet clearly ‘intangibles’ are key to Doges success, yet some refuse to accept that. Instead they reward what’s considered technical over behavioural sciences in a relationship that’s quintoxic and symbiotic, as much as idiotic or toxic. The latter we don’t want or need, while the former is compelling. 
And seems worth looking at. 

Dogecoin’s current success pits it against market fundamentals. But the fundamentals do exist and can be seen. Ask about market cap in comments. Some say they’re not operating in the way others say they’re supposed to. This makes getting upset about Doge, like being all mad at Coke - CocaCola Amatil for being OK at marketing while having little, to no, nutritional value. 

And that may not be to your taste or meet ethical standards, but their successes, can’t be denied.

Nor can the power of a meme.
As Dogecoin seems to come down to matters of feel good factor and brand values, more than fundamentals, of course.

Refusing to grant that success can lay at least a large part it’s foundations in human psychology and behavioural drives, seems as silly as the daftness credited to Dogecoin investors themselves. Yes fundamentals and historic moment in time, apply but that is not all.

You could see it as clever, or a damning indictment, but Dogecoin has managed to occupy the space where the investor revels in a conflicted position, winning and losing being as easily embraced as the same sides of the coin.

Further more Doge offers 
1. the Perception of Affordability, as much as value for it.
Little to lose, but a lot to get, at low unit price. Noting I say, ‘perception of’.

2 Accessibility and Strong sense of Community, all in on same joke and opportunity.

3 Brand is Less Perceived Risk and More Fun, as much joke as an investment. 

4 An investor is supposed to know they would, or could fail, all along. 

So we get good humoured uptake, we cannot take too seriously.

Clearly where there’s less fear of peer judgement, there’s less regret, less shame and blame if you fail, too. Failure culture is a thing.

Perhaps that makes Dogecoin seem = no false promises! Vs other Crypto

Because if the investment doesn’t pay off, the joke does.

And if it goes well, investors get a bonus! Ka-ching plus lol.

Yet many people are still crying... why should Dogecoin succeed, it’s a meme for heavens sake, surely in a sane and rational world it wouldn’t? Yes it’s shallow, how infuriating. 

Then Dogecoin gets to rubs a bit more salt in the wound.
It gets to proves it’s own joke and value as one. The world isn’t rational, so in a bull market you get to enjoy a rise - literally and figuratively, with Dogecoin! Doge doubles down for the win!

If it does not do well, Doge brand says hey! we’re lighthearted, you were definitely forewarned, no point being filled with sense of dread if your investment in a joke meme, ups and tanks. Take it easy for a change. What a relief in this fraught [crypto and COVID] world. What’s a little kidding around?

What’s your come back or recourse going to be? ... because IRL the ‘just joking’ defence - wrong or right, is commonly accepted. It might not be right, but it is a fact that so many people get away with ‘just joking’!, especially when they shouldn’t.

And we observe we’ve seen volatility at a historic moment in time, out of C19, with a bit of stimulus, when people are looking for lightness and fun.

Sharing in a symbolic, commonly held joke is pretty advantageous, without much downside side risk reputationally, and that is really what Elon is actually trading on! 

With so little blow back or blame landing on brand and lack of negative responses, means less bad feedback. So far.

With Doges brand currently being so well known, it encompasses both iconic ‘winner’ and ironic ‘loser’, allowing the investor to hold mutually conflicted positions in their hearts and minds. 

It is not all about winning, some of the investment must represent the (meme or cosmic) joke. Life/death. Timing. You cannot choose when you get born. C’est la vie! Like much of life, we must let it be serious fun.

And how do you control when you ‘die’ or your investment tanks. Dogecoin investors get called ‘stupid’ and resented by those who stick to Crypto principles of respecting fundementals. It’s classic for Doge investors to be considered ignorant rather than insightful, by sticklers or those sitting on the fence siding with fundamentals first, who consider this a matters of principle and ethics first. 

But.. Winners are grinners. While losers are sore. And salty.
So salty. Crying in their cola. 

So there’s the POV Dogecoin represents the great divide and both sides of it. Like two party politics, humane/wonk, Whale/Ape, junk food/health food etc. and this is where we approach it’s true value and purpose.

* Finally you say Tomato, I say Tomatae, and yes Doge may be all flippy dippy rocket moons, but that’s not necessarily sustainable and when, or if, it dumps, these perceptions will invert in future.

* **And actually... the real rub here on Crypto is probably that Dogecoin is too close to Fiat, in how it operates. Printing machine goes bbbrrrrrrrr.

* Perhaps that is really why it is is so divisive in a Crypto world? So comes back to Crypto vs Fiat, where Doge stands in for Fiat here.**

Rejecting products powered by psychological insights and which succeed by exploiting that, is like willingly choosing to be blindsided and ignoring common realities - you choose to do so at your own risk and may lose out by doing so, but you will - at least - be embodying your own healthier, value system and adherence to a sensible investment strategy. 

Now,.. that is not a ‘fair/unfair’! matter but a conscious choice. And you win, by living your truth. But people act like it is not fair, and get all emotional, which is understandable.

I grant totally may have misjudged or left matters out in this commentary, I’d be pleased to be set to rights, thanks for your generosity. And while noting things in line with fundamentals after all, this sub leans into technical and rewards it, there’s great intel elsewhere round here. For instance understanding it’s market cap is key. So best best is to combine that with, the not very, oh wow secret of behaviour and cultural sciences, as much as tech ones. Elon’s using that. (Some say to rile Zuckerberg : )

This makes it entertaining, funny, intriguing, lighthearted, ironic, popularist + polarising, flippy, divisive, controversial, topical and newsworthy. 

As Dogecoin tech data aligns with intangibles, it is confounding.. as even it’s fundamentals are polarising - being the flip side of what they ‘should be’.

In this lies it true use value. 
TLDR: Being mad, for it or against, does not make sense.  Once it’s core purposes: entertainment and controversy, decline, it loses utility, and fortune reverses. Is it worth it? Let me work it.
Ti esrever dna ti pilf nwod gnaht ym tup i

And no, I have not bought Doge, so jokes on me! But in order to find market and moment come together, aligning cultural with technical analysis, is key. Good work, everyone, who contributes to that!",cryptocurrency

Who said: ""Two vast and trunkless paws of stone  
Stand in the desert. Near them, on the sand,  
Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose ears,  
And wrinkled muzzle, and snarl of cold command,

Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,  
The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed:  
And on the pedestal these words appear:'

Look on my gains, ye Mighty, and despair!'

Bitcoin,I just need to vent,"I was a huge bitcoin sceptical. I followed what major ""economists"" said regarding bitcoin. ""it's too volatile"", ""there's no value in it"", ""it's made for traffickers and criminals"", ""it will crash and people will lose their money"". I swallowed media and assumed I was right thinking this bs. Heck, all those statements not only were wrong, but they were also unfounded by people who literally don't know shit. Big mouths.

I forgot about bitcoin until I started to dig, out of curiosity about how Ethereum works, and the whole thing about Blockchain in general, then Bitcoin, and lately I just read Satoshi's paper on Bitcoin.

Right now, everything looks so well put together that it's hard for me to believe that this wasn't planned. Bitcoin's limited supply will just shield it from the Fed printing money - if this policy has any consequences, which I wouldn't be surprised.

# **Inflation is the big challenge for markets and the Fed in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/07/inflation-is-the-big-challenge-for-markets-and-the-fed-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; After April’s disappointing jobs report, market focus will shift squarely to inflation in the week ahead.
*****
&gt; The tug-of-war over tech stocks will also continue to be a dominant force in the stock market, after Friday’s bounce more than halved the week’s losses in the S&amp;P technology sector.
*****
&gt; The April employment report was extremely disappointing with just 266,000 jobs created, well below the 1 million expected. The Friday report cast doubt on the expectations of some investors that the Fed will move toward paring back its so-called quantitative easing bond purchases later this year.
*****
&gt; The thinking is if the inflation data appears hot when the consumer price index is reported Wednesday, it could ignite the debate about whether the Fed will have to tighten policy sooner than it would like. For now, the market is viewing the April jobs data as a distorted one-off report.
*****
&gt; “It’s all about the inflation numbers. It’s all about the transitory nature and to what extent we’ll see it,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group “It’s more relevant to the CPI month-over-month changes. If the month-over-month gains are starting to pick up steam, and we’re seeing 0.3% to 0.4%, that’s not transitory and that’s a problem for the Fed.”
*****
&gt; Economists expect April CPI to rise 0.2% over March, after a gain of 0.6% the month earlier. But on a year-over-year basis, CPI is expected to look sizzling, jumping 3.6%, according to Dow Jones. That compares to 2.6% the month earlier. Excluding food and fuel, CPI is expected to rise by 0.3% on a month-over-month basis.
*****
&gt; The central bank has maintained that the pop in inflation is expected to be transitory.
*****
&gt; Multiple Fed speakers are on the calendar, including Vice Chairman Richard Clarida, who speaks a half-hour after the CPI print Wednesday. Other officials speaking include Federal Reserve Board Governor Lael Brainard, New York President John Williams and Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan.
*****
&gt; The producer price index is reported Thursday, and that should confirm a trend of higher prices that is showing up in corporate earnings releases. Another important data point, retail sales is released Friday.
*****
&gt; Boockvar said the retail sales report is not as important since it has been artificially boosted by one-time stimulus checks.
*****
&gt; “It’s like the steroid era of baseball,” he said. “Who knows how many home runs it would have hit without stimulus.”
*****
&gt; # Tech battleground
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 and Dow finished the past week with gains. The S&amp;P rose 1.2% to 4,232, and 2.7% to 34,777. But the technology-laden Nasdaq fell about 1.5% to 13,752, even with Friday’s 0.9% gain.
*****
&gt; In the commodities market, fears of inflation continued to build.
*****
&gt; Copper futures hit a record high, as did lumber futures, rising 13% in the past week. Corn futures rose 8.6% in the past week, finishing at the highest level since 2013.
*****
&gt; West Texas Intermediate crude futures gained 2% to $64.90 per barrel.
*****
&gt; The 10-year note yield, which moves opposite price, was at 1.55%, down from 1.63% a week ago.
*****
&gt; Commodities fueled gains in the stock market this week, with the S&amp;P energy sector by far the best performer, up 8.9%. Materials rose 5.9%, followed by financials, which were up 4.2%. Industrials gained 3.4%. But the S&amp;P technology sector slumped 0.5%, for the week even with a 0.8% gain Friday.
*****
&gt; “I think one thing that people are overlooking is that the technology selling we’ve seen in the last few days...is not just the reaction to the adverse earnings price reactions that we saw from certain tech names,” said Julian Emanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist at BTIG.
*****
&gt; “But it’s also this idea in that in a world where we assume capital gains taxes could go up, that’s where the capital gains lie,” he added. “So they are likely to come under incrementally more pressure on that basis.”
*****
&gt; President Joe Biden has proposed raising capital gains taxes to 39.6% for taxpayers making more than $1 million. That’s up from the current top rate of 20%.
*****
&gt; Emanuel said the upcoming federal income tax return filing date of May 17 could also be adding pressure to technology, since investors may be selling winners to pay their taxes.
*****
&gt; “With the tax bill coming due on May 17 for the 2020 calendar year, people are just going to use it as an excuse within the context of higher capital gains taxes to sell those stocks to pay for their tax bill,” Emanuel said. “I think people are overlooking this as part of the reason.”
*****
&gt; Boockvar said tech names could also face further headwinds from higher interest rates, particularly if inflation data is hotter than expected.
*****
&gt; “I think the last couple of weeks tells you froth is coming out of the most expensive part of tech and earnings for the big cap names are as good as it gets in terms of growth rates. The market is telling you that,” he said. “If you get a further move in rates, that’s a headwind.”
*****
&gt; Earnings season continues in the week ahead though most of the rush is over for the quarter. Disney, Marriott, Wynn Resorts, Airbnb are among the companies reporting that should provide insight on the economic reopening.

&gt; # ARKK Stocks Breakdowns and Bounces

&gt; After struggling for most of the past couple months, momentum and Tech stocks are broadly outperforming today as the Nasdaq is up 1.25% compared to a 0.78% gain in the S&amp;P 500. The ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) has been a poster child of the momentum theme over the past year. After a 383.9% gain from the March 2020 low to its high in mid-February, ARKK has fallen around 30% in the months since then. For most of that time, the ETF consolidated between its 50 and 200-DMA. After a failed attempt to break above its 50-DMA at the end of April, it has taken a leg lower, falling below its 200-DMA for the first time in a year in the process. While ARKK has yet to move back above its 200-DMA, it has found support around $105 which traces back to the lows earlier this spring and the highs from the fall. In other words, from a technical perspective ARKK, as well as some of its holdings, still have plenty of technical hurdles including moving back above its moving averages and breaking the past few months' downtrends. At least for the time being, the group has found some respite in the move higher today.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/050721-ARKK.png))**

&gt; As for the individual holdings of the ARKK ETF, below we show the 25 largest which accounts for approximately three-quarters of net asset value. For the most part, these stocks continue to sit on huge gains from the past year (or since their market debut for those that have IPO'ed in the past year; bolded and bordered rows in the table below) with only a small handful in the red: Teladoc (TDOC), Coinbase (COIN), and Iovance Biotherapeutics (IOVA). Even though the 25 largest ARKK holdings are on average up 117% over the past year, they have certainly been a pain trade recently. Most of these names are deeply oversold at the moment, and relative to their 52-week highs, they are down 35% on average. In fact, of all 58 holdings, there are only four—Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), TuSimple (TSP), Trimble (TRMB), and PACCAR (PCAR)—that are less than 10% below their 52-week highs, and none of these break into the top 25 largest holdings (as such they are not pictured below).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/050721-ARKK-Table.png))**

&gt; While ARKK holdings have generally been weak over the past few months, in recent days there have been some notable developments in the charts of these names. Some of these like CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP) and EXACT Sciences (EXAS) have fallen below the long-term 200-DMA. Other names in the ETF broke below their 200-DMA a while ago now, and their charts do not look much better. Stocks like Invitae (NVTA), Materialise (MTLS), and Teladoc (TDOC) collapsed below their long-term moving averages earlier this spring and this week's moves lower have resulted in breaks of critical support levels. For TDOC and MTLS, those levels have previously marked support at multiple points in the past year. One other interesting name in terms of performance today is Regeneron (REGN). Unlike many other ARKK stocks, REGN has actually been trending higher since March, albeit that is in the context of a much longer-term downtrend than many other ARKK holdings. Regardless, that recent rally has resulted in the stock to run right up to its long-term downtrend. In another move that is out of sync with its peers, today it has reversed lower, failing to break out from that downtrend.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/050721-ARKK-Below1.png))**

&gt; While most names have pulled back sharply and continue to trend lower to sideways at best, that is not to say all ARKK stocks have entirely negative charts. Similar to the ETF's chart, there are several names that have found support in the past couple of days. For example, DocuSign (DOCU), Iovance Biotherapeutics (IOVA), Palantir (PLTR), and Spotify (SPOT) are all bouncing off critical support levels of the past year. For others like Fate Therapeutics (FATE), Iridium (IRDM), PagerDuty (PD), PACCAR (PCAR), and Synopsis (SNPS), those support levels have also coincided with their moving averages. PACCAR is also notable in that it is even breaking back above its 50-DMA today. Similarly, Novartis (NVS) is attempting to move back above its 200-DMA. Perhaps one of the most technically strong stocks of these has been Sea Ltd (SEE). Over the past year, the 50-DMA has consistently provided reliable support. After a brief dip back below in March, in April it moved back above its 50-DMA and has once again successfully retested in the past week.

&gt; In order to keep track of the ARK Innovation ETF's (ARKK) holdings, we created a custom portfolio that members can add here. Please note that this does not update real time and is only based on ARKK's holdings as of 5/6/21.

&gt; As always, investors should do their own research before buying or selling any securities, and this chart analysis is in no way meant to be a buy or sell recommendation.

&gt; # Commodities Soar to Five Year Highs

&gt; As talk of inflation continues to heat up, one asset class fueling the fire has been the commodities complex. In our one-year review of the market low, we noted how commodities had been some of the biggest winners during the market recovery. Well that trend hasn’t stopped yet, and as shown in the chart below, on Wednesday, the Bloomberg Commodity Index closed at its highest level since August 2015.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Blog-5.7.21-a.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Whether this strength flows through to CPI or Core PCE (the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation) remains to be seen, but the technicals suggest this move could just be getting started. WTI crude oil is on the verge of breaking above a level of technical resistance that capped prices in 2019, while copper prices are less than 3% from their 2011 all-time highs. However, those who thought gold would benefit from inflation fears have been mistaken. In fact, of the 23 commodities tracked in the Bloomberg Commodity Index, gold is the worst performing year to date and one of the few that is actually negative over that time period.

&gt; To be clear, we are not calling for runaway inflation. In fact, breaking to five year highs shows that broadly commodities have gone nowhere over that time period. However, we do continue to have a bullish view of energy and industrial metals and wouldn’t be surprised to see this trend continue, albeit likely at a slower pace than the past year. If prices do continue to rise it may put more pressure on companies who are not able to pass those costs onto consumers. But if companies are broadly able to pass these increased input costs along, then expect price increases to begin showing up in traditional inflation measures, but any persistent impact is likely to be modest. Be sure to check out the LPL Research blog next Wednesday, as we examine the April CPI data release.

&gt; # April Jobs Data Disappoints Lofty Expectations

&gt; Investors betting on a continued acceleration in U.S. payrolls in April following March’s impressive numbers received an unwelcome reminder of just how choppy the data can be month-to-month.

&gt; The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released its monthly employment report this morning, revealing that the domestic economy added only 266,000 jobs in April, well below Bloomberg-surveyed economists’ median forecast for a gain of 1,000,000. The prior two months also received net negative revisions of 78,000 jobs. The unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to 6.1% from 6%, though that was paired with an above-estimate gain in the labor force participation rate, which moved from 61.5% to 61.7%, equaling a recovery high. Average hourly earnings rose 0.7% month over month, signaling lower-wage workers did not rejoin the workforce to the degree expected.

&gt; Anecdotal commentary provided by companies in recent months detailing their difficulty finding qualified job candidates evidently worked its way into the data this month in a big way. There are a few explanations for why this might be. Enhanced unemployment benefits may reduce the urgency for some to return to work. Additionally, still-closed schools and lack of child-care may make it difficult for workers to return to the in-person segments of the labor markets. And finally, March’s big jump in payrolls may have represented a rehiring of workers with whom hiring managers already had relationships, such as furloughed employees. Hiring new workers requires a more rigorous, and time-consuming, vetting process.

&gt; As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, April bucked the reacceleration trend seen off the December 2020 low. Total payrolls still sit about 8.2 million below the February 2020 peak of 152.5 million, but we are still very optimistic about our ability to recapture the lion’s share of those losses quickly despite today’s disappointing readout.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5.7.21-Blog-CHart.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “The job market got a bit of a reality check this morning,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “While we always caution against reading too far into one data release, we think most of the cited factors that suppressed April’s payroll number should wear off naturally with time. We believe that despite April’s speedbump the overall trend will be higher from here.”

&gt; Given the magnitude of the total loss that still needs to be recovered and the varying degrees to which parts of our economy are currently open, we believe jobs data will carry the potential for strong upside surprises for at least the next several months. Improving employment trends—though choppy—buoy consumer strength, and the economy overall, given consumers’ large weighting in the calculation of gross domestic product (GDP). As such, we continue to recommend positioning portfolios to take advantage of these trends, where appropriate, including an overweight allocation to equities relative to benchmarks, and a tilt toward sectors that may benefit more from a continued cyclical upturn

&gt; # Let’s Talk About Stocks And Higher Taxes

&gt; Our new Constitution is now established, everything seems to promise it will be durable; but, in this world, nothing is certain except death and taxes,” Benjamin Franklin

&gt; First off, we hope everyone has a happy and safe Cinco de Mayo!

&gt; One of the big discussions lately has been about how will higher taxes potentially impact the stock market. We’ve known since President Biden won the presidency and the Democrats secured control of the House and Senate that higher taxes were coming, likely in the form of higher corporate taxes and higher capital gains taxes on the wealthy—though probably not until 2022. It is worth noting though that stocks haven’t been fazed at all by all the higher taxes talk, as we just saw the best first 100 days for stocks under a new president since FDR.

&gt; With proposals for the $1.8 trillion American Families Plan (AFP) and $2 trillion plus infrastructure bill (known as the American Jobs Plan or AJP), higher taxes are needed to help finance the new spending. Let’s be clear though, with a 50/50 Senate (Vice President Kamala Harris breaks ties) and historically slim Democratic majority in the House, we think these final numbers will likely come in less than $3 trillion combined, as these initial numbers from the Democrats are starting points for negotiations.

&gt; Higher capital gains taxes on the wealthy are one way to pay for things, with the AFP proposing to increase the top tax rate on ordinary income to 39.6% from 37%, and capital gains and dividends taxes on those who earn more than $1 million to a maximum of 43.4% from the current 23.8%. Fun stat, only 0.32% of the population makes more than $1 million a year, so the truth is this won’t impact the other 99.68% of the population.

&gt; “We’ve known higher taxes were coming so this shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone at this point,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Now here’s the catch, looking back at the times that taxes increased amid a strong economy, stocks did just fine. Given the strong economic outlook this year, you’d have to think history could repeat once again.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, in 1986 and 2013, capital gains taxes increased, but the economy was on firm footing back then, compared with the 1970s hikes, which saw an economy marred by higher inflation and sluggish growth. Not surprisingly, the two more recent hikes saw solid stock market performance, while the 1970s hikes didn’t. Is it as simple as how the economy is doing? It very well could be.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5.5.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Corporate taxes are currently 21% and President Biden has discussed increasing the level to 28%. Although we think in the end the level will be more like 25%, the bottom line is higher corporate taxes are likely coming, which could knock a few percentage points off of future S&amp;P 500 Index earnings growth.

&gt; So what happens after corporate taxes are raised? As the table below shows, muted returns a year out are normal, but interestingly stocks have consistently been in the green the three months before the official date of the tax increase, suggesting investors weren’t very worried about higher taxes on the horizon.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5.5.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; It’s always possible that higher taxes slowly take a bite out stock market returns over a longer time period than just a year, but if the concern is what all the talk about higher taxes may mean for markets over the next year, there’s not much historical evidence pointing to the potential for a bad outcome. The picture is murkier, though, with corporate taxes, which isn’t surprising, since stock prices are ultimately tied to earnings growth. But is often happens, markets seem to be more attuned to larger economic forces.

&gt; # Individuals, Writers, and Managers All Still Bullish

&gt; The major indices are broadly lower in the past week with the exception of the Dow which has risen just over 1%. The Nasdaq on the other hand has been the worst performer falling almost 3%. Even though the major indices are split in terms of performance, sentiment has gone the way of the Dow as bullish sentiment as measured through the AAII weekly survey rose 1.7 percentage points to 44.3%. While not a particularly large increase, this week did mark the first time bullish sentiment has risen in a month.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/050621-AAII-Bull.png))**

&gt; With bullish sentiment higher, fewer respondents reported as bearish. Only 23.1% of investors reported pessimistic sentiment; down 2.6 percentage points versus last week's reading. Just like bullish sentiment, that was not a particularly large change, and it leaves the reading in the middle of the past several weeks' range.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/050621-AAII-Bear.png))**

&gt; The inverse moves in bullish and bearish sentiment resulted in the bull-bear spread climbing 4.3 points to 21.2. While that is still at the high end of the past few years' range, it is 11 points below where it stood only two weeks ago. Looking at another sentiment survey from Investors Intelligence which targets equity newsletter writers, the bull-bear spread also rose slightly week over week leaving the spread well below levels from only a couple of weeks ago. In other words, sentiment has moderated recently, but it has not dramatically shaken a historically bullish tone.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/050621-AAII-Bull-Bear.png))**

&gt; Perhaps the most notable reading in this week's AAII survey was the reading on neutral sentiment. Up 0.7 percentage points from the prior week, it was not a particularly large gain especially compared to the 5 and 5.2 percentage point gains the previous two weeks. Regardless, moving higher once again neutral sentiment hit the highest level since the first week of March. Other than that week and the current one, there has only been one other week in the past year (second to last week of 2020) in which neutral sentiment was as high as it is now. Even though this week's reading is elevated relative to the past year, compared to the rest of the history of the survey, it is pretty unremarkable. On average over the life of the survey, neutral sentiment has averaged a reading just 0.9 percentage points lower than this week's reading.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/050621-AAII-Neutral.png))**

&gt; The NAAIM Exposure Index is yet one more sentiment reading that also has shown some moderation but remains at a generally bullish level. This index reflects the average exposure to US equities of members of the National Association of Active Investment Managers. Readings of 200 would indicate they are leveraged long on average, 100 would be fully invested, 0 would be market neutral, -100 would be fully short, and -200 would be leveraged short. Last week saw this index tip above 100 for the first time since mid-February which also ranked in the top 2% of all readings going back to 2006. This week it fell 15.93 points. That stands in the bottom decile of weekly moves and was the largest drop since late March, but at 87.79, the index still points to historically bullish positioning among active managers.

personalfinance,mortgage interest rates for FTB,"I have been looking at applying for a mortgage over the past 8 months. The best rate my broker can find me is 2.99% which he assures me is the best interest rate available on the market. One of my colleagues at work took out a mortgage on 1.89% rate a couple of years ago. I understand the pandemic has accelerated the rates due to the increase of risk, but i was wondering if anyone else had found their rate cheaper or is this just the standard rate for the foreseeable future?

Just to add a little bit of context. This was to borrow £196,200 - with a 10% deposit (£21,800)",finance
personalfinance,Paying off high interest loan and replace with finance?,"First of all I am a massive car fan, I love having a nice car as I drive 50 miles a day for work so I am in it a lot of the time. 

Because of this, when I got this job I took out a £7000 loan with Santander to buy myself an £8000 Bmw 1 series which was a diesel so is really good on fuel, because I am fairly young (23 at the time) I hadn’t got much credit score built up so this was a loan with 24.9% APR. 

A year later, I’ve paid £2600 off of this loan and it’s all going well and the payments have been fine and I’ve had no problem paying it. Due to this, my credit score has now gotten really good.

My question is however. I’ve got a dream car in mind which is an automatic bmw 3 series. This car I can finance for a much lower APR and pay the same amount I’m currently paying on this loan.

Would it make more sense to sell my 1 series, pay off my 24.9% APR loan, finance a much nicer car, which is worth a lot more, but pay the same each month for the same amount of time as I would be paying the loan, due to this having a much lower Interest rate?

Or am I missing something here?",finance
dogecoin,I'll say it,"All of you that bought Doge with a lot of money that couldn't afford to lose because you had an idea that Doge was a coin to get rich fast, get the \*\*\*\* out.

Your negativity is the opposite of what this coin was made of and the community created by people way older than me in this reddit.

Go buy stocks or some other \*\*\*\*. Go fill other reddits that are full of negativity and add your own.

Go and tell them you are pulling out because in reality you don't understand \*\*\*\* about investments or the purpose of a crypto coin or what which one symbolizes. For some are technicalities, this one is a meme. If you can't understand or get behind it, pull out, keep your thoughts to yourself. No one is going to have pity of you, no one cares. We only care for people that want the community and the coin to grow, slower or faster it doesn't matter. And yes, even when it goes down. I haven't touched my coins since my initial investment is February. I have seen dips and didn't sell, I have seen pumps and didn't sell. My goal is to one day, and I actually believe that, Doge will have a value enough for me to be comfortable, have my own security but also GIVE TO WORTHY CAUSES. And I truly believe that most of you paperhands don't even give a \*\*\*\* about that.

So please, get the \*\*\*\* out with your money and your negativity.

And yes, I'm not one of those ""positive"" people in here. This is reality. I'm only positive to people that spread positivity. Don't ask me to feel bad for you. \*\*\*\* you. You don't give a \*\*\*\* about us so why should I care. I'm not a messiah. 

This is only me personal point of view and doesn't reflect this community. Most of the people don't even agree with me. Most of the hodlers are very understandable. I'm just fed up seeing 80% of posts now about people that made stupid decisions.

I rather have one person buying 1 Doge that have something positive to add to this community than a guy that invested 50k on it and pulled out because he's ""afraid"". If you are afraid is because you should have never bought.

And you know what, please, take this chance to give all the bad karma you have accumulated inside you for your disappointment on yourself for risking money on Doge you couldn't lose. Take your anger and negativity and let it out in here. And let the community grow like it should.

And thank you for helping people like that crypto ""expert"" and his crypto gang (just a \*\*\*\*\*\* whale and his elitists minions). If you still don't understand how they achieved that, then you really out of your element. Your fear and ignorance made that possible. Let that sink in.",cryptocurrency
dogecoin,Doge is active asset,"Hear me out fellow Doge fam.

Remember this, Doge is an active asset not passive asset. Thats a huge thing if you think about it. Nba is not a small thing for our boi. 

Doge can make actual profit to companies who accepted it, not by growth of Doge, but actuall turnover with selling goods, merch, ect. 

You know that if you think about it and then you realized how fakin big thing it is. 

Doge generates interest rate when you hold, and it's a currency when you use it. Keep that in mind! 

Hold and be good all the time.",cryptocurrency

1. I would jump on this if it wasn’t for closing, financially does it make sense if I’m going to move in 6\~8 years?  
2. Is there such a thing as no closing costs with a reputable bank?

About $86k left on mortgage at 4% interest/APR at Wells Fargo. I was thinking the house was worth $180k but zillow is saying $208 in the current bubble (LCOL area). I’m about 8 years into a 30 year loan and overpaying a little. Financially I can handle the payments on a 15 year loan.",finance

personalfinance,"High Credit score 820, accounts closing soon.","Hello! 

I have three accounts that I've been ""slow paying""  for awhile because I'm trying to maximize my credit history. Problem is that they all have ~ $1000 each and will basically all close at the same time.

2 are for student loans
1 is for a power sports ""toy"" 

I have ~ 9 years of credit history which apparently has a high impact on my score. 

The last time I closed a loan account several years ago by completing the payments my score took a large hit. I'm afraid with these closing that this will be the trifecta of pwnage to my credit portfolio. 

The only other thing I have outstanding is a mortgage with around 140k left.

I have 50,500 in available credit across two cards with zero balance. So my debt to credit ratio is great!

Is it better for me to:

A. Keep slow paying all three to cross 10years of credit history
B. Pay off all three now immediately
C. Pay off one or two
D. Stop worrying because it doesn't matter

I don't think at this point it really matters but the interest rates for all three loans is quite small. If the answer is to continue dragging the accounts out I'm not super concerned with what I'm paying interest wise.

Thanks y'all.",finance
personalfinance,Maxed out FAFSA. Taking out private loans?,"[OR,USA]In the process of getting a second bachelors degree and hit the 150% credit limit. Taking out private loans?

I got a BA back in 2013. The degree is basically useless. I barely passed undergrad because of health issues and undiagnosed ADHD. Never took out loans or FAFSA for this degree. 

I got a job after being out of school for a small family business with no possibility of moving up. I got depressed and stayed for about 8 years living with my parents the whole time in a HCOL area and Barry getting by with bills. They didn’t support me and I paid them rent in cash. 

Now I’m doing better. I got treatment for the depression. Discovered I had ADHD and got treatment in the last year. 

I decided to go back and get a new degree. 

I found a computer science program that you can do the prep courses for about a year and a half and then enter a masters program for it. 

I started out doing it remote and have been doing it for about a year now part time while still working. 

I have about a year of classes full time left before entering the masters part. 

The program is out of state though. There is no in state options like this. 

I apparently hit the credit/units limit of 150%. And now have to appeal for continues FAFSA loans. I’m not sure if I will get it approved or not. 

I was supposed to move to my new state and city in June. To start attending in person finally. 

Now I don’t know what to do. I can’t afford to go if I do t have aid. I never even used it for my first degree. 

Private loans seem like the only option now for me to do this. 


Questions are: 
1. Do you apply for private loans each quarter or for one amount for the year? 

2. How much do you take out at a time for a private loan?

3. What’s a normal interest rate for a private student loan? 

4. If I can’t get FAFSA cut off but am still a full time student do I have to start paying the loans back?

personalfinance,Tax question regarding recharacterization of traditional IRA to Roth IRA.,"Let me first say I’m a noob to IRA’s. 

I opened a traditional IRA (2020) a few weeks ago hoping to reduce my tax burden from some stocks I sold in 2020, but I goofed because I didn’t realize that my state pension counted as a company sponsored retirement plan which means I can’t take the deduction.  

So I opened a Roth IRA (2021) and had the traditional IRA recharacterized as a Roth. This just went through a few days ago, but my broker says it will be about a month before the traditional IRA is closed. 

How do I report the traditional IRA on this year’s tax return, which is done except for this one detail? Can I just pretend it doesn’t exist? It has 4 cents interest in it because I maxed out the contribution and they only recharacterized the max I could contribute.",finance
Banking,Understanding the Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR),"So I was reading up about how the Fed can attempt to influence credit availability and long term interest rates by controlling what is used to calculate the SLR (as they did last year 1st April).

My understanding that the SLR requirements are put in place to ensure banks have enough capital with respect to their risky assets such that if they lose the assets (eg people defaulting on loans and mortgages as they did in 2007/8), they have sufficient capital to cover those potential losses such that they will not go under. 

However, I have trouble understanding **why** certain things are included in the calculation, and some not. My google search has mostly been futile as the same findings are repeated about what is the SLR, what goes into its calculations. I want to understand **why** it is the case. 

So to start off, the definition of the SLR =  Tier 1 Capital / Total Leverage Exposure . 

1. Tier 1 Capital includes ""Common Equity Tier 1"" and ""Additional Tier 1 Capital"". 
2. Total Leverage Exposure refers to ""Both on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet assets exposures"". Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think of it as assets that have a **risk of declining in value** (eg derivatives, loans, etc). 

For 1, my main trouble is understanding ""Common Equity Tier 1"", which investopedia says it ""comprises a bank’s **core capital** and includes **common shares**, stock surpluses resulting from the issue of common shares, retained earnings, common shares issued by subsidiaries and held by third parties, and accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI)."" 

* To me, when I think of a bank's core capital, the first thing that pops into my mind would be the actual amount of cash they have (minus deposits since deposits are not factored in to the SLR anyways). But clearly I'm missing something here because cash is nowhere to be seen. I was thinking that that it is better expressed in the form of retained earnings, because that would have accounted for any expenses and liabilities. 
* Another thing is the bank's own common shares being considered core capital. While I understand, if banks need to take losses on assets and continue operations, they can fall back on their retained earnings, which in a way helps buffer the losses since all these earnings are the net income accumulated over the years of operation. But can banks use their own shares for this purpose? Essentially, the question is, how can **banks use their own shares to protect themselves from asset loss**? How do shares play that role? Honestly I think I'm carrying one big misunderstanding somewhere, and hope someone can shed some light into it. 

Now, for 2, the Fed introduced a temporary change on 1st April 2020 (and which has since expired) where ""the change would exclude **U.S. Treasury securities** and **deposits at Federal Reserve Banks** from the calculation of the rule "". This effectively lowers the denominator for the banks, increasing their SLR and giving them more leeway to **lend out their capital (cash), providing credit for the economy**, and also allows them to **park more of their (non-productive) cash into US treasury bonds (which give interest), thus lowering bond yields**, helping the Fed control long term interest rates. These two outcomes, as per my understanding, was why the Fed allowed this change in light of the Covid shock to markets and the economy. 

* I can understand and accept that US treasury securities, although almost considered to be risk-free, are still debt assets (which are inherently risky), and hence included into the equation in which banks have to hold a certain amount of capital against. What I don't understand is why deposits at the Federal Reserve Banks are included. My understanding is that banks, instead of keeping excess reserves/deposits with themselves, they can deposit them with the Fed and get a small interest on it (better than nothing). But why is this considered into the equation? Will these assets (deposits at the Fed) **have a risk of being lost if the Fed is somehow unable to return them**?? If yes, what situation will it be where the Fed cannot return the deposits? If no, why is it part of the SLR equation, and why is there a need to hold capital against it?
* When the expiry was drawing near, and as banks were lobbying the Fed to extend this SLR change, one of the reasons I saw was that banks would have to ""decrease deposits (pushing savers out of holding deposits)"", essentially meaning turning away people who want to deposit money with the bank. **Why would reverting the change mean that banks have to turn away deposits?** 
* After the expiry of the change, the fear that banks would now have to sell treasury bonds to meet SLR requirements (and cause a rise in yields that would hamper economic recovery) did not materialize. Instead, it was reported that banks were raising cash by issuing debt. This would imply that this increases their core capital. Why is this possible when cash is not included in the definition of core capital? After all, this also has a net neutral effect on their balance sheet, since the increase in cash will be offset by an increase in liabilities to their creditors. 

As one can see from my myriad of questions, I'm definitely no banker or accountant or whatever, in fact just a barely 20 y/o kid trying to learn more about the financial world. My understanding towards the SLR is probably ridden with misunderstanding and would really appreciate if people, or actual bankers over here, can help me clear it up.",finance

personalfinance,Question on taxes,"Hi everyone, thanks for taking the time to read this and hopefully I get some answers that are helpful to others! Obligatory apologies for mobile formatting.

So, I don't know where to start with taxes. I did them on turbotax the last couple years. I lost 2000 dollars gambling on robinhood and didn't include that on my taxes for the past couple times. I had refunds of a couple hundred dollars from a regular job. In order to import the robinhood forms to turbo tax you need to buy premium so I didn't want to pay money to report that i lost money (which i think wouldn't have been worth it). Now as of last year I've gotten pua as a gig worker because I started walking dogs with Rover right before covid started. They sent out a fact finding questionnaire for me to prove I qualify for pua. I was told I should get a letter confirming the money is mine and I don't owe it back if everything works out but I haven't gotten it yet. I don't want to file taxes on all that money and then have it be that I owe it back. Also theres something about 10000 of it being not taxable but I already have both state and federal tax taken out of it as I get it (so is that gonna be a refund?) As you can see I have a bit of a complicated situation here and dont know where or how to do my taxes and i don't want to throw money at a professional to do what's probably easy enough to do myself with some guidance. Also don't tell me not to gamble with robinhood I'm already on tda investing in safe etfs lmao I learned my lesson. trust me. Thank you all so much I look forward to seeing your responses!",finance
dogecoin,"For a currency based on one, it's community seems it can't take a joke.","The ""hustle"" comment came after trying to call attention, several times,  to the fact that people don't seem to realize that federal currency is only worth what it is because the people placed that value on it. Still people are complaining that a show that is was made for no other purpose than to tell jokes, had a finished with a punchline. 

The punchline was kind of true too. Look at the paper hands leaving. If they really believed in the movement we all do, they would be HODLing like we are, but they are afraid of losing their quick buck and trying to hustle all along. I've lost nearly 4k of my profits when Barry Bitcoin declared war on doge but I still believe that people set the value of otherwise useless currency (I mean, bitcoin doge or even the good ol' dollar, if you can't find someone that wants it, what else is it good for?) and the best, most accessible,  example of this has been blockchaining leading to the the acceptance by businesses as currency. 

The real question should be, how is this different than investing in the stock market? The short answer is that it's not. Some will buy in believing in what they invest in, and others will try to hustle and make a quick buck. The most important thing is that the non-hustlers keep the faith and don't invest more than you're willing to lose. The stock market crash of 1929 came when people had so much hope, they were buying in on credit. This combined with the original ponzi scheme caused unpresidented volatility in the market causing the truly stable financial backers to jump ship to protect their assets and with the huge drops in stock value it was only a matter of time before everyone lost faith it would turn around.

With the fed printing more dollars than ever before I believe confidence in the US dollar is decreasing substantially.

investing,Investing Styles Part 2: Ray Dalio and Risk-Parity Investing,"Ray Dalio, the master of the LinkedIn essay and co-CIO of a minor hedge fund, is the subject of the next installment of investing styles. Ray’s All-Weather Fund is a risk-parity approach to investing, an approach that aims to diversify equal risk amongst a set of assets that have minimal or negative correlation in the event of rising or falling growth and inflation across the world economy.

The set of assets in Ray’s approach is wider than most individual investors consider: Emerging Market Credit, Corporate Credit, and Commodities, in addition to equities and bonds. Ray’s selection of assets in his risk-parity fund was driven by his belief that there are 2 core environmental drivers of markets - growth and inflation. Different assets in the portfolio perform under the 4 possible combinations of rising or falling growth and rising or falling inflation. Rather than allocating solely to assets that perform well over a falling inflation/falling growth regime, he spread the allocation over assets that perform under each of the four possible regimes. Helpful grid of the assets that perform in each regime here: [https://imgur.com/HnQ3Qp0](https://imgur.com/HnQ3Qp0). Since the market is forward-looking, what matters for classifying the regime is not just the direction of growth and inflation, but whether or not the direction is already expected, and thus priced into the market. You want to have assets that are durable when inflation or growth surprises to the upside/downside. 

Now for the controversial element of risk-parity: leverage. Rather than allocating an equal dollar amount to each of the assets outlined above, the allocation strategy is to employ leverage on lower volatility assets to achieve higher mean return at the cost of higher volatility and of the interest rate of the borrowed dollars used to lever. For example, if you have an asset with a 2% historical mean return and 5% historical volatility then you could achieve a higher expected mean return by leveraging the asset 2x to increase the expected mean return to 4% while expected volatility is now 10%. Additionally, you should expect to pay some interest rate on the margin used to implement the leverage.

The decision of how much to lever is usually set by targeting a total portfolio volatility and then giving each asset in the portfolio an equal volatility budget. If it’s a lower volatility asset, for example TIPS or investment grade corporate bonds, then the leverage ratio is higher. But for a volatile asset like equities there may be no leverage at all since the existing asset volatility already meets the volatility budget.

It isn’t intuitive how in theory applying leverage in this way can actually decrease portfolio volatility over time so it’s helpful to compare a 60/40 equities bond portfolio against the risk-parity allocation to equities and bonds. In the 60/40 portfolio the total portfolio volatility is dominated by the equity component. In the risk-parity portfolio the same mean-return as the 60/40 portfolio could be achieved with lower volatility by allocating less to equities and more to bonds and applying leverage. If you are a nerd and interested in more theory about portfolio allocation strategies under risk parity I recommend this AQR overview: [https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Research/White-Papers/Understanding-Risk-Parity](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Research/White-Papers/Understanding-Risk-Parity) 

So how does Ray think the average Joe should invest using this risk-parity theory jumbo? Well, he did an interview with Tony Robbins in 2015 suggesting a 55% allocation to US bonds but every recent interview is about cash being trash, US bonds being dumb and investing in Asia. If you happened to have a couple billion dollars you could directly invest in his hedge fund but for us poors we’re stuck with mutual funds and ETFs. The central idea of risk-parity can be applied in your own portfolio by diversifying among assets that will perform well in different regimes. If your portfolio doesn’t have any assets that perform well under a rising inflation/rising growth regime then consider looking into commodity ETFs and inflation-linked bonds.  


The choice to use leverage as a retail investor is harder to recommend than the ideas around diversification. The theory of leveraging lower volatility assets in order to achieve higher return makes sense but there are downsides. One is that retail investors will pay higher costs to use leverage, either in high-fees for leveraged ETFs or in higher margin fees than institutions. The other, perhaps more relevant, risk for retail is failure to manage the risk of leveraged assets well. There must be rebalancing between assets to maintain the risk budgets of each asset and if the correlations of assets within the portfolio change then the fundamental assumption of assets performing under different regimes can be violated and leverage ratios should be managed accordingly. Another option is to trust a mutual fund or robo-advisor to manage this risk-parity approach for you, but as noted above the implementation matters and the fee drag of expensive risk-parity products should be considered.  


Hopefully you can take some ideas about allocating risk across your portfolio, considering other asset classes, and the performance of your portfolio under different market regimes into your own investing style. Next time, I will cover Christopher Cole’s long term investing style which aims to protect against the tail events that even risk-parity funds do not handle well.

So, disclaimer, this is not financial advice, we are not financial advisors, and we are certainly not YOUR financial advisors. This is a labor of love and a thought experiment. I am hoping that you all will push me further in my analysis so that I become better over time!  These are just our personal thoughts and views based upon news shared out in the world. 

This information is not groundbreaking but more us gathering from various sources some interesting stories, news, and tickers to share with the community! I will note where I found the material from when I can remember or when my notes include it but some are just from memory and came from places like Twitter, emails, reddit, etc.

Now lets get into it, shall we?

From the recent articles of Fortune we have some socially conscious companies and companies that are good to work for. A couple of ETF’s mentioned and then one stock I pulled from this set:

ETFs:
   ICLN- etf focusing on clean energy, should be seeing benefits from he shift towards environmental focus for at least 2 years of full dem control and 4 years of Biden. I own a couple shares and so does my spouse. 
   TAN- solar ETF, same rationale as above
   PBW- clean energy ETF, same rational as above.

   Then we have $RKT [Rocket Companies, including Rocket Mortgage] Innovation in an old field. Taking care of employees exceptionally well which should pay dividends in loyalty and retention which I think is extremely valuable in the tech field. During the pandemic they gave extra free time off and made it mandatory because had noticed no one was taking PTO to stay at home and twiddle their thumbs. This should help morale and employee satisfaction and avoidance of burnout.
   All 24,000 employees had shares during to/prior to the IPO so they should as a majority be invested in the companies market performance personally.
   Yahoo 1 year price target consensus of 24.75 and it was ~22.65 so only a small upside at current prices.
   I may sell a cash covered put or 3 over the next few weeks to see if can make some premiums and then possibly get a block of stock with strike of 20 or below. Not sure yet. I just had some cash secured puts I sold expire OTM so will be deploying that capital this week and will include my moves in my next report. I am long a handful of shares here. 


From Swaggy stock reads:

   DKNG! I am long DraftKings and currently very excited to be a hodler. THe analysis in swaggy stated that they are a market leader with 20-40% market share varying by state [or sport- I forget and deleted the email so /shrug, I’m good like that]. Main competitor is FanDuel who has yet to IPO followed by Barstool and BetMGM. Online sports betting legalization is moving forward to help govt generate tax revenues.
   And my sports ball boy TeB likes it for the Daily Fantasy Sports and knows people who have made line ups for over 180 days straight! That is some dedication [or addiction- and we know addiction is great for reoccurring revenue even if it may not align with personal morals]

From some MarketBeat emails/website articles we have some interesting news for insider trades:

CSX director sold 1.4 million shares at an average of 100.93 worth ~142 million and now only owns 12,399 shares worth ~1.2 million. This could be a bad sign of the prospects of the company if directory bailed out of nearly ALL of his shares. Would check other insider trades for this company before taking this to the bank though for sure.

FDX CEO and MMM VP both sold small blocks of share but hold much bigger blocks so probably just wanted to put some money down on a new Ski Chalet or super car! (I own both tickers)

From market sentiment we have some facts:

RKT fell 16% Thursday following 1Q revenues rising 236% and net income up 170% but the guidance of loan volume was disappointing along with worries of rising interest rates and inflations. May be good entry point if you’re bullish long term. Or may want to do what I do and make some cash flow selling cash secured puts waiting to be assigned blocks of stocks in companies you are ultimately fine holding for year+ and either sitting on or selling covered calls on to keep the cash flow coming.(I own some shares and thinking of selling short term cash secured puts depending on the premium)

Etsy was down 13% at some point despite good 1Q results because guidance for 2Q was disappointing. (Own a handful)

Corsair 6% down despite exceptional growth. 


And finally, from pits most foul, the depths of my memory:

GDRX- discount pharmacy deals, makes decent money there and also making inroads into telemedicine to compete with likes of TDOC, was ~38 a share and Yahoo had a 1 yr target consensus of ~53. Should be fine as long as Pharma system not overhauled, which is certainly a concern right now.(have about a grand in here so one of my small mid positions)

AAPL- quietly making acquisitions. Instead of large blockbuster billion dollar buys of competitors like we see FB doing, or of new areas to expand in like we see AMZN do, AAPL has largely been buying smaller companies with the main goal seeming to be talent acquisition which is critical in the tech field. I’m sure you’ve all seen the graphic comparing AirPods revenue to entire companies and man is that intoxicating. The amount of product apple sells is INSANE, but that’s why their market cap is also INSANE! I do think they have a fair chance of being the one to make one of the next big technological break throughs given their focus on talent acquisition [think AI, AR, VR]. Currently have 5-7 shares and selling cash secured put for 125 after having a stock secured call getting exercised for 127. 

I am bullish on public storage companies and storage REITs as we have huge housing demand yet not enough supply, so people maybe selling houses to capture the insane mark up but not have a place to go yet or place of same size, so that’s some storage business. Then we have the disparity between main and Wall Street and historically public storage does well during down turns and evictions where people are unfortunately removed from their homes and have to find someplace to store their belongings. I am long PSA and SAFE, maybe some others but I have over 200 separate tickers and didn’t spend more than a minute quickly scanning trying to find all of my tickers in this space.

SCI- have about a grand here. Cemetery’s and death shit. People always be dying. Just had big quarter so not sure best time to buy in. Yahoo 1 yr price consensus is 56.88 and currently ~56.71, 1.57% dividend, 19.69 P/E ratio]

AMZN I think is safe bet to keep growing and growing and growing and....growing until government intervention. One of my beta readers questioned why Bezos has been dumping a lot of his stock. My response: Cash burn at Blue Origin [private space company] has to be huge right now, so until the flights become regular and he is actually making money on space tourism this should be the reason behind much of the sales. Then again he also has access to private companies/venture caps so he’s investing money in companies that he thinks will be the next big thing that none of us have access too. See: https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/05/amazon-ceo-bezos-sells-nearly-2-billion-worth-of-amazon-shares.html (I am
Long Amazon)

NFLX has incredible amount of IP and reach on hand.( I am long)

DG- another recession play. Yahoo 1 yr target consensus is 233.12, 0.78% dividend, currently ~216. (I am long)

Defensive stocks like grocery stores, essential suppliers, utility companies, etc with dividends may be safe recession plays if think the future is not as Rosey as it looks when you’re 4 corona seltzers deep and just boofed some MDMA after smoking one of them blunts dipped in resin covered in keef or wtf ever the young bloods are doing these days.

CLX- i have some of this. Clorox. I think people will have germs on the mind for a while. I don’t know about you all but my hand washing has gone up at least 2500% since last March, wish my gains matched! Think this focus on cleaning will last at least a couple years post pandemic. Yahoo 1 yr consensus is 191.92 and dividend of 2.46%.


This weeks question:

With American birth rates not exceeding death rates, are there any stocks you think will suffer if this trend is not continued and the population of America continues to trend downwards?

Thanks for tuning in and good luck out there!",finance
CryptoCurrency,The complete idiots introduction to crypto,"Full Disclaimer: I’m quite new to crypto. Like many people, I’ve been aware of cryptocurrencies for a while, I’ve put money into bitcoin in the past and sold with regret. My goal is to discuss cryptocurrencies in a way that anyone can understand them, and I will certainly have some additional opinions to add in. Of course, my opinions are just my opinions, I am not a financial advisor, and this is not financial advice.

Also, I'll tell you in advance that I'm not making any recommendations on what to buy or what will ""make you rich"". My interest is in the technology, social, and economic side of things, and the possible changes that crypto brings. I frankly don't care which crypto ends up revolutionizing the world, as long as one of them does. (which, realistically, there's no guarantee any of them will)

There ARE some oversimplifications, because my goal is to write to people without presuming any knowledge or getting too caught up in the terminology. If anyone wants to offer any criticisms, suggestions, or corrections I am absolutely open to them. I do not proclaim to be a Guru, I just ask that you do so respectfully

Let’s get started..

**What is Bitcoin?**  
Bitcoin was the first successful implementation of cryptocurrency. It was created by Satoshi Nakamoto, who has a super cool backstory because nobody knows who the fuck Satoshi Nakamoto is. There is speculation that Satoshi is a group of people, there is speculation that Satoshi is dead, nobody really knows. Satoshi was NOT the first person with the idea for cryptocurrency. There were others who came before Satoshi, one example being Bitgold which was idealized by Nick Szabo. What separates Satoshi from the others is that Satoshi solved a pretty complex Computer Science problem called the Byzantine General’s problem. More on that later. What you should know is that Satoshi was incredibly smart, and many Computer Scientists, Finance/Economic Gurus, and Lawyers have all acknowledged that Satoshi needed a pretty deep understanding of ALL these fields to do what Satoshi did by creating Bitcoin.

**Ok but what IS Bitcoin?**  
Well, not so fast. Let’s talk about money first. Often people refer to “fiat” currency, which is a currency that is “established” by the government. The American dollar is fiat. I think technical terms can be a distraction when trying to learn new ideas, so instead of fiat, I’m going to just uses the term “money”. I will never use the term “money” to describe crypto, and that’s just to avoid confusion in this explanation.

**What is money?**  
Well, technically anything can be money. If you look at the history of human civilization, there are people who have used all kinds of things as “money”. Tulip Bulbs, Stones, Salt, Shells, etc. At the end of the day, we as people need to come to an agreement on the things we’re willing to give and receive payments for. Let’s say I wanted to open my own cupcake shop and you come in hungry for some noms and you slap a 20 dollar bill down on the counter and say SIR GIVE ME YOUR FINEST CUPCAKE. I can 100% legally say nah.. I do not accept American dollars, I only accept Bitcoin. In fact, I can even legally pay my employees in Bitcoin, in fact many employers have already done this.

Of course government laws are going to vary country to country, but legally and more importantly, LOGICALLY there’s no reason why I can’t. It would be a somewhat bad business move on my part, because most people don’t have a convenient way to perform transactions with bitcoin, and I would probably lose a lot of business and go broke.

But money has physical properties, and some things just make “better” money than other things. We COULD use gold as money, but then we’d all be lugging around lots of heavy gold. But fuck, we’d never need to do a leg day again. But still.. that’s just not super convenient. There was a time when you could go to the bank and deposit your gold, and they essentially give you a receipt that says “Hey, you have THIS much gold stored with us at the bank”.

Now we just sort have the receipts and not the gold. Keep in mind, American currency hasn’t ALWAYS been backed by gold, it’s something they’ve changed their mind on more than once. The federal reserve still maintains a vault with a crap ton of gold, but that’s beyond the scope of this topic.

But one of the appeals to gold is that it’s FINITE. Once all of the gold on earth has been mined, you can’t just “create” more (at least not yet). When things are rare, they’re often more valuable. This is considered “deflationary” because over time the value actually INCREASES.

Typical money, however is considered “inflationary” because there’s simply no maximum to how much money the U.S. government can print out. The more money they print, the less your dollar is worth. Right now we’re seeing a lot of unusual spending to counteract the pandemic, and it’s hard to really predict how much that might increase inflation.

If I went back to 1920 with $100,000 it would be worth a heck of a lot more money than it is today. Inflation is always happening. That means if you just save all your money under your mattress and don’t invest it in SOMETHING (whether that be stocks, crypto, a house, paying off your debt, etc.) you’re ALWAYS going to be losing money because of inflation, which is somewhere around an average of 2% every year. So in 1 year, your $100 will be worth $98 today. In 10 years, it will be worth $90 today.

**How do we as a society use money?**  
Well there are important things to note. Arguably the most important is that we use a shit ton of “ledgers”. Ledgers are just big long lists of transactions and/or balances. I want this to be friendly to people who aren’t accountants, so here’s a very simplified version of a ledger for dummies like me:

Bob's Ledger:

|Transaction|Account Balance||
|:-|:-|:-|
|N/A|$200||
|Withdraw $50|$150||
|Deposit $100|$250||
|Pay Alice $10 for cheezburgers|$240||

Alice could have her own ledger, and of course when Bob pays Alice $10, Alice’s ledger will be updated to add $10 to HER ledger. There’s also the concept of OWING someone money. For example, on the application “venmo” you can request payments from your friends. So if your buddy Elon owes you $50 cause he smoked all your pot, you can formally enter that transaction into a ledger to point out that Elon “owes” you money. Keep in mind, that YOUR account balance is still going to be the same and Elon’s account balance is going to be the same UNTIL Elon actually pays you. But you still have a record of debt, someone “owing you money” which is also a very important feature necessary for ledgers and economic growth.

Now there are many kinds of ledgers. If you’re a business, you have to keep track of ALL your expenses, the salaries you’re paying, how much money you’re making, any loans you receive, etc.

So who’s maintaining YOUR personal ledger? Well, it’s your bank isn’t it? They know everything about your account, and every time you put money in or take money out, you have to trust them to accurately make changes. You can go online and even view your transaction history which.. in essence IS a ledger.

**What’s a potential problem with this?**  
Well, for starters there is always the potential for fraud. Banks have historically engaged in some less-than-ideal business practices over the years. One classic example being the housing bubble in 2008. I’m going to REALLY oversimplify the complexity of what actually happened by saying they loaned out a crap ton of money for people to buy houses (mortgages) even though the banks KNEW those people did not have the financial ability to pay it back. Of course, the banks didn’t really care because if people can’t PAY those loans back, the bank just foreclose on them and keep the house along with the money. Eventually that blew up in their faces. There’s also a constant stream of banks loaning money to each other, putting it into investments, etc.

tl;dr the Bank does all kinds of crazy shit with your money. If everyone decided we all want to withdraw everything from our accounts tomorrow, the banks don’t actually HAVE enough money in their overall supply to pay everyone. Now I don’t want to mislead you into thinking Banks are just evil. They’re not. The investing and wheeling and dealing that they do with your money can actually be quite good for the economy. That being said.. the Banks are making profit off this. LOTS of profit. Profit that theoretically could be in my hands and your hands.

**JESUS JUST TELL ME WHAT BITCOIN IS**  
Chill, Mary. What is the most important thing a bank does? They maintain those ledgers. Without that, none of the other stuff will work. But what if.. WHAT IF!! We could maintain those ledgers without actually needing a bank?

Well, that’s pretty much what Bitcoin does. It’s just software. If I send you 10 bitcoins (In my fantasies I actually have that kind of money) then it goes through the network and computers are used to automatically update the ledgers. It keeps a record of EVERY SINGLE transaction and dates all the way back to 2009 when bitcoin was created. Now you’re no longer trusting your bank to keep those records, you’re trusting a bunch of computer wizardry that’s not actually controlled by any one individual person or company. (Don’t worry, I’ll talk about the computer wizardry later)

Bitcoin has a finite supply just like Gold. Once all of it has been “mined” there won’t be anymore. Which means that if we as society all elect to use bitcoin, the value of each bitcoin will increase over time. More importantly, that also makes it a potentially good way to counteract some of the money you’re losing each year due to inflation. I personally think it’s unlikely that crypto will actually overtake something like the US Dollar, but they can certainly coexist in harmony.

It is all digital, so you don’t need to carry around cash or gold which is a pretty convenient feature for a “currency”. And it fits with many of the other ideal properties of a currency. It’s divisible, exchangeable, 1 bitcoin is always going to be equal to 1 bitcoin, and it’s clearly durable since you’re probably never gonna leave a bitcoin in your jeans and wash it by accident.

Most people want to get into cryptocurrencies selfishly because it’s beneficial to them. They see money to the moon want much rich quick doggo go quack quack. But there is actually another more ethical and economic reason why we should all be interested in cryptocurrency. There are currently 1.7 billion people in the world who don’t even HAVE banks, and they are statistically more likely to be impoverished. Making sure those people get banked and have equal financial opportunities as everyone else is not only the right thing to do, it’s also economically beneficial to us all because it introduces more people to the financial markets.

There are also countries that are using their own money, some of which are incredibly volatile (one day it’s worth a lot, the next day it’s worth a lot less). Cryptocurrencies are an alternative for them that COULD be more stable, and they also make it much more convenient trying to make transactions with people across the world. It cuts out some of the middlemen needed to do currency exchanges and online transactions and has much faster speeds for making payments and exchanges across the world.

And honestly, that’s the only explanation you need of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies you really need. I’m going to put off the more technical explanations for the end because I don’t want to scare people away.

But what’s the computer wizardry behind Bitcoin?Well, Bitcoin as I mentioned before, maintains a ledger. When I send you 10 bitcoins that ledger needs to be updated so that it removes 10 bitcoins from my account and adds 10 bitcoins into your account. But how do we determine whether or not that was a valid transaction? Well, if you’re familiar with checks (and I wouldn’t be surprised if some kid is reading this that’s never seen a check in their life. #oldmansadfeels) there are a couple things that you need to write on a check:

1. You have an account number (e.g. 8675309)
2. You’re putting in a dollar amount (e.g. $69 and 0/100 cents)
3. You have the person you’re sending the money to (e.g. Jenny)
4. You have a signature

These things are all represented when you make a bitcoin transaction. The software identifies and verifies that it’s you making this transaction in a secure way using cryptography. It takes a COMBINATION of your personal “private key” that nobody other than you can see, and COMBINES it with information about your transaction and converts it into an output that makes it virtually impossible for anyone to figure out what your “private key” is. This output is called your “public key” which everyone has access to.

Your “public key” is then combined with information about your transaction (such as who you’re sending cryptocurrency to, how much, etc.) and creates a digital signature that can ONLY be produced if the person who “signed it” has access to your private key.

Wait, real quick.. what is encryption?Well it’s a way to take an input of data and sort of scramble it so it’s difficult (but not impossible) to understand. An example is if you want to write a note to your friend in class about how hot Ryan Reynolds is but you don’t want your teacher to find out, you could both create a “language” where you change every letter in the alphabet to the right by one. So every “A” becomes a B and every B becomes a C etc. You can tell your friend Ryan Reynolds is “TP IPU!!!”

Now if you just see “TP IPU” it’s pretty hard to understand what that means. The average person would have to sit down and put some time in to try to figure out how to decipher it, but it’s not THAT secure or difficult to crack. However, for you and your friend it’s super easy to translate because you both know what the strategy is. Take “TP IPU” and move every letter to the left by one and you both know he is “SO HOT!!!”

But these computer algorithms are somewhat similar. They use a cryptographic “hash function” called SHA-256. Hash functions are not exactly like encryption, because they’re not designed be reversible. Let’s say my hash function is to multiply 2 numbers and I give you the number 1200. Now figure out what I used to come up with the number 1200.

It’s hard, but no impossible. There are a lot of numbers that multiply together to get 1200. In fact 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 16, 20, 24, 25, 30, 40, 48, 50, 60, 75, 80, 100, 120, 150, 200, 240, 300, 400, 600, 1200 are all factors of 1200. Without more information, I assume you probably couldn’t figure out which of these I originally multiplied in my head to get 1200. And this number is only 4 digits long, which is drastically smaller than any real number that would be used as a hash

But this information gets stored in a “block” which is basically just like a single page in a ledger. You can contain 500 transactions in a single block, so your transactions might be in a group with many other transactions, which is probably the same way the bank maintains their global ledgers. You might have your own account with the bank, but the overall bank database keeps a log of transactions for \*everyone\*.

All of these “blocks” are tied together. You can think of it like a conga line where the person behind you has their hands on your shoulders and you have your hands on the shoulders of the person in front of you. Unless the person in front of you is Ryan Reynolds, at which point you might be putting your hands a bit lower, but please just be respectful when kids are in the room.

The point being that because each of these blocks is tied together to the next block that follows it and the block that comes before it, they cannot be changed without screwing up the entire conga line. If you make changes to any ONE block in the blockchain, it will make changes to ALL of the other blocks.

**So how do we verify that these blocks are accurate?**  
Well, every block in the blockchain also has a certain number associated with it. Going back to the example where you and your friend are passing notes to each other, all you’re really doing is “shifting” the letters in the alphabet by 1 so that A becomes B, B becomes C, etc. But 1 was just a random number, you could’ve chosen to use 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, etc. Let’s call that number n.

Say I give you the sentence “rcfgrva qvqa'g xvyy uvzfrys”. I’m not going to tell you what the value of n is, you just know that you need to shift all the letters over by SOME number.

You would have to keep on trying different “shifts” until you finally get a coherent sentence, at which point you’ll know that the value of n = 13 and the message is “Epstein didn’t kill himself”

The blockchain kind of works like that. Again, keep in mind that I’m oversimplifying and that a hash function is much more secure and difficult to crack than our very simple “alphabet-shifting” algorithm.

But there is some number, where if the computer can “guess” what the number is (and the computer has to do this by literally just guessing and putting in random values until it receives “Epstein didn’t kill himself” at which point it knows that n = 13.

But if we just had ONE computer doing that, not only it would be super inefficient time-wise (guessing these numbers is very difficult and can take a lot of computation) and it also would NOT be decentralized. So the idea is that absolutely ANYONE can use their computer to do these computations for the blockchain. And ALL of these computers will get their own copy of the blockchain that they can potentially make changes to.

It’s worth noting that if only 3 people are using their computers to update the “ledgers”, it’s actually not very secure or decentralized. If 2 out of those 3 people conspire against the other person and have enough technical knowledge to feed the computer fraudulent data, they can very easily manipulate the “ledger” aka blockchain to say “hey, that other person owes us 2 million dollars”. But the more people we have using their computers, the more decentralized it gets and the harder it is to manipulate. Because it’s based on a group vote where computer 1 looks at their data, which says “Epstein didn’t kill himself” and computer 2 looks at their data, which says “Epstein didn’t kill himself”, and computer 3 looks at  their data and it says “Epstein killed himself” and both computers 1 and computers 2 vote that computer 3 has invalid data and is a big loser.

This consensus mechanism was essentially how Satoshi solved the byzantine generals problem. The more computers there are, the more secure the blockchain is. It's easy to manipulate the blockchain if there's only 3 computers, but it's MUCH harder if there are 1 million computers. Once there’s a consensus reached on which data is valid, ONE of these lucky computers gets to write to and update the blockchain (aka ledger) with the blockchain that has the most work put into it.

Here are some phenomenal resources for more details about the technical aspect of it that put me to shame:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_160oMzblY8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_160oMzblY8)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIDL\_akeras](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIDL_akeras)

But this process is basically bitcoin “mining”. Don’t get it confused, bitcoin mining is literally just leaving your computer on and letting it do all these computations for you. It obviously involves no real mining. It’s called “mining” because one lucky computer (hopefully YOUR computer), which managed to guess the correct number first, and that person will receive a certain amount of bitcoin. This is NEW bitcoin, that has yet to be “unearthed” from the supply, and this is the only way to “unlock” more bitcoin, similar to how going into a mine is the only way to “unearth” more of the world’s gold supply (which again, we noted there is a limited supply of both of these things. Once all of it has been mined, there will be none left. There will never be more than 21 million bitcoins).

This act of guessing the number is called “Proof of work” because it proves that your computer dedicated it’s resources to computing for the blockchain. Having these rewards for “miners” incentivizes people to mine for the blockchain. That being said, the more powerful your computer is, the higher your likelihood of being able to update the blockchain. They actually have computers that were built for the SOLE purpose of mining cryptocurrencies. Your average laptop probably won’t be super-efficient at making you a lot of money

This brings up two interesting questions. 1, what happens when all the bitcoin supply is mined? Will miners have incentive to keep mining? And the answer is that they will still receive parts of the transactional fees.The hope is that once the supply runs out, it raises the value of those fees and will still keep incentivizing people to mine. It’s not also not impossible that changes to the bitcoin network may need to be made.

**Another question to ask is if bitcoin relies on so much computational power, won’t that generate a LOT of wasteful energy?**

Here’s a great video addressing and debunking this question:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DidAwxWaDKI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DidAwxWaDKI)

While it’s true that Bitcoin can potentially require a lot of computational power if adopted on a more global scale, it can still theoretically be more “green” than using no crypto. In addition to this, “Proof of Work” is just one possible way of verifying transactions.

Note that Bitcoin was the first real implementation of it’s kind. Bitcoin is the giant that all other cryptocurrencies stand on the shoulders of. Many of the newer currencies have the benefit of being able to take everything Bitcoin does great and on finding solutions for areas for improvement. Instead of “Proof of Work” we can use “Proof of Stake” which platforms like Ethereum, Cardano, and many others are moving towards and will be far more energy efficient than Proof of Work. You literally just put your cryptocurrency up into a pool with a bunch of other people, and one user is chosen at random (but it takes into factor how much currency you’ve put in, how long you’ve put it in for, etc. so it’s not entirely “random”, some people have a better probability of being chosen than others). Then the person who won will have the ability to update the blockchain and receive the reward. All of the other aspects of how the blockchain, signatures, etc. work are all either similar or identical.

Now it is possible to create applications and credit cards that allow you to walk into starbucks and use Bitcoin to buy coffee (and they do exist already) but from what I can gather, Bitcoin honestly seems better fit to be a store of value, like gold. You don’t bring gold into starbucks and put it down on the register and say “give me a pumpkin spice latte” why the FUCK do you always make my job more complicated, Becky?

**So basically all this stuff is just a complex way of tracking payments and storing value?**
Well, no. It’s so much bigger than that, actually. Newer cryptocurrencies are capable of faster transactions per second with less energy usage. You can already see our society making movement toward mass adoption such as being able to buy Tesla cars and baseball tickets with cryptocurrency. Keep in mind, credit cards were first created in the 50’s and you couldn’t just pull up to any McDonald’s and pay with a credit until 2002.

That’s a pretty good indicator of how slow we are to adopt new technologies on a larger scale.

And these are just basic building blocks that could potentially lead the way to a much bigger and much more robust cryptocurrency economy. I know you see that there are 80 billion altcoins on the market, and many of them might just be “get rich quick” scams, but there are also a lot of genuine competitors who are currently trying to race to be the first one to really shape the future of the world.

Think of all the things you do with money. Buying stocks, opening a line of credit, buying insurance, paying taxes. People are actively working to make all of these things happen in crypto. You might see people refer to this as “Defi” or “Decentralized Finance”. Even the popularity of NFTs where you can buy artwork with cryptocurrencies shows different and creative ways that blockchain technology can be implemented beyond just “bank transactions”.

If you ever hear the term “smart contracts” just understand that they’re basic computer programs built on blockchain technology that tell the computer how to carry out a transaction. You could think of it somewhat similarly to how a vending machine works. Nobody is telling it what to do, but it is understood in the vending machine’s programming that if you give the machine a dollar, it will dispense the item that you selected, that the item will not be poisonous or expired, in most cases you can expect it to be cold, and you will receive any change back that you’re owed.

These smart contracts make this type of Decentralized Finance possible and note that the Bitcoin platform (again being the archetype) does not have smart contacts. However, many platforms like Ethereum do have smart contracts and others like Cardano are adding them in (I mention these because they are my favorites)

As I stated, this also provides us with an opportunity to give the billions of people who don’t have it already, access to something like insurance. If you don’t have insurance and your house burns down or you get into an accident, you’re completely screwed for life.

It also opens up the possibility for a more decentralized internet. Right now, a handful of companies control a vast majority of the internet. I could build a website and ask you to let me use your computer as a server, and you could rent out your computer to act as the server for my website when you’re not using it, and in exchange I’d pay you in some cryptocurrency. If we move towards decentralized apps, or “dapps” which are much more difficult to change, we can eliminate the “middlemen” who maintain and control these applications. For example, Uber is just an application that connects you with somebody willing to pick you up and drive you. You pay Uber, they take a chunk of the money to themselves, and give the driver the crumbs leftover. Theoretically we could write an app that decentralized and eliminates the middleman. You alert the application and say “Hey, I need a driver” and it connects you to a driver who comes to pick you up. The driver can get a bigger tip, you can pay less money. You both win.

Alright, now I’ve been fairly bullish here. I have lots of hope for the technology and it is honestly the stuff that a revolution can be built on. But here are some slightly bearish outlooks (followed by bullish comments I couldn’t help but add on)

My biggest peeve at the moment might be Robinhood. Cryptocurrency (and currency in general) is not meant to be daytraded. How seriously would we take the US dollar if one day it was worth 40 cents and the next day it was worth $1.20 and then there were people just constantly trading them around all the time trying to profit off the changes?

That said, there's a fair argument to the fact that the daytrading and speculation is undeniably drawing more attention to cryptos, which is a good thing. Sorta.

Still, the most important thing the cryptocurrency community can do as a whole to move towards acceptance on a national scale is stop buying every time the price goes up and stop selling every time the prices goes down. It’s not a casino or pyramid scheme, it’s revolutionary technology that has real life applications that can better the entire world, and you still have the chance to be at the forefront of it.

For Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to be accepted by the SEC as a store of value, we need to prove that they’re not excessively volatile. Robinhood is increasing the volatility of cryptos. Daytrading is increasing the volatility of cryptos. LITERALLY everyone holding crypto would be far richer if they just held for the long term than daytrading would EVER make you, because it’s the actual ADOPTION and social acceptance/implements of the stuff is what makes it valuable.  The $500 you made off doge isn’t shit compared to the money you could make if you’re holding coins for a platform that eventually grows into a trillion dollar industry (note that doge does not have smart contracts either).

This also seems like a convenient time to point out that the chair of the SEC has already stated that crypto is a store of value, and that getting the SEC on our side is 100% possible if people act appropriately. Mind you, the chair of the SEC taught on an entire class on Blockchain finance at M.I.T. and he is very much still on the fence in his position on cryptocurrencies and well-informed on the topic. Any narrative that says the SEC is wagging their finger at cryptocurrency without giving it valid consideration is false. They can be convinced, but we are the ones that need to convince them. It starts making wiser investment decisions.

This is all still pretty high risk and high reward. Don’t get too caught up in the hype of crypto because frankly it’s impossible to peg down which of the hundreds of competing platforms will still be around in 20+ years, and frankly if people get scared away from cryptocurrency because they had a bad experience where you told them to buy and they lost money, the process of moving toward these changes is going to take much longer.

Which brings me to my next point. There’s currently no crypto ETF. Why do you want a crypto ETF? It’s exactly like I said, there are hundreds of competing platforms and no way to be 100% sure that they will be around in 20+ years. An ETF basically gathers all of them into one big bucket (metaphorically). If the price of one goes up and another goes down, they cancel each other out. Generally speaking, an ETF is the “safest” way to invest your money and get slow, consistent gains with less volatility. That doesn’t mean ALL ETF’s are good. You can have an ETF with the worst 20 altcoins you can find on /r/cryptomoonshots and it’s absolutely worthless. But if you can gather up a bunch of the most likely ones to succeed and put them in an ETF, the outcome is much more likely to be positive.

**How do we get an ETF?**  
Win over the SEC. See my previous comments.

dApps are great in theory but they’re more complicated in reality. In general, the most difficult part of decentralizing this stuff is trying to update the software, and it’s going to be a long time before the status quo is changed, if ever. It’s entirely possible someone could write a piece of software with an incredibly hazardous bug in it and it’s more difficult to change.

In theory everything is supposed to be decentralized, but even in this intermediate stage of decentralization we just see changing of middlemen. Instead of us interfacing with bankers to maintain our money, we now interface with apps which are making companies profits every time they take a piece of the transaction fees. Which one is “better” really depends on the tradeoff between how much you’re paying them versus how secure you feel your money is (not in terms of ""hacking"" but ""secure"" in the sense of volatility. That your $10 today will still be worth $10 tomorrow), but as crypto becomes more common, it’s inevitable that those fees will increase and we’ll just be stuck with more of the same.. or worse.

Anyway, I honestly did not imagine myself writing this much. I’m 10 pages in on a word file. But this stuff is certainly very interesting to me. I’m incredibly optimistic about the possibilities that can come from crypto, but at the end of the day it’s the actions of the people who determine whether or not any of it actually has value in the future. In a sort of hyperbolic analogy, we could have a scientific breakthrough like a cure for cancer, where the underlying science, math, engineering that all went on behind the scenes were revolutionary and able to create something that’s never been done before and capable of making the world a better place, but it’s absolutely useless if everyone refuses the cure and people just sell it back and forth to each other in hopes of getting a profit rather than use it for what it's intended for.

As of now, even the safest cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum should be considered fairly high-risk with high reward potential. That’s not a bad thing. If you’re investing your money in a well-diversified portfolio you SHOULD have money in low risk low reward, medium risk medium reward and high risk high reward assets. And I personally don’t think there are any better prospects for high risk high reward investments than crypto because of the remarkable upside, the technology, and the resilience it has shown so far.

I've been assuming the best case scenario for crypto, but the reality is that the regulation and banning is absolutely possible anywhere in the world. Crypto will still exist underground, it's impossible to fully ""Ban"" crypto, but acceptance on the global scale that we would all like to idealize may be much harder/take longer to reach with resistance. Still, some of the most incredible minds of our time are putting in effort to create and improve on these features and it's hard to compete with the innovators of academia.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,"Let me introduce you to the next big trend after Crypto, DEFI and NFT: Play to Earn! [Had tons of work with this, I'm stoked!!!)","The recent NFT (Non fungible token) hype allowed us a brief glimpse into the future of digital technologies that are based on blockchain technology.

While people still debate about the possibilities of NFTs another soon to be trend emerged from the shadows of blockchain technology, utilizing everything we new until now and combining it to something truly miraculous.

I’m talking about play to earn.  


[ “The next evolution in how people play, work and live” — Napoleon…probably ](https://preview.redd.it/2uwrf1cup4y61.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db145e4b0f333792988dc4b20194c9fbb8378922)

 

Play to earn isn’t a full gowns system like free-to-play, pay-to-play or buy to play. It isn’t limited like those aforementioned variants and it currently is more like a vision.

Something that most people currently don’t understand and if they do do it’s more like a faint picture of what could be, like when we look at futuristic landscapes that may or may not be in a thousand years.

But this new trend is emerging rapidly. It will overwhelm the gaming industry, before we even realize what was going on and afterwards we will ask ourselves how we could ever play games without it.

&amp;#x200B;

[ “Some people can only see what is already there, others see what might could be and bring it into reality” -ScoobyDoo…I think ](https://preview.redd.it/f0smp5z7q4y61.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc129615243e7e823b00ddda06eb4c6e10993745)

Twenty years ago, the majority of people scoffed at gamers. They had a picture of an ugly guy in their minds. One that sits in their mom’s basement and has no social skills.

Today the gaming industry is bigger than movie, books, and music combined.  


  


[Source: marketwatch- I'm to afraid to post a link](https://preview.redd.it/id5jvvxhq4y61.png?width=588&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3236b0187a00229c36e8a74c2d88a9a328cd5ceb)

 

But we are not stopping here. The next destination is Oasis from “Ready Player One”. Envision a interconnected ingame world, in which every game has it’s own economy and every item, skill, building, land, object, person and system within the economy has a $ value attached to it.

In other words, 

# Ordinary players will earn a living, an hourly wage, not by being one of the best, but by merely playing the game like all the others. No need for a job. The fun game itself will provide a stable income

that is what play to earn promises. and it is by no means and easy promise to make. Ad we are only at the beginning of this new era of gaming.  


As soon as you play a game free-to-play, earn your first tokens and withdraw them to an exchange…

… it’s a mind-blowing experience because you suddenly realise what play to earn could mean in your personal live:

**“ I played this game for an hour and earned a certain amount of dollars and I can withdraw the money and spend it to pay my bills…**  


[ Virtual Items=Real Value, Virtual Economies= Real Economies, virtual currencies=real currencies = WEALTH CREATION ](https://i.redd.it/t37fvby1r4y61.gif)

 

**Why would I ever play a normal game again if at the same time I can play something that’s moderately entertaining and earn while doing it.”**

It is the future and these new ""genre"" of games will give people a glimpse into what’s coming.  


For those of you who never looked at play to earn games. Here are a few:  


\- Gods Unchained (Trading Card Game) Token: No Token but hundred thousands of nfts sold!

\- Axie Infinity  **Market Cap $440,022,237**   (Pokemon, Tamagotchi) Tokens: AXS, SLP, even **ELON MUSK** HEARD ABOUT IT  


[Yep, one of the richest guys in the world knows about play to earn.](https://preview.redd.it/cil9rvtbs4y61.png?width=599&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bad53296cd6f773fbe15be024eacb2c0ae72197c)

\- AlienWorlds (Metaverse)  **Market Cap $480,840,667**  Token: TLM (You can't call it a game yet, more like a economic experiment, but already attracted a million players, that earn between $4 and $400 a month just by clicking a few times a day)

\- CryptoBlades: Token: SKILL **Market Cap $530,000** (AlienWorlds Competitor, Fantasy Game, Binance)

\- MyNeighbor Alice Token: ALICE  **Market Cap $240,118,514** ( like HarvestMoon)  


Just look at Coinmarketcap or Coingecko. There are a ton of upcoming NFT, play to earn games.  


In my humble opinion, play to earn games will dominate the entire gaming market within the next 20 years. If you see one with potential, that is where you should focus your attention. 

**DOGE** proved once and for all that a enthusiastic community doesn't even need a product to generate massive amounts of money.  


Just imagine World of Warcraft, Call of Duty or any of the other franchises as projects with a Token. Fully integrated into the economies. Then imagine a coinmarketcap with hundreds if not thousands of triple A games listed there, like ethereum and bitcoin.   


CAN YOU EVEN IMAGINE WHAT THE MARKETCAP OF THOSE PROJECTS WOULD LOOK LIKE?   


NEVER IN THE HISTORY OF HUMAN KIND DID WE EXPERIENCE WHAT HAPPENS IF A GAMING ECONOMY e.g every piece of land, equipment, virtual avatar, skill, ... HAS REAL VALUE.  


I tell you right know: There will be games, which ingame economies will be bigger than most real world states. AND... man i stop right now, before my excitement kills me. I think you guys get the point.

 IF you decide to APE into any crypto gaming project in the future, consider this:  


 

* Crypto Gaming Projects are heavily tied to the overall market volatility. If the market goes down, the same will most likely apply to Tokens and Nfts
* You should always consider everything in Crypto High Risk
* Always do your own research and never invest based on what anyone else is saying, even if it Is Warren Buffet
* Don’t invest more than you are willing to lose.  


**TLDR: Earning money by playing a game, powered by tokenomics and ingame economics is the future. The game company essentially becomes a central bank of the virtual system. The can create any monetary system they like. The sky is the limit.**

dogecoin,1st ever reddit post from $DOGE newbie,"Wanted to share newbie experience in case it may help other newbies out there. Sorry for the length.

I am a long-time lover of all things DOGE after first seeing Kabosu’s (real-life dog from the meme) precious and uniquely indescribable face!  I’m not an active user of social media but the DOGE hype managed to get even my attention, and I thought it sounded like a great way to support the DOGE community.  I started with a small $50 investment on RH (the only way I could purchase in NY at that time) and built that up to 1K. 

I was happy.  DOGE was doing well, and I was holding out hope that RH would soon allow me to withdraw/use my DOGE. Not long after, though, things spiraled downward when the $$ started to roll in and I got greedy.  (Not saying that caring about money is wrong – not at all!  Yes, it isn’t everything, but we all know it does impact quality of life.)   I am only saying that the $$ affected my decision making and I got caught up in the roller coaster ride.  Had I just stayed with my initial investment of 1K, I would have easily (well, maybe not easily, but firmly) managed to HODL the course. But as we (my husband, too) invested more and more money later and later into the game with only $$ on our minds, we became much too emotionally invested with every rise and dip. In the end, we decided to curtail our trip to the moon. ☹

I’m sharing this with you because I am hoping that perhaps it will prevent someone else from making my mistakes or give some solace if you ended up in the same boat as I.  To any who may be able to relate, I want to say:

Don’t give up on DOGE.  I pulled my money out of RH for several reasons:

I got greedy and started to feed the DOGE more than I really was prepared to lose, so when things got dicey, I panicked and bailed.  (main reason)

I realized I wasn’t truly emotionally prepared for the ups/downs (or pumps/dumps as I think of them now), so I needed to take a step back.

I got fed up of RH’s nonsense “technical issues”

Whether you choose to buy, trade, sell DOGE, it’s your personal decision based on your individual circumstances, and I hope you don’t feel guilty for doing what you feel you need to do.  But, please, do listen to the many experienced DOGE traders when they tell you not to invest more than you are prepared to lose.  And heed their warnings when they say not to get too emotionally caught up in the moment-to-moment price.  And know that even when you do listen to their advice, you still might find yourself engaging in these counterproductive behaviors anyway.  Take comfort!  You are not alone!  We all make bad decisions sometimes.

But I STILL BELIEVE IN DOGE!!  And I invested some of my piddly RH gains back into DOGE on GEMINI.  It wasn’t much, but I will continue to add more here and there when I can.  At least on Gemini (newly added and only option in NY other than RH), even with the fees, I have more peace of mind knowing that I can own my DOGE and the app won’t crash on me when I need to use it.

Good luck, fellow Shibes!  There can be a lot of hate and noise out there, but I just ignore those comments and posts.  The true members of the DOGE community are so supportive and want only the best for you and $DOGE.  REMEMBER – DO ONLY GOOD EVERYDAY!",cryptocurrency
stocks,"The love/hate mating dance of Cathie Wood (ARK) with this subreddit, her take on this correction and her strategy going forward","Preface: I'm **not** invested in any ARK funds myself. I do hold some of the stocks in her funds.

Loved by most of this subreddit in 2020. Hated by most in 2021. Yikes. In the past 3 months, correlating with the sharp drop in most of her funds (Most of them have dropped 30%+ since February), more and more people have started critizing ARK. ARK has seen outflows of more than $750 million in the last week. Now, everyone has a different take on whether her stock picks will do well or not, that's fine. I think we can all agree that 2020 has been an extraordinary year, with growth / tech / speculative stocks being the absolute winners of this mad year, mostly due to historically never before seen low interest rates, but also affected by a huge in-flow of new investors, support packages which are focused on certain sectors (Clean energy for example). More traditional sectors have underperformed last year, yet we've been seeing an institutional rotation away from speculative stocks into more value oriented names. 

However, let's not forget that pretty much all ARK funds are still up 300%+ up from the beginning of 2020. And while the sectors ARK is heavily invested in outperformed hard, they are most likely primed to underperform this year as institutions rotated away with interest rates picking back up and the global economy slowly opening again. Is this a problem though? No. 300% in a year is insanity. This is a healthy correction. And while it may hurt seeing your portfolio like this, this is a good moment to remember why you invested the way you did (and also a good moment for self-reflection). 

Whether the criticism she's getting lately is deserved, i'll leave that up for debate. Some of her picks are HIGHLY questionable in my opinion, yet i also see some as primed for explosive growth in the upcoming 5/10 years. She has also received a lot of criticism on here for selling her bigger blue chip stocks. Is this warranted? How does she view this correction?   


“I love this setup,” she said Friday on CNBC’. “The worst thing that could have happened to us is to have the market narrowly focus on just our ilk of stock — the innovation space. From our point of view — five-year time horizon — nothing has changed except the price,” she said. Back in February, Wood expected a 15% compound annual rate of return from her strategies, but after the recent fall in prices, she envisions that number rising to between 25% and 30%.""

In other words, she welcomes this. Now, obviously she would not say this is a disaster, as she is the fund manager. But there is also truth to her statement. Now, why does she love this setup? She sees this as an amazing buying opportunity, now that prices have dropped. But where does she get the money from? Mainly her blue chips, which is heavily debated on this sub.

 “The FAANGs certainly meet that criteria — they’re acting like defensives,” she said. “During a period of volatility like we’ve just seen, we will sell those stocks and move into either our more pure-play or earlier-stage innovation companies that are being hurt by risk-off.”  

I actually wrote a quite comprehensive piece on this (on this subreddit as well), diving deeper into her strategy, and how she exectutes this. To read more about this, click [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mtb0kc/analyzing_cathie_woods_ark_strategy_in_a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). 

Let's not forget that most people (even fund managers) do not beat the market over a long term (and even less on a risk-adjusted basis). ARK funds have outperformed in 2020, and will most likely underperform in the short term. Whether it will underperform in the long term, who knows. Imo, she has some holdings that i do not see a future in, and her projections and valuations are... Rich to say the least. But let's not forget she was right with her earlier Tesla valuation when everyone called her crazy. It's also possible that this correction gives her the ability to make changes in her portfolio's for favorable prices, and thus makes higher returns possible. 

This is not financial advice. Do your own research.

Happy learning friends!",cryptocurrency
algorand,"May i ask why you choose algorand instead of other environments? I was asked this in a thread and the answer turned into an essay, enjoy!","I'm coming from a web development background, I first found out about crypto with bitcoin around 2009 after the 2008 collapse and missed out on that opportunity now the recent crypto bull market with the backdrop of the USA's nonstop 'quantitative easing"" and the record low bank interest rates, which have been historically low for an historic time 10ys+, the COVID crisis and rampant public spending I have a feeling Blockchain skills will be quite valuable in the coming decade.

So I recently explored the viable smartcontract blockchains Ether, cardano, Polkadot, and finally thankfully Algorand. Here are my initial thoughts on those blockchains and why I ultimately chose Algorand to begin with.

Ether: Solidity is a good language although for me even coming from a background of web development it's just not fun to read and I suspect has a steep learning curve, I was still interested because it is Etherum the largest viable blockchain until I researched the state of its blockchain and the crippling gas fees and ridiculous tx speed which makes ether only useful as a store of value until they upgrade.

Cardano: I took one look at their Dev Docs and was immediately turned off Haskell is a nightmare and their ""Marlowe"" contracts with ""Oracles"" yeah a mess, that's as far as I got into that storm.

Polkadot: I must admit I do like polkadot and I will explore it in the future but it is built on rust which I am not familiar with, and rust is a opensource programming language with public vulnerabilities will this be a problem when its is actually being used for millions of financial transaction's worth billions of dollars? Also the architecture of the actual blockchain is unique I need more research before I can comment on it.

Algorand: Then I stumbled upon Algorand sitting around #43 on CMC at the time, I began researching it studied its blockchain and the capabilities and was shocked at its market cap I mean how could this diamond go unnoticed its better than ADA and Ether right now! I was sold, I dived into the Dev Docs, unsurprisingly it delivered, and there it was TEAL I was enraptured by this language its beautiful, robust, private and secure easy to understand and I can write smartcontracts/ ASA's in JavaScript/PyTeal/Python that was the dealmaker for me.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,"22 years old, in college, and will graduate with ~80-90k in loans.","Hello everyone! This post is a long time awaited. To give a little background:

I'm a 22 year old fulltime college student. I'm getting my master's degree in a healthcare field that will (unfortunately) not pay the greatest (Athletic Training...). That's my first regret. I wish I had chosen a nursing degree but I have one year left until I graduate so I'm riding out this degree before I figure anything else out.  Starting salary? Anywhere from 40-55k. I'll have the ability to work per diem on the weekends. Anyways, getting back to my debt:

I have \~60k in private loans. My parents never attended college and I was the first person in the family to go to college. They never saved for me nor did any form of financial planning so I was ""forced"" to take private loans out. (I'm not blaming them at all, just wish I was more financially aware when I was a stupid senior in high school). I pay $129 per month to cover the interest for half of the loans, but the other half I do not need to make payments until after I graduate.

I will graduate with \~$20-25k in federal loans. Some subsidized, some unsubsidized. I believe they have been in forbearance for the last year.

My total debt by the time I graduate will be anywhere from \~$80-90k.

Currently, I'm in my last 12 months of school. A part of my program is taking summer classes this summer, then a fall and spring semester where I will be ""Working"" fulltime (NOT getting paid, it's a part of my 'education') until I graduate in may next year. My expenses for this upcoming year will be:

\- 6 months of rent ($3-5k). After 6 months I will be living home for the spring semester to complete my residency. Fortunately my parents will not charge me any expenses (I have this covered in my bank account)

\- One year of tuition ($15k, but I will have the ability to take out federal loans that will reduce my cost \~$2.5k per semester)

If all goes well I will graduate, pass my boards, then seek a fulltime position. In addition to this, I can work do a lot of per diem work that pays $25-35 an hour. I plan to do this AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. Additionally, I plan to refinance my loans when I graduate. Like I said, I will be living home (if I can find a position near my parents house) for a couple years as they have given me the option to stay for as long as possible.

Moving on, I'd like to note that I have $30k invested between ETFs, stocks, and cryptocurrency (10% of my investments). I've worked my whole life and if I haven't spent money on rent, books, food, or any other living expense, it goes to my investments. I would like to note that my spending is not out of control, if I would even consider myself to have spending money. I rarely go to bars, I don't buy things for myself, and I do a great job at saving my money (whatever money I make, if it's anything), seriously.

Currently, my only form of income is through gig-work. Last year I made over $10,000 with Instacart and have recently started up Doordash. It has given me the freedom to not need to take out any more private loans and I'm so blessed because of it. These are the only jobs that work for me because my academic schedule between tests, quizzes, and residency is hectic. Some weeks school requires 80 hours of work and other weeks it requires 20 hours of work. This part stinks because it leaves a regular paying job out of the picture. Also, I will be moving home after the next 6 months so I'm not sure if I can even get a job that will want me only for me to leave in a couple months. Either way, I'm open for any form of work, and if I have the time to do it, I'll do it. Side work, tasks, anything, I want to take it on to make some money. If anybody has ideas regarding this, please let me know. 

Finally, I'd like to seek some opinions about what I should do regarding the money I have, the money I owe, and the interest that will accrue in the future. Please avoid any negative comments as this has given me GREAT deals of stress -- I've lived the last 2 years of my life regretting my degree (I wish so badly that I didn't tell myself ""I only have a couple years left"" when I had the opportunity to switch), jealous of friends that are making $60k+ out of school, and overall depressed regarding allowing myself to go into this kind of debt.

Summary:

* I will graduate with $80-90k in debt. $30k of those are federal loans that are currently in forbearance.
* I will pull in $5-15k between now and the time I graduate. The gig market changes all the time. Additionally I flip things on the internet that pulls in some side money.
* By the time I graduate I will hopefully land a job that pays &gt;$40k. Either way, I plan to work as much as possible throughout my weeks, even if that includes super early mornings or late nights.
* I have $30k in an investment portfolio that is mixed between stocks, ETFs, indexes, and cryptocurrency (10% of my portfolio is in crypto).

My current plan: continue to keep my investments invested, get a fulltime salaried job, and begin paying off my loans to their maximum extent. I'm talking, 90%+ to each paycheck will go to some of my student loans (my parents are great enough to cover my car, phone, any other living expense). Being in debt is so depressing.

Thank you for taking the time to read this. I will be available to respond to anybody as soon as possible as I have notifications set on my phone.",finance

personalfinance,25k student loan Asap.,"I am in a little bit of a conundrum and if someone could point me in the right direction I would be very happy. 2020 was the worst year of my life. I went to college at the American University of Armenia and the authorities there illegally extorted me and subsequently my parents out of a lot of money. I aged very quickly and have legit insomnia now. Long story short  2 years have past and I am now 20. Thank the Lord I am heading back to New York soon. Unfortunately, however, my parents are ultra-conservative anti-vax control freaks and they are forcing me to cohabitate with them and go to community college under the pretext that I need to work and pay them back. However, I need to be independent, get a real degree, and take a break from unbearable people. I have indeed added to their debt load and I am obligated to pay them back. To re-build my life I need a 25k long-term low-interest student loan that I can use to give to my parents Asap. I am currently applying to a wide range of colleges in the northeast. Brooklyn cuny looks promising due to its 3k yearly tuition cost. I am currently in the process of securing a job that can pay me a salary of 3k to 5k tops in a month depending on my hours.  Please direct me to where I could promptly qualify for such a loan. I assume student loans have more desirable qualities than conventional ones. I don't know if I should seek federal or private loans. I don't know which institutions to approach for the most desirable deal. Someone, please provide me direction. Thank you in advance.",finance

personalfinance,15-year mortgage or 30-year mortgage with prepayment?,"Looking to buy a house quite soon, and have been planning on getting a 15-yr fixed rate mortgage and paying it off quickly to improve cash flow as soon as possible. However, I'm sure most of you know how tough this current housing market is for buyers, and most of the good options are a bit beyond what we'd normally want to be spending.

One place we want to put an offer on would put us at monthly payments at just under 30% of our take-home, which is a little high. As such, we've been considering getting a 30-year and paying additional payments on a regular basis, so we can still pay the loan off over the same period as the 15-year, but with a slightly higher interest rate affording us a bit more flexibility if need be.

Would appreciate any thoughts/experiences regarding the tradeoff b/w a 15-yr and 30-yr + prepayment. Thanks",finance
dogecoin,"SpaceX, DOGE-1, and Interplanetary Commerce","Don't forget SpaceX's goals are ultimately focused on interplanetary colonization.

Cryptocurrency is going to be crucial for this to succeed considering the complexity of transactions between different countries countries on Earth or even between different banks, and that's not even taking into consideration the fees. Imagine how much more complex this would become when all of that empty space starts getting in the way.

I think it's incredibly likely that these colonizers would end up developing a regional currency of their own after just a few generations and that may suffice, but even then, what happens when we have interplanetary commerce?

How are people going to use a currency a that's controlled by a single bank(the Fed) is in control of their money when they're on Mars? How are banks going to transfer funds to other banks on different planets?

SpaceX taking payment in Doge is a **statement** that cryptocurrency is going to be the go-to currency in interplanetary commerce, and they're investing early because they truly believe that they will be able to achieve this vision and believe that cryptocurrency is going to be the way they do business in the future and are stocking up now because it will compound exponentially in the centuries to come, and will become a large source of generational wealth for both people and businesses.

Many of the naysayers of Doge are very short-term thinkers financially, and maybe they're right, the inflation of doge may limit it's price in our lifetime, and the huge supply will limit it's price in our lifetime. But SpaceX is forward thinking enough to realize that sure, maybe Doge is a risky bet for a couple of decades, but all of it's short term weaknesses(in terms of years/decades) are exactly what will help it become the ultimately currency of the galaxy over the next few centuries.

There's a reason Mark Cuban is taking payments in Doge and promising to never sell it. He doesn't need the money at all, but it will create immense generational wealth. There's a reason SpaceX is taking Doge, and it's because it will allow them to do conduct business with others tens or hundreds of millions of miles away.",cryptocurrency

gaming,Assassin's Creed Odyssey starts off kind of... lame? [Spoilers],"I'm getting the sense AC Odyssey might not be the right game for me, which I find kind of bizarre given how much I liked AC Origins (after having 0 expectations from the franchise, I might say). I don't know, I just don't find Alexios all that interesting when compared to Bayek, and I get the feeling the game is hellbent on shoving Alexio's tragic backstory down my throat at every step, without really earning it.

I've barely made it to the point where you first enter the Ancient Forge, and immediately upon exiting I get this completely out-of-place cutscene with Kassandra blabbering about the Cult of Kosmos and how they're gonna take over the world or something. I mean, who even thought this might be a good scene? Whatever build-up the game seemed to have towards presenting Kassandra as this merciless warrior is just completely thrown out the window, in favor of a silly scene between two siblings. I just stopped playing shortly after because the whole thing felt so fake, so weak in execution. I thought presenting Nikolaos so early in the game also felt very lazy, and the whole family dynamic feels so forced it's really off-putting.

Instead of having a story, I feel like I'm being fed a poorly written family drama, as there's seemingly nothing else going on. I don't know man, maybe I'm burned out from AC Origins? I played that one back in 2018, so there must be more to it.

personalfinance,"With an interest rate below 3%, is there any reason to pay off a mortgage early?","The way I see it, my mortgage is currently shrinking due to inflation faster than I'm paying interest on it.

Houses are one of the only things you're allowed to take out such large loans on, and with interest rates below 3%, fractional reserve banking is legitimately the only way banks are currently beating inflation through loans, and you basically get to benefit from that by getting a loan that is practically paying YOU interest decreasing in value due to inflation, while you slowly obtain an appreciating asset.

personalfinance,401k loan for Student Loans,"Hey everyone, I've recently been contemplating a 401k loan to help pay off my wife's student loans from law school. My wife has approx 120k in student loans and they have been in forbearance since the covid relief bill passed last year and are set to restart payments in the fall. We've just been holding onto the normal monthly payments and will make them as a lump sum principal payment once payments restart. The interest rate for these loans is between 6.5 and 8%. We're both 28, I've got 130k in my 401k and am contributing 20% of my salary to my 401k (this won't change whether or not I take the loan). We've set up a Roth IRA for my wife that is maxed out and contribute 3% to a simple IRA her boss set up to take advantage of the match her employer offers.

My 401k plan allows me to take 1 loan up to 50k to a max of 5 years at 4.5%. If I take a loan right as her student loans return to standard payments, paying 50k as a principal payment saves me approximately 30-35k in interest to the loan servicer (assuming I did the math right) and I'd be paying my loan back to myself at the above mentioned 4.5%. I know taking a 401k loan is generally a terrible idea but in this case I'm struggling to see a huge downside. I should also mention I have no intention of leaving my job and am aware that if I do with a loan open, I owe the entirety of it back immediately or suffer a huge tax penalty.

Appreciate any thoughts on this as I'm really torn on what to do",finance

CryptoCurrency,Destructive Monetary Policy is how the Crypto Market goes to the Moon!,"Ever the pandemic hit and the FED has announced unlimited QE, the markets, including crypto, has been pumping non stop. The result is ever increasing wealth inequality in the midst of an economic depression and a pandemic. Forget the fundamental crypto analysis; the FED's actions has made them irrelevant.

&amp;#x200B;

 [How Much Money Was Printed In 2020 Visualized (demonocracy.info)](https://demonocracy.info/infographics/usa/us_stimulus_package_10_trillion_2020/us_stimulus_package_10_trillion.html) 

&amp;#x200B;

The wealthy elites does not know how to plan for a crisis, they only know how to make money, so when the pandemic hit, they were losing money so they decided to ask their friends at the FED to not only print trillions of dollars, but to get them to buy corporate bonds and debt, bailing them out.

&amp;#x200B;

And since the elite own most of the stocks, they were the first to get rich during the pandemic by virtue of the cantillion effect (whoever get the new money first wins while the others lose).

 [The Cantillon Effect: The Global Elite's Secret End Game (georgegammon.com)](https://www.georgegammon.com/cantillon-effect-global-elites-secret-end-game-agenda-exposed/) 

&amp;#x200B;

The FED is sending a message to the investor class, that no matter how s\*\*\* your investment is, you can still make a lot of money. We have already seen this happening with joke coins like DOGE and scam coins like Safemoon.

&amp;#x200B;

This is how crypto fits. Now the wealthy elites have more money to spend thanks to the government, what do you think they are going to spend it on? Stocks, real estate, and now crypto. All assets that have been rising over the past year.

&amp;#x200B;

The proper response from the retail investor is to throw his/her money into the same assets that the wealthy elites are investing their money, so that he/she also benefits from the cantillion effect. This allows the retail investor to ride the wave instead of being left behind.

&amp;#x200B;

The money printer has essentially removed the ceiling of the entire market. With institutional investors and rich celebrities also getting in the mix, the new money is flowing into crypto, taking the market to ATHs. BTC can easily 100k or even 200k. ETH can be 20K one day etc.

Should I liquidate all my stocks at a loss and then buy assets that protect against inflation? Or should I just hold them for the long term like I was supposed to do?

CryptoCurrency,Federal Reserve Bank President Says Bitcoin Is Clearly a Store of Value – 🚀🚀🚀🚀,,cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Refinancing from 7/1 to 15 or 30 year,"Hey all.

First time home buyer with very little knowledge even after doing a ton of research before buying. I bought about a year ago using a 7/1 because it was a 2.25% compared to 3.25% for the 15 year. 

I am now starting to get a little nervous just in case after my 7 years I end up maxing out my interest rate on my adjustable. So I am looking into refinance options.

I am seeing a lot of quotes on 15, 20 and 30 years with less than 2.8%. Looking at the costs to refinance based from these nerdwallet quotes, it doesn't seem expensive. At all. I was expecting 2-3% of my remaining mortgage cost (230k so 4-6k) but based on nerdwallet, some companies like Sebonic (never heard of them) offer a bunch of credits and total cost is very cheap.

Am I just being 'gaslighted' so I go ahead and start looking and then they throw it on me at the end? Has anyone refinanced recently, and if so, how much was it?

Thanks for the help!",finance

“Coin crowding” is here... In January, Bitcoin made up 70% of total crypto value (which was $1T). As altcoins like Doge and Ethereum have rallied, Bitcoin now makes up less than 50% of crypto market cap — which has doubled to over $2T. Now, smaller altcoins like DigiByte, VeChain and SafeMoon are gaining traction. But the Fed just warned that asset prices are vulnerable to significant declines if investor sentiment shifts. And it's possible that out of hundreds of coins, only a few might survive over time.

CryptoCurrency,"The Basic of Cryptocurrency - Everything You Need to Know, As Simple as Possible","!! This is going to be a long post !! Please bear with me. I **will** make you understand.

Welcome to my self-made explanation post! I've seen a lot of questions about how crypto works, what is blockchain, what is Proof of Work, what is Proof of Stake, what is staking, etc.

I believe the main reason people don't understand crypto fully is because there are too many technical terms people have never heard before, so in this post I will try to explain everything I could understand in 4 months of my existence in crypto space as simple as possible, without using any terms you have never heard before. Literally an ELI5 explanation.

Please note that I am not an expert, so if there is any mistake or misinterpretation in my explanation please kindly leave a comment to let me know :) Also, I'm not native English speaker so forgive my grammar mistake if there's any and my limited vocabulary.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**SECTION 1 --------** ***WHAT IS CRYPTOCURRENCY?***

***CRYPTOCURRENCY*** is just another currency, like the one you use everyday to buy chocolate from your local store. In this community, people call your everyday currency as ***fiat*** currency. Fiat currency could be US Dollar, European Euro, Japanese Yen, Chinese Yuan, and much more.

***WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE?***

Unlike fiat currency, which is physical and can be touched with your hand, cryptocurrency is just **a bunch of data**.

Let me ask a question. Have you ever send a money to your family through a bank? With a click of a button, the money appears in your family's account. Well, **it doesn't work like that.** What actually happen is :

1. You give your money to bank in location A
2. The money is stored in location A
3. Bank A tell their branch in location B about this transaction
4. Bank B give the money they store in location B to your family

So the money you held just a moment ago never truly reach your family. The one your family received, it's different piece of paper. You can't teleport a physical thing.

Now, since cryptocurrency is just a bunch of data, you send this data to your family and they receive that exact same data. This is possible thanks to internet.

***BUT DATA CAN BE HACKED. ISN'T IT RISKY?***

That is why we have ***crypto***, it is derived from **cryptography.** In cryptography, people learn how to **encrypt** data to make sure only you and the receiver can read that data. You know, just like in movies where special forces need time to solve passwords to their enemies' secret information.

***THAT'S NOT SAFE ENOUGH! SPECIAL FORCES CAN STILL HACK IT, RIGHT?!***

Exactly. That's why we need to move to section 2.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

***SECTION 2 -------- DECENTRALIZATION, THE BIRTH OF BLOCKCHAIN, BITCOIN, PROOF OF WORK, and its SECURITY***

Did you know that there are only two people in this world that holds the secret recipe of KFC's fried chicken? Did you know that they are not allowed to fly in the same plane because just in case one had an accident, the secret recipe won't vanish from this world?

Have you ever heard that in a submarine, you are only allowed to shoot your torpedo if at least 2 of the high ranked officer on board agreed to open fire so they can't abuse this power for their own benefit?

KFC stores their secret recipe in **2 ""locations""**, in submarine you need **2 approvals** to execute an action.

What if you can store your money in **everyone's computer all around the world**, and need **thousands of approval** from everyone all around the world to execute a transaction?...

? : ***""KNOCK KNOCK!""***

me : ""***WHO'S THERE?""***

? : ***""SATOSHI NAKAMOTO!""***

me : ***""SATOSHI WHO?""***

~~Satoshi :~~ ***~~""ELON!""~~***

nobody knows who Satoshi Nakamoto is, but this madman introduced the first cryptocurrency to the world back in 2009. It was **Bitcoin**.

Satoshi saw some problems in fiat currency. Here are 2 of the main problems :

1. Fiat currency is inflationary, which means they are being produced without limit and das not good according to economy
2. Fiat is regulated by central authority (which is government and bank).

Remember how your money never arrive to your family what if the bank refused to send it to your family with whatever reason they made? There are people out there having their dead mother's account **closed** and her children never got to touch that money, even though it's their. Sue them? You sure you can win?

Wanna hear a classic story about a poor man who worked his life for some saving, only to find out his saving is worth nothing because money keep getting printed like crazy because greedy politics never end? I don't want to talk about it. My heart hurts every time I think about how wicked power abuse can be.

All this problem is available thanks to power abuse of central authority. Satoshi proposed the solution for decentralization. Satoshi believed that central authority, especially in money, is not good. Satoshi then introduced Bitcoin.

Satoshi said Bitcoin works by **Blockchain technology**. Block. Chain. Yes, it's a **chain of block.**

***WHAT IS A BLOCK?***

A block is like a box that can be filled with a number of transaction history. It has a maximum capacity, so block will keep getting created over and over again. The first block ever created by Satoshi themselves is **connected** to the second block, the second block is connected to the third block, and so on until the latest block. Hence the name **Blockchain**.

So if I have 10.000 BTC and I used it to buy a pizza years ago, it is written in the block that I have spent 10.000 BTC in the past so my balance right now is 0. It works just like how bank keep records of your balance.

Whoever gets to create the next blockchain will be rewarded with some coins.

***HOW DO I CREATE A BLOCK?***

It depends on the project's mechanism. For example, Bitcoin uses **Proof of Work** mechanism.

To put it simply, you use your computer to solve code, and if you do solved it, you'll be the next block provider of the block chain and get paid because providing block means you are maintaining the transaction availability of the blockchain and the project. When you are participating in solving the code, you are called a **miner**. You will also get transaction fee from people who want their transaction to be prioritized.

***THE SECURITY OF PROOF OF WORK***

I'm going to give you example on Bitcoin's security.

Bitcoin is programmed so that the more miner participating in solving the code, the harder the code will be, so competition will be maintained, the block won't be created brutally, and it is almost impossible for hacker to keep creating chain of blocks without having other miner solved the code while the hacker is in action.

It is possible for hacker to create 2 or 3 blocks consecutively, but 6 block consecutively is a no no no. That's why you need to at least wait for 6 blocks to be created to consider your transaction is safe.

If you want to solve the code faster, you will need faster and more powerful computer, which will ended up consuming more electricity. Oh, and, more computer power participating in solving the code will also make the code harder.

That explains why there are Bitcoin farms made by big miner while smaller miner with limited resources made pools to combine their computer power and dividing the rewards to all members according to the computer power they provide.

Not to mention, this chain of block is stored in every miner's computer, so if you want to change the history, you will need to **hack every miner's computer all around the world at the same time**. ***This is why decentralization is so crucial in cryptocurrency.***

Now, if you do have such powerful computer, why not just participate in solving question rather than risking going to jail? ps.I love chaos tho, if you can make it pls do it lol

***OKAY, NOW TELL ME ABOUT PROOF OF STAKE***

right. Here goes!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

***SECTION 3 -------- BLIZZARD'S BUTTERFLY EFFECT, THE BIRTH OF ETHEREUM, SMART CONTRACTS, PROOF OF STAKE, and STAKING***

Sorry, before we get into Proof of Stake, I want us all to appreciate a phenomenon called the butterfly effect. You can skip this part to *SMART CONTRACT* part if you want.

Butterfly effect is a phenomenon  where a little action could have a cascade of reaction to surrounding environment and eventually lead to a great effect in the future.

Years ago, there was this ~~alien-like creature~~ young man named Vitalik Buterin. He was an average college student, happily playing World of Warcraft. One day, his beloved item in the game got nerfed and from that, Ethereum is born. Talk about butterfly effect.

&gt;I happily played World of Warcraft during 2007-2010, but one day Blizzard removed the damage component from my beloved warlock's Siphon Life spell. I cried myself to sleep, and on that day I realized what horrors centralized services can bring. - Vitalik Buterin -

&amp;#x200B;

***SMART CONTRACT***

Bitcoin's sole purpose was to be the future of daily currency, even though today it has failed to achieve its purpose, it has become a medium for store of value instead.

Ethereum, on the other hand was created as a platform for every other developers to create their own application in decentralized manner and have blockchain technology applied on their application. We call such application as **dApp** or **Decentralized Application**.

All dApps will have an automated transactions like today's automated transaction. The difference is, since it's running on a blockchain, **you no longer need middleman or central server** or anyone to be the connector between you and the dealer. And since it is being verified all the time by thousands of people all around the world, **there is no room for lies**.

Then, these dApp will have to pay the rent to Ethereum. We call this fee as **gas fee**. The gas fee in Ethereum is **Ether**. This Ether is the ETH you buy on exchanges. It's the currency for Ethereum space. And maybe soon Ethereum space will become even larger, so large that society start using it as daily currency. Well, who knows..

***WON'T THAT MAKE PEOPLE RUN OUT OF PLACE TO WORK?***

about that, this is what Vitalik said:

&gt;Whereas most technologies tend to automate workers on the periphery doing menial tasks, blockchains automate away the center. Instead of putting the taxi driver out of a job, blockchain puts Uber out of a job and lets the taxi drivers work with the customer directly.

Ethereum is also using the Proof of Work mechanism, but as this post was typed, Ethereum is moving to Proof of Stake because of one main downside of Proof of Work : **energy consumption**. Competition of having the most powerful computer, let them turned on 24/7, ~~the rise of GPU card prices I've always wanted~~ will eventually destroy environment. That's why.

***PROOF OF STAKE***

Proof of Stake works just like Proof of Work. Proof of Stake works with the same principle, except **you don't have to use your computer**. You use **your coin** to participate in the code solving and get paid as many as the coin you deposit, calculated with the mathematical equations used by the project(each project has different technical systems for the rewards and code solving participation system).

***STAKING***

Staking means depositing several coins to staking service provider and get them working on the code solving. Depending on the service, it can be set so that you can't get them back before certain period of time or you can get them anytime. You will get paid as much as the percentage the service provider will give you for staking.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

***SECTION 4 -------- DIFFERENT KINDS OF COINS***

Bitcoin was created as a currency, Ethereum as a platform and Ether as gas fee.

There are more coins out there made as stock shares, meme, discount token, scam, you name it. It depends on the project behind it.

&amp;#x200B;

***SECTION 5 -------- CRYPTO WALLET***

First of all, **crypto wallet is not what you think it is**. It is not like your everyday wallet which you can keep your physical fiat money in. Every crypto coin that is created, sent, or received, **is all stored within the blockchain**\-in every miner's computer. It never leaves the blockchain, ever.

When you ""send"" some coins to someone, what actually happen is you are sending a signal to the blockchain to **assign** some of your coins to said address. In order to do this, the blockchain will ask you to show your **secret key**.

***SECRET KEY? WHAT'S THAT?***

**Secret key** acts as your **signature** in the blockchain. If someone tried to steal your coins by ordering a transaction using your name, they will need to show **your signature**. If they cannot show it, the transaction will be canceled and no coins are sent.

When you first create a wallet, you will be given a combination 24 words  (or sometimes it's only 12, sometimes more than 24). This 24 words is called **seed**.

***WHAT DOES A SEED DO?***

A seed is a **key generator**. A crypto wallet consists of **2 keys**. One is **Public key** which is known as **your address** to receive coins, the other is your **secret key** which is known as your **signature**.

***Every wallet that lets you sign transactions on your own must have the seed.***

&amp;#x200B;

***HOLD ON, I CREATED AN ACCOUNT ON EXCHANGES LIKE B\*N\*NCE, BUT NEVER RECEIVED THE SEED??***

Most wallets that don't give you the seed is only storing your coins on the company's wallet behind it. When you ""sign"" transactions, you are only giving orders to the company to actually sign on behalf of you. This is pretty much why people often say **""Not your keys not your crypto""**

&amp;#x200B;

***TYPES OF WALLETS***

There are **3 main types** of crypto wallet : **Hot wallet, cold wallet, paper wallet**

\[----------------------work in progress, I need sleep-----------------------\]

&amp;#x200B;

^(god I'm tired)

***END -------- END***

Let me know if there's anything you still don't understand, I might add an update of more explanation later.

Hopefully this helps you understand more about Cryptocurrency.

financialindependence,Almost overnight I own over a million dollars in real estate. I am terrified.,"I happen to live in a vacation destination and have an extensive family background in vacation real estate, so from the beginning real estate was my plan for FIRE. Right out of grad school, I lived with my parents for 2 years, saved like crazy, and bought my first property in 2018. 

I bought that property for $362k. First year (2018) it grossed 35k. With a lot of DIY I have made some good improvements &amp; rental incomes have steadily increased. This summer it will gross over 60k. It is cash-flowing but I put 100% of profits (plus extra from my own income) into improvements &amp; paying down the mortgage aggressively. Vacation rental rule of thumb in this market is that once mortgage is paid off, you can expect to pocket about 50% of gross after all expenses. My goal is to have that mortgage paid off within 10 years.

This spring I had saved another down payment and living with my parents was getting old, so I purchased a second property with the intention to live in it basically forever. (my career is remote, I can live anywhere and I like the beach, what can I say). I paid 397k for it in March 2021. Been paying minimums on that mortgage because it's such a low interest rate. 

So my FIRE plan was simple: keep working &amp; saving aggressively, buy rental properties as I save up more down payments, pay them off from rental income and build a portfolio to replace my employment income, manage all of it myself to cut costs, and then eventually hopefully (at least partially) retire by 45. Hope for some steady appreciation in property value to supplement net worth.

But this spring something insane happened, and keeps happening in vacation real estate markets all over. The market went absolutely and totally bonkers. I am not kidding. My mother has been the leading real estate agent in this county for over a decade and her mind is blown by what is happening. She knows this market better than anybody on the planet, so when I talk about valuations know that I'm getting my info from her. My house that I bought for 397k? It was worth 50k more than that on the day of close. I could get 500k for it today and probably start a bidding war. The rental is worth well over 600k, nothing like it has come on the market in the last week so it's hard to say. There is no inventory and properties have 20+ offers the day they go on the market. Then sell for 10-20% over asking. Nothing appraises but somebody is there offering cash so they sell anyways. Prices are going PARABOLIC and it's terrifying.

Then last week a certain computer company announced that they are building a huge new campus in the nearest large city, and I know that is only fuel on the fire.

Clearly this is a bubble. My instinct is to sit tight, keep paying down the mortgages and stick to the plan. But is that really the best use of this new capital that's fallen into my lap? If I sell something I pay capital gains on either property. And then what do I do with that money? The stock market is bonkers too right now. I have to pay bubble prices if I try to buy something else locally. And buying an investment property elsewhere defeats the purpose of my ""live local to rental properties so I can manage them myself and save $"" plan. Plus vacation markets all over are going nuts like this. But at the same time if somebody handed me a check for $500k right now, I don't know that I'd go buy more real estate, so is that a sign that I should be pulling some cash out?

Anybody have advice? If my goal is retire by 45, do I keep my head down or try to capitalize on this windfall?

**tldr: crazy market tripled my net worth overnight, not sure what is the best choice in terms of FIRE**


Stats: (not as amazing as some here, but working on it slow and steady)

personalfinance,22YO looking for long-term financial planning advice,"Hi all, I'm looking to provide a lore-dump so-to-speak on my finances to gain some long-term planning insight. I have done some financial planning studywork, but am looking to gain other advice and insight! I just accepted a good job in a new state and am looking for next steps for this new inflow of money.

Salary: $55,000

401(k): I am auto-enrolled at 9%, and my employer contributes $5,400 (\~9.8%) irrespective of my contribution on a yearly basis. I will be putting 401k contributions into a Roth IRA.

Savings: About $2,000

I have 1 car, 2015 Kia Soul with 99k miles. It is paid off.

I have approximately $16,000 in student loans with a weighted interest rate of 4.36% (from 3.7% to 5%). 

I have approximately $3,000 in investments (individual brokerage account) and $700 in a Roth IRA from my previous employer.

I live in the Raleigh-Durham, NC area, where local COL is about 5% lower than national average.

I am married, and among the other financial goals am looking to purchase a car for my wife. She is not college educated (only say that for the purpose of financial planning, lol!). She has previously worked in schools as an aide (approx. $11-14k annual).

As a part of my move, we are currently living with friends paying a significantly reduced rent for 2-3 months until my wife and I find a permanent place (not looking for personal advice on living with friends, pls).

&amp;#x200B;

My personal questions are as follows, but I am accepting of any general advice/guidance:

1. Should I be paying student loans while the interest rate is frozen?
2. Should I adjust the auto-enrolled 401(k) contribution rate of 9%? Up/down?
   1. If down, to be used for what other purpose?
3. General advice for *planning* car purchase - such as should I prioritize saving for the car now, manage until after I pay down student loans, etc. (I know car advice is a different beast - I know not to buy new and do not plan on adding a significant car payment)
4. Should I do anything with my $3,000 in Robinhood? This was an account I built up over time thru college.
5. What should I utilize surplus funds for over the next 2-3 months while I am paying a significantly reduced rent?

Thanks in advance :)",finance

Federal loans right now are 4.3-5.3 % for direct unsubsidized and Grad PLUS. I plan on going into Big Law post-graduation (my school is good enough that this a reasonable assumption for me) so federal loan repayment isn't exactly an enticing benefit for me. Between these two, which is the better option? What do we think interest rates will be in the future? (My federal loans sit between 2-5% now, but have been between 4-7 in the past.)
2. Additionally, I was expecting to get a bit better interest rates than the option Ascent gave me. I've been directed to SallieMae and Citizens Bank as good options as well, but am open to others. Is it bad to apply for a couple to try and get a more competitive rate? I'm aware that one application will lower my credit score a few points with the hard credit checks, but I have read mixed opinions on the internet on whether applying for multiple loans at the same time will / won't impact your credit score more than applying for just one at any given time. Thoughts on this?

personalfinance,Savings bond question,"Hello!

My wife has in her possession a collection of EE savings bonds from 1986, every year until 2007, mostly for her birthday month of March. These were all given to her by her parents and grandmother. In looking up the value of these bonds for her, I was surprised to find how much their interest rates varied.

I know it makes sense to immediately cash out the bonds that already reached full maturity, (Just losing value to inflation now) but I noticed all the bonds yielded 4.0% up until the 03/1996 savings bond, which only yields 0.26%. At this point, it doubled to face price but the interest is obviously pathetic. The bonds go up to 0.28% in 1998, but that's obviously still pathetic.

**My question: Does it make sense to cash out all the Savings Bonds between 03/1996 and 03/2003 since they'll gain almost nothing in interest moving forward, and they've already matured to the face value? Or am I missing a reason to hold these longer?**

I know if makes sense to hold onto everything from 1992-1995 since they haven't reached full maturing and yield 4%. I wish I could still buy Savings Bonds like that!

Also, I noticed the rates jump in 2006-2007 to 3.20% and 3.60%, so it probably makes sense to let them reach full maturity.",finance
personalfinance,Is there a downside to refinancing my home?,"My bank just called me today to discuss refinancing my mortgage. The gist of the conversation was that, since interest rates are lower, the bank can offer me better terms on my loan. I'm currently 20 months into a 30 year mortgage at 3.8% APR. They offered a 20 year mortgage with 3.1% APR and lower monthly payments than my current mortgage or a 15 year term with about a $400 increase in payments (which I can afford) and a 2.6% APR. The 15 year term will reduce the total owed on my my mortgage by $73,000.

This seems like a no-brainer, but I've been told that when something seems too good to be true, it probably is. What's in it for the bank to offer me this deal? What kind of things should I be looking out for? Is there the possibility that I'm making a poor choice by refinancing?

personalfinance,Just got a 2nd degree and brainstorming ideas for a side-gig,"I'm a single, 30 year old guy with no kids.  3 months ago, I got a job at a large hospital network doing help desk work.  I work Tuesday - Saturday, evening shift.  On rare occasions, I can be called in on Sunday or Monday if there is a major upgrade.  It was the best job I could get given the tough state of the job market.  I graduated in May 2020 with a bachelors in Information Technology, as the pandemic was kicking into high gear.  This is my 2nd bachelors degree, as I've made a career change.  I've been saving money like crazy and keeping my spending to a minimum.  Here are my financial specs:

Annual Earnings: 43k before taxes (about $1320 after taxes every 2 weeks)

Student Loans: 59k (all federal)

Assets Owned: 20 year old minivan

Housing Costs: $1250/month (currently $625 as I split it with a room mate but that could change)

&amp;#x200B;

As the title states, I'm brainstorming different side gigs I could do to earn extra money.  43k is enough to get by on, but there isn't much wiggle room.  The toughest issue with seeking a 2nd formal job is that employers are so fickle and are unwilling to work with people who already have a first job (and I work for most of the weekend).

personalfinance,Investing Advice for Newly Widowed 74 Year Old,"Hi folks, my father recently passed away (thanks in advance for your condolences).  My mom (74) is in pretty good mental, physical, and financial shape, but I'd like to carefully consider how best to set her up financially going forwards.

1) What are some good resources for investing advice for seniors?

So far, I've found the discussion of glide paths [https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Glide_paths](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Glide_paths) that suggests a good rule of thumb is to have something like ~30% of assets in stocks, ~60% in bonds, and ~10% in cash (or 80% bonds, 20% stocks or similar).  I didn't see anything in the PF wiki.  (Apologies if I missed something.)

2) The above rules of thumb seem reasonable.  Currently my mom's assets are (long story) significantly in cash and equities.  The equities are about 30% of the total portfolio.  So, according to the above, we should plow most of the cash into bonds.  My concern is that we seem to be at a time of very low interest rates and inflation, but presumably with the Fed printing money like it's going out of style, the possible passing of an infrastructure bill, etc., inflation and rising interest rates seem likely.  So investing in bonds right now seems like a bad idea.  Do you agree with my concern?  If so, is there a smarter strategy for investing the cash?

3) My parents refinanced their house last year with a 30 year mortgage at 3%.  Would it make sense to keep the mortgage or to pay it off with the cash reserves?

Some further possibly useful details.  My mom should be getting a combined pension of ~$65K, the assets invested or available to invest are ~$2M (about $550K cash), and the unpaid principle on the mortgage is ~$450K.  I know that my dad especially liked having the mortgage in order to itemize the deductions; last year the itemized deductions went to ~$7K medical, ~$7K taxes, $21K mortgage interest (note that there were two mortgages at the time, hence the large cash available now), and ~$7K to charity.  My intuition (and maybe a general rule of thumb?) suggests that one should just pay the mortgage off, especially if bonds are paying less interest than the interest rate of the mortgage.

4) Planning for elder care: I'm at a total loss here, and pointers to useful resources would be *greatly* appreciated.

I apologize if the above is too much of a ""what should I do with my $"" question.  If so, I'd still appreciate pointers to general resources and/or general rules of thumb for folks in their 70s and/or other considerations I should be thinking about.

Thank you very much in advance for your advice, and please let me know if there are any additional details that might be helpful.",finance

Bitcoin,Could deposits to my Exodus wallet be traced?,"I've been sitting on a lot of cash- almost $28,000. It's all my own, earned money, all legal, but now it's so much that it would look suspicious if I took it to the bank and deposited it.  
When covid hit last year, I was super-fearful about everything, and I thought society might collapse, so I basically liquidated my life. I sold my extra car, sold my collections, everything extra to me, and held on to the cash at home. This year I've moved it to my safe-deposit box at the bank, but I know inflation is going to eat it away before I spend it.  


If I buy Bitcoin at local storefront dealers, sent to an Exodus wallet, are these purchases going to be noticed by anyone?   
I have Bitcoin on ""Newton"", an online exchange, which is tied to my identity and bank account; if I transfer that onto the same Exodus wallet as this bitcoin I would buy with cash, is that identifying these future cash purchases and exposing them to scrutiny?

I don't trust safety deposit boxes. Pretty sure a bank could access it if they wanted to and the whole point is to get away from banks. The 'buried in a mountain' is a bit of a joke, I assume. The trusted family member is somewhat doable, but really safes at home/work seems like the best option.

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, May 10, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, May 10, 2021**

Stocks fell sharply on Monday, with technology stocks swiftly reversing from Friday to come under pressure once more as the risk of inflationary pressure and recent suggestions from monetary officials weigh on the mind of market participants. The Nasdaq (QQQ) sank 2.53%, its worst performance since March. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones (DIA) reached fresh intraday highs before pulling back while the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) retreated from record levels, closing 0.95% down.

Market participants are spooked that as the economy reopens and comes out of the pandemic, a surge in demand and consumer spending could drive a surge in prices. This, in turn, may prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner-than-expected, pressuring the valuations of technology and growth stocks. However, it is important to note that monetary officials, including Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, have repeatedly said they expect any inflationary pressures to be “transitory”. In an April 28 meeting he said, “Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.” Looking ahead, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' April consumer price index (CPI) is set to be released Wednesday and the producer price index (PPI) on Thursday. These will show the latest change in prices for consumers and suppliers, and are expected to show a significant jump over last year's pandemic-depressed levels as demand resurges as the economy in the US reopens.

Further spooking the markets is recent commentary from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen where she suggested interest rates may need to rise to prevent the economy from “overheating”. She said, “It may be that interest rates will have to rise somewhat to make sure that our economy doesn't overheat, even though the additional spending is relatively small relative to the size of the economy. It could cause some very modest increases in interest rates to get that reallocation, but these are investments our economy needs to be competitive and to be productive. I think our economy will grow faster because of them."" In later remarks, she seemingly downplayed her remarks, saying that raising rates was not something she was predicting or recommending and that the decision ultimately rests with the Federal Reserve. She said, “Let me be clear, that’s not something I’m predicting or recommending. If anybody appreciates the independence of the Fed, I think that person is me.”

While it may seem like doom and gloom, this is the most important piece of the puzzle and why one shouldn’t begin to panic about inflation or the economy overheating. Last Friday, the April Job Report reported only 266,000 jobs added in the month of April, missing estimates of more than 1 million and marking a sharp deceleration from the 916,000 jobs added in March. Despite significant progress, the economy remains roughly 8.2 million jobs short compared to pre-pandemic levels, and both the unemployment rate and labor force participation rate remain well below January 2020. The sharp decline in job growth allays fears that the Federal Reserve will be forced to tighten monetary policy anytime soon, with Powell and other monetary officials consistently reiterating the Central Bank wants to see a “string” of strong labor market gains totalling more than 1 million jobs added before any adjustment to the current policy is made. With the April report coming in far below estimates, the labor market remains far below the Central Bank targets, meaning it is extremely unlikely to tighten its accommodative monetary policy anytime soon.

In short, a transitory rise in inflation is not surprising given the economy is recovering from a severe decline in prices from March 2020, and while substantial progress has been made, economic recovery, particularly in the labor market, remains far from complete.

**Highlights**

* Pfizer (PFE) and BioNTech (BNTX) submitted an application with the US FDA to approve use of their coronavirus vaccine for individuals 16 and older
* The Bank of England upped their growth estimates for the economy of the UK, anticipating GDP will grow 7.25% in the country, up from its forecast for 5% growth in February. The BOE also now sees inflation averaging 2.5% in 2021, up from its prior forecast for 2%, but said the rise in price pressures will likely be ""temporary.""
* The trial between Epic Games vs Apple (AAPL) has commenced. Epic has accused Apple of violating U.S. antitrust law and sued it in August after the tech giant yanked the developer's hit video game ""Fortnite"" from its App Store. Apple has defended itself by arguing that its app-marketplace policies are fair and that Epic breached a contract applicable to all developers distributing apps on its mobile devices by trying to make their own market place within the app store. Epic Games also sued Alphabet on similar grounds. Apple is facing a similar lawsuit in Europe filed by Spotify (SPOT)
* U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo plans to hold a May 20 meeting with senior U.S. auto industry leaders and other industry officials on a semiconductor shortage that has cut production, two sources briefed on the matter told Reuters.
* No price target increases today, technical issue on our end :(

personalfinance,"Changing the Way I Manage My Money, Looking for Concurrence on Approach","I've (31) known for a while that I am saving too much money in a 0% interest checking account, and I have just accepted a new job with a different compensation structure which is kicking me into gear on doing things differently going forward. Seeing as this is a major change in how I think about money I was looking for people's perspective on my plan.

Current situation:

* \~155k salary per year with a bonus of \~15k. I was filing as single/no dependents despite being married with 2 dependents because I liked the big check during tax season (i know this is stupid!)
* 288k left on a 360k mortgage currently valued at \~$700K (Seattle is crazy!). I put &lt;20% down when I bought this house but then started throwing money at the principle ever since.
* \~85k in checking/savings accounts
* Maxed out 401k and IRA.
* No credit card debt/student loans.

Future Plan:

* 160k salary per year with \~140k in bonuses. I intend to file correctly going forward (married, 2 children)
* Sell current house, put 20% into a house purchased at \~1.1M.
* Continue to max out 401k + IRA annually
* Put enough of home sale equity into kids college funds 1x so i can forget about doing this on a recurring basis ( i havent calculated this yet, but i was thinking like 20k a piece?)
* Put remaining equity from home sale + 50% of savings + entire bonus into index funds (I was thinking of just US based index funds?)
   * Remaining savings would be held onto for quick cash in case of emergency.

In case it inst clear, the major change in the way I'm thinking about money is that interest is king. And to put more money into the principle of a house at a 3% interest rate is a losing move if i can invest that money for anything &gt;3%. I have enough saved up to weather any storms and my job market tends to be pretty stable (engineering management in the Puget sound).

&amp;#x200B;

Some questions:

* Is my plan putting too much faith in the market? It seems like the market has averaged \~9% annually despite huge downswings like in 2008.
* Are index funds the right way to go? Is there any argument to be made to park some of my investment into something even more stable? 
* This approach obviously drives for a significant increase in my monthly mortgage payment but i think that's counteracted by the market interest. Is there anything wrong with this concept?

CryptoCurrency,A few things to consider with taxes (USA),"I've seen a lot of confusion around taxes on crypto here lately. I am by no means a tax professional but wanted to go over some basics to clear up some things.

\- Keep in mind that every single transaction is a taxable event. Even if you are transferring from one crypto to another instead of fiat, it is considered a realized gain. It's as if you sold it for fiat and then bought the other crypto. If you profited on this trade, you will owe taxes on the amount profited. If you lost on this trade, you can use this loss to offset your gains.

\- Learn about short term capital gains taxes VS. long term capital gains taxes. Essentially, short term is when you held the asset for less than a year, and it is taxed as regular income. Look up federal tax brackets as well as local tax brackets (if applicable), to have an idea of what your tax liability will look like with $X amount of gains. Long term capital gains taxes on the other hand, are for when you held the asset for a year or longer. The tax liability is much lower (look up the tax brackets for exact numbers). Try to think about how you want to work with this system. Short term gains will be taxed higher, but gives you more flexibility and vice versa for long term gains. Figure out what works best for you.

\- The bottom line is, your tax liability is based on your amount of profit made. I see so many people claiming that making lots of transactions will somehow make your tax liability go up. This is not how it works. The IRS doesn't care about how many transactions you made, they care about how much money you made so they can get the proper cut. Get some kind of software that tracks your transactions and profit and put in each trade immediately after you make it. This will save you from the headache of looking back when tax season comes up and trying to figure everything out from months ago. They will penalize you if you don't do everything properly.

Of course, hiring a tax professional to do your taxes will be the best option. It will save you from making mistakes and being penalized with fees from the IRS. Unfortunately they target low/middle income earners due to reasons I don't think should be talked about on this sub, so it is very important to stay informed and do things properly.

Feel free to add anything you think is important!

personalfinance,Thinking of switching jobs - thoughts?,"Hi all, 

Long time lurker here and figured it's time to post my situation.

I have been employed with the same company going on 2.5 years now managing properties. I was promoted after a year to a new property and recieved no pay increase or even a review. I was supposed to get a bonus and a raise but the upper management was let go so that was lost in transition. Fast forward to another year, I was promoted to another property that is 4x the size of any property we have. 

I was promised the title and pay after 60 days, but it never happened. 4 months later I basically told my superior I was fed up with the lack of being valued and was offered the title and pay increase of 25%. So I started at 60k and offered 75k. 

Meanwhile, another company is trying to poach me for 85/95k (still negotiating) and the company seems really cool and has a great culture. Here is a break down of the difference I see 

Current employer
60k salary offered 75k after 2.5 years, no annual raises ever.
Matching roth with a vested 3 year period.
Tuition reimbursement for schooling 
3 weeks PTO 
Mostly older demographics as coworkers 
28 min drive 

Second company 
85/95k with a promise of annual raises 
3 weeks pto 
Matching 401k 
Free stays at their properties and family discount 
Great culture full of millenials and gen X 
1.5 hour drive 

I want to leave because honestly I feel disrespected with no raises, lack of reviews, and even moving jobs I didn't get a raise initially. The newer employer sees my value and is willing to pay for it. I work in hotels if that helps and the prospective hotel is a new brand that would elevate my career. 

I intend to commute for a couple months and move closer to the new place, if I get it. The housing is cheaper and I can afford to have a large house when I'm ready. Not going to lie, I want to quit at this point to prove a point of them mistreating me and although the newer job is 8x smaller, they'll pay me more and it would look great on my resume.

dogecoin,Some important points to read and understand,"(1) Crypto is HIGHLY volatile.

(2) In order to make big money you need to put in big money.

(3) You will HAVE to see unrealized losses of a significant amount, this is normal, price fluctuations happen over and over and over.

 (4) Sectors of the market such as crypto doing bad will cause the entire sector to do bad. It's a mirror and vice versa.

 (5) Institutions (Whales) rotate in and out of currencies and stocks over and over again. This causes huge spikes or dips.

 (6) We've seen dips as in the range of 0.20 +/- and 0.20+/- upwards in the matter on 60 seconds.

 (7) You only lose when you sell, causing you to get back in at a higher price OR less capital, decreasing potential gains and losses.

 (8) Consolidation is HUGE for the market. It allows new buyers to get in while maintaining the buyers at the top and rebounding previous sellers to get back in.

(9) Elon tweets CAN rocket the currency (as of today it had little value due to the dips).

(10) The coin is being accepted more and more.

 (11) Billions of dollars is behind this coin, millions of people supporting it globally. This happens once every several years.

(12) Selling at dips allows whales to get in again with their profits at your exit point, giving them better ability to control the market since everyone else may buy in after their buy in which is the spike.

(13) We've seen these fluctuations before, this isn't brand new, in a day it can clear up or 10 days on average. Doge is priced nicely where it can happen in minutes.

(14) The entire media has a piece of investment in this. It's priced so great anyone and everyone should be in and trust me, they are. As long as the media is on our side, we're doing just fine. They control a major part of the swings.

(15) There are thousands if not hundreds of thousands and I'd push it to millions of people that seen SNL globally and have unverified accounts waiting to get in any minute. There will be a wave of people. 

(16) A lot of people get paid this week, unemployment checks are hitting weekly, this is appealing for people to buy despite the recent dip it's perfectly priced.

(17) It's global, one half of the world can have a different psychological perspective towards seeing dips and might behave differently as opposed to overreaction and over selling. 

(18) Average down and up. It makes absolutely no sense not to if you can afford to do so. The more people paperhanding will lower your profits because of less movement. Every contribution is required.

(19) Every investment is a gamble. For some of us, this is life changing. For others, it's vital. Only put what you can afford to lose. 

(20) Spread the word about doge, there are so many people hesitant about crypto currency.

(21) Report all spam, FUD and mentions of other coins in this subreddit. 


More importantly, STOP looking at the charts every second. Take a break. Be healthy. If you continue to see red you'll condition yourself to believe it. This is what they want. Why would they intentionally tank this before it hits $1-$2? To spread fear and jack the price up themselves due to the acceptance of the coin. Causing people to jump right back in at higher prices. The goal was always $1+ and I'm 100% certain it does NOT end here. There's MORE money to be made for everyone. After $1 you decide for yourself. 

Our commitment to this is beyond comprehension. We've seen waves and have surfed through them tons of time before. As for the FUD and people spreading the mentioning of other coins, I would NEVER opt into another coin community that spreads fear and misinformation. I would NEVER follow the lead of a community that obtains joy from those that sold and those that are at a loss during any time but especially a pandemic. If these people guide you to their coin to invest into, they more than likely sold at a loss here because let's be honest, they're spreading crypto what makes you think they weren't invested at some point? These are the people that will not maintain dips and any lows. They'll be the first ones out. Use your absolute discretion when doing so. Our community is full of support, appreciation and, hope. We got here because of US. Every single person is valuable. Both at the very top and bottom.

stocks,Too late to get in on commodities market?,"Obviously commodities (oil, steel, etc) have seen a nice run up in the past few months due to inflation concerns while tech &amp; growth have been sold down heavily.

personalfinance,How to prioritize retirement savings vs. paying down extreme student loan debt?,"As of this month, my spouse and I are bringing in a combined $20,000 per month in gross income which is &gt;4x what we were at a month ago. We also have slightly more than $400,000 in debt, all in federal student loans, and spread almost evenly between us. The interest rates range from 5.3% to 7%, with a weighted average ~6.4%. They are currently under REPAYE, and our calculated monthly payment is $0. We should be able to keep a near $0 payment through the end of 2022. At the moment, this seems like the best option since the government is ""paying"" for $1100 of our $2200 in monthly interest (or will be, after the COVID-19 forbearance ends).

I have two different thoughts on how to allocate our income and want some more sets of eyes to evaluate our options and point out anything we might be missing.

Option 1 - Contribute 3% of my spouse's salary to 401(k) to max employer match. No other retirement savings. As best I can tell, this would leave us roughly $14,000 net monthly income. Put $8000-$9000 per month (ideally more) into student loans until something changes (bonus, raise, etc.).

Option 2 - Max both of our 401(k)'s = $39,000. Max HSA = $7200. Max both of our Roth IRA's = $12,000 post-tax. After deducting the pre-tax contributions, I think we're left with ~$10,500 per month net income. Comparing this to scenario 1, that would leave us $4500-$5500 per month (ideally more) to put toward student loans.

Questions: which choice makes the most sense? Is there another option that I'm missing? My spouse has been contributing just enough to 401(k) to get the employer match (3%) so far this year and I have not contributed anything. If we do decide to max our 401(k) contributions this year, we can 'over-withhold' on our last 8 months worth of paychecks to contribute the full $19,500 in 2021, right? Same with HSA contributions?

Other things that might be relevant: we maxed Roth IRA contributions for 2020. Any retirement savings will be invested into Vanguard/Fidelity Index Funds. Our income will be below the phase out for Roth IRA contributions this year so we can factor in contributing to 2021 Roth IRAs without having to finagle our MAGI. We currently have ~$18,000 in a savings account. Any advice on size of emergency fund would be helpful. I go back and forth because I want to be conservative and hold a 6 month emergency fund, but does it make sense to keep that much in a savings account when we have 6-7% interest debt?

We live in a HCOL city, but I am less looking for monthly budget advice (that will probably be its own post), and more looking for pros/cons between maxing tax-advantaged retirements accounts (putting the loans on a 10-12 year payoff trajectory) vs. putting everything toward the loans (putting the loans on a 5 year payoff trajectory). As for paying on the loans themselves, I will put everything in a savings account for now and dump it all into the loans right before forbearance ends.

I know that the debt is at an interest rate that borders the ""high interest pay it off immediately"" range, but I'm worried that after paying off the loans I'll wish I hadn't missed out on those previous years of tax-advantaged retirement contributions.

I started following the Dave Ramsey plan about two years ago by pausing my 401k contributions. It pains me to miss out on the 8% match but it has worked so far.

I began paying off the $22k balance in credit cards debt and about a $10k balance on an auto loan.

I've paid off $16k in credit cards so far and just made the final payment on the $10k vehicle loan last month. I have the the additional $500 former auto payment and, for the next three months while my son is not in school, another $375 per month of tuition payments that I can put somewhere else.

I've noticed that my $64,939 pension from my former career in the trades is stale. The balance hasn't changed much in 8 years. It's been up and down a few thousand dollars in that time but nothing significant. Others that I know who are still in the trade say the pension is mismanaged.

What should I do with the pension?

A) Cash out the 401k with a 20% federal tax and 5.9% state tax and use the balance of $49k to pay off my all of my credit card debt and loans ($9k), set the balance ($40k) aside as my emergency fund, begin paying off the mortgage and press play on my 401k contributions with the 8% match?

B) Continue on as I have and move the pension to an IRA while leaving my 401k contributions on hold?

C) Any other suggestions?

dogecoin,DOGE and FIAT explained kinda.,"Doge adds 5.2 billion coins a year it’s not limitless. Here’s why adding coins isn’t bad if it seeks to be an actual currency and not a store of value like BTC. The following paragraph is stolen from a nasdaq article. Non of this is financial advice. 

Today, Dogecoin lives life as an inflationary coin. Much like fiat currencies, more gets minted every day. And just like its government-backed counterparts, Doge’s upside remains limited because buyers know they can always acquire more later. (For a real-world example, consider that the EUR/USD exchange rate of 1.2 is virtually the same as in 1999). In other words, when your currency adds 4% supply every year, it will eventually find a price equilibrium with other 4% growth currencies.

    Fiat, is the dollar and all major currencies in the world I’m aware of, are a fiat fundamentally similar to the dollar. Fiat has no hard asset backing it, it’s worth whatever value people ascribe to it. They added 40% of the US dollar supply over the last year, talk about inflationary. 
   Doge is fundamentally more sound than the dollar from a monetary policy standpoint, that is the real joke, unfortunately. So no it will not always rise uncontrollably but with growth comes adoption and buying, and honestly 5.2 billion a year is not that much to buy up, considering its market cap is around 60-70 billion last time I checked.

energy,Should we adopt nuclear energy?,"Nuclear energy might be the future to our energy crisis but most people seem to be misinformed about it. I felt that it was important for people to know about the advantages and disadvantages of nuclear energy. Nuclear energy can be the key to a clean and reliable energy supply because of it's massive potential for generating energy without directly producing carbon dioxide.

Advantages of Nuclear energy

\- Net-zero emissions : Nuclear energy does not produce any carbon dioxide directly. Although it may produce carbon through other processes such as transportation of fuel, the carbon dioxide offset from the atmosphere leads to net-zero emissions.

\- Small : A nuclear power plant occupies less space to produce the same amount of energy as other clean sources of energy such as solar or wind.  

\- Dense : A single pellet of Uranium can generate the same energy as 1 ton of coal, 120 gallons of oil, and 17,000 cubic feet of natural gas ([EIA](https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2019/01/f58/Ultimate%20Fast%20Facts%20Guide-PRINT.pdf)).

\- Stability : Nuclear energy is the most reliable source of energy. Nuclear power plants operated at full capacity more than 92% of the time ([EIA](https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2019/01/f58/Ultimate%20Fast%20Facts%20Guide-PRINT.pdf)).   

Disadvantages of Nuclear energy

\- Non-renewable : Although clean, nuclear energy is not renewable. Uranium is a limited resource and it is bound to run dry at some point in the future if we continue to use it. Especially with more nuclear power plants built, the consumption of Uranium is also going to increase, leading to a faster rate depletion.

\- Nuclear waste : One of the biggest obstacle to mass adoption of nuclear energy is the disposal of nuclear waste. Currently we do not have a proper method of safely disposing nuclear waste. The U.S government passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Act in 1982 which gave ownership of all nuclear waste produced in the U.S to the federal government. It was enacted to prevent the use of waste to produce nuclear weapons but it also gave the government the responsibility of managing and disposing nuclear waste. Because of which it is important for us to tell our senators and representatives to come up with a solution to a decades old problem. We could learn from France who has a nuclear waste recycle program where they generate as much energy as possible before storing away the waste. It leads to less frequent need for refueling leading to less waste produced.

I would like to end this by urging everyone to do more research on nuclear energy. [Energy.gov](https://Energy.gov) is a great source with statistics and descriptions. Energy.gov also has the most up-to-date data. Below are some more resources which you can read to learn more about the topic. 

[https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/publications/magazines/bulletin/bull60-2/6020809.pdf](https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/publications/magazines/bulletin/bull60-2/6020809.pdf)

This is an article talking about how France has an efficient nuclear fuel cycle.

A good article that the department of energy published which goes over some facts about nuclear energy and goes more into detail on the workings of nuclear energy.

An article about the aftermath of Chernobyl. Since Chernobyl happened such a long time ago, people only remember the destruction it caused. The media played on major part in striking fear in the people's heart and this article is a good read for people who only want the facts about the incident.

dogecoin,The Doge Card - Day 2: A 21st Century Payment Processor,"**tldr;**  Doge has something that not many of the other crypto's have and that's liquidity (a lot of coins). Because of that and the low fees (compared to say ETH), it has the opportunity become a mainstream 21st century blockchain payment system.

I've organized this into sections, so if you don't care about a specific section, you can skip to the next:

1. Section 1: Context
2. Section 2: Background (aka Story Time)
3. Section 3: The role Doge can play in the financial system
4. Section 4: Community Input Questions

**Section 1: Context**

In a previous post, I discussed the Doge Card concept allowing people to use Doge on a debit card to transact with the existing infrastructure and be reloadable adding more Doge as needed. After more research, this post discusses next steps and things for the community to consider, #butfirst let's take a look at how the financial system came to be where it is today.

**Section 2: Background (aka Story Time)**

A long time ago in a nation not far away...

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*SCROLLING CREDITS\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Turmoil has engulfed the new Republic. It has only been 36 years since the US declared independence and now war with Great Britain and her allies threatens the stability of the young nation.

With a blockade of deadly Royal Navy battleships blocking trade with Europe, Americans are left to trade among themselves.

While the banking system was full of politicization and corruption, foundations would soon be laid that defined the US financial system for generations to come...

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*END CREDITS\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

To summarize the history of banking in the US across the years, the ability to issue credit and remain solvent when debtors default is the core theme of regulatory and systemic changes. To facilitate solvency challenges, the federal government took it upon themselves to insure the American people and reassure that their money is safe - it is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States in response to the great depression in the 1930s establishing the FDIC. This and more recent regulation in 2010 with the Dodd-Frank Act, has worked to prevent banks from failing and increase their ability to offer businesses and consumers credit to buy houses, cars, go on vacations, and start businesses that create jobs. This backing though comes with a price, oversight and intense procedures with a snail pace of innovation.

**Section 3: The role Doge can play in the financial system**

This is where cryptocurrency has made a huge impact. The ability to transact internationally quickly (within 10 minutes and 1 minute for Doge), to not have a central entity inflate and deflate it at will, and to have privacy in a time where companies are collecting tons of information about you, sounds like a silver bullet solution, but there are trade-offs which will be discussed in section 4.

Where Doge fits in to the puzzle, is that unlike many other crypto coins, it has liquidity and is not deflationary; although, it will inflate less and less over time. The early American financial system (as well as many before it) proved that by having a store of value as a means of transactional currency limits the ability for transactions to take place.

1. Circulation problem - there is a small amount of it
2. Adoption problem - only the wealthy have it and it's difficult to price things against it
3. Hoarding problem - owners want to hodl instead of release into the economy (Banks were the first true hodl'rs - we will lock our doors before we give you our bullion!)

This is why Bitcoin, the trailblazer, has failed to gain mass adoption in terms of transactional use - because it was not designed to be used but literally designed to be hodl'd. See why Stripe ended their adoption in 2018 - [https://stripe.com/blog/ending-bitcoin-support#:\~:text=Therefore%2C%20starting%20today%2C%20we%20are,transactions%20on%20April%2023%2C%202018](https://stripe.com/blog/ending-bitcoin-support#:~:text=Therefore%2C%20starting%20today%2C%20we%20are,transactions%20on%20April%2023%2C%202018).

Doge on the other hand has the solution to each of those problems:

1. Circulation problem - there is plenty of it, over 129B coins (compared to USD circulation of 2.2 trillion it's not quite as liquid b/c the USD circulation has been inflated over the years)
2. Adoption problem - it's affordable and attainable, even if it reaches $10 becoming top valued crypto in the world, it's still affordable and things can be priced against it
3. Hoarding problem - in it's current volatile state, there will be this but as adoption of a functional use increase, think this will turn more into a savings account like perspective where you get 10% interest growth rather than current banks of 0.01% - 0.6% annual rate, but you aren't afraid to spend it to go Disney World or ticket for Virgin Galactic space tourism ride.

This sets Doge up to be a primary candidate for a payment system (and yes there are 3 other cyrpto with more liquidity than Doge but I'm excluding them b/c don't know much about them other than BTT which is meant really as an internal reward system).

Let's talk about the components of the existing electronic payment system with debit cards/credit cards:

1. **Payment Gateway** \-&gt; acts an entry way to talk to a merchant bank, think [Authorize.NET](https://Authorize.NET), you still have to get a merchant bank account which will offer [Authorize.NET](https://Authorize.NET) as the payment gateway solution.
2. Acquiring Bank (aka Merchant Bank, aka Processing Bank) -&gt; the merchant bank, if you go with [Authorize.NET](https://Authorize.NET) you will have to get a Merchant Account through your bank and go through a lengthy KYC process, sometimes a credit check, etc. Newer platforms like Stripe, provide a merchant account and payment gateway for you all in one and take on some of the risks (e.g. merchant being fraudulent taking customers money and disappearing - Stripe has to pay this back to the customer) and most compliance tasks handling the relationship with acquiring bank behind the scenes. **Note**: The merchant bank account is not the same as a business checking account, but separate. If you just accept checks and cash, you don't need a merchant account.
3. **Payment Processor** \-&gt; the entity that coordinates payment flows on behalf of acquiring banks, think First Data or Global Payments. They primarily act as as a routing mechanism that connect gateways to acquiring banks through credit card/debit card networks to issuing banks.
4. Issuing Bank -&gt; the bank that issued the debit/credit card
5. Credit Card Network (sometimes Credit Card Association)/ATM Network -&gt; the network through which VISA/MasterCard determine which issuing bank to send transaction requests to or for debit-pin transactions, the inter-bank network of determining authorization (Discover/American Express are their own issuing bank).
6. Clearing House (facilitated by Credit Card Networks or ACH) -&gt; how transactions are settled between the Issuing Bank and the Acquiring bank (upon authorization/capture, the acquiring bank will generally release funds right away to the merchant although it still takes 1 day or more to actually be deposited into a business account for use and will settle later with the issuing bank)

The next two components towards the Doge Card are:

1. A payment gateway
2. A payment processor to route transaction requests to legacy networks or the blockchain network in which the blockchain would act as the issuing bank

**Section 4: Community Input Questions**

If you've made it this far, I'm quite impressed. There are some challenges with this hybrid evolution with both perspectives clashing. The crypto world (it seems) has the following values:

1. Security - it's a common occurrence for credit cards and personal information to get hacked, with so many parties involved it's not surprising that data can be comprised
2. Privacy - it's not uncommon for personal information to be sold or made accessible to businesses within a supply chain - how many have gotten letters in the mail for pre-qualified credit offers that you didn't apply for
3. De-centralization - consumers have put their trust in entities (corporate and government) and a few bad apples ruin it for everyone where decisions are based more on profit-based outcomes (best for bottom line) which doesn't always align with consumers or is a regulation worthy event (e.g. political agendas).

Still, there's no perfect system. In the pursuit of those things, it comes with a cost which outrages the traditional banking system:

1. Invites Security Treats - Crypto is not invulnerable to security issues and in some ways invites more hacking opportunity by being open source and a public ledger revealing nodes and large wallets. The counter to this though is that crypto is more transparent about security issues which are quickly addressed.
2. More privacy supports illegal financial activities - when you know the currency you are accepting can be used for other things without being watched and having oversight, it becomes easier for criminals to finance human trafficking, drugs, weapons, etc.
3. De-centralization supports fraud opportunities - when you don't have a central counter-party that holds issuers to acquirers and vice versa, then one party can renege in which the merchant either doesn't get paid or more likely the consumer doesn't get the promised product/service combined with increased privacy, the consumer doesn't even know who the merchant is.

No one really talks about the fraud that happened in the early days because most people weren't directly affected by it, but if you ever seen Catch Me if You Can, it shows just how *easy* (not really) it was to commit all kinds of fraud. Having a bank refund a transaction for a merchant not fulfilling their product/service is something that is easy to take for granted until you get screwed over.

To increase adoption and implement a payment gateway and payment process, these 2 problems need to be solved.

**The Questions Finally 😌**

As early adopters of Doge believing in it's long-term value:

1. Would you be willing to give up on some privacy for more accountability and to what extent (e.g. in some cases, regulation requires SSN/EIN like receiving business payments)?  
A thought I have is connecting wallets to phone numbers and addresses, encrypted and   
hidden in public network but accessible given node agreement of the validity of the inquiry (e.g. court order) and only to that requester (e.g. government authority clients would be given special permissions to make these authorized requests and created through a community facilitated process - see #2). The phone number/phone identifier could also be used to send push notifications/text messages if and only if the consumer opts-in related to wallet activity (think a development platform like Shopify but the blockchain becomes the source of the customers privacy rights). While companies like CoinBase provide wallet apps, this reduces the effect of de-centralization. If CoinBase fell off the face of the earth, how would you access your wallet? What happens if their bottom line starts to fall and they want to start charging you for it? Privacy controls should be the responsibility of the network.  

2. Would you be willing to rethink de-centralization to some degree to reduce fraud and protect consumers via Community Driven De-centralization?  
Again, there is no perfect system, but the community here in this subreddit and when the coins were stolen early on is pretty impressive. StackOverflow and the like give strong credibility to the self-organizing capability of individuals. I think a fraud prevention system within the network could be implemented algorithmically pretty decently allowing you to approve transactions on your phone via FaceId/Pin (reducing theft of wallet/issuing card)  and by requiring more identify verification from merchants such as a node verified merchant. You could still send direct payments to non-verified merchants but at your own risk. This merchant verification would largely be automated but to merchants whose transactions seem to be flaky require additional community verification. In return for volunteering, the system would reward these community fraud preventers in Doge (e.g. in addition to mining). It would also provide a similar mechanism for flagging transactions as fraud in cases where human validation may be required. How many of you have been scammed before? It sucks. Community fraudster preventers would help reduce that giving consumer confidence. The question becomes, who is qualified to do that and what would stop the wallet holder and his/her/them allies to join the fraudster preventer program to allow their transactions but stop competitors. I think the answer to this is that the protocol
   1. Would never allow you to review your own transactions or transactions of those you have a direct transaction relationship with
   2. Require you to hold a wallet for a given amount of time (e.g. 30 days) before becoming eligible to apply to join reviewed by existing members
   3. All manual decisions would be peer-reviewed by 3 or so people with majority vote
   4. Merchants/consumers could appeal decisions which would require 5 votes by people with more experience
   5. The protocol would implement a training based program that would you would go through to participate and unlock that feature
   6. You as a fraudster preventer would be able to review other fraudsters preventers and be reviewed by others of your feedback/decisions for community accountability.
   7. With respect to the government authority special accounts, this verified merchant process would apply to verify government authority process.

Whatever the implementation, if we are going to ever see Doge gain payment system adoption, there will need to be controls in place to limit illegal activity and offer protection to consumers.

Thanks in advance for your feedback, you've made it to the end. The fate of the galaxy now rests in your hands!

As a side note, one might wonder how is this profitable for an organization/business to invest in? The answer is it's profitable for the community and doge holders overall. Transaction fees would be given to node operators facilitating the infrastructure for the network in hosting a payment gateway node or a payment processing node. They would then be able to convert it to USD to cover operational costs and earn profit or pay directly in Doge. The key aspect here is not that node operators don't make profit, but rather one node operator doesn't have more than 50% influence/control, aka de-centralization.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,"What are some practical ways to be your own bank, or what are some ways on the horizon?","As a fan of a certain fast and feeless crypto, I love the idea of using crypto for daily expenses like a cup of coffee or my phone bill; but let’s face it, the options to pay directly with crypto aren’t there yet, in that most merchants don’t have QR code’s for popular coins at the point of sale.

I know there are some legitimately decentralized stable coins out there, but some have high fees and they face the same issue of being accepted as non-pegged coins.

I’m truly fed up with banks, and now with Biden’s new proposal he’s going to basically turn banks into surveillance tools for the IRS. I don’t have a problem paying taxes, but I don’t want a bank reporting every cent I spend to the government when there’s no transparency on their part. I don’t want a bank telling me where I can and cannot spend my money, or making me wait 7 business days for a check to clear. Basically, I’m looking for ways to make being my own bank a lifestyle beyond just setting up cold storage.

I know there’s centralized parties who will give you a debit or credit card and then sell your crypto on the back end, but I’m looking for decentralized options, especially with minimal fees.

economy,How have the current unemployment and price soaring affected you?,"It’s been recent that the unemployment rate has reached 6.1% in the USA in April 2021. Approximately 2.7 million people have lost their jobs. I guess everyone has seen the graph that was spread all over the news. Anyway, I’m going to post it below. But I want to talk about how the economy affected any of you and your actual experience.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/20t2mkn47gy61.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ccf97a139ddac5cc67d5e0b36a99b2ce3bdf5ff0

I know that our country has faced some hard times, and we have to go through another recession again. Still, I don’t really believe that we have overcome the financial crises of 2009. Now, again we have to go through some difficulties one more time. But at the same time, it’s a time for new opportunities.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel sorry for the people who have lost their jobs and struggle to find a new one at the moment. Unfortunately, current restrictions with the pandemic prevent some companies from expanding the number of employees they have. But on the other hand, the prices should have become lower. The same thing concerns the interest rate that the bank charges us. As far as I know, the CB has to lower the base interest rate to stimulate the economy.

&amp;#x200B;

In my opinion, the current recession is a chance to start something on your own. Even though the economy is a little bit unstable, I want to take this opportunity and start my own business. I’ve been working on a business plan for a while, but some calculated costs were way higher than the potential income. Now, some companies have changed their prices strategy and cut down their prices for certain services. For instance, I have considered a couple of companies to promote my start-up. But after the crises took place, I decided to stop my choice only on this candidate — [https://www.cardinaldigitalmarketing.com/services/seo/](https://www.cardinaldigitalmarketing.com/services/seo/). I think it is the right thing to offer some discounts for your potential clients to remain profitable. I’m analyzing a couple of other companies, too, in case I’ll change my mind.

Thank you for spending your time reading this. I hope you can share some thoughts or experiences on how this crisis or any crises have affected you. Also, I want to know if I am correct in my predictions and expectations.",finance
personalfinance,"Is it too late to file 4868 and 7004 for 3520-A for 2020 IRS federal tax returns with the May 17th, 2021 extension?","Long story short, I didn't realize I became a resident alien after 2 years of a J and 3 years of a F visa and now I need to report foreign PFICs. I had a TFSA (tax free savings account with a ""Declaration of Trust"") in Canada with mutual funds in 2020, and I don't think it's possible to file on time because I just realized and the bank takes two weeks to send a copy of the annual report of my funds.

After researching for 3 days, I figured out that I need to file at least 7 forms including a substitute 3520-A because the bank is definitely not filing that for me.

**Question**: Can I still file 4868 and 7004 to extend the filing of 3520-A?

**4868**: I couldn't find anything about the extension of this form, but based on other posts and calling some accountants, it seems like it should be valid.

**7004 for 3520-A**: This one is a little more complicated. I think the answer is unclear and IRS may have contradictory guidelines:

1. First, according to the IRS relief for 1040 filers [guidelines](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-21-21.pdf), it says ""This relief includes the filing of \[...\] 3520"" on page 3. **Which means I can file 3520 on May 17th**.
2. Now if I go to form **3520-A's** [instructions](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i3520a.pdf) for the **deadline**, it says ""by the due date of the U.S. owner’s Form 3520"" if the foreign trust is unable to report. **This would then be May 17th**.
3. But now I want to extend m 3520-A using the 7004 form. [Instructions](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i7004.pdf) state on Part II line 2 of page 2 that ""Generally, Form 7004 must be filed on or before the due date of the applicable tax return. The due dates of the returns can be found in the instructions for the applicable return."". **The instructions of the applicable return is the 3520-A form, which would then imply that the deadline for filing 7004 for 3520-A is also May 17th**.
4. Now finally, if I go to the **e-filing for 7004** [page](https://www.irs.gov/e-file-providers/e-filing-form-7004-application-for-automatic-extension-to-file-certain-business-income-tax-information-and-other-returns) on the IRS website, I find that the **deadline** **for 202012** (I presume this would be my deadline for federal taxes that end Dec. 2020) **is 3/15/2021. However, this page was updated in January and it's also the original deadline for the trust! It's also possible it's out of date.**

In this situation, will my 7004 application still be valid if I file it before May 17th? and in what format?

Or please tell me, how screwed am I? I don't want to pay a 10k penalty as a poor student with hardly any savings. :-(",finance

stocks,Write up a plan,"Recent posts here are mostly about questions regarding inflation, selloffs, uncertainty.

You can't be uncertain if you have a plan.

Most people that came to the stock market are without a plan and when some first idea doesn't work you pivot, you try different things losing even more money.

I've made a post bashing new investors for their lack of balls during red days so this is not it. This is a small guide to help you cope with emotions.

Market is driven by 3 major factors.

1. Emotions - you can control them if you have a plan, altough you can't control what the market does. If there is a huge selloff and your strategy tells you to invest long term in for example utilites, treat yourself and buy the dip!
2. Huge institutional investors. Well with our amount of money even if you are in the millions you and me - we are screwed. If they fart left and we go right well too bad, we need to wait for a change of wind direction.
3. Logical valuations. That is also within your area of competence. You can read 5-10 years worth of 10Ks and decide if a company suits your methods or not.

That is if you are INVESTING.

There is a HUGE HUGE difference between investing, day trading, swing trading and trading options, investing for growth, investing for value or speculation.

You can't make money long term if you don't know into which group you belong.

I for example am investing my money LONG TERM. Which means even if market dives I take my cash position and I deploy it to make more money in 2-3 years. I reinvest every single dividend for a snowball effect.

I can't understand why people are joining a discussion without having any sort of fundamental information regarding investment strategy from the OP.

Yes we see you red lines, we see your winnings but tell us WHY and what for you are investing. For how long?

IMO every post should being with:

1. I am XYZ type of investor
2. My time frame is XYZ
3. My risk tolerance is low, average, high
4. I am using XYZ method of trading (swing trading, day trading, long term holding)

&amp;#x200B;

We can't have a decent sub without these type of infromation, right now this is a pit where people are dumping their thoughts like shit into toilet without any freaking context.

&amp;#x200B;

So.

The planning part.

1. Ask yourself truly how much can you lose.
2. Ask yourself why are you investing.
3. For how long
4. When to exit. For example if stock is 1-2-3 fold or maybe just after 30% uptick? Have that and then don't cry when you see drop from 178% gain to 13% because you never exited that position. I am for example holding dividend paying stocks, when one of them rises 50% I sell and I put that money into something else or I reinvest to the pie I have.
5. How much can you really add? Are you going to DCA ( dollar cost average)?
6. Throwing around HOLD THE DIP or JUST DCA won't work for people that are in the market for a 3 year timeframe. I can hold a stock for 10 years without a flinch but most people can't.
7. If you are uncertain use a paper account. Most of the notable platforms have a form of trading virtual money. Do it for a year and see if you are not bored already. It's about the process, a journey, if you are in for a short squeeze of time just play option like in a casino and then whine about losing or brag about winning. It's like giving a leash without a dog to a child to see if the child keeps walking out with the leash to make sure it can handle a dog long term.
8. Make sure to be up to date but don't make decisions based on inflation or the interest rate if you are a long term holder. I know that inflation is a bad sing for day/swing traders because their positions and trading strategy will be harder so make sure to read up on that. I don't give a damn about those things, only when I buy.
9. I buy once a year. I reinvest everything automatically to see the snowball but I make one big purchase a year. It gives me time, reliefs stress. I can read 100s of 10Ks before I hit that purchase button because of my investing plan I am stuck with it for minimum 5-10 years so it better be good.
10. Decide if buying 10 stocks for 1000 dollars make sense. IMHO it doesn't. If you work with less then 10K just invest in 2-3 very well picked holdings, it will bring more money from divs and natural growth. If you purchase 15 holdings it doesn't make sense and you won't make a lot of money, you will be frustrated.
11. If you can't invest more at a time work on yourself. Get an MBA, maybe do some certifications. Increase your wage. Don't enter the stock market to make it your main source of income without education. For me it is a hobby that will last a lifetime, for you it may be a chance to actually replace your ""normal"" job. So educate, go to local uni or a course (a good course, not a mentorship). Even if you are 40 and driving a forklift you can go to college and you can get new education. Your family should be supportive about you growing as a human being.

&amp;#x200B;

It really doesn't matter for me what market will do in 3 hours from now, it may be the biggest drop we've ever seen and I don't care. I wait for a moment like that to deploy cash. If you hold options day trade well hats off to you for such a high risk tolerance and congrats on high rewards.

Market is overheated, tech had a huge run but it doesn't mean that we will see a huge correction any time soon. Low rates are balooning the prices. Diversify a little to sleep better. Or not, just make sure you write it down and stick to it.

&amp;#x200B;

Good luck.

personalfinance,Questions About Financing All Cash Offer On Single Family Home,"Hello,

I have a question for any mortgage lenders / bankers out there related to financing. I was having a discussion with someone and I was telling them how I recently submitted 40k over list price an on a single family home that was listed at 800k.

Long story short, I lost to an all cash offer. Since the home has not closed yet (and I don't know the offer), for the sake of argument, let's assume it was a full price offer of 800 that was accepted.

I was saying what kind of person would pay 800k cash for a property when interest rates are so low, when instead you could put your money into the market, etc for a higher return than current mortgage rates. Here is what they explained that some of these cash offer are doing and I'm needing clarification if this is accurate and if it is possible:

\- You can get a loan from your investment brokerage for up to 50% of your investments (not sure if this was IRA or traditional account). So let's say you had 1.6 million in your brokerage account, you could get a loan of 800k from your brokerage account at 5%; he's saying a 'bridge loan'

\- Then the seller has accepted this 'all cash' offer. Once you close and move in to the new home, you refinance your home with a regular / traditional mortgage (I'm assuming 30 years) and then put the 800k back into your brokerage account. Does this make sense or even possible? When he says re-finance, it is actually a refinance, or is it called something else (reverse mortgage, etc)? Are these 'mortgages' at regular single family rates? Would the bank give you a 'mortgage' for 800k, or is it subject to appraisal? 

Any comments are greatly appreciated!

MachineLearning,[D] (Paper Overview) Barlow Twins: Self-Supervised Learning via Redundancy Reduction,"**Video**

[https://youtu.be/fNyyKJ22P8Y](https://youtu.be/fNyyKJ22P8Y)

**Paper**

[https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03230](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03230) 

Code

[https://github.com/facebookresearch/barlowtwins](https://github.com/facebookresearch/barlowtwins)

**Abstract**

 Self-supervised learning (SSL) is rapidly closing the gap with supervised methods on large computer vision benchmarks. A successful approach to SSL is to learn representations which are invariant to distortions of the input sample. However, a recurring issue with this approach is the existence of trivial constant solutions. Most current methods avoid such solutions by careful implementation details. We propose an objective function that naturally avoids such collapse by measuring the cross-correlation matrix between the outputs of two identical networks fed with distorted versions of a sample, and making it as close to the identity matrix as possible. This causes the representation vectors of distorted versions of a sample to be similar, while minimizing the redundancy between the components of these vectors. The method is called Barlow Twins, owing to neuroscientist H. Barlow's redundancy-reduction principle applied to a pair of identical networks. Barlow Twins does not require large batches nor asymmetry between the network twins such as a predictor network, gradient stopping, or a moving average on the weight updates. It allows the use of very high-dimensional output vectors. Barlow Twins outperforms previous methods on ImageNet for semi-supervised classification in the low-data regime, and is on par with current state of the art for ImageNet classification with a linear classifier head, and for transfer tasks of classification and object detection.",technology

CryptoCurrency,Is a centralized cryptocurrency possible on blockchain?,"I.e. a government controls additional issues of the coin, yet all coin additions would be recorded on a decentralized ledger. I.e. keep stabilizing effects of monetary policy/fiscal policy, yet keep blockchain benefits of inability to duplicate(by anyone but the gov) and publicity of information.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,Hacking the Ethereum Virtual Machine and the future of Smart Contracts.,"So I've been thinking about the security of Ethereum a lot lately. Since Ethereum is basically a worldwide, decentralized computer there has to be some interest in exploits.

Currently with Proof of Work a 51% attack is pretty difficult to pull off, not to mention expensive, and in all likelihood, it would fail. With Proof of Stake coming in the future I think a 51% attack on Ethereum would still be difficult because of how much Ether has already been distributed. Pair that with the current price of Ethereum and you realize how expensive it would be to buy up more than half the supply. And on top of that you would not only need to control 51% of the coins in supply but you'd also need to control more than half the validators as well, I think.

Ok so a 51% attack may be extremely difficult to pull off. So our hacker ""friends"" might move to something else.

That's what brings me to smart contracts. So in theory as long as you don't have the resources for a 51% attack, then you can't add bullshit blocks to the chain. And the chain (I may be wrong here) is like computer code being fed into the EVM. This ""code"" allows Ethereum to process transactions, execute smart contracts, and change the state of dapps. 

So smart contracts and transactions are immutable because once the EVM executes them a malicious actor would have to get the entire network to agree on a bullshit block with new code injected on an old contract. So this too would be difficult.

But what about smart contracts that are malicious in the first place? So smart contracts are open source, correct? So is the actual solidity source code available to be viewed by anyone, like on a block explorer?

How can the public be protected from intentionally faulty smart contracts. For example a contract that holds payment in escrow while the payee does some agreed upon task but once the task is complete the payment is sent to the contract author's wallet instead of the payee's? This is just one example but I'm sure solidity hackers could develop some devious devices with time.

Smart contracts are supposed to be trustless but as more people use platforms like Ethereum and other smart contract platforms like Binance Smart Chain and Cardano, will we see a rise in Smart Contract auditors? Or even smart contract pentesters?

Maybe a pentester's fee plus a bonus are locked up in a contract and if the pentester can get the funds to their wallet they can keep the fee and the bonus or if they fail to extract the funds they just get the fee. Or there would be 3rd parties that go over smart contract code kind of like a lawyer reads a contract with you before you sign it.

Won't this be necessary as the majority of people in the public won't have the knowledge to understand solidity code and therefore not have the ability to trust the smart contracts they enter? Could we see ratings organizations that give smart contract devs points for good contracts and take points for bad ones, like a reputation system?

What does the community think about smart contract security in the coming future?",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,How to deal with debt that has been certified to state and federal agencies,"I have been having some state tax issues—in short, a bunch of payments I made haven't been properly credited in the system (due to some clerical errors and everything being backed up due to COVID and telework/understaffing). The Office of Tax and Revenue has been issuing me notices and late penalties for a few months now even while I've been in contact with them about getting this cleared up. I'm not worried about the penalties and interest, which should get rectified when the payments I made are finally accounted for. 

Despite all that, I got a notice that my ""debt has been certified to federal and state agencies to capture any tax refunds or administrative and vendor payments you may be due."" Is there anything I can do to contest this, or at least monitor it so I know if it's still hanging over me? Is this going to affect my credit?

Again, I'm confident that this will all get sorted out in my favor, but dealing with the OTR has been a mess. I'm not expecting any tax refunds any time soon, but I might be next year, and the nightmare scenario would be that OTR resolves my case, closes it out, and forgets to de-certify the debt or something.",finance

CryptoCurrency,"Would a government ever accept a bitcoin for federal tax, and why, and how would that play out?","From how I understand it, taxes are what gives currency their value. But a currency issued by a federal government also controls the supply of that currency. What if it used bitcoin for taxes? Or rather why couldn't it? 

Furthermore, at some point in time, currencies were likely similar to bitcoin. Maybe some king gave out 100 silver tokens to his 20 subjects and said ""we will trade with these,"" but over time competition has driven currencies to have additional issuances by their gov.

So would a bitcoin based gov lose out in the long term to one ran on a centrally based blockchain cryptocurrency due to its ability to stabilize cyclical economic movements",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Should I pay off a loan early?,"So I completed my taxes yesterday and I will be getting a more sizable refund than before. I wanted to run my situation by yall to see how I can best use it. So here is the jist:

I make $4513 a month (that's after taxes, 401k, health insurance, and HSA)

Apartment rent: ~$1450 - $1500

My car: $199 a month ($2866 left, ~21.9% interest)

Student loan: $50 a month ($3569 left, 1% interest)

All loans (including above): $37,780 (multiple school loans and 1 car)

Fiance owns his car, has no student loans, and has a better credit score than me. (700+ compared to my 670).

I make enough for our expenses so putting the refund toward something seems like a good idea. I'd like to completely pay off one of the loans (car or Discover or student) with the $4000, but I've seen some posts saying that's bad for my credit (?).

CryptoCurrency,Tutorial: How to create your own meme coin,"**DISCLAIMER:** This is meant as satire. The intention is to show how easy it is to become a modern day meme coin scammer. I am not promoting the creation of meme coins, I am educating on how simple it is to create them. We are in a different era of shitcoinery, in the ICO days of 2017 you had to know how to write solidity to create your token sale. Today things have changed, teenagers with no dev experience can get a token up and running in less than a day.


This tutorial is going to be short, as it has become so easy to become a shitcoin scammer these days.

You'll need 4 things:

1. Branding
2. Website
3. Token
4. Socials


#### Branding
The easiest part of this whole process. Literally choose anything it doesnt even matter at this stage. Some ideas:

* SafeDoge
* DogeClassic
* DogeMoon
* DogeSafeXRP
* BoobieCoin

Youll need a logo too, you can either find one in google images, or pay someone of fiverr.com to create one for you.

#### Website
I know what you all are saying right now:
&gt; i dont know how to code, how can i make a website :(

well you are in luck, most modern day meme coin scammers arent devs, just go to themeforrest.com and buy a website.

Some of my favorites: 

* https://themeforest.net/item/cryptoland-wordpress-cryptocurrency-landing-page-theme/22832328
* https://themeforest.net/item/icos-bitcoin-and-cryptocurrency-wordpress-theme/21626006
* https://themeforest.net/item/crypdrone-multipurpose-cryptocurrency-hosting-with-whmcs-template/22720357

#### Token
Now for the most important part, your token. I suggest you create the token with a multi trillion supply so the price is like $0.00000000001, that way you can convince noobs that its really cheap and is going to $10. Little do they know a price of $10 would make the market cap more than all of the money in the world, but what do you care, you're a scammer.

&gt;but im not a dev i cant create a token :(

fear no more future scammer, go here: https://dxsale.app/

DxSale will create your token for you, you just give it the token details such as supply and team wallet address etc and it will deploy the contracts for you.

#### Socials
Create whatever socials you like, more the better.

#### Final Step

Make a post on /r/CryptoMoonShots  detailing how this is a coin for the people and how you are going to donate so much money to charity etc. Really sell the fact your arent a money grabbing scammer and you care about people.


ez pz lemon squeeze your are now a modern day meme coin scammer",cryptocurrency
investing,Stanley Druckenmiller says the Fed is endangering the dollar’s global reserve status,"* Fed policies could end up threatening the long-term health of the U.S. dollar, investing magnate Stanley Druckenmiller told CNBC.
* “I can’t find any period in history where monetary and fiscal policy were this out of step with the economic circumstances, not one,” the chair and CEO of Duquesne Family Office said.
* Though he agreed with the early steps the Fed took during the pandemic, he said the policies have continued for too long.

Federal Reserve policies aimed at keeping markets and the economy afloat during the pandemic could end up threatening the long-term health of the U.S. dollar, investing magnate Stanley Druckenmiller told CNBC on Tuesday.

The chairman and CEO of Duquesne Family Office said the Fed’s insistence on holding interest rates down and buying trillions in bonds even though markets are thriving and the economy is booming is a long-term risk.

“I can’t find any period in history where monetary and fiscal policy were this out of step with the economic circumstances, not one,” Druckenmiller said during a”Squawk Box” interview.

Though he does not take issue with the Fed’s initial actions to combat the pandemic-related threats, Druckenmiller said the central bank has kept its foot on the accelerator too long.

He asserted that the Fed has continued its policies to help underwrite the spending binge in Congress, which has allocated more than $5 trillion in stimulus and is contemplating trillions more in infrastructure-related spending.

Over the long haul, he said, the policies and the heavy debts and deficits they support will threaten the dollar’s standing as the world’s reserve currency. That status means the dollar is accepted for transactions and as a store of wealth anywhere and is widely held by central banks around the world.

“If they want to do all this and risk our reserve currency status, risk an asset bubble blowing up, so be it. But I think we ought to at least have a conversation about it,” Druckenmiller said.

“If we’re going to monetize our debt and we’re going to enable more and more of this spending, that’s why I’m worried now for the first time that within 15 years we lose reserve currency status and of course all the unbelievable benefits that have accrued with it,” he added.

To be sure, others have warned in the past that Fed excesses could threaten the dollar, but the greenback has retained its position in the world.

One reason for that is there have been no other viable alternatives introduced.

Druckemiller has entertained the thought that a challenge could come from the crypto world. He said in the CNBC interview that the ultimate solution could be “some kind of ledger system invented by some kids from MIT or Stanford” though he conceded that “I don’t know what it will be.”

However, he noted that in the early days of the pandemic, other foreign governments already voiced their concerns about the dollar by selling Treasurys, the opposite of what normally would happen in a crisis when ultra-safe U.S. debt is generally seen as a haven.

Indeed, foreign holdings of government bills, notes and bonds actually have decreased, falling by $127 billion or nearly 2% over the past year, according to Treasury Department data. Foreigners hold nearly one-third of the public portion of the $28.2 trillion U.S. debt.

Druckenmiller said central banks have been the root of a lack of confidence in dollar stability.

“The problem has been clearly identified. It’s [Fed Chair[ Jerome Powell and the rest of the world’s central bankers,” he said. “There’s a lack of trust.”

Druckenmiller’s comments came a day after he and Duquesne partner Christian Broda said in an opinion piece for The Wall Street Journal that Powell “needs to recognize the likelihood of future political pressures on the Fed and stop enabling financial and market excesses.”

Similarly, former New York Fed President William Dudley wrote in Bloomberg News that markets are underestimating how much the central bank will have to raise interest rates in the years ahead to keep up with the inflation it is trying to foster.

The Fed itself, in its semiannual Financial Stability Report last week, said it worried about risks coming from soaring asset prices.

Druckenmiller told CNBC he has “no doubt whatsoever that we are in a raging mania in all assets.”

\*\*Update\*\*

Ok, I've done some further research on this. So for those that are interested, this is what I found.

Based on federal regulations, this would be considered a clerical error only if it was non-numerical ([12 C.F.R. § 1026.19(f)(2)(iv)](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=315a4f5deaa5063b50b8b3915e908d4a&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se12.9.1026_119&amp;rgn=div8)).  I don't see how this falls under ""non-numeric"" as it is a literal adjustment of the numbers provided in the original Closing Disclosure. On top of this, the Truth in Lending Act states that it is the responsibility of the creditor to notify ""the person concerned of the error and make whatever adjustments in the appropriate account are necessary **to assure that the person will not be required to pay an amount in excess of the charge actually disclosed**"" ([15 U.S.C. § 1640(b)](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2010-title15/html/USCODE-2010-title15-chap41-subchapI-partB-sec1640.htm)).  And since this is in excess of the disclosed amount, I don't see how this request is not a TILA violation.

CryptoCurrency,Taxes on crypto profits per country (updating list),"Tax liability is a major source of concern for anyone invested in Bitcoin and other digital assets.

But while some countries are putting pressure on investors and levying taxes on income and capital gains from Bitcoin transactions, many are taking a different approach—often with the aim of promoting better adoption and innovation within the crypto industry. They’ve implemented friendlier legislation, and allow investors to buy, sell, or hold digital assets with no tax liability.

I've looked up the different laws in country's about taxable events related to cryptocurrencies and listed them down below. If you're missing your country, please comment and i'll look into it. This list is a work in progress, so maybe things will change in the long run and i'll update it.

* **Argentina:** Income tax based system. Any profit (from holding, trading, mining) is taxable for 15%.
* **Austria:**  Cryptocurrency assets are deemed an interest-bearing investment.

* **Australia:**  In short, cryptocurrencies are subject to [capital gain tax](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital_gains_tax.asp)  and ordinary income tax in Australia, depending on the circumstances of the transaction. CGT is the tax you pay on the difference between the Australian Dollar (AUD) value of the disposed asset at the time of the disposition minus the AUD value of the disposed asset at the time it was acquired.If the assets have been held by an individual for more than 12 before selling, you can apply a CGT discount:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;50% for resident individuals (including partners in partnerships)  
&gt;  
&gt;33.33% for complying super funds and eligible life insurance companies  
&gt;  
&gt;50% discount is removed or reduced on capital gains made after 8 May 2012 for foreign resident individuals

&amp;#x200B;

* **Belarus**: There's a [Decree](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/ru/Documents/tax/lt-in-focus/english/2017/27-12-en.pdf) signed by the president of Belarus [Alexander Lukashenko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Lukashenko) to exclude digital tokens from the same regulations as applied to traditional markets in the nation. This law is in use until Jan 1, 2023.
* **Belgium:**  Anyone who makes gains out of speculating on the cryptocurrency market must pay 33% and list these gains under ""miscellaneous income"" on their tax returns.
* ***Brazil:*** if you have more then R$5000 (around U$ 950) in any crypto, you need to declare it as an asset in the end of financial year. You pay taxes (15%) once you sell for more then R$35.000 (around $6.700). Failing to report cryptocurrencies will result in a fine ranging from R$500 to R$1500 (around $120 to $360).
* **The British Virgin Islands:**  BVI does not impose any [capital gains taxes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital_gains_tax.asp), income tax, or corporate taxes for companies and individuals who reside there. 
* **Canada:**  Cryptocurrency is taxed in Canada as either [capital gains](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital_gains_tax.asp) or as income tax, depending on whether your activity with cryptocurrency is considered to be as a business or not. 100% of business income is taxable, whereas only 50% of capital gains are taxable.
* **Cayman Islands:**  The Cayman Islands are another popular tax haven for individuals and companies. There are no taxes for all types of crypto activity in the Cayman Islands. 
* **Croatia:** Capital gains tax at an 12% rate for individuals and an 18% rate for company's.
* **Czech Republic:**  cryptocurrencies  are differently taxed depending on their use. Overall, individuals that trade cryptocurrencies are taxed at a rate of 15%, while businesses are taxed at a rate of 19%. This is calculated on [capital gains](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital_gains_tax.asp) from the price of buying and selling on a later date.
* **Denmark:** generally treats cryptocurrencies as [capital propert](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalasset.asp) (55%) for tax purposes, taxing gains and allowing for deductions on losses.  If you have both made a profit and a loss on your transactions, you should normally enter your profit in box 20 of your tax assessment notice and your loss in box 58 of your tax assessment notice, respectively. You should not offset a loss against any profit.
* **Finland:**  Finland taxes cryptocurrencies both at the acquisition stage and at the realization stage. So [capital gains](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital_gains_tax.asp) from the moment you buy and sell your tokens. Finish law also depicts three other kinds of Cryptocurrencies gains:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Hard forks: cryptocurrencies created through hard forks are taxed at the time of transfer, using an acquisition cost of zero. A forked cryptocurrency is therefore not taxed at the time of acquisition but rather at the moment of selling.  
&gt;  
&gt;Airdrops:  Treatment of airdrops for taxation purposes will depend on whether they are treated as mined cryptocurrencies, staked cryptocurrencies, forked cryptocurrencies, or as a gift.  An airdrop offered only to current holders of a currency might be considered a gain on previously held property and treated as staked currency taxable as a capital gain.   
&gt;  
&gt;Gifts:  Finland does not tax gifts or lottery winnings (provided the winnings come from a Finnish or European Economic Area lottery and do not require any work from the winner)  For purposes of transfers of cryptoassets within a year of receipt as a gift, the value of the cryptoasset at the time of receipt as a gift will be determined by the value at the time when the giver acquired the asset.

&amp;#x200B;

* **France:**  Profits from cryptocurrency speculation and mining are treated as industrial and commercial profits subject to the progressive income tax schedule (45% of marginal plus social contributions). For companies, profits from cryptocurrencies are liable to tax under the general corporation tax regime for profits and losses. Currently, corporate income tax is levied at the rate of 33.33% . *The standard rate is to be gradually reduced to 25% in 2022.*
* **Germany**:  For German residents, any cryptocurrency held for over a year is [tax-exempt](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tax_exempt.asp), regardless of the amount. If the assets are held for less than a year, capital gains tax doesn’t accrue on a sale, as long as the amount does not exceed 600 euros ($692).
* **Greece:**  cryptocurrencies can be taxed two ways, as capital gains and income. In case of companies, any business activity or capital gains derived from mining or trading virtual currencies triggers a 29% flat rate tax. In case of individuals, there is a split: capital gains are taxed at 15%, while personal income attracts rates from 22% to 45%.
* **Hungary: C**ryptocurrencies are subject to [capital gain tax](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital_gains_tax.asp)  of 30.5%. *There are plans to* cut the tax rate to 15% *in the near future, because of the covid-pandemic.*
* **Hong Kong:**  Essentially, whether cryptocurrencies are taxed or not depends on their use, according to [Henri Arslanian,](https://www.linkedin.com/today/author/henriarslanian) a global crypto leader at [PwC.](https://www.pwchk.com/)  “If digital assets are bought for long-term investment purposes, any profits from disposal would not be chargeable to profits tax,” he wrote in March when the directive was introduced.
* **Israel:** Capital gains tax based at 30% for both individuals as company's.
* **Italy:** If you're earnings are more then €51.645,69 for seven consecutive days you have to pay a tax rate of 26%. You've can't trade cryptocurrencies.
* **India:** *There aren't any taxation laws at the moment, but in recent news there's some laws in the making. They are looking into the following:*

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Bitcoin mining  
&gt;  
&gt;Bitcoin held as an investment being transferred in exchange of real currency  
&gt;  
&gt;Bitcoin held as stock-in-trade being transferred in exchange for real currency  
&gt;  
&gt;Bitcoins being received as consideration on sale of goods and service

&amp;#x200B;

* **Japan:** Income based tax rate of 5% to 45%. The law is kinda fishy about this. *it also seems some laws are in the making to make he rate 20%.*
* **South-Korea:** Capital gains tax based divided on sales (11% rate) and gains (22%).
* **Malaysia:**   In Malaysia, cryptocurrency transactions are currently tax-free, and cryptocurrencies don’t qualify for [capital gains tax](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital_gains_tax.asp), because digital currencies are not considered assets or legal tender by the authorities. 
* **Malta:**  Malta doesn’t apply [capital gains tax](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital_gains_tax.asp) to long-held digital currencies like Bitcoin, but crypto trades are considered similar to day trading in stocks or shares, and attract business income tax at the rate of 35%. However, this can be mitigated to between five percent and zero, through “structuring options” available under the Maltese system. 
* **Netherlands:** The value of your crypto investment is counted on the first day of January. It's taxed in [box 3](https://www.homefinance.nl/belastingen/inkomstenbelasting-box-3.asp).
* **Norway:** The Norwegian Tax Authority has issued a statement on the following two points:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Income derived from the sale of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoins will be treated as capital property, at least for tax purposes (22%).  Capital property legislation allows deductions for losses and taxes gains. Although travel currencies are exempted from the capital gains tax, cryptocurrencies such as bitcoins are not, because cryptocurrencies are not recognized as travel currencies.Income from actively mining cryptocurrencies by the owner him or herself is likely to be considered other income. The mining of cryptocurrencies on a larger scale, on the other hand, may be considered business income

&amp;#x200B;

* **Peurto Rico:**  Puerto Rico comes under U.S. Territory, but it is considered a foreign country for U.S. federal income taxes. Puerto Rico is well known for [Act 22](http://puertoricotaxincentives.com/) that maintains zero capital gains tax and only a 4% income tax rate. 
* **Philippines:** Not taxable as of yet.
* **Poland:**  You only pay taxes on your income. I f you had sold no cryptocurrencies in a given year (nor had you used them to pay for, e.g., an excavator or a service), no revenue will be shown. And no income will be shown, either.  The tax rate is 19% on income (i.e. the difference between gross revenue and deductible expenses).
* **Portugal:**   Proceeds from the sale of cryptocurrencies by individuals have been [tax-exempt](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tax_exempt.asp) since 2018, and cryptocurrency trading is not considered investment income.
* **Singapore:**   If digital currencies are being traded, the profit is taxed, but if the profits are long-term investments, they are not subject to taxes. Traded as an investment, profits and losses in cryptocurrency are considered capital gains; but as a non-property type of capital gain, they are tax exempt.
* **Slovakia:**  As for other income, the **tax** rates applying are either 19% or 25%. Whereas the first applies for a total income lower than 35.022,31€, the latter if the total income is above this.
* **Slovenia:**  No capital gains tax is levied on individuals when they sell Bitcoin, and gains are not considered income. However, companies that receive payment in cryptocurrencies, or through mining, are required to pay tax at the corporate rate.
* **Spain:**  you must inform about any cryptocurrency acquisition, transmission, exchange, transfer, collection, or payment made. Basically on the profits you generate when you bought any coin at a price X, but sold it at a higher price, Y. That is, you must pay taxes on the gain generated (the difference between the selling and the buying price, Y – X). It works under the following brackets:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;From 0 to €6.000, you must pay a 19%  
&gt;  
&gt;From €6.001 to €50.000, 21%  
&gt;  
&gt;From €50.001 onwards, 23%

&amp;#x200B;

* **Switzerland:** For the purpose of tax assessment, cryptocurrencies must be voncerted into Swiss Francs. [The Federal Tax Administration (FTA)](https://www.estv.admin.ch/estv/en/home.html) provides year-end conversion rates for certain cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin. The cryptocurrencies are considered to be assets, comparable with bank deposits , and Are therefore subject to wealth taxes. In general [capital gains](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital_gains_tax.asp) on assets of individuals such as cryptocurrencies are exempt from income tax.
* **The United Kingdom:**  Anyone buying and selling Bitcoin in an individual capacity is most likely to be subject to UK Capital Gains Tax (CGT) on any gains made.  For those who are considered as trading in cryptocurrencies (i.e. buying and selling with a high frequency), Income Tax may be due on the profits as trading income. [HMRC’s](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs) view is that only in exceptional circumstances would it expect individuals to buy and sell cryptoassets with such frequency, level of organisation and sophistication that the activity amounts to a financial trade.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;You don't pay taxes on the first  £12,300 of capital gains.

&amp;#x200B;

* **The United States of America:**  Buying and selling crypto is taxable because the IRS identifies crypto as property, not currency. As a result, tax rules that apply to property (but not real estate tax rules) transactions, like selling collectible coins or vintage cars that can appreciate in value, also apply to [bitcoin](https://www.coinbase.com/price/bitcoin),[ ethereum](https://www.coinbase.com/price/ethereum), and [other cryptocurrencies](https://www.coinbase.com/price). It also depends on how long you're holding your tokens &lt;1 year 10% to 37% and &gt;1 0%, 15% or 20% taxable.
* **New Zealand:** Cryptographers are treated as a form of property for tax purposes. There are three kinds of tax brackets:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Income tax for individuals: acquiring cryptoassets for the purpose of disposal (for example to sell or exchange), trading in cryptoassets, using cryptoassets for a profit-making scheme.  
&gt;  
&gt;Income tax for businesses and organisations: Your business needs to pay tax on cryptoassets it receives as payment, or that it sells or exchanges. How tax applies will depend on the type of business you have.  
&gt;  
&gt;Taxing cryptoasset income: Before you can put your cryptoasset net income (or loss) in your tax return you need to:  
&gt;  
&gt;calculate the New Zealand dollar value of your cryptoasset transactions  
&gt;  
&gt;work out your cryptoasset income and expenses.  
&gt;  
&gt;If you held cryptoassets that were stolen, you may be able to claim a deduction for the loss.

personalfinance,State Specific Deductions &amp; Moving,"My husband and I are due to receive a 5-figure non-injury lawsuit settlement within the next 5-6 weeks. I know this settlement will be taxed as income and I have prepared for the federal liability by adjusting our withholdings on my husband’s W4. I am a stay-at-home mom so I don’t earn income.

The settlement amount is conveniently double the amount of our current state’s maximum deduction per 529 individual account. I want to deposit 50% of the settlement into one of our children’s account and the other 50% into another’s so our total 529 contributions equal the total amount of the settlement. 

Am I correct in assuming that if our 529 deductions equal the amount of the settlement that we will have no additional state liability due to the settlement?

If my assumption is correct, then I have a second question.

We plan to move out of our current state before the year ends. If we do, are we still able to take the entire deduction on our current state’s tax return or is it pro-rated based on how many months we lived here? The settlement will be issued and deposited prior to our move and we will deposit the funds into the 529 accounts prior to the move as well. Will we be double taxed on the settlement amount by our new state or will the settlement strictly be considered income in our current state?

personalfinance,Take Advantage of IRA Tax Savings or Keep Chunk for Down Payment,"I’ve got two possibilities in front of me and the math points clearly at one, but uncertainty of the future may sway me toward the other. Context: we’ll be buying a house in the next 6-8 months (that part is not up for debate, don’t need opinions on whether to buy now). Also, I left a high paying private industry job last year for a lower paying more chill government job (no regrets, absolutely needed for my mental health). That means we were in the 22% bracket in 2020 and will be in the 12% bracket for 2021. I’ve filed an extension for my taxes but decisions about traditional IRA contributions for 2020 have to be made this week. Also, don’t get hung up on interest rates I used below—I kept it conservative but consistent. It’s sufficient for just comparing the two situations.

Situation 1
Do not contribute to 2020 IRAs, keep full amount of $40k in the bank for future down payment, collect roughly $7k in state &amp; federal tax refunds, bringing total down payment savings to $47k
Using Excel mortgage calculator, this higher down payment will result in about a $35/mo lower monthly payment, which, if invested every month until retirement will lead to roughly $25k.

Situation 2
Siphon off $12k of current $40k savings earmarked for house down payment and contribute to 2020 IRAs ($6k for each of us).
State and federal tax refund will increase to nearly $11k, so combined with the $28k left in savings, down payment will be about $39k, instead of $47k.
Difference in down payment, as mentioned above, leads to $35/mo higher mortgage payments, BUT $12k flat invested now will become $58k.

So, off the bat, numbers point to following Situation 2. BUT with the uncertainty of the housing market, should I give up the additional flexibility that $12k could bring to house shopping? (We do have an additional emergency fund plus retirement funds.)",finance

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, May 11, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, May 11, 2021**

Bottom line, the extreme volatility in the market, particularly in tech stocks, continued today, with tech stocks opening deep in the red before recovering throughout the day, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) going from roughly 2% down at open to close to break-even by close. With the market fluctuating so wildly, it is difficult to pinpoint the reasons behind this price action, but I think there are two main, competing factors contributing to the volatility the market has seen in the last two weeks or so. It seems that fears of inflationary pressures causing the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected are affecting the market to the downside while the April Job Report, which missed analyst estimates and marked a sharp declaration in job growth compared to March, bolsters the Fed’s argument that it will not consider tightening monetary policy until it sees a “string” of strong labor reports.

Looking ahead, market participants wait for the  U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' April consumer price index (CPI) set to be released tomorrow and the producer price index (PPI), set to be released on Thursday. These reports will show the latest change in prices for consumers and suppliers, and are expected to show a significant jump over last year's pandemic-depressed levels as demand resurges as the economy in the US reopens. 

Last Friday, the April Job Report showed only 266,000 jobs added in the month of April, missing estimates of more than 1 million and marking a sharp deceleration from the 916,000 jobs added in March. Despite significant progress, the economy remains roughly 8.2 million jobs short compared to pre-pandemic levels, and both the unemployment rate and labor force participation rate remain well below February 2020. For months, members of the Federal Reserve, including Chairman Jerome Powell, have consistently said they expect any inflationary pressures to be “transitory” and want to see progress rather than projections in the labor market before they consider tightening monetary policy.  In an April 28 meeting Powell said, “Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.” Put simply, Powell is saying that after the severe decline of prices following the quarantine in March, a rise in inflation as the economy recovers is not surprising and reflects transitory factors (transitory meaning not permanent).

On the other hand, market participants are spooked that as the economy reopens and comes out of the pandemic, a surge in demand and consumer spending could drive a surge in prices. This, in turn, may prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner-than-expected, pressuring the valuations of technology and growth stocks. Market participants are anxiously waiting for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) set to be released tomorrow and the Producers Price Index (PPI), which are both expected to show a significant jump. Expectations for CPI are 3.6% year-on-year for the headline print and 2.3% year-on-year for the Core Inflation Rate (Core inflation rate is the one most people think about when talking about inflation). PPI is expected to be 5.9% year-on-year for April. If the numbers come out much higher than predicted, some analysts wonder if the Fed will realistically be able to hold out on raising rates for the foreseeable future. 

In short, the sharp deceleration in job growth shown in the April report serves to allay concerns that the Federal Reserve will tighten rate anytime soon, which may be why tech was able to bounce back somewhat today. For months, Jerome Powell and other members have reiterated they want to see significant progress in the labor market before they consider tightening policy and will telegraph their intentions well in advance. On the other hand, if the CPI and PPI numbers come in way higher than consensus estimates, inflation may begin to become a real concern for the Federal Reserve.

personalfinance,I need help- debt to income ratio,"I have around 180k in student loans, all of which are federal and I haven’t made a single payment yet. I finally got a stable job but the pay isn’t great (65k before taxes). I’m lucky enough to live at home at the moment but I’m 28 and am in a rush to move out and get my life started. I’m planning on dumping almost my entire income into my loans, however, I don’t see how I’ll ever pay it off. I have advanced degrees and am fairly certain I can move up within the company I’m working at annually, but I can’t wrap my head around the debt. Especially once interest resumes. Does anybody have any guidance on how I can manage a normal life with such heavy debt? I’m looking to consolidate my loans in hopes that it’ll lower my interest a little bit (it currently ranges from 6-8% between all loans). I called my loan provider to ask what my payment will be and they told me 1k/month. When I asked how that’s possible they told me they couldn’t calculate payments for the entirety of the loan and don’t know how much interest will be monthly because I don’t have a statement that applies interest ???? It was an extremely frustrating convo. I have advanced degrees and am employed by a huge company now so I’m not too worried about what my income will be 10-15 years from now, but for now, I don’t know where to start. I also have an IRA account with a decent chunk of money in there but I have no idea what to do with it.",finance

personalfinance,How do I move a non-college student loan?,"Just so we are all on the same page, I know this was a very stupid move and I've been kicking myself for years.

Ok, so 10 years ago I borrowed $20k for a private school for my kid through AES.  The balance is down to $12k with 3.6% interest.  The APR is variable and I have a feeling interest rates are going to start heading upwards. I also think AES calculates their interest funky because my college student loan which was about the same amount and higher interest (4.6%) only has $6k left and they were borrowed at the same time, with very similar payments.

Sorry I'm rambling, so where would I go to get an unsecured $12k loan, fixed APR no higher than 4%? I have very good credit.",finance

However the car is in transit and doesn't come in for another week or so. The deal I signed at the dealership was for an interest rate at 3.99%. However I checked their website for the month of May and the new interest rate deal is for 2.49%.

personalfinance,HELOC or Refinance?,"I've tried not to mess with my house financing since I bought in late 2019 but atm I'm currently considering shedding my debt and cutting up my credit cards by borrowing against the equity of my home while the housing market is still hot. I just need some honest opinions.

Purchased for 92.5k @ 3.875/30yr with PMI using FHA. I have offers from two parties who both think it will appraise between 120k-140k.Background: 35.6k Debt between two incomes, mostly mine ( $9k consolidation loan at about 18%, credit card debt from my reckless early 20's with percentages of 18.99-24.99%, and a car note with $5600 @ 5.24%). I am also the primary breadwinner at 45-60k (varies with overtime) and fiancée at 20-30k (cash tips). Our current monthly mortgage is $770 with PMI/Property Taxes/Insurance.

Now if the house appraises closer to 120k or less I understand it probably wouldn't be worth it in an attempt to shed our debt since the borrow allowance would be lower as well, but if I could potentially lump it all together in one go it would make things incredibly more manageable and eat up less money in interest and more to go to principle. So moving forward, the discussion will be if the house appraises for 140k or more (or if I utilize the heloc option?)

Currently I have a bank offer for Home Equity Loan (HELOC Right?) for 114,400$ @ 3.79 no rate lock / 20yrs under the assumption it appraises for $140k+. This gives me access to a loan at a lower interest rate than my credit cards/her car loan.

The other loan originator guestimates I could get a rate and term refinance for 30yr @ 4.14%+ give or take with a rate lock. This would allow me to get out of the FHA loan and into a conventional loan without PMI, but would give me less money to pay our debts. I could do a cash-out refinance but I believe that would not give me much more money to work with to make it significant.

Bottom line, I don't know which makes more sense to do since I have two objectives and it doesn't look like I can fully satisfy both so I have to pick one or the other if the appraisal comes back right.

Can I do the Heloc then go back and refinance the house? Or should I only do one or the other? We are both currently employed and don't foresee any major future expenses or job loss fortunately. I am leaning more towards the heloc since we can already comfortably afford our current mortgage payment despite having PMI on the life of the loan ($60\~ or so a month of that $770) and I could treat the payments as if it were replacing all my multiple credit card payments. Am I missing any variables or factors that I should be heavily considering? Am I misunderstanding something, I feel like I am.",finance

Husband got into medical school in Australia in 2020 but we are having a nightmare of a time trying to get financial aid. We are U.S citizens. Here's the catch, this particular school doesn't take Federal loans. It wouldn't be enough anyway at only 20k U.S.D a year and school is 30k a year. The only lender is Sallie Mae who requires U.S citizen to co-sign. I co-signed it because my credit score is 825/850 so it's pretty damn good but I only make 40k. His was credit score was 690 and had been employed with current job for 5 months with 65k earnings with solid work history. The loan was denied for 75k which is a year of medical school and 15k to move internationally and cover 6 months of expenses so we can get settled. We don't have collateral like a house. At the time, I had 25k in IRA and 6k in savings (I hold our savings because I'm better with money). No CD accounts and only had been employed with current job for 4 months but solid job history. Since he doesn't have anyone in his family without overextended credit/bad credit, he had to defer medical school for a year because we couldn't get loan. 

Nearly a year later, I have 30k saved and 27k in IRA, low debt to income ratio, 14 months at current job. His credit score is now 770 with 15 months of 65k job.

CryptoCurrency,"Everything is Screaming Inflation, and why the Official Numbers are BS.","There’s a huge inflation tsunami heading towards us. The April CPI reading comes out tomorrow at 8:30 AM. Good thing official inflation measures exclude food, housing, gas, education and healthcare. We don't need to be able to afford those things.

Let’s look past the bullshit CPI which registered 2.6% for the March reading. The everyday items you and I consume are going up by much larger amounts than the FEDs favorite inflation gauge. Take housing prices for example, which everyone knows are going up at a crazy rate. February year over year increase was 12% nationally and shows no sign of slowing down. But the CPI doesn’t reflect this. The CPI tries to estimate housing inflation using “owner equivalent rent” which is what a homeowner would pay to rent their own house. The cost of the house is ignored in this equation, the focus being on the cost of the shelter it provides instead. That’s great, unless you want to buy a house. 

The prices of just about everything that it takes to build that house are going up too. The price of a new lot to build on is up 11% YOY and will likely continue to climb as supply of new lots is down 20% in that same period. The materials that make up the home are up as follows:

Lumber: +67% YTD

Copper: +27% YTD

Gypsum: +7% YOY

Steel Mill Products: +18% YOY

Add in a shortage of construction workers, a national push for higher wages and ultra-low interest rates and housing shows no signs of becoming more affordable anytime soon. Fulfilment costs are going up across the board as well, due to numerous factors. Disruptions in the global shipping markets have led to price increases of 25-50% on shipping containers.

To compound the aforementioned issues, the prices of the commodities and inputs used to produce a broad range of goods are also increasing rapidly. Look at these increases in just the last month alone:

Cocoa: +2.5%

Coffee: +12.7%

Sugar: +13.6%

Lean Hogs: +6.3%

Rough Rice: +3.6%

Oats: +7.4%

Soybeans: +7.7%

Wheat: +18%

Corn: +18.5%

Farmers are now substituting wheat grown for human consumption as animal feed due to the huge increase in the price of corn. This feedstock inflation can trickle thru the butcher block and dairy isle and potentially increase prices of meat, chicken, milk, eggs and cheese, just to name a few. 

In the recent earnings calls of several multi-national corporations the topic of pricing and supply chain issues was highlighted. Coke and Pepsi are both going to raise prices, and if you look at the price of sugar, the reason is obvious. P&amp;G and Mondelez both announced intentions to do the same, and Kraft spoke about rising costs across it supply chains. Selling a smaller amount for the same price isn’t gonna cut it this time anymore. Prices are going up. 

So, inflation appears to be working its way thru commodities markets and supply chains and will soon be knocking on the door. Could it be that the inevitable hangover from the money printer going BRRRRR is approaching? I have no idea, but the numbers are staggering. Don’t worry though, you likely won’t be affected. Unless you live inside, drive, eat, drink coffee or pop, shop online or have anything to do with those industries, you’ll be just fine!

* No auto loan (one car lease)
* Wife has student loans (less than me, but way lower interest)
* Mortgage
* Already maxed out employer 401K and we're both starting IRAs
* 6+mo emergency fund in accessible savings
* No other investments, however my 2021 goal is to become more financially literate and begin investing beyond retirement accounts...if I were further along on this front I'd probably opt to put the money into this **as I'm sure I will see a greater return on the investment in the market** but at this point in time I simply do not feel comfortable with making that commitment when I know there is a guaranteed ROI by paying the loans off while simultaneously freeing up $750/mo in cash flow that can be put towards other financial goals.

investing,Billionaire Sam Zell Buys Gold With Inflation ‘Reminiscent of the ‘70s’,"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-04/sam-zell-buys-gold-with-inflation-reminiscent-of-the-1970s

Billionaire investor Sam Zell is seeing inflation everywhere, and has bought gold as a hedge -- something he says he used to knock others for doing.

“Obviously one of the natural reactions is to buy gold,” he said in a Bloomberg Television interview. “It feels very funny because I’ve spent my career talking about why would you want to own gold? It has no income, it costs to store. And yet, when you see the debasement of the currency, you say, what am I going to hold on to?”

Zell, 79, said he’s concerned not only about the U.S. dollar but other countries printing money as well, and questioned whether inflation will be transitory, as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell indicated last week.

“Oh boy, we’re seeing it all over the place,” Zell said of inflation. “You read about lumber prices, but we’re seeing it in all of our businesses. The obvious bottlenecks in the supply chain arena are pushing up prices. It’s very reminiscent of the ‘70s.”

While gold is an attractive investment, opportunities in fossil fuels are not, said Zell, who in 2019 agreed to set up a joint venture with Tom Barrack Jr.’s Colony Capital Inc. to invest in oil and gas.

“Right now, oil and gas is not priced to reflect the risk of what’s going on, whether it be in the EV world, a climate changed world,” he said. “As recently as a couple of years ago I thought the risk-reward ratio was appropriate. It’s clearly become very inappropriate as our political situation has changed.”

Zell also said he’s concerned about renewable energy undermining the reliability of power grids, pointing to the recent blackouts in California and Texas.

In real estate, there are plenty of questions about what demand will look like over the next couple years in the office, lodging and retail sectors, Zell also said in the interview.

“Everybody’s worried about going back to work and office-space occupancy. I don’t think that’s really an issue,” he said. “The problem is that, before the pandemic, we were dealing with an oversupply of office space. Obviously the pandemic hasn’t reduced that oversupply and has probably encouraged it accordingly.”

Stores also present challenges, he said, given that the U.S. already had more retail space per person than the rest of the world before Covid-19, and shoppers increased their reliance on e-commerce while stuck at home during the pandemic.

“Street retail today is like a falling knife, and you don’t know how far it goes down,” he said. While that “doesn’t mean the best malls aren’t going to perform,” there’s a “huge amount of real estate that’s going to have to be reprogrammed in one form or another.”

The challenges faced by hotels are more of a temporary problem over the next three to four years, Zell said. “We will see a slow recovery in business travel,” he said. “In the interim period of time, it’s going to be a slow recovery, and hotels are big overhead things and running them at less-than-optimum occupancy is a very expensive scenario.”",finance
personalfinance,Settle a debate: Can you re-negotiate a mortgate pre-approval?,"Didn't know where else to post this.. thought maybe r/askreddit but figured i'd get more educated answers here.

If a house appraises for $400k, but the buyers pre-approval is only for $375k, can the buyer go back to the bank and ask/re-negotiate for a higher pre-approved amount?

* My assumption is that they may choose to give you a higher amount at a higher interest rate, but obviously they may choose not to. They're not going to approve you for something you can barely afford, so to raise it a little is ok, but it's going to cost you by way of a higher rate. They're not going to give approve you for the absolute max you can afford... an amount that means you're going to have to choose between mortgage or food.

I am looking for second opinions on my wife and I's current finances and budgets and our future prospects. We are looking to buy a house within the next 5 years and plan on having kids after we're settled in the new house.

Summary;

* Age: Both 25
* Location: California, USA
* Income Before Tax: $75,000(me) + $45,000(wife) ($120,000 combined)
* Retirement(totals combined between wife and I): 401k($21,000) | Roth IRA($29,000)
* Savings: ~$25,000
* Rent: $1650 w/utilities
* Loans/Debt: 1 Car($15,000 @ 2.4% w/36 months left(~$430 month)) and 1 CC($3500, no interest until mid-2022, plan to pay it off beforehand)
* Education: Me; HS graduate, no college | Wife; Bachelor's and currently enrolled for her Masters($8,000 a year tuition($4k every 6 months))

Prospects;

* My income may increase with a highly likely promotion by end of this year to over $100,000.
* My wife may find a new job, which could increase her income. Unknown for the amount. I am guessing $60k-$80k is likely due to education and experience.
* Rent may go down if we add another roommate, still planning/contemplating this.

Goals;

* House purchase within 5 years, before/at 30 years old. House prices, we hope, go down. We don't want a 4,000 sqft mansion. A modest 1,500-2,000 sqft house for $300k-$400k with a 2-3 bedrooms is our plan. Pipe dream. I know.
* Keep saving for retirement. Don't touch retirement unless emergency.

Budget/Savings;

* My income, ~$4,000 a month after tax. Covers all of rent, bills, car payment, CC's/every day purchases for my wife and I. I contribute 16% of each paycheck to my 401k(trad)(company matches 50% up to 4%, so 8% contribution needed on my side for max match), and try my best to put $500 each month to my Roth IRA. At the end of the month I usually have $500 or so left over(plan on trimming what I can).
* Wife's income, ~$2,400 a month after tax. $2,000(max contribution) of which goes straight to savings in a 2.75% savings account she has access to. 1-Year maturity. Maturity ends in August. At that point we'll have ~$26,000 from contributions and gains every year. We plan on continuing this for as long as possible due to the high APY. I let her do whatever she wants with the extra $400, but she's been saving what she has left over after spending.

5-Year Projections;

* 5 years of savings(and gains) with the high APY account alone: ~$130k.
* My 401K(~$110k by my calcs) and Roth IRA($77k($42k in contributions)). Estimating a 10% return each year(I know, not a guarantee).
* My wife's Roth IRA($50k($30k in contributions)). Estimating a 10% return each year(I know, not a guarantee).

Misc;

* My work has overtime usually, though not guaranteed. Last year I average an extra $5k in income working overtime, not much but its something.
* Usually every month I go through all my bank statements and see where my money is going. I do this to try and find any ""leaks"" and stop it if I can. I track all my necessary expenses in spreadsheets so I know what I'm spending for the necessities.

CryptoCurrency,When do you pull out for taxes?,"So I feel like I'm starting to get into dangerous areas. I've been using bots and a few other things like manual trading to get some real gains.

Being in the USA I know I only need to pay capital gains taxes on sells/swaps. I'm using Koinly and cointracker to help keep track of this. I'm paying for Koinly services since that is far cheaper and they both are pretty much the same, but I'm using them both so I can see if some numbers are extremely different and this brings up red flags.

Currently I have about 20k transactions (most due to the bots since if I use something like a grid bot I am just looking at a 0.35%+ gain per grid).

&amp;#x200B;

I never had a lot of money to start with. $ per $ I think I started with about $5k-$6k. Right now I'm looking at a little over $4k in realized gains. I might have to look at things just to make sure all the numbers are 100% right. But it's about $4k-$5k realized gains. So not by much to some, but to me as someone who started at extreme poverty IDK how I'm going to cover that at this time. I think between state taxes and federal that's about $1,250 in just raw taxes if the gain is $5k.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to come up with a stable thing where I might take out a given % of my profits per month or every other month to cover for taxes and what not.

Note I am trying to move into more long term trades to get out of this worry since capital gains if held over 1 year it's $0 in federal taxes if the amount gain is less than $40k.

&amp;#x200B;

How often do you pull your money out and set it aside for taxes? What would you do about this situation?

&amp;#x200B;

HUGE NOTE: one thing I am worried about is if the IRS will eventually do an audit on me. I heard if you had a large amount of transactions, then you can get audited. 

(If I somehow get in the $100k range in gains maybe less, I will try to hire an accountant I can talk to about stuff like this. Because my anxiety has been through the celling because of worrying about future possible tax problems and how can I deal with it. IMO if someone has to worry this much when they are trying to be 100% legal in what they do, then the system is broken.)",cryptocurrency

# Ethereum can't scale

This is demonstrably false because there are multiple rollups currently online, some of which have been running for a year now! Here are some examples that you can use today: Loopring, zkSync, DeversiFi, Hermez, Aztec, dYdX, Immutable X etc. Most of these projects can process thousands of TPS with such low gas fees that some of them subsidize it (or abstract it away from UX), so the users effectively pay zero gas.

What's missing are generalized programmable rollups. Optimism has been live on mainnet since January, but is currently restricted to only Synthetix. Uniswap V3 is the next major release on Optimism, before finally opening it up for public smart contract deployment in July or later. By the way, Optimism have done a *terrible* job with communications this year - criticism is certainly due here. Engineering-focused project or not, communications &amp; public relations are always important.

But Optimism is just one solution. Other solutions like zkSync 2.0, Arbitrum and StarkNet will be rolling out over the course of the year, and we have more like OMGX and Cartesi joining the fray. Indeed, it now seems likely Arbitrum will be publicly available ahead of Optimism. Not to mention sidechains or commitchains like Polygon or xDai, or other EVM chains like BSC or Avalanche. Ultimately, all of these are part of the extended Ethereum ecosystem.

At the same time, this is also partially true. I will note that Ethereum L1 gas fees will likely remain high forever, short of some exotic technology that doesn't yet exist. Even on rollups, you're not going to get dirt cheap fees until data sharding is released, which is a couple of years away, and even that won't be enough long term. And that's just fine... There's simply overwhelming demand for EVM blockspace.

# High gas fees will kill Ethereum

This is one of those bizarre comments that pervades through crypto retail doesn't seem to make any sense. Overwhelming demand for a product will somehow... kill a project? It's like saying AMD and Nvidia are going to die soon because graphics cards are now grotesquely overpriced.

No, the reality, like I said above, is that there's overwhelming demand for EVM blockspace and a limited supply of gas. Currently, the high fees shows there's incredible demand for Ethereum L1 blockspace, and people are willing to pay a steep premium for it.

**This is what gives the Ethereum network and ETH value. And in two months' time, there'll be a mechanism with EIP-1559 to accrue this value to every ETH stakeholder.**

Over time, we will see gas fees drop with a greater supply of gas - the reality is that there'll never quite be enough blockspace supply to satisfy global demand for EVM blockspace long term. There'll be rollups, there'll be hybrid solutions like zkPorter/Validium, there'll be sidechains/alternate chains, and there'll be centralized solutions. The ecosystem will work together to offer different trade-offs with decentralization versus transaction fees.

# Ethereum is centralized, all decisions are made by Vitalik

While Vitalik remains an important part of the Ethereum ecosystem, Ethereum development has become sufficiently decentralized over time. Unique to Ethereum is a multi-client approach, where researchers work with developers to create plain text specifications. These specifications are then implemented by multiple client developers who work independently. This is different to all other blockchain projects where the core team develops a single client. Now, of course, there are arguments for a single client - putting all resources into one client could make for a higher quality client than 4 or 5 not-as-high-quality client, but this is clearly the most decentralized approach. For example, there are currently 4 consensus layer clients in production, and 1 more in development - all developed by teams independent of the Ethereum Foundation (apart from receiving grants). For any consensus forks, these 5 development teams have to agree on upgrades, and then 135,000+ validators do as well. This is not how a centralized network functions. Not to mention Ethereum's strong ""Layer 0"" that all developers and validators listen to intently - its community. For example, EIP-1559 has been significantly motivated by the will of the community.

# Ethereum was premined. Ethereum is controlled by Vitalik. (u/aaqy, u/ec265)

I'm not a fan of ICOs, and Ethereum certainly did have one. I don't like ninja mining either, like Bitcoin. We have seen some DeFi projects have fair launches with airdrops to users, and this is certainly the best way to distribute tokens.

However, It's important to understand the context - back in 2014 this was simply the fairest way to raise funding. At genesis, Ethereum Foundation held \~12M ETH. However, over the years, this has been distributed - a lot of it seems to be fundraising in the early years. Currently Ethereum Foundation and early developers hold \~2% of the supply at most. Vitalik owns 0.3% of all ETH.

Contrast this with other projects where the founders often hold 20% or more, public corporations like Tesla or Amazon with a similar amount, or Satoshi holding 5% of all BTC. (Was as high as 50+% in 2009/10, and yes, they are assumed lost and not comparable anyway.) I would even go ahead and say that 0.3% is absolutely not enough to adequately incentivize a founder to keep working on the project!

Would I have preferred to see Ethereum do a fairer launch? Sure. But today, in the here and now, Ethereum has the fairest distribution among founders of any project.

# Mining is destroying the environment

While there are nuances to do this, this one's actually true to an extent - mining is highly inefficient. Fortunately, Ethereum is moving to proof-of-stake within the next 9 months, which will cut Ethereum's energy consumption by 99+%.

It's not just about electricity either. We know there's a significant global shortage for semiconductors right now. A lot of TSMC's limited wafer supply currently being used to fabricate mining-related silicon (ASICs, GPUs) can be reallocated towards CPUs, ASICs and GPUs more productive usecases like engineering, science, and of course, gaming.

# Ethereum did a rollback and will do it again

People like to point to the DAO fork as proof that Ethereum is not immutable. But there are many nuances to this that are disingenuously ignored:

\- Firstly, the DAO fork was not a rollback. It was a unique situation where the hackers had to wait 28 days for withdrawals, so a smart contract change was executed.

\- There was strong consensus across developers, users, miners and community alike - it was hardly a centralized decision.

\- Those who disagreed simply moved to Ethereum Classic. It's a win-win situation for all.

\- Ethereum was still a very, very new project then. You know which other project did a rollback when it was less than 2 years old?  [Value overflow incident - Bitcoin Wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Value_overflow_incident)

\- [EIP-999 being rejected](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-999.md) is the final deathblow to this hypothesis. There was a chance to rollback 500,000 ETH to an entity managed by one of its co-founders, and the community overwhelmingly rejected it. **Rollbacks do not happen on Ethereum.**

# Ethereum relies on Infura

While it's certainly true that Infura is a dominant service provider, and the ecosystem definitely needs to diversify, this is demonstrably false. Infura [suffered a massive outage in November 2020](https://blog.infura.io/infura-mainnet-outage-post-mortem-2020-11-11/), yet Ethereum kept running just fine. Sure, it disrupted some frontends, exchanges and wallets, but nothing that couldn't be fixed with simply running your own node or using a different service. Since this outage, many frontends and wallets have started running their own nodes and using alternatives like Alchemy. There's still more work to do on this front, but to say Ethereum is reliant on Infura is false.

# Ethereum state is growing too fast

Compared to Bitcoin, this is certainly true. If you want a chain that's easiest to play back in archival mode, verify every transaction from genesis, then yes, Bitcoin is a better option. It's just a question of how valuable this really is - given you're trusting Bitcoin miners already if you want to use their network? With Ethereum, you can run full nodes (not archive) on a Raspberry Pi 4 with a 1 TB SSD, and send and verify transactions. This is relatively accessible hardware to most users and consumers. Some would argue that clients like TurboGeth makes this easy enough even for archive nodes.

On a related note, Ethereum's state growth is much, much closer to Bitcoin than Binance Smart Chain, EOS, Solana or other high-TPS L1 chains. The concept of users verifying transactions don't even exist for these chains.

As a side note, Ethereum will make more such trade-offs going forward with weak subjectivity, statelessness, state expiry etc. Purists will cry foul, and that's fine - there'll be an audience that will gladly trade-off being able to sync from genesis given the tremendous benefits elsewhere.

# Ethereum has no fixed cap

This is true, but there are good security reasons for it. I'd add that with EIP-1559 and The Merge, it is somewhat likely ETH will hit a maximum supply of around \~120M and continue deflating or stabilising from there.

# Ethereum's monetary policy is unreliable

This is also partially true. While many exaggerate, it is true that Ethereum has seen 2 cuts in block rewards, and these were made by social consensus rather than code. EIP-1559 and The Merge completely overhaul Ethereum's monetary policy. But yes, until EIP-1559 and The Merge prove themselves on mainnet without further changes over several years, this remains a valid criticism. Bitcoin remains the standard for predictable and reliable monetary supply - though it does trade-off with a security risk in the future.

# Ethereum 2.0 is years away

There are a lot of misconceptions about ""Ethereum 2.0"", though the Ethereum researchers an developers are largely to blame for confusing communications. Firstly, we don't even call it that anymore. Anyway, this just refers to a series of upgrades. The first upgrade, beacon chain, went live in Dec 2020, The Merge is actively being developed (the second devnet is going live today) and scheduled to release by late 2021. Next comes data sharding. Another misconception is these upgrades will lead to low gas fees - definitely not on L1. What data sharding will do is accelerate rollups. A much greater impact to L1 will be statelessness+state expiry, plus sharding execution if it's ever required. (The jury's now out on that one...)

# Ethereum has no intrinsic value, it's all created from thin air

Ethereum is a global, decentralized SaaS platform and collects revenues in transaction fees. These transaction fees are now substantial - over $1 billion per month. Indeed, yesterday, Ethereum generated $117M ([cryptofees.info](https://cryptofees.info)), which is $43B annualized. This would put Ethereum as #2 compared to the largest corporations in the world. I don't think this sort of activity is sustainable for now, but it shows you that it's possible, and gives you a glimpse into the future.

With EIP-1559 releasing in July, a majority of these transaction fees will be burned, directly accruing value to all ETH stakeholders. Following The Merge, the remaining non-burned fees (tips) will be returned to stakers, in addition to the yield they generate.

Not only is Ethereum one of the most productive assets in the world, it also has the most advanced accrual mechanisms.

# It is too difficult to stake ETH

This is definitely valid, 32 ETH is a lot of money. However, I think there's a significant misconception about what staking is. On many of the delegated-type chains, when you're ""staking"" what you're actually doing is just delegating to someone else. Some newer models like Algorand randomizes this process, but you're still delegating, rather than validating. You're effectively being given free money for not really doing anything. Early delegated-type systems like BitShares or EOS never paid delegators, so the validators ended up bribing delegators. The new delegated-type systems simply ""pre-bribe"" delegators. Of course, validators can still bribe delegators from their rewards, but that's a separate discussion.

In Ethereum beacon chain, you are validating your own ETH, and thus earning staking fees for providing a service to the network.

Those that just want to stake and don't care about these technicalities, beacon chain is just the base layer, and we have multiple staking services being built on top of it, with various levels of decentralization. These staking services let you earn staking rewards for small amounts of ETH. See the full list here:  [Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain (Phase 0) Block Chain Explorer - Ethereum 2.0 Staking Services Overview - beaconcha.in - 2021](https://beaconcha.in/stakingServices)

# Ethereum never executes upgrades on time and constantly change their plans (u/I_haven-t_reddit)

Does Ethereum constantly change their plans? Yeah, that's definitely true. But it's simply pragmatic. This industry is innovating rapidly, and when you have exponential advancements, it doesn't make any sense to just stick to old tech. Abandoning the hybrid PoW/PoS makes sense, even if it means you lose out a year or so of research. Going for a rollup-centric roadmap makes sense, simply because it'll deliver massive scalability sooner than anyone imagined. Upgrades are definitely being executed - the beacon chain went live in Dec 2020, EIP-1559 happens in two months' time, and The Merge goes less than 6 months after that.

A perfect counter case would be Cardano, which is basically obsolete 2015-era tech. DPoS, single-ledger, relying on state channels and sidechains for scalability. By rejecting significant advancements like signature aggregation, sharding and rollups, they are destined to be stuck in the past. OK, maybe that's a poor example because despite being obsolete they still can't execute. Seriously, though, the actual counter case is, of course, Bitcoin. And that's just fine - a model like that makes sense for something that just wants to be money and nothing else.

# Proof-of-stake increases centralization by concentrating wealth (u/epic_trader, u/Mathje, u/sn00fy)

While this seems to make sense at first glance, there are many nuances to this:

\- Ethereum has had the benefit of 6+ years of proof-of-work, and we've seen significant token distribution in that time. Now, the distribution is relatively decentralized and second only to Bitcoin.

\- Validators and (non-validating) stakers have costs too. While hardware costs are significantly lower, there'll be taxes and overheads which will be redistributed.

\- The biggest factor often overlooked is that proof-of-stake has very, very low issuance. When The Merge happens, issuance will be \~0.5%. A validator cap is being proposed which will also subsequently cap issuance at only 0.8% or so.

Proof-of-work may still have better redistribution characteristics, but it's marginal at best.

# Even if companies adopt Ethereum they will just run a private chain (u/sn00fy)

Not just companies, but we're going to see private chains being run for consumers. We are already seeing some of this with Binance Smart Chain, but in the future, I'd speculate have big players like governments, banks, and corporations run private chains.

Naturally, there'll also be business adoption for the public chain with B2B activities.

Like I alluded to at the very beginning, only a very limited amount of gas will be consumed on the Ethereum L1 chain long term. But that doesn't matter - L1 will be 100% saturated at all times, and other solutions building with Ethereum only adds to its network and Lindy effects.

# Ethereum has old tech, new chains have newer tech (u/Mathje)

Of all the misinformation and FUD that pervades this space, this is the one that grinds my gears the most. Ethereum has always been at the bleeding edge of innovation, and continues to be. While there are certainly innovative projects in the space, absolutely nothing is even attempting to solve the big problems: the blockchain trilemma. Consider this: every other smart contract chain uses some form of delegated-type consensus mechanism, many with a hard cap on number of validators. Cosmos: 300 (currently 150); Polkadot: 1,000; Binance Smart Chain/EOS: 21. The ones that end up with more validators have to compromise on scalability.

Beacon chain uses revolutionary new techniques like weak subjectivity and signature aggregation to enable massive decentralization with up to a million validators. There are 135,000 validators live already despite being none more than an incentivized testnet, with thousands being added every week. Not to mention, beacon chain validators are not required to be online 24x7 like the other chains.

Or, consider this: these L1 chains can offer more throughput than Ethereum's \~55 TPS for ETH transfers, or \~20 TPS overall, sure. But Ethereum is empowering rollups with data sharding to scale to 100,000 TPS and beyond, with groundbreaking new tech (data availability sampling) securing it all without compromising decentralization. No L1 will ever scale to these levels, even after absolutely giving up on decentralization. Not even considering hybrid solutions like zkPorter or Validium.

Or, consider this: the most innovative chains are actually rollups. Just look at the phenomenal work being done by StarkNet. There's a good reason they are becoming rollups on Ethereum and not anywhere else - it has the best consensus mechanism in the industry.

Or, consider this: Pretty much every innovative new smart contract is released on Ethereum, and then copy-pasted to other chains.

In short, the Ethereum ecosystem has far and away the most cutting-edge tech in the industry.

# There is no real use case for Ethereum. It's only used by degens for gambling and exchanging other tokens that are just as useless. (u/sn00fy)

Degens are paying transaction fees just like everyone else - the whole point of credible neutrality and permissionless means Ethereum does not discriminate what people use the chain for.

That said, it is certainly concerning that a lot of activity on Ethereum seems to be speculative. This is, of course, true of all early tech. We're definitely seeing real adoption from big players as well - I don't need to repeat all the news about Visa, EIB bonds, etc. A lot of work needs to be done to onboard more of these non-degen usecases.

# Rollups are centralized

It's true that some of the early rollups have centralized sequencers. This is not a security risk, though, as fraud or validity proofs will ensure the same security as Ethereum mainnet. There is a liveness and censorship risk, and centralized sequencers are definitely not trustless systems. Fortunately, most rollups have decentralized sequencers in their roadmaps, so this is not going to be an issue for long.

# Rollup-centric roadmap breaks composability ([epic\_trader](https://www.reddit.com/user/epic_trader/))

Yes, and no. Within rollups, everything will be composable, but between rollups/L1 nominally hey do break composability. Fortunately, there are multiple projects hard at work to solve this, with relatively seamless L2&lt;&gt;L2 interoperability. It's still a work-in-progress, of course, but this is more of an engineering problem that is currently being solved than a theoretical hurdle.

# Bonus: Ethereum is a frankenstein monster with two chains, two assets, ETH1 and ETH2

No, there's only one ETH. While there are two chains that run in parallel right now, think of beacon chain as an incentivized testnet to ensure the brand new consensus mechanism works well. These chains will be merged in the next 9 months and it'll all be one ethereum again.

# Addendum

I feel like half the comments down below are oblivious to the concept of the blockchain trilemma. No project has solved it, or is even attempting to, other than Ethereum. All projects other than Bitcoin and Ethereum significantly compromise on decentralization and security to varying magnitudes, and most still can't offer the scalability Ethereum rollups offer today - let alone after data sharding goes live. Wake me up when you have a non-delegated consensus mechanism with 135,000 validators (let alone the 1 million possible) while at the same time maintaining a manageable state that can be run on a consumer laptop or a Raspberry Pi 4. Like I mentioned, most chains have a few hundred validators at most with stake delegated and centralized to them. Someone mentioned Solana - according to the project's system requirements page ( [Validator Requirements | Solana Docs](https://docs.solana.com/running-validator/validator-reqs) ) it requires a cloud instance that costs $1,200/mo to run a Solana node, with a state growing by several TBs every month. This is simply a different class of product that is in no way comparable to Ethereum. There's nothing wrong with this, and as I've mentioned above, there'll be different solutions with varying trade-offs between decentralization and transaction costs built on top of  or parallel to Ethereum.

# Errata

(Edited in 18 hours after the post went live)

\- 90% of the comments criticizing this post seems to be around the fees. I'll once again reiterate the blockchain trilemma, and that the Ethereum ecosystem is uniquely positioned to deliver great scalability through rollups, combined with high decentralization and security. L1 gas will remain high, and that's fine, because most people will be transacting on rollups, hybrid solutions like zkPorter/Validium or even centralized sidechains. I think there's a significant mental block in thinking of rollups the same way as alternate L1s. Rollups are exactly that - direct competitors to alternate L1s, but superior to them in almost every respect. Crucially, what many seem to be misunderstanding is that no L1 can possibly offer the combined scalability the Ethereum ecosystem working together at various levels can. 

\- While the DAO fork was not technically a rollback, it was definitely in the spirit of one, and should be criticized as such. It was still a unique, one-time event, and all further attempts at rollbacks, most notable EIP-999, have been unanimously defeated.

\- While Bitcoin mining was highly centralized in the early days, this is not a ""ninja mine"". It remains clearly a fairer launch than Ethereum's.

\- While proof-of-work is undeniably inefficient, it is fair to say that proof-of-stake needs to prove itself at scale before being considered superior to proof-of-work.",cryptocurrency

No change in strategy with BABA, so probably mostly holding as Masa sees no fundamental changes in it as a business and it makes plenty of money. Notes that Mapbox deal with SVF unmentionable company is not announced yet (didn't comment on it specifically) but saw no problem with Softbank unmentionable companies merging with SVF portfolio companies. No expectation of doing more share buybacks, implies he would allow share price to fall further below book value of assets and focus on investing. Wants to focus on systemic approach to investing to exiting companies and create more regular pipeline so more steady revenue going forward. Says SVF2 money can be recycled easily and a 3rd party investor is not necessary, happy with amount of capital available. Downplays worries about risks of technology regulation, says he is focused on unicorns not megacaps.

My take: fundamentals are good. Investors are not going to like that he no longer plans to commit to share buybacks. I'd expect the share price to fall a fair bit medium term. Masa implied high levels of confidence on BABA and Arm deal to NVDA which are the 2 big question marks right now.",finance

CryptoCurrency,"Are we sacrificing decentralization, transparency and immutability in order to speed up adoption?","Three blockchain executives discuss their work with governments in fraught political contexts, and the questions it raises about blockchain’s claim to the libertarian banner.

From cypherpunk to state contracts: the changing face of blockchain   


Blockchain continues to occupy an unusual space in the contemporary tech sphere, with concepts such as “decentralization,” “transparency” and “immutability” continuing to slide between a purely technical meaning and a more overtly politicized one. 

Certain blockchain advocates — at least, those still steeped in the libertarian ethos that survives the technology's roots in the cypherpunk movement — continue to question the technology's implementation for projects like government defense contracts, as well as its wider absorption into the traditional financial banking systems it was originally designed to circumvent.

Earlier this week, Cointelegraph reached out to several executives at the Fantom Foundation to reflect on the choices and approaches taken by blockchain companies who work in governmental and institutional contexts that raise fundamental questions about blockchain’s status from a socio-political perspective.

 Fantom had recently announced a new public-private partnership with the Tajik Ministry of Industry of New Technologies that will see the rollout of a range of blockchain-based solutions across nationwide IT infrastructure. The partnership forms part of Fantom's wider business strategy across Central and South Asia.

In respect to the incumbent Tajik government, citizens have long called attention to the abuses of President Rahmon's dictatorial regime, which emerged out of a brutal civil war in the mid-1990smid 1990s following the collapse of the Soviet Union. State monopoly over media, the systemic repression of political dissent and banning of the main opposition party, and the absence of civic and democratic freedoms has forced many Tajiks to seek political asylum abroad.

Speaking to Cointelegraph, Fantom’s chief government relations officer Barek Sekandari said that Fantom's choice to collaborate with various regimes, despite their politics, is due to the company's priority to provide the populations of countries in underdeveloped economies with the same level of technological modernization as exists across the Global North. 

Sekandari argued that for Fantom:

""Our goal is not to help these so-called regimes or whatever to to be more repressive [...] our goal is to solve [...] real-world problems [...] There are a lot of people suffering because of the state finance and health system, supply chain management, the educational system, the paper money system. These are the problems that the general public is facing on a daily basis. It's not the government as a whole, if you put it that way.""
As noted, there are many blockchain companies who choose, for example, to pursue contracts with federal military agencies at the core of the Global North, the United States, where innovative technologies are already widespread and broadly accessible.

Sekandari further emphasized that Fantom is not only working with the Tajik ministry but also coordinating its work with international organizations working in the region, such as the Asian Development Bank and the United Nations, among others.

Fantom’s previous engagements in Central Asia and South Asia have also included the signing of a memorandum of understanding with the Pakistan Punjab Prisons Department to formalize the beginning of blockchain-based software implementations. 

As with Tajikistan, Fantom's choice to work with the authorities is a fraught one: under the premiership of Imran Khan since 2018, the government has come under criticism for its brutal repression of grassroots movements among students, farmers and teachers against the austerity prescriptions of a 2019 IMF loan conditional on a structural adjustment program. 

Responding to Cointelegraph's questions about Fantom's choice to work with the prison systems management of the Pakistani state, Fantom's director of Asia operations, Samuel Harcourt, said the company would still hold that improving transparency and data integrity remains an important thing, regardless of the institutional context.

As part of a different project in the region, the Fantom also continues to collaborate with Afghanistan’s Ministry of Health, including work on a blockchain-based product to prevent the circulation of counterfeit pharmaceuticals. Fantom's CEO Michael Kong told Cointelegraph he believes the benefits of a blockchain system are particularly evident here, in light of the fact that 40% of drugs in Afghanistan are counterfeit, with most citizens therefore unable to trust the quality of what they procure at local pharmacies.

CryptoCurrency,Looking for interesting blockchain/NFT based games and my experience with them so far,"Hey guys! I lived under a rock for some years and only now started to research into crypto adoption world. I found out there are actual games you can play which use blockchain technologies to create engaging economy style of gameplay. Before I only knew about Gods Unchained and it required prior investment so I dismissed it. I want so share my thoughts on games I found to be interesting in that field which I think you should check out.


First game that caught my attention was Alien Worlds. Even though it doesn't have an actual gameplay at the moment, the amount of WAX you can create with it served me well to scale into different games. I also like how I gradually scale my resource acquisition by finding new items. In not so distant future they plan to add missions to earn new NFTs and battles between minions.


Another project is Red Planet which again is not quite a game (at least I didn't get to the game part yet cause I don't have enough currency to spend for elements to craft things). Rather it is another avenue to scale your WAX acquisition by staking all your NFTs found in other games for it.


Then I found out about Koloboks which as I gather made quite a few waves on Red Planet before they nerfed the amount of aether you could earn by staking Koloboks NFTs. Game is basically breeding sim where you can earn in-game coins and prize NFTs by sending your pets on missions. It has some interesting aspects where you try to figure out which units to breed, which to send on missions (they have a chance to die based on mission difficulty) and which you should just get rid of to scale your flock better in the future. Also NFT acquisition is still relatively fast and staking on Red Planet allows for bigger amounts of WAX to be earned.


Then comes Telegram integrated Nifty Wizards which is a text based RPG sort of thing. It is created by the same people who made DU$T which is a coin you can get for each message you send in affiliated chats in Telegram. In NW you complete quests and earn NFTs which allow you to get more variety of activities to do and eventually find new ways to get DU$T. Unfurtunately, the game is in very early stages and lacks clarity and purpose so to speak. It clogs your Telegram with like 10 different chat rooms you no longer have any interest to be in once you complere quest and they fail to explain what goals you can strive towards and now to achieve them. Interesting project but definitely needs some polish and redesign I think.


So these are NFT based games I found on WAX platform that caught my eye. I am 100% sure I missed some other neat projects in the same vain. What games you tried and can recommend? Maybe even something outside of WAX ecosystem?",cryptocurrency

This is a big risk to the USD status as a reserve currency for all transactions, and even as a store of wealth. That's why cryptos have become so popular since 2011. And Dogecoin is posed to be that new store of wealth, the new reserve currency for all transactions. The US has reached its debt limit, and if Congress does nothing about it by the end of July then they default on the national debt. $1 by end of 2021 is as likely as Congress raising the debt ceiling and passing more spending bills using more dollars borrowed, with interest, from the Federal Reserve.

In the information economy, the digitalization of money as in production systems leads to a gradual decrease in the use of cash in economic transactions. In fact, it is costly in cash production, transportation and storage. In the Figure, the increase rates in non-cash transactions in major countries between 2015 and 2016 are given. The country with the largest decrease in cash usage is Russia with an increase of 36.5%, followed by China with 25.8%. In the USA, this rate increased by 5.7%. In short, although the transition from cashing out varies significantly between countries, it is actually almost global.

In the new economic system where money has entered the digitalization process, the concept of “**Cashless Society**” has become a frequently discussed concept. The **cashless society**, in short, is a situation where all kinds of financial transactions are made electronically in the digital environment, not with the usual physical banks and coins (Chakravorti and Mazzotta 2013). For example, the bill submitted to the US Senate in June 2020, the bill, code S3571, briefly passes the following topic: “The bill includes Federal Reserve Banking’s digital transition accounts for residents and citizens and businesses residing in the United States (i.e. Among other things, these accounts are required to provide certain banking services to eligible individuals who choose to deposit funds into these accounts, including access to covid-19 (i.e. 2019 coronavirus disease) and payments. These accounts may not charge fees or it may not have balance requirements and must provide a specific interest rate.

personalfinance,Continue paying down student loan debt or start saving,"Hello!

Looking for some financial advice from the group! I just paid off my last private loan last month (woohoo!!) with an institutional loan (0%), perkins loans (5.0%) and federal loans (avg. 4.24%) remaining. I'm trying to decide my next steps and whether I should shift a larger percent of my income to savings/investments as I have sort term goals I'd like save up for. Up until last month, I had been paying at least \~$2,600 towards my loans each month (private loan accounted for $10k total).

Below is a detailed breakdown of my current finances:

Assets:

* Income: $75,000 gross (bi-weekly pay); after deductions the net into checking is \~$1700/paycheck
* E-Fund: $10,000 in High Yield Savings - goal is to have $12k but I'm content right now
* Additional saving in HY: \~$10,000
* Employer Roth 401k: 10% gross plus 5% match (bi-weekly pay)
* Roth IRA: $100/month; increasing to $200/month in June

Remaining Loans:

* Perkins: $7,100 - 5% interest; min. payment $93
* Institutional: $2,300 - 0% interest; min. payment $56
* Federal Loans (Great Lakes): $21,416 - avg. 4.24% interest; min. payment $284. Note: I paid a bunch down while it was in deferment last year but switched my strategy to the high interest private loan (8%), which I just paid off.

I'm tempted to scale back my loan payments to $600/month and pay down the institutional loan to create more cashflow when the federal loans start up in September so I'm looking for advice there. In addition, I'm looking to buy a new truck the end of this year (my current truck has a nasty engine tick and a engine rebuild is not worth given the age), purchase a motorcycle if I can swing it and plan for a wedding coming in a couple years (targeting \~2023).

Someone told me there was an option to have a lower interest rate (by 0.7%) but there is a penalty for early payment in the first five years which goes by 5% the first year, 4% the second, etc. I know that the first few years the mortgage payments are basically paying all interest so I’m not sure if the 0.7% difference is actually better?

personalfinance,"Not sure how to phrase this, but is there a reason to protect the assets in an inherited traditional IRA if I don't expect my income to go down in the future?","I inherited a traditional IRA, but I already retired early myself. My income year to year is from passive income, which really only changes if I sell stuff in taxable accounts or if interest rates/dividends go up.

The size of this account is only worth about 1.3% of my total investment portfolio, so nothing significant.

Most of my investment portfolio is in taxable accounts as well as some money in a Roth IRA. Since I have so little of my portfolio in tax shelters, I've been trying to keep this inherited IRA safe since I can't contribute more money to it.

But...is there even a point to doing that? Since it's a traditional IRA (and can't be converted to a Roth), all the money in the account will need to be distributed over time (I'm already required to take a certain amount each year). These distributions are always taxed at my ordinary tax rate, regardless if most of its value earned came from things like qualified dividends and long term capital gains.

It seems like the only benefit this account really gives me is the ability to make more frequent short-term trades without being responsible for the tax *that year*. For everything else, it seems like I'd fare better in a taxable account where I can pay the lower qualified dividend and lower long term capital gains tax rates.

Is there something I'm not getting here?

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, May 12, 2021","PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, May 12, 2021

The selloff in stocks intensified after a report that showed the consumer price index (CPI) rose at a faster-than-expected pace, spooking market participants about the prospects of inflationary pressures, increasing pressure on equities. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed 2.09% down, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) fell 2.54%, while the Dow Industrial Average (DIA) fell 2%, the worst slump since February.

The Bureau of Labor statistics reported that the consumer price index, which measures a basket of goods as well as energy and housing costs, rose 4.2% from a year ago, compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 3.6% increase. The monthly gain was 0.8%, against the expected 0.2%. Excluding the volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI (this is the main measure of inflation) increased 3% compared to the same period in 2020 and 0.9% on a monthly basis. The respective estimates were 2.3% and 0.3%. This confirms fears market participants have had for months. Tomorrow, the producer price index will be released, which is expected to show a similar spike like the CPI. 

Market participants are worried that as the economy reopens and comes out of the pandemic, the surge in demand and consumer spending could drive a surge in prices, which, in turn, may prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner-than-expected, pressuring the valuations of technology and growth stocks. However, while the readings in inflation definitely are not good, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be “transitory” as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. In an April 28 meeting Powell said, “Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.”

While the inflationary readings are definitely not good, they weren’t unexpected and with the SPY trading near record levels for consecutive weeks and the stretched valuation of some technology, this week’s sell-off is not unexpected. In my opinion, the current fear around the equity market seems overblown, and though I expect volatility going forward, my long-term outlook remains bullish and will be looking to take advantage of this dip in the indexes and mega-caps. 

Moreover, the April Job Report, released last Friday, showed the US economy only added 266,000 new jobs last month, missing estimates of more than 1 million jobs gained and marking a sharp deceleration from March’s total of 916,000 new jobs added. As said earlier, members of the Federal Reserve, including Powell, have consistently reiterated they want to see a   
“String” of strong labor reports before considering any changes to the current policy. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, “We want to see a string of months like that \[like in March\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, there’s a very large group of people who are not.” The April Job Report bolsters Powell’s argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy. 

In addition, at a separate event in April, Powell said that quantitative easing would likely taper “well before” the interest rate is increased. He said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.” In short, while the inflationary readings are not great, I’m fairly confident fears that the Federal Reserve will tighten policy sooner than expected are overblown. 

**Highlights**

* Elon Musk tweeted that Tesla (TSLA) is tweaking its self-driving software to eliminate a phantom braking problem and may release a significantly improved version within the next two to three weeks.
* Roblox (RBLX) says it would be able to pay its game developers more money if Epic Games - Apple trial results in cut fees in the app-store.
* Vehicle sales in China rose 8.6% in April versus the same month a year earlier, their 13th consecutive month of gains, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. Sales reached 2.25 million vehicles in April
* Gartner Research says it expects the global semiconductor shortage to persist until 2022.

personalfinance,"Inherited some money in a different country, unsure what to do with it.","Edit: please stop DMing me about Bitcoin. I’m not interested.l lol. 

Hi - apologies if this is covered elsewhere and please point me in right direction if so. 

I inherited some money from my grandmother in a different country. Roughly $72k USD at current exchange rates. Right now it’s just sitting in my bank account there and earning $4 a month interest. 

I know I can’t invest it in a mutual fund there because of the PFIC or whatever it’s called. I can’t finance a house there while I live in the US. So my best option is to put it on a term deposit at like 1% interest rate before tax. 

Another option is to bring the $$ to the US where I could invest it more easily. I had wanted to use it (with my savings) to put a down payment on a house. But in my area (LA), I’m already priced out of the market. I might be able to find somewhere affordable, but the options are pretty dire. 

So someone mentioned I should put it in an index fund. I have a vanguard fund for retirement - what should I look at for a more liquid investment that won’t be locked away until I’m 65? 

Are there any other options I’m missing with this money? And of these options what’s my best bet for further research? 

For context: I eventually plan on returning to my home country but right now I’m staying in the US - maybe for as much as the next 15 years. If that’s helpful to know. I have 401k, I have an emergency fund, I have low debt. So this money is really something extra.

cybersecurity,Thoughts and opinions on entry level Cybersecurity jobs with the federal government,"Hello r/Cybersecurity
My question is for everyone here, regardless if you are employed with the federal government or not. All thoughts and opinions are helpful.

TL;DR
I have my Comptia Sec Plus. Have several years of Helpdesk experience. I’m looking into entry level Cybersecurity roles with the federal government. Looking for thoughts, opinions and expectations. 


I recently become certified in Comptia Security Plus (looking into other certifications). This certification didn’t come out of the blue. I have been entry level IT for several years now and I finally have the confidence to try and break out. I’m also certified in AWS (Solutions Architect Associate). 
With that being said, I was told that I may have some luck getting a remote entry level Cybersecurity job with the US federal government (I reside in the US). I have browsed the website, usajobs.gov and saw some listings for my city. Problem is, there’s not much detail about these jobs. I wanted to know if any of you have any insight of what an entry level Cybersecurity job would involve for the federal government. 
With my current employer, the entry level Cybersecurity team would handle tickets my team and other teams send to them. Issues are usually related to Zscaler, firewall inquiries, whitelisting and blacklisting known applications, collecting information on new request that would be security related and routing the tickets higher up the ladder. 
You have to start somewhere right? 
If you are inquiring why I do not look into this role with my current employer, the answer is I tried. They are only hiring contractors and I’m a full time employee. I would have to quit then apply through a employment service to get the job. The positions I see available on the government site are permanent with full time benefits. I would like to leave a full time position for another full time position. 

Any advice, thoughts and opinions would be greatly appreciated. Advice that would help me move up the ladder would be appreciated as well (such as certifications).",technology
stocks,Inflation explained like you're five,"I started that as a comment but it became quite lengthy and I decided that it should be a separate post instead.

Let's say, currently the inflation is 0%, a burger costs $1 and a single stock  share of any company costs $20. You can buy 20 burgers if you sell that share.

Tomorrow the inflation becomes 10%. Everything is more expensive by 10%. The burger now costs $1.1, the share costs $22. You can still buy 20 burgers for that share. But if you have sold that share yesterday at $20, today you can buy only 18 burgers. Your money lost buying power due to inflation. That's why some people say that during the inflation it's better to have money in the market, you protect your money from losing value by buying stocks. But it's often not that simple, we'll return to this at the end.

The government doesn't like 10% inflation, it's too high. They like 5% inflation. To achieve that they need to decrease the demand for buying burgers. When less people compete for the goods, the price of those goods decreases. How can government decrease the demand? They do it by increasing the interest rate in banks. Now instead of spending $1.1 on the burger you can put that money into the bank, and over time your money will grow in value, and in 30 years you'll be able to buy 1000 burgers. Not everyone is capable of delayed gratification, so only part of people will put money into the bank, the others will continue buying burgers. Anyway, the demand decreases and eventually the burger price decreases to $1.05, that's 5% inflation, exactly what the government wants.

Now let's talk about the banks. How do they earn money? They do it by offering loans. Let's say, a fancy tech company wants to build SkyNet. They need to hire developers and they need money to pay those developers. The company does not earn anything yet, so the plan is to get money from the bank, build the product, then start earning and then repay the debts. Bank gives the money to that company and asks to return the same amount and 10% extra later. Where did bank get that money? Well, most likely they are just holding your salary on your bank account. Your money is safe, no one can steal it, and at the same time bank can use that money to give loans and earn interest. Everyone is happy.

You remember that the government increased the interest rate to fight the inflation, right? Previously your money was just sitting at the deposit and doing nothing. But now you started to earn some interest on it. Let's say, it's 5% per year. This makes banks sad, because instead of just using your money and getting extra 10% from the SkyNet company, they now also need to pay you those 5%. Obviously they won't pay it out of their own pockets. They will instead ask the SkyNet company to return not 10%, but 15% at the end of the loan period.

The SkyNet company now has to pay more to the banks. It's difficult as they have no earnings yet. Where do they take the money to pay banks? They have to issue more shares and sell it to investors. More shares means more supply. More supply means that the price of the good drops, so the shares of that company become much cheaper.

So, if you're sure that inflation is inevitable, how can you prepare for this? We discussed that a bit at the beginning. One option is to keep money in your account. Your $20 will lose some value, you'll be able to buy only 18 burgers instead of 20. Another option is to buy a share of the SkyNet company. As we've just discussed, it will likely drop in value and will cost like $12, you'll buy only 11 burgers for it. But who knows, maybe in 5 years it'll pay of. And a yet another options is to buy a share of the burger company. Since burgers became more expansive the company also earns more and its share is more valuable. Most likely it costs $25 now, and you can buy more burgers with it.

You've already figured it out. The burger company is what we call a value stock. The SkyNet company is the growth stock. And since everyone expects inflation, we currently observe the rotation from the growth stocks into the value stocks.",finance

Why?  Inflation is eating at USD right now, and I think the ECB (plus EU fiscal policy) will be less aggressive than the Fed and the US government, thus keeping EUR inflation comparatively low.  Thus, inflation will eat at USD but not at EUR.  Any thoughts on my analysis here?

The next question is if it would make sense, as I've said, to hold more euros instead of dollars.

Obviously there's a lot of factors to consider besides inflation, especially the forex relationship that I don't quite understand.  Would inflation cause the US dollar to appreciate or depreciate with respect to the euro?

There's also other risks like the US dollar potentially being more reliable, etc.

Any thoughts or insight is appreciated.  This sort of micromanagement may be more trouble than it's worth since I'm not sitting on millions (lol), but I figured I'd ask and see what sort of knowledge I can glean.  Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,H&amp;R Block has repeatedly sent me someone else's return with ALL their personal information. Does someone else have my return?,"So I've been getting my business and personal taxes done the last few years by my father in law who works for H&amp;R Block as a preparer. This has gone fine the last several years. 

This year, however, H&amp;R's system has repeatedly sent me someone else's tax return for my review and signature. He has the same name as me and was born on the same date, but obviously has a different SSN, address in another state, different income, preparer, etc. I can see all of his personally identifiable information, his 6-year-old daughter's name, SSNs and address, his workplace, etc. I also have his bank account and routing numbers. I could easily steal this guy's identity if I was so inclined. Obviously I'm not, but it's a major concern. 

H&amp;R also sent me a messed up business tax return that is right in all respects except my address is incorrect.

I'm quite concerned that if I have this guy's name, address, SSN, bank account info, income, etc., that someone else might have all the same information about me. I have no way to verify this, but it is a major concern.

Apparently H&amp;R's tech support has been working on this issue for over a month, and they still sent me the same guy's return again. 

I don't really know what I'm hoping to glean by posting this, but I guess I'm looking for some other perspectives and some ideas on my recourse here. This whole thing is very concerning and I'm wondering what my options might be.

personalfinance,Tax paid to the wrong county,"So the place I worked at in 2020 (I no longer work there for obvious reasons).  The HR department barely existed for the poorly run small company and was a piece of shit. I told them in August 2019 that I moved counties. I did it officially and reminded them multiple times. They never changed it. I didn't realize till most of 2020 was done. I had to force the issue for them to change it.  So I paid about $570 to the wrong county and $290 to where I actually live. Now I owe the state about $660. And according to my tax software I owed the state in total about $960 so the amount I owe is about what wasn't taken out of my paycheck, and what went to the wrong county.

So is the money I paid to the wrong county just gone? Will my taxes be screwy because I said I lived in the one county the whole time but paid to 2 different ones.

Some back story on me, I am a 20 year old real estate investor who sold off his stock portfolio at 18 when he got into real estate. However, I fully intend on re-entering equities no later than by the time I am 25. In the mean time, I’ve been doing research on different companies (fidelity, schwab etc) and different investment strategies. So far, I am leaning towards choosing fidelity as my brokerage. HOWEVER, this reduced interest thing sounds like it could be hugely beneficial to me as real estate will always be a large percentage of my portfolio.
What I’m asking for is for anybody to share any expierences they’ve had with either this specific Schwab program or with the company in general.
Specifically, I would like to know:
1. Is there a limit to how many discounted morgages you can carry?
2. Is 20% down adequate for these loans or would you have to put down more to reap the full discounted benefits?
3. What is the approval like for this program? Is a 720 credit score adequate? Do you need above average DTI ratio or other metrics?
4. In general, is this program worth choosing Schwab for, assuming you take full advantage of it?

I’m planning to have above a million in assets invested in whichever brokerage I choose at some point in my life which would qualify me to take advantage of the .5% off morgage rates. I doubt I will reach the 5 million mark, but you never know!

cardano,Ergo's Efficiency and interplay with PoS.,"We were working on a blog post about energy efficiency but given the panic in the market. Here's some snippets from previous/related articles. 

Ergos PoW allows light clients with full node-security(NIPoPoWs), DeFi without risk to consensus, interoperability with Cardano, sharing on-chain oracle data used for free by dApps. And so, so much more.

# Ergo

&gt;Ergo’s mission is to optimize proof of work while advancing the new extended UTXO model. The goal is to push the boundaries of what is possible with Proof of Work.

&gt;Ergo believes decentralization of services via light nodes will be the key to success, and it is hard to find light nodes with the same security properties in a Proof of Stake design. What does that mean, mobile lite nodes with full Proof of Work security. Given time, wearables may carry the hardware capacity to host a lite client with the same security properties. That my friends would be a game changer for anyone interested in the best security practices.

&gt;As technology advances, it becomes more efficient. The watt/hash has been continuously improving and will most likely continue to do so. Large Proof of Work infrastructure is most profitable by finding the lowest electricity rate, as this lowers a miner’s cost of expenses. Large mining farms are most likely to form in jurisdictions that produce excess amounts of electricity, leading to favorable cost per watt.

&gt;The first principle of conservatism is to maximize the efficiency of what you produce. Our world as a whole is very energy inefficient. The amount of electricity, heat, and food produced often has a very high level of waste.

&gt;Proof of Work is only 12 years old. As computer technology improves, the watt/hash rate will continue to improve. The energy efficiency of electricity production and transmission is on a similar path of advancement. Proof of Stake is younger. Network challenges will come. The underlying technology will improve.

&gt;The greatest value of Proof of Work, in my opinion, is the security and privacy aspects. These are core to the initial foundation of the cypherpunk movement.

# Autolykos

The Autolykos algorithm is ASIC resistant and optimized for common household hardware. 

# NiPoPoWs

&gt;NIPoPoWs, or Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof-of-Work, are cryptographical structures that are applied to Proof-of-Work blockchains as a way to apply some compression to the blockchain’s consensus layer. They are short, stand-alone strings of information that a blockchain can inspect to verify that an event happened without actually having to connect to the blockchain and download all block headers. NIPoPoWs contain only a small sample of block headers—they are, however, enough for the network to verify that a transaction or any other event actually happened.

&gt;Schwartz compared NIPoPoWs with a table of content found at the beginning of a book—instead of having to go through the entire book to find a certain piece of information, a reader turns to the table of content to verify that it is, indeed, contained in the book.

# Current Market Sentiment

&gt;The mentality of crypto markets shifted greatly after the ICO mania of 2017. In fact, it seems that the space as a whole has come to celebrate bailouts, printing, and stimulus.

&gt;Yes, there have been some massive price gains in fiat, a lot of hype-based marketing, but it does seem the original intent of goals of cypherpunks is becoming increasingly diluted. 

&gt;This is something that needs to be addressed. If cryptocurrency is to be implemented as an effective tool for the average human, we need tooling and adoption. Right now, it seems the market mentality is as follows: how do we honeypot new users with hype marketing, drive pumps and cannibalize these new members of communities.
&gt;
&gt;The current state of the market is a little sad. We need to get back to the roots of the crypto-revolution, decentralized tools that are private, secure, and drive real-world adoption of these systems. The ideal is to create tools that help people create value. 
&gt;
&gt;Cryptocurrency should provide tools to enrich ordinary people. Their small businesses providing no much above making ends meet, not depersonalized big financial capital. This is what inspired me. This is my dream.
&gt;
&gt;The tools of a cryptocurrency in the eyes of the original broad community vision should allow people to do economic activity whatever the business size, geographic location, interest rates set by big players, and so on. 
&gt;
&gt;The tools should allow people to do contracts (digital, self-enforcing, reasonable smart contracts) regardless of the differences in jurisdictions, traditions, followed business practices, etc.
&gt;
&gt;I hope Ergo will be useful here. Thousands of small cooperatives and individual entrepreneurs are more important to healthy and sustainable wealth growth around the globe than a couple of corporations hiding profits in offshore heavens.

# Background

Kushti (Alex / founder) was a core developer at NXT (first PoS), IOHK scholar and helped build Cardano. Everything in this life has trade-offs. He left and started a PoW for reasons outlined in this post. 

# Cardano
Here is Charles Hoskinson answering the question ['Are there any situations in which PoW is superior?'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=207&amp;v=Y27Q3wL_Hko&amp;feature=youtu.be)

&gt;Those that are familiar with the Lindy effect, which is often linked to Bitcoin’s monetary evolution, will recognize this process. The Lindy effect states that a technology’s remaining life expectancy is proportional to its current age, meaning that the longer it exists, the more its trusted to continue to exist. This means it’ll take time for Cardano’s young system to be trusted — particularly in comparison to Bitcoin that already abides resiliently for over 10 years with 99.98% up-time and zero known immutability breaches. The rigorous academic basis of Cardano is arguably the best possible foundation to build on, but it still needs to prove it is resilient against attacks ‘in the wild’ and thus undergo the test of time to earn the trust of investors. To justify an increasing ADA price that is important in Cardano’s security proposition, it is essential that the system will actually be used. It is therefore no coincidence that this is exactly what IOHK, Emurgo and the Cardano Foundation are focusing on.

&gt;Although PoS is a very secure protocol, some smart contracts may require the consensus-theoretic security features of PoW for some part of their execution. The larger a dApp is if it is doing collateralised DeFi, the more significant the stake it has at its disposal, and since this is not yet fully resolved in the Proof of Stake consensus, it is a weak point. Ergo brings the proven security of PoW, with sufficient protection for all more complex DApps implementations on top of the standard UTxO model rather than translating very natural cryptographic concepts inherent in PoW to PoS, where the game theory implications of the protocol are entirely different.

[EMURGO to Partner with Ergo and Build Blockchain-Based Decentralized Financial Solutions](https://emurgo.io/blog/emurgo-to-partner-with-ergo-and-build-blockchain-based-decentralized-financial-solutions)
&gt;EMURGO’s strategic partnership with Ergo aligns with the objective to also meet the increasing needs for tailored decentralised financial (DeFi) solutions moving forward. As the interest in building decentralised financial services grows in tandem with the overall blockchain industry, this partnership allows for much-needed deeper research &amp; DeFi solutions development. These solutions will explore the usage of Ergo’s smart contracts that are embedded with privacy features and interoperable with Cardano’s extensive global network. This will, in turn, offer developers, investors, and interested parties the flexibility to utilise Ergo’s functionalities or to fully on-ramp onto larger blockchain ecosystems such as Cardano.

This is an updated version of a post I made 6 months ago by the same title, so if it sounds familiar, then it probably is. However, there are a lot of new faces here who could learn a lot from the info in this post.

If you want to see some sources for my claims, check out the version of this post I made in r/EthTrader or r/EthFinance.

#ETH 2.0

As most of you will already know, ETH 2.0 launched successfully back in December 2020 and has been running smoothly without a hiccup ever since. To date, it has locked up over 4 million ETH and growing. Since then, the devs have been working on the next phase of ETH 2.0 and have decided to fast-track the merge from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake. This will bring some major benefits including:

- A 99.9% increase in efficiency, making Ethereum by far the largest environmentally friendly blockchain.
- Greater network security than PoW due to efficiencies with PoW and slashing which can punish dishonest validators/attackers.
- A ~80-90% drop in ETH inflation from around 5%pa to well below 1%pa. This will reduce the current daily sell pressure of $50,000,000/day of new ETH being sold by miners to offset electricity costs to just $5,000,000-$10,000,000/day going to stakers who will sell less due to not having any significant operating expenses to pay off.
- An increase in ETH 2.0 staking rewards from the current 7.5% to as much as 20% due to miner/validator extractable value and network fees/tips. (Note: a 20% roi on staking will not be a permanent thing and will likely drop back down to single digit returns quite fast.)

This upgrade is currently running in testnet and is slated for as early as October this year or very conservative estimates as Q1 2022.

ETH 2.0 doesn’t end there though! There are still 2 more main upgrades to come after the merge. One of these is the introduction of shards. shards are essentially parallel blockchains which are each responsible for a different part of Ethereum’s workload, think of it like a multi-core processor vs a single core processor. At first, it is likely that these shards will only act as data availability layers and won’t actually process transactions yet. However, their data can be utilised by the L2 scaling solution, rollups, increasing Ethereum’s throughput in transactions per second up to 100,000 TPS. 

Following this upgrade comes the really big base layer scaling benefits. Each shard will be fully functional chains (or possibly partially functional shards each with specific purposes, this is yet to be determined). With 64 of them, we can expect the base layer of Ethereum to scale around 64x, not including the massive scaling which comes from layer 2 scaling solutions like rollups as previously mentioned. Finally, this will likely also introduce web assembly or “eWASM” which will allow contracts to be programmed in a wide range of programming languages, opening the floodgates for millions of web devs who want to be involved in Ethereum but don’t know Ethereum’s programming language, Solidity.

#EIP-1559 and ETH scarcity

As I covered in a previous post of mine, ETH doesn’t have a supply cap like Bitcoin. Instead, it has a monetary policy of “minimum viable issuance”, not only is this is a good thing for network security, but with the addition of EIP-1559, it leaves the door open to the possibility of ETH issuance going negative. In short, EIP-1559 changes the fee market to make transaction prices more efficient (helping to alleviate high gas fees!) by burning a variable base fee which changes based on network usage demand rather than using a highest bidder market where miners simply include who pays them the most. This will result in most of the ETH being paid in transaction fees being burned. As of late, the amount which would be burned if EIP-1559 was in Ethereum right now would make ETH a deflationary asset!

Best of all, EIP-1559 is almost certainly going live with the London hard fork on the 14th of July! ETH becoming ultra sound money is almost imminent!

#Layer 2 Scaling

In the mean time while we are waiting for the final phases of ETH 2.0, layer 2 scaling is here. Right now, projects such as Deversifi or Loopring utilise rollups to scale to thousands of tx/s on their decentralised exchange platforms or HoneySwap which uses xDai to offer a more scalable alternative to UniSwap. Speaking of which, big DeFi players like UniSwap and Synthetix are actively testing using optimistic rollups to scale while maintaining composability between DeFi platforms. The most bullish thing about L2 scaling is all of the variety of options. Here’s a non exhaustive list of Ethereum L2 scaling solutions:
- Aztec protocol (L2 scaling + privacy!)
- ZKSync
- Loopring
- Raiden
- Arbitrum Rollups
- xDai
- OMGNetwork
- Polygon (formerly)
- FuelLabs
- Starkware
- Optimism
- Celer Network
- + Many more

Best of all, since the previous edition of this post, value locked in layer 2s has exploded!

#DeFi and Composability

If you’re reading this, I am sure you are aware of the phenomena which is Decentralised Finance (DeFi or more accurately, open finance). Ethereum is the first platform to offer permissionless and immutable financial services which when interacting with each other, lead to unprecedented composability and innovation in financial applications. A whole new world of possibilities are opening up thanks to this composability as it allows anyone to take existing pieces of open source code from other DeFi projects, put them together like lego pieces (hence the term money legos) and create something the world has never seen before. None of this was possible before Ethereum because typically financial services are heavily regulated and FinTech is usually proprietary software, so you don’t have any open source lego bricks to build off and you have to build everything you need from scratch. That is if what you want to do is even legal for a centralised institution!

Unsurprisingly, since the last time I shared this post, the total value locked in DeFi has exploded from just over $10 billion to almost $100 billion!

#NFTs and tokeniation

NFTs or “Non-Fungible Tokens” - a previously niche form of crypto asset last time I shared this post has now exploded into the mainstream. While many folks are still very hesitant to adopt them or just don’t see the point, this reaction from the masses seems very similar to people seeming very confused as to why anyone would want to stream music if radio already exists when Bill Gates talked about the future of the internet back in the 1990s. Over time, these things simply work their way into the mainstream consciousness and work they way into the back end of products and services we already use.

So far, it has mostly just been art NFTs which have broken into the mainstream. This is only just scratching the surface of what NFTs and tokenisation have to offer. There are also human readable names for your ETH address (see ENS names and unstoppable domains), breedable virtual collectible creatures like crypto kitties, ownable in game assets like Gods Unchained cards or best of all in my opinion, tokenised ownership of real world assets which can even be split into pieces (this doesn’t necessarily require an NFT. Fungible tokens can be/are used for some of the following use cases). This could be tokenised ownership of real estate (see RealT), tokenised ownership of stocks, bonds and other financial assets (which by the way makes them tradable 24/7 and divisible unlike through the traditional system) or even tokenised ownership of the future income of a celebrity or athlete (see when NBA Star Spencer Dinwiddie Tokenized His Own NBA Contract).

#Institutional Adoption

Ethereum is by far the most widely adopted blockchain by enterprises. Ethereum’s Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) is the largest blockchain-enterprise partnership program and Ethereum is by far the most frequently leveraged blockchain for proof of concepts and innovation in the blockchain space by enterprises. Meanwhile, there are protocols like the Baseline protocol which is a shared framework which allows enterprises to use Ethereum as a common frame of reference and a base settlement layer without having to give up privacy when settling on the public Ethereum mainnet. This framework makes adopting Ethereum much easier for other enterprises.

#Institutional Investment

One of Bitcoin’s biggest things it has going for it right now is the growing institutional investment. In case you were wondering, Ethereum has this too! Grayscale offers investment in the cryptocurrency space for financial institutions and their Ethereum fund has already locked up millions of ETH and an ETH ETF already exists in Canada. Not only this, but as businesses transact on Ethereum and better understand it, not only will they buy up ETH to pay for their transactions, but they will also realise that much like Bitcoin, Ethereum is a scarce asset. Better yet, a scarce asset which offers yield when staking. As a result, I expect to see companies having ETH holdings become the norm just like how Bitcoin is becoming more widespread on companies’ balance sheets.

#The state of global markets

With asset prices in almost every asset class at or near all-time highs and interest rates lower than ever and even negative in some cases, there really aren’t many good opportunities in the traditional financial system right now. Enter crypto - clearly the next evolution of financial services (as I explained in the section on DeFi earlier in this post), with scarce assets built in at the protocol layer, buying BTC or ETH is a lot like buying shares in TCP/IP in 1990 (that is if the underlying protocols of the internet could be invested in which they couldn’t). ~~Best of all, major cryptos are down from their all-time highs anywhere between 35% for BTC or 70% for ETH and much more for many altcoins. This means that they can significantly appreciate in value before entering uncharted, speculative bubble territory.~~ 6 months on from when I first wrote that and unsurprisingly crypto is at all-time highs. However, so are most asset classes. And best of all, now with ETH staking live, Ethereum now effectively pays a dividend of 7.5% if you stake. This is enormous compared to dividends in traditional finance which these days are often as low as 1-2%.

While of course we could fall dramatically at any moment in the current macro financial conditions and recent rise of crypto, as a longer term play, crypto is very alluring. The existing financial system has shown that it is in dire need of replacing and the potential replacement has started rearing its beautiful head in the form of crypto and DeFi.

#Improvements in user onboarding and abstracting away complexity

Ethereum has started making huge leaps forward in terms of usability for the end user. We now have ENS names and unstoppable domains which allow you to send ETH to yournamehere.ETH or TrickyTroll.crypto (I don’t actually have that domain, that’s just an example). No longer do you have to check every character of your ugly hexadecimal 0x43AB96D… ETH address to ensure you’re sending your ETH to the right person. We also have smart contract wallets like Argent wallet or the Gnosis safe. These allow for users to access their wallets and interact with DeFi self-custodially from an app on their phone without having to record a private key or recovery phrase. Instead, they offer social recovery and their UI is straight forward enough for anyone who uses a smart phone to understand. Finally, for the more experienced users, DApps like Uniswap have pretty, super easy to use graphical user interfaces and can be used by anyone who knows how to run and use a browser extension like Metamask.

#The lack of an obvious #1 ETH killer

One of Ethereum’s biggest threats is for it to be overthrown by a so-called “Ethereum killer” blockchain which claims to do everything Ethereum can do and sometimes more. While there are competitors which are each formidable to a certain extent such as Polkadot, Cardano and EOS, each have their own weaknesses. For example, Polkadot and Cardano are not fully operational yet and EOS is much more centralised than Ethereum. As a result, none of these competitors have any significant network effects just yet relative to the behemoth which is Ethereum.

Also, undoubtedly you will have heard of Binance Smart Chain by now. The favourite chain of any new investor with pocket money to gamble on shitcoins but not enough to warrant paying $10-$100 for a totally permissionless Uniswap transaction. However, Binance Smart Chain isn’t really an ETH killer. Not only is it basically a copy paste of Ethereum with block sizes adjusted to be incredibly large (and according to the developer who built Geth, the node software which BSC uses, dangerously large to the point he thinks it could break) but BSC is also centralised with just 21 nodes run by operators with close ties to Binance. I’m not bashing on BSC here, credit is due for them finding a niche and dominating it, but it is important to note that BSC is *a lot more centralised than Ethereum.* Hence it is cheaper. Also, I would argue its existence is good for ETH as it has siphoned off users who may have moved to an actually decentralised or semi-decentralised ETH killer. Instead, BSC has taken these users, hampering actual ETH killer adoption while BSC is too centralised to see any institutional adoption which is one of the things which separates ETH from its competition.

This doesn’t mean that these projects aren’t a threat. In fact, I am sure that projects like Polkadot (which is more focused on complimenting Ethereum than killing it) will take a slice out of Ethereum’s pie. However, I am still very confident that Ethereum will remain on top due to the lack of a clear number 2 smart contract platform. Since none of these ETH killers stands out as the second place smart contract platform, it makes it much harder for one project to create a network effect which even begins to threaten Ethereum’s dominance. This leads me onto my next reason - network effects.

#Network effects

This is another topic which I made a previous post on. The network effect is why Bitcoin is still the number one cryptocurrency and by such a long way. Bitcoin is not the most technologically advanced cryptocurrency. However, it has the most widespread name recognition and the most adoption in most metrics (ETH beats it in some metrics these days). The network effect is also why most people use Zoom and Facebook messenger/WhatsApp despite the existence of free, private, end to end encrypted alternatives which have all the same features (you really should use Jitsi for the zoom alternative and Signal for the private messenger app. I highly recommend both. Let’s get their network effects going!). It is the same for Bitcoin. People don’t want to have to learn about or set up a wallet for alternative options. People like what is familiar and what other people use. Nobody wants to be “that guy” who makes you download yet another app and account you have to remember the password/private key for. In the same way, Enterprises don’t want to have to create a bridge between their existing systems and a dozen different blockchains. Developers don’t want to have to create DeFi money legos from scratch on a new chain if they can just plug in to existing services like Uniswap. Likewise, users don’t want to have to download another browser extension to use DApps on another chain if they already use Ethereum. I know personally I have refrained from investing in altcoins because I would have to install another app on my hardware wallet or remember another recovery phrase.

Overthrowing Ethereum’s network effect is one hell of a big task these days. Time is running out for the ETH killers.

#Ethereum is the most decentralised and provably neutral smart contract platform

Ethereum is also arguably the most decentralised and provably neutral smart contract platform. Unlike some smart contract platforms, you can’t round up everyone at the Ethereum Foundation or any select group of people and expect to be able to stop the network. Not only this, but the Ethereum foundation doesn’t have the ability to print more ETH or push through changes as they wish like some people would lead you on to believe. The community would reject detrimental EIPs and hard fork. Ever since the DAO hack, the Ethereum community has made it clear that it will not accept EIPs which attempt to roll back the chain even to recover hacked funds (see EIP-999).

Even if governments around the world wanted to censor the Ethereum blockchain, under ETH 2.0’s proof of stake, it would be incredibly costly and would require a double digit percentage of the total ETH supply, much of which would be slashed (meaning they would lose it) as punishment for running dishonest validator nodes. This means that unlike with proof of work where a 51% attacker can keep attacking the network, under proof of stake, an attacker can only perform the attack a few times before they lose all of their ETH. This makes attacks much less financially viable than it is on proof of work chains. Network security is much more than what I laid out above and I am far from an expert but the improved resistance to 51% attacks which PoS provides is significant.

Finally, with the US dollar looking like it will lose its reserve currency status and the existing wire transfer system being outdated, superpowers like China won’t want to use US systems and the US won’t want to use a Chinese system. Enter Ethereum, the provably neutral settlement layer where the USA and China don’t have to trust each other or each other’s banks because they can trust Ethereum. While it may sound like a long shot, it does make sense if Ethereum hits a multi-trillion dollar market cap that it is the most secure and neutral way to transfer value between these adversaries. Not to mention if much of the world’s commerce were to be settled in the same place - on Ethereum - then it would make sense for governments to settle on the same platform.

#ETH distribution is decentralised

Thanks to over 5 years of proof of work - a system where miners have to sell newly minted ETH to pay for electricity costs - newly mined ETH has found its way into the hands of everyday people who buy ETH off miners selling on exchnages. As pointed out by u/AdamSC1 in his analysis of the top 10K ETH addresses (I highly recommend reading this if you haven’t already. It is the top result when you Google ""adamsc1 top 10k eth addresses""), the distribution of ETH is actually slightly more decentralised than Bitcoin with the top 10,000 ETH wallets holding 56.70% of ETH supply compared to the top 10,000 Bitcoin wallets which hold 57.44% of the Bitcoin supply. This decentralised distribution means that the introduction of staking won’t centralise ETH in the hands of a few wallets who could then control the network. This is an advantage for ETH which many proof of stake ETH killers will never have as they never used PoW to distribute funds widely throughout the community and these ETH killers often did funding rounds giving large numbers of tokens to VC investors.

#The community

Finally, while I may be biased, I think that Ethereum has the friendliest community. Anecdotally, I find that the Ethereum developer community is full of forward thinking people who want to make the world a better place and build a better future, many of whom are altruistic and don’t always act in their best interests, Vitalik being one of the best examples as he holds less than 0.3% of the total ETH supply, a remarkable small percentage for any founder of a multi-billion dollar company or cryptocurrency (for reference, Jeff Bezos owns about 10% of Amazon and Satoshi owns about 5% of all Bitcoins). Not to mention his many charitable donations, including $1 billion dollars worth of SHIB sent to the Indian COVID relief fund (sure, there isn’t $1 billion worth of liquidity in those SHIB tokens but it’s still a hell of a lot of money). Compare this to the much more conservative, “at least we’re safe while the world burns” attitude which many Bitcoiners have. I don’t want to generalise too much here as the Bitcoin community is great too and there are some wonderful people there. But the difference is clear if you compare the daily discussion of r/Bitcoin to the incredibly helpful and welcoming daily discussion of r/EthFinance who will happily answer your noob questions without calling you an idiot and telling you to do you own research (there are plenty of examples in any of the daily threads). Or the very helpful folks over at r/EthStaker who will go out of their way to help you set up an ETH 2.0 staking node on the mainnet or testnets (Shoutout to u/superphiz who does a lot of work over in that sub!). Don’t believe me? Head over to those subs and see for yourself.

**Please don’t hate on me if you disagree about which project has the best community, it is just my very biased personal opinion and I respect your opinion if you disagree! :)**

#TL;DR: 
- **ETH 2.0** - Huge scaling and better tokenomics. ETH is about to be deflationary, ultra sound money.
- **EIP-1559 and ETH scarcity** - ETH issuance will be super low and will very likely go negative before the end of this year.
- **Layer 2 Scaling** - Literally dozens of different solutions/projects. Many of which are live on mainnet now. ctivity on these networks is also growing very fast!
- **DeFi and Composability** - Money legos and open source code allowing for fast development and unprecedented innovation in the world of finance.
- **NFTs and tokenisation** - Tokenise everything. No, seriously. So much more than just art NFTs.
- **Institutional Adoption** - Ethereum has the most enterprise partners (EEA) + the Baseline protocol is bullish AF.
- **Institutional Investment** - Grayscale investments now owns 2% of ETH supply and Canada ha an ETH ETF. Just wait until companies figure out ETH is a deflationary, dividend paying/stakable, environmentally friendly, more advanced version of Bitcoin.
- **The state of global markets** - Crypto may be at all-time highs now but so is almost every asset class and the system Ethereum wants to replace is looking very broken.
- **Improving UX and abstracting away complexity** - Human readable addresses and smart contract wallets which even your mother could use.
- **The lack of an obvious #1 ETH killer** - No ETH killer clearly sticks out from the rest. This makes it hard for one of them to create a big network effect.
- **Network effects** - Ethereum has by far the largest network effect and as Bitcoin has shown us, the network effect is extremely important.
- **Ethereum is the most decentralised and provably neutral smart contract platform** - Super secure under ETH 2.0, no more tolerance of DAO like forks and a neutral platform for adversaries like the US and China to transact on so that they don’t have to trust each other’s banks.
- **ETH distribution is decentralised** - Years of proof of work have put ETH in the hands of many. ETH supply is more decentralised than Bitcoin.
- **The community** - Super duper mega friendly. Shoutout to r/ETHTrader, r/ETHStaker and r/ETHFinance!",cryptocurrency

So what’s going on?  Why did we get so high only to retreat $0.30?  Simple answer: inflation. While DOGE is more like a currency than stock, because it’s not widely accepted as currency and acts as a medium between currencies it will be impacted by inflation. With the Fed recently announcing that yes, inflation is happening, it negatively impacted the value of DOGE.

If the inflation was localized to the US, it cryptos shouldn’t have been impacted. This is because if the value of 1 USD (or EUR or any other currency) goes down theoretically the value of DOGE should go up when measures against that currency. Take a look at FOREX markets though, and you’ll see that there is some weird stuff going on there too. Global currency values are going down, which dramatically impacts crypto.  This is why all cryptos are down, including DOGE.

## Colonial hackers stole data ahead of pipeline shutdown

The hackers who caused Colonial Pipeline to shut down the biggest U.S. gasoline pipeline on Friday began their blitz against the company a day earlier, stealing a large amount of data before locking computers with ransomware and demanding payment, according to *Bloomberg*. A cybercrime gang called DarkSide, took nearly 100 gigabytes of data out of the Alpharetta, Georgia-based company’s network in just two hours on Thursday, as part of a double extortion scheme. Colonial made the decision late Friday to shut down the pipeline that is the main source of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel for the East Coast, without saying when it would reopen.

## China’s PLA Unit 61419 purchasing foreign antivirus products

Recorded Future’s Insikt Group has discovered six procurement documents from the websites of the official People’s Liberation Army (PLA) military unit 61419 that show its intent to purchase English language versions of antivirus software from companies like Kaspersky, Norton, Symantec and others. Insikt points out that Chinese-language versions of the software would be the more logical choice if it was intended for legitimate use. Insikt suggests that given unit 61419’s extensive history in software supply chain exploitation, the antivirus brands listed in its report should be closely monitored. The report can be found at Recorded Future, dated May 5.

## Insurance provider ends ransomware reimbursement

The insurance company AXA said, at the request of the French government, it will end cyber insurance policies in France that reimburse victims for ransomware payments, although policies will still cover the cost of recovery.  Speaking at a recent Paris roundtable, French cybercrime prosecutor Johanna Brousse said in 2020, only the US experienced more ransomware attacks than France. A September report by another cyber insurance provider, Coalition, found that 41% of claims were ransomware related in the first half of 2020, with a 260% increase in ransomware attacks on the year.

## Japanese manufacturer Yamabiko targeted by Babuk ransomware

The ransomware group that claimed to be retiring after its attack on Washington DC’s police department last month has reportedly targeted Yamabiko, a Tokyo-headquartered manufacturer of power tools and agricultural and industrial machinery. Although official confirmation is still pending from the victim company, it appears the Russian-speaking threat actors have already released some of the data on their data leak site. This includes personally identifiable information (PII) on employees, product schematics, financial data and more, according to TechNadu.

## Research firm finds disappointing stats in internal risk mitigation

Elevate Security, a leader in human attack surface management, released new findings yesterday on the state of human cybersecurity risk in the workforce, revealing that traditional employee risk mitigation efforts such as security awareness training and phishing simulations have a limited impact on improving employees’ real-world cybersecurity practices. The three year study involving 114,000 users found that security training has no significant effect at the organizational level or in real-world attacks, and in fact users with five or more training sessions are actually more likely to click on a phishing link than those with little or no training. The full report is available at ElevateSecurity.com.

## Missed patches a major cause of government security incidents

A new report from  BAE Systems Applied Intelligence found that 63% of managers in UK central governmental organizations experienced a security incident in the past six-months, with 52% of those coming from missed patches. Interestingly, security considerations were virtually tied with integration issues as the most common barrier to upgrades with 68% and 69%, respectively. Overall 60% of departments had digital transformation plans in place, with 75% of those motivated by a desire to mitigate the risk of security vulnerabilities.

Some of the largest Internet providers in the US funded a campaign that generated “8.5 million fake comments” to the Federal Communications Commission as part of the ISPs’ fight against net neutrality rules during the Trump administration, according to a report issued last week by New York State Attorney General Letitia James. The industry campaign was run through Broadband for America (BFA), an umbrella group that includes Comcast, Charter, AT&amp;T, Cox, and CenturyLink and allegedly used third party vendors to fabricate comments and attach them to real names and email addresses.

## Britain’s NHS app ready to become vaccine passport next week

As of next Monday, people who have received both doses of the COVID vaccine will be able to use the app for foreign travel, which is expected to be opened up as of May 17. This National Health Service (NHS) app is separate from the NHS Covid-19 app, which is used for contact tracing, and which ran into privacy conflicts with Google and Apple, as we reported last month. The UK Government advised people to register to use the app at least two weeks before travelling, and reminds travelers that few countries currently accept proof of vaccination, so people will still need to follow other rules when travelling abroad – like getting a negative pre-departure test.

personalfinance,"Received gift to buy home, unsure how best to use it","Hi! I’ve just received a gift from my parents for the purpose of buying a house, it’s far more money than I’ve ever had at one time and I’d like to make sure I do the smartest thing with it. 

Here’s my overall situation: I’m 32, salary of 65k, about 20k in a retirement plan (had a late start), unlikely to have kids but who knows. If I keep doing what I’m doing I could probably be making 100k in 10 years. My only debt is student loans, it’s quite large but I’m banking on public service loan forgiveness in ~6 years and am on an income-based repayment plan. My parents have given me 300k to buy a house - it doesn’t all have to go into the house, but I can’t just do whatever I want with it. I know there are varying opinions on whether now is a wise time to buy, but I’m doing it, and I’ve just placed an offer on a 300k house. With the current state of the housing market in the place where I live, that’s about what I can expect to pay without making serious compromises on location, quality, and size (and it’s already a big location compromise).

The first thing I’m wondering about is how much of a down payment to make. I know that with interest rates where they are now, it might make sense to borrow more, but my income doesn’t support a large mortgage payment. I also know I need to beef up my retirement savings, so my plan right now is to make a large down payment that leaves me with mortgage payments low enough to make a sizable increase in my retirement plan contributions. Then I’d use a chunk of the remainder to cover house updates and save/invest the rest. 

On the other hand, although my income doesn’t support a large mortgage, I do now suddenly have ~5x my yearly income in cash. Would it make more sense to just put 20% down, invest the remainder of this gift somewhere with a higher rate of return than my mortgage interest, and use that to make my payments? I’m also dealing with high property taxes, which would be a sizable portion of my mortgage payments, so I’m not sure how that changes the calculation.

Basically, I want to use this opportunity to get my retirement savings on track and set up my home purchase in an optimal way.

I expect compound annual sales growth of over +20-25% for several years with huge near term upside driven by opportunities in high-tech syringes and cannabis (particularly Canada). The company has recently launched a Developers Kit to help customers find more use cases, for which INVE can prototype quickly. Over the past year, manufacturing capacity has increased +70% from 130 million units to 220 million units, and [management has commented recently](https://www.webcaster4.com/Webcast/Page/2610/40963) “That's not even a lot of buffer for what we're seeing as our baseline demand”.

As of 5/12, the stock is trading at $14, a valuation of 3x Enterprise Value / 2022E Forward Sales of $120M. With high visibility for 20-25% sales growth, I believe the stock today is worth $26 based on 5x Forward Sales. If Identiv delivers on their pipeline of smart syringes, cannabis labeling and other innovative products, sales will exceed $250 million by 2024 and the stock will trade \*significantly higher\* than where it is today. As the world gets more digital, I expect INVE will sell billions of NFC tags configured for [countless applications](https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/pdf/the-need-for-enabling-touchless-technologies-whitepaper.pdf).

**Recent updates on Needles --** INVE’s customer is awaiting FDA approval for smart syringes for which they are targeting 100 million units from INVE with an average selling price of $1-1.50 = $100-150 million opportunity. [Per May 6, 2021 earnings call](https://www.webcaster4.com/Webcast/Page/2610/40963), “Now these are super precise auto injectors for cancer, autoimmune and other treatments that have to be dispensed in exact amounts, at the right temperature, at the right dispense rate and exactly the right needle insertion. In this design, we're incorporating multi-sensor features, including temperature and fluid dispensing measurements, as well as authenticity and data protection.""

**Recent updates on Cannabis --** INVE is also well positioned to capture market share for mandated [RFID tagging of cannabis](https://cannabisindustryjournal.com/tag/rfid/) in Canada and [potentially in the USA](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/02/06/1981126/0/en/Identiv-to-Showcase-NFC-Solutions-at-WestPack-and-First-ever-Cannabis-Packaging-Summit.html) in the future, which is a 1 billion unit opportunity in Canada alone. [Per 10K](https://sec.report/Document/0001564590-21-012914/) – “Governments can track the quality and authenticity of cannabis products for compliance and especially for tax collection”.

[Per May 6, 2021 earnings call](https://www.webcaster4.com/Webcast/Page/2610/40963), ""So, I think, the cannabis one you're referring to which is in the public domain, there's a big opportunity out there. And we mentioned that we've provided sample rolls to them sample products. It's very far along, but it's a government program. You would think they'd want to drive it as fast as possible, because it's going to increase their tax collection capability and certainty. But government programs go with the pace they go. So, it should be hitting in the relatively near-term. But again, with us, if we say it's going to fall in the third quarter or fourth quarter per se, and then it pushes out, that can change expectations. So it's on track, and we're comfortable with the position. We're in there. And it's moving along and they're taking samples and assessing it, but exactly when it becomes mandated is not certain, give or take three to six months.”

[Per May 6, 2021 earnings call](https://www.webcaster4.com/Webcast/Page/2610/40963) ""Back on this cannabis, 1-billion-unit opportunity. It almost sounds like you sort of won the technology bake out there. Is that a fair characterization? Or is that still going on?""... ""In terms of compliance and ability -- so the short answer is, yes. But to be clear, being a government program, it won't be sole source. Are we pretty -- well, I wanted to not overstate anything, because nothing's been awarded? But, we're certainly at the forefront of those who, more than comply, you completely satisfy everything they're looking for.""

stocks,Looking for reasons why I *should not* go hog wild buying tech right now,"This is my reasoning below. Would like to hear some counterarguments before I begin to go on a shopping spree; I’m sure many users here know way more about this than me and can provide some great food for thought. Thanks in advance. 

Basically, a lot of growth stocks have been pummeled mainly due to A) sector rotation into reopening plays and B) fears of inflation. The first has no tangible impact on a company’s fundamentals. The inflation hysteria does makes sense, as a lot of growth stocks tend to reinvest excess cash flow and that makes them more vulnerable to interest rate movements. 

But with many of these growth stocks currently being decimated by levels of 50% or more, you have to wonder how much of that is priced in, and should inflation normalize over the coming months, these stocks should see a pretty massive jump in positive sentiment. I’m pretty confident that inflation fears are a nothingburger, making this an excellent entry point for someone like me who has withheld a lot of gunpowder on the sidelines waiting for an opportunity to invest during a tech correction. If inflation does turn out to be a more long-term issue then, again, the stocks are already down 40-50 percent. Don’t see how much more they can reasonably fall. The reward seems to outweight the risk.",finance

personalfinance,What to do for first car?,"Hello guys, longtime lurker here looking for some of your opinions on what I should for my first car. So a little background about me.

I’m a 22 year old new grad and I have about ~30k worth of student loans. I majored in a field that the average starting salary is about 50k-60k. I never had a car in college as I simply didn’t need one since I would just Uber whenever I needed groceries. My main goal rn is to pay off my student loans as fast as possible (all federal loans) but I also need to get a car to be able to commute. 

I know that buying a brand new car is a bad idea since they depreciate so quickly. I’ve been considering getting a used car that’s about 2-3 yrs old as I feel like that’s the best value since it’ll still be relatively new by the time I’m done paying it off, something like a civic or Corolla. Is this the best approach or would getting an older be a better idea? Thanks for your input

personalfinance,Thinking of selling my house after 6 months. Any way to avoid capital gains?,"Background: Purchased first home under just my name in November 2018. Married in December 2018. Refinanced house in March 2020 (6.3% to 3% interest rate). Sold house 5 months later for a 60k profit. Used that money for down payment of our new house that we bought together in November 2020.

It’s only been 6 months since we bought our house but with the market being all crazy, if we sell now we could be profiting about 125k-140k. We are still young (28 and 25), so we would be looking to move to another state and rent for a year. I now work remote and my wife could easily find another job so no problems there. This is something we’ve always wanted to do and this might be the only chance since we plan to have kids in a few years.

My concerns are with having to pay capital gains on this house since we’ve been living here for only 6 months. I keep reading websites saying that after one year the percentage amount goes down but after 2 years I could pay nothing. Other websites say that if we already avoided paying capital gains from our first house sale then we can’t do it again. It’s all very confusing.

The only way the price will keep going up is if the community gets larger. How do we do that? By allowing others to buy dogecoin. I bet you there are hundreds of people waiting for a big dip to happen, so they can get in. But we’re not letting them because we keep spending our hard earn money to hold the line while the whales get fed whenever they feel like because they know we will keep repeating the process.
If there was a big dip, lots of whales will sell, that’s the opportunity we need so more common people buy it at lower price and eventually profit from it, And dogecoin can grow organically.",cryptocurrency

The Chinese population growth slowing is seen as a bad sign indicated by the decline in Alibaba stock price the day this was announced. However, an important thing to note is that the Chinese are not only getting richer but the Chinese middle class seems to continue to grow which is the more important number ([Yahoo!Finance](https://news.yahoo.com/jack-ma-makes-rare-visit-123439015.html), [St. Louis Fed](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2018/january/income-living-standards-china#:~:text=However%2C%20since%20the%20measure%20is%20based%20on%20the,median%20income%20but%20far%20below%20the%20world%20average))*^(Important because this directly impacts the market that the company is in)*

**Risks**

Slower growth metrics and loss of market share from companies such as Pinduoduo and JD.com

Dark clouds of the antitrust regulations and potential future regulatory concerns

Tensions between US and China relationships may serve as risky for Chinese companies/holdings in the United States.

**Note on investing in China**

A common point that I see on Alibaba or any Chinese ADR is that China can nullify any value of what you own at any moment simply because they don't like a company. While there are some elements of truth to this, intuitively speaking, this wouldn't make sense for China to do since they're trying to welcome MORE foreign investment.

In addition, there are many mutual funds, ETFs, and individuals that have exposure to China than before as referenced by the Alipay and Yahoo scandal ([Source](https://news.yahoo.com/news/yahoo-alibaba-softbank-reach-agreement-alipay-160402485.html)) which would be counterproductive to the point above.

To cut the knees of their technology companies even further as they're positioning themselves to be competitive to the United States wouldn't make sense. A recent notable event was the introduction of the digital Yuan for Alipay which indicates Alibaba is aligned with CCP values and will continue to show their willingness to work with them ([Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/10/china-digital-yuan-alibabas-ant-joins-e-cny-currency-trial.html))

**Conclusion**

Alibaba seems to have put the antitrust issues behind them with the Alibaba's growth is slowing as indicated by analyst reported estimates and current earnings. Although this may seem alarming, Alibaba is continuously reinvesting into growth opportunities which can hurt their short term bottom line. The growing Chinese middle class and disposable income per capita points to more good signs than bad for Alibaba. The middle class and income numbers are far more important than overall population numbers. Regulatory concerns aren't over for Alibaba in its entirety but the business is very solid and they've shown a willingness to comply with any new introduction to Chinese regulatory policy.

**TLDR:** In a land of unattractive valuations in the current stock market environment, Alibaba with a forward P/E of \~20 seems extremely attractive for a long term investment despite short term volatility.",finance
personalfinance,Question on home loan,"I'm looking to upgrade my housing situation. The market is insane right now, which is unfortunate for me. My question is about which options might be available to me to get to my desired end state loan. So ... here's the deal:

I'm looking to purchase a new home for $750k-$800k. I currently have ~$150k in cash savings for a down payment, and own outright (no mortgage) a home that will probably sell in this current market for something like $450k. I'd like to end up, in a few months, with just a 15-year fixed-rate conventional loan on ~$200k-$250k. The problem is that I want to wait to sell my current home until after I've closed on my new home. So ... what can I do?

One option would be to just finance the whole $600k-$650k initially, and then refinance in a month or two when my house sells, right? But that's going to cost me double the closing costs on my two loans, right?

Another option is to get a ""bridge loan"" (I think?). I don't know much about them except that there are generally higher fees and interest rates with them, and lenders seem to be more reluctant to do them.

Is there a way I can get a second mortgage for the latter ~$450k that I intend to pay off once I sell my house? Is that going to entail essentially doubling lender fees?

What other options do I have? Could I take out a loan from my 401k? Something else I'm not thinking of?",finance

stocks,Renewable Energy Stocks to buy on this Discount?,"So with almost all of the Renewable Energy Stocks a good way down from their all time highs and the charts looking like most hit a bottom formation, what stocks are most likely to bounce back  strong?

I personally think, that if from China to the US everybody is on board with changing the energy production to renewables and the strong development of the sector despite the pandemic in 2020, it should be very likely, that we see at least a strong decade for renewable energy stocks.

While researching what stocks are best positioned to profit from Governments trying to make a switch in energy production and at the same time are relatively stable during inflation and rising interest rates, I came to the conclusion, that I wanted to invest in companies that are already profitable an so well financed, that they are able to pay out dividends.

While the US market is relatively small for such companies, countries that are more advanced in their energy production do have some stocks that fit. Europe, Canada and China are clearly ahead in renewables and I would love to get some inspiration on where to look for more companies like this.Also I would be very interested in feedback on the stocks I have come up with doing my own DD.

CryptoCurrency,Crypto is an enabler.,"Astonishingly more than a third of the world population does not have access to basic banking services that can help them out in case of a personal financial crisis loans, checking accounts and the list can go on. These people that in most cases are already financially disadvantaged typically resort to doubtful and dangerous lending practices. The interest rates of these practices is anything but fair, which consequently leads to more instability among the people who requested the loan. This is where cryptocurrencies come in with their high volatility and ease-of-use.

There are now many apps and programs that facilitate the use of cryptocurrencies and bring them closer to the wider audience. An added benefit of cryptocurrency use is that it’s completely decentralized, so trading can be done freely across borders. Crypto technology will facilitate a financial revolution ( Goodbye Banks!!!!) that will leave everyone more financially connected, empowered and enabled.

Increased transactional transparency , low transactional costs as the traditional brick and mortar is no longer required.

The world is changing and it’s changing quickly. The speed at which cryptocurrencies are taking over is a clear indicator that traditional financial institutions can no longer hold the fort and that other financial needs are arising and need to be addressed.

Millions of people now have the opportunity to invest, send money across borders, save money and start a business thanks to the amazing possibilities that cryptocurrencies bring to the table and once the world wakes up they will realise the true scale of this great enabler which in turn can help the global economy and build a better future especially in such dire times as this pandemic.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,Binance under investigation by Justice Dept and IRS for Money laundering,"[https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/104836/binance-crypto-irs-us-government-investigation-report](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/104836/binance-crypto-irs-us-government-investigation-report)

Cryptocurrency exchange Binance is reportedly facing an  investigation by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service as well as the  Department of Justice, according to a report by Bloomberg.

According to the report,  officials from the DOJ and the IRS have ""sought information from  individuals with insight into Binance's business,"" citing unnamed  sources. Bloomberg's report noted that ""\[t\]he federal agencies haven’t  accused Binance of wrongdoing.""

Bloomberg reported in mid-March that Binance was facing an inquiry  from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) over whether the  exchange allowed U.S. residents to trade on its platform. 

Minutes after Bloomberg's report became public via headline newswires, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao tweeted:  ""So much FUD today. It's a pain for some, an opportunity for others.""  That message was similar to one he issued in the wake of Bloomberg's  CFTC report in March. 

“We take our legal obligations very seriously and engage with  regulators and law enforcement in a collaborative fashion.,"" a Binance  spokesperson told The Block when reached. ""We have worked hard to build a  robust compliance program that incorporates anti-money laundering  principles and tools used by financial institutions to detect and  address suspicious activity. We have a strong track record of assisting  law enforcement agencies around the world, including in the United  States.  We don’t comment on specific matters or inquiries.”

In recent months, Binance has sought to beef up its regulatory advisory team. In March, Binance hired former U.S. senator Max Baucus as a regulatory advisor, and later that month the exchange added two former members of the Financial Action Task Force (FAFT) to its advisory team. 

As previously reported, Binance has faced regulatory scrutiny in Europe for its stock token trading service. The offering drew a public warning from regulators in Germany.",cryptocurrency
stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, May 13, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, May 13, 2021**

The wild swings in the market continue, with three indexes bouncing back after yesterday’s selloff. With the market fluctuating so wildly, it is difficult to pinpoint the reasons behind this price action, but I think there are two main, competing factors contributing to the volatility the market has seen in the last two weeks or so. It seems that fears inflation, marked by high prints in the consumer price index yesterday, are causing concern that the Federal Reserve will tighten monetary policy sooner than expected and is pushing the market down while the April Job Report, which missed analyst estimates and marked a sharp declaration in job growth compared to March, bolsters confidence in the Fed’s claim that it will not consider tightening monetary policy until it sees a “string” of strong labor reports. Again though, with so many factors revolving around the market, it is difficult to see the clear picture.

The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed the day 1.17% up after closing 2.09% down yesterday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 0.77% up after closing 2.54% down yesterday. The Dow Jones (DIA) closed 1.26% up after closing 2% down yesterday. 

Yesterday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the consumer price index (CPI), which measures a basket of goods as well as energy and housing costs, rose 4.2% from a year ago, compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 3.6% increase. The monthly gain was 0.8%, against the expected 0.2%. Excluding the volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI (this is the main measure of inflation) increased 3% compared to the same period in 2020 and 0.9% on a monthly basis. The respective estimates were 2.3% and 0.3%. 

Today, the producer price index (PPI), which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output, rose 6.2% compared to April 2020 and 0.6% monthly increase. The core PPI, which excludes volatile items like food and energy rose 4.6% year over year and 0.7% in April. Economists polled by FactSet were expecting a 0.3% monthly increase in April and 3.8% year over year. This is the biggest jump since 2014. In tandem with the CPI report, this shows prices for both consumers and producers has increased more than expected. 

However, while the readings in inflation definitely are not good, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be “transitory” as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. In an April 28 meeting Powell said, “Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.”

Moreover, the April Job Report, released last Friday, showed the US economy only added 266,000 new jobs last month, missing estimates of more than 1 million jobs gained and marking a sharp deceleration from March’s total of 916,000 new jobs added. As said earlier, members of the Federal Reserve, including Powell, have consistently reiterated they want to see a   
“String” of strong labor reports before considering any changes to the current policy. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, “We want to see a string of months like that \[like in March\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, there’s a very large group of people who are not.” The April Job Report bolsters Powell’s argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy. 

In addition, at a separate event in April, Powell said that quantitative easing would likely taper “well before” the interest rate is increased. He said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.” In short, while the inflationary readings are not great, I’m fairly confident fears that the Federal Reserve will tighten policy sooner than expected are overblown. Looking ahead though, I expect the kangaroo market to continue in the near term. Just my two cents.

personalfinance,Buying a 1 bedroom apartment in Washington DC need advice!,"Hello,

I would really appreciate some insight. I’m considering buying a condo in the SW Waterfront neighborhood (Potomac Place Towers)  of DC, and am wondering if it’s a good financial decision. I already believe it’s a good lifestyle decision, but would like both things to line up.

* 25F, Single, Project Manager @ Healthcare 
* Income: 90K  of base salary (not including bonuses or stock options because unsure of exact figures). If career goes as expected over next \~5 years, this will be income floor, with average/ceiling being much higher.
* Assets: $70k investments (primarily retirement accounts), $50k savings account.
* Timeline: I like this area, and am committed to my role/team/company. I do consider going to graduate school (MBA) and in which case I would turn the property into a rental. I plan to try and hold for about 10 years. 
* Current: Rent 625 sq ft studio for $1600/month in DC.
* Condo: $318k for \~600 sq ft, 1 bed w/ balcony + storage.  No parking included.  The building has amenities - pool, 2 gyms, front desk etc. 
* Closing Costs: $4k out of pocket (less seller subsidy) 
* Loan: $318k purchase price with 3% down for 309k loan amount. Preferred lender offering 3.125% interest rate. 

Payment Breakdown:

* Principal and Interest: 1321
* PMI: 59
* Tax: 253
* Homeowners Insurance: 33
* Condo Fee: 400
* **Total Monthly: 2066 (27.5% gross monthly income)**

While I am increasing my housing costs by a significant factor compared to renting, it’s right at part of the recommended 28% of monthly gross income. My only other debt is 250/month for health bills with 2.5 years remaining, retirement accounts (pre-tax 401k, after-tax 401k, back door Roth IRA) as well as start increasing contributions to taxable brokerage accounts (goal in medium-term is to significantly increase this). Current pandemic rate rentals in the building are going for $1750-1850 for a 1 bedroom though they have been on the market for quite some time. I picked the Waterfront area because of the development in this area (Phase 2 of the Wharf).  I'm thinking of picking up waitressing shifts 1-2 per week in the Wharf to offset some personal costs and beef up savings. I thought about getting a studio apartment (but the monthly payment difference would be $300-400 month) and I feel like renting a studio would have higher turnover + more difficulty to sell later on. 

Main Concerns:

* Am I buying before a pandemic-induced housing market crash - aka at inflated prices? 
* While I expect to stay here for up to 5 years, my life circumstances could change. Buy vs Rent calculators are giving me lots of varying advice. I would try to hold onto the property as much as possible and rent it out if I go to grad school out of the city.
* Schools in the area don't seem that great when looking online. How does this affect my decision?
* Rising HOA costs over time. Other buildings in the area have HOA costs that are around $500+. 
* I Have no idea how to factor in above concern of housing market dip and how long that could take to recover from, as well as the potential future rental market if I decided to rent instead of sell. 
* Felt like my post was disjointed, but figured I’d post and add detail later. Would appreciate any feedback especially those familiar with the DMV area!! All comments are welcome but please mention if you are from DMV!",finance

personalfinance,Help demonstrate lender is charging more?,"I'm told my auto lender charges double the interest. They have gotten away with it because of how they show it. Can you look over my payment history (balance and payment amount) to help me demonstrate it?

I did the math. The interest just confuses me and I want to make sure the calculations are right.

Here's the payments: [https://imgur.com/a/MErpMaF](https://imgur.com/a/MErpMaF) begins in feb 22, 2019 and ends apr 10, 2021. 2 pages shown.

This is what I was told:

Look on the payment for June 28,2020, you made a payment of $650.00. Your balance before the payment was $24,796.33. $24,796.33 - $650.00 = $24.146.33. but the amount that shows as a balance is $24,458.22. The interest that you are paying out of the $650.00 payment is added back in the balance. I didn't catch this, until a person in finances with the government showed me. Lender charges double the interest. They have gotten away with it because of how they show it.

Every time you make a payment with lender, the interest goes up the same amount you paid on last month's payment. If you make a payment on January 5, and you don't make another payment until February 6, then in their eyes, you are 30 days late. So the interest that you paid on in January, doubles in February. Go on the website, and look at the PAYMENTS MADE ON THE LOAN, print it off if you have to. Make sure you print from the first payment until now. Get your calculator out, because you will need it.

$10k personal debt
$50k IRS debt
$10k State tax debt

$20k yearly income.
$0 assets

I am 5 classes away from getting my AA degree and transferring to a 4 year university to get my bachelor's degree. I have 0 student loans as I have been cash flowing my education. I will need to take loans once I transfer tho. There is a garnishment order by the state and Feds for the back taxes but it's not enforceable since I am an independent contractor. 

My question is how should I go about this? I had another job previously but was barely surviving due to the garnishment. I know I need to increase my income to take care of this and I qualify for some +20-$22 per hour jobs, but I was barely able to survive with a $28/hr job. These lower wages will make it impossible to survive. 

What order should I go about paying this? Should I pay off my personal debt to improve my credit so that I can get a loan /, credit card to pay my taxes? ( it seems cheaper then the penalties and interest that the Feds charge). 

How should I go about this?

personalfinance,"[USA][2020 Tax season] Assuming standard deduction, how much time/effort is it worth spending on taxes?","I use turbotax and have done so my entire adult non-dependent life. I've done all the data entry for my taxes such that I am ready to submit them as is, assuming the standard deduction. Due to some luck with market swings in 2020, I owe tax (rather than getting a rebate) for the first time, and my total tax obligation is much larger than it has been in the past. In addition to federal tax, I owe partial year tax in two states. It was probably folly to take on my taxes myself rather than hire an accountant, but I have accepted that I made this bed and now I sleep in it.

I am single, I don't own property, and my earned income is mostly W-2 and 1099 (with a small K-1). I've gone through the TurboTax suggestions to make sure I've accounted for my 401K etc. I don't think that I could come up with itemized deductions in excess of the standard deduction.

**At this point, is there anything to be gained from spending more time on my taxes?** On the one hand, there's enough money at stake that spending some number of hours to reduce the total tax burden by a percentage point or less would be a worthwhile use of my time, but on the other hand it seems very cut-and-dried. To be clear in all of this, I intend to stay above board, avoid audits, and I don't have access to any offshore accounts or shell corporations.",finance

The said the following:

personalfinance,My company went through an IPO. Looking for financial advice.,"I am in my early 30s. Married with kids. My company went through an IPO and I have about $2 million dollars of equity, pre-tax. I grew up middle class and I'm still paying college loans (along with my wife), I own a house and paying for two cars. This is the first time I've really had to worry about what to do with money.

I've talked to financial advisors and gotten some decent advice, but have them manage my money seems like a scam. ~1% fee annually is a lot of money, especially if all they are going to do is put into an index fund. I can do that myself. The subreddit has been more helpful, though I am considering consulting with financial advisors that charge hourly on occasion. I'll also be having a CPA help out with my taxes for this year so there are no surprises.

Financially, my goals are to buy a new house and sell our current house, which is in progress. The new house should cost a little over $600k, and we have about $70k of equity built up (though we haven't actually tested the market).
My other goal would be to retire (FIRE). I like my company and coworkers, but I hate the idea of working 5 days a week. I might work part time, or try to start a business on my own, but the goal would be to be financially stable (with no job) before I do that.

My plan is to
1. Pay off debt (student loans, car notes), most of which should be done in a couple years. Most of the interest rates are good, so I'm not trying to pay early.
2. Take out a loan on the new house, probably 30 years for flexibility. Interest rates are low still, around 3%, so I think it makes sense to get a loan here. This would also diversify some in real estate, and the loan is a bit of a hedge against inflation.
3. Diversify and invest, mostly in index funds. I have created Vanguard accounts for me and my wife. I will sell the bulk of my stock and buy VOO and maybe some other indexes (looking for advice here). We also have about $150k in 401k savings.
4. Retire when it's safe. I want to pay of debt and vest any significant equity I have remaining. I'll follow the 4% FIRE rule here. $2 million would come out to $80k a year. I probably want to grow that to at least $120k a year ($3 million). Though the equity I have hasn't been taxed yet, so I might be further away here. I might take some time off just to evaluate retirement spending.
5. Invest money into IRAs (though not this year, as my income will be too high from the RSUs, I believe.

My questions are
1. Is there anything else I should be doing, or thinking about? Particularly for the investing.
2. Are there other things I should be evaluating when trying to retire early? I know lack of health insurance is a big one.
3. I will need to pay for the house down payment before hitting long-term capital gains. Do I have any options that would save money here vs selling shares early? I know I can borrow $50k from my 401k, but that still leaves another $50k or so I would need to pay.

CryptoCurrency,"Don't just leave your coins in your portfolio! Stake it, lend it, put it in liquidity pools.","For all the newbies, there are a great amount of coins that you're able to stake or do for passive income.

Here are some coins you can earn passive income on:

**-ETH and many of its tokens**

On Kraken I see a staking option.

You can also provide liquidity in DEXs like Uniswap by depositing ETH and tokens like Uni, AAVE

**-USDT/USDC**

Popular choice. Ledger offers lending to Compound but there's other lenders with higher rates.

**-BNB and many of its tokens**

Stake on Binance. Or send to BSC DEXs like PancakeSwap to provide liquidity.

**-ADA**

This is a no-brainer. Wallets like Daedalus and Yoroi are excellent for this.

**-BTC**

Yes. BTC. You can lend it. And there's a coin WBTC as an ERC-20 token you can buy that correlates with BTC price. You can then use that to provide liquidity for ETH DEXs.

**-ALGO**

Official algo wallet does it for you.

**-VET**

VTHO making is automatic.

**I know DOT, MATIC, LTO, XTZ, ATOM and** **~~LINK~~** **can be staked.**

These all have really good interest rates, most 5%+ APY, way better than the banks.

Bottom line. Remember to stake or find ways to gain passive income. You don't want to miss out. Some exchanges even let you stake within, so you can stake even a little bit of ETH without getting fucked by gas fees.

Bitcoin,This is a very important message about bitcoin. Please take the time to read it.,"I mainly created this thread because of so many users coming here and saying bitcoin is old and outdated. These users are very misinformed. They've been fed misinformation by people that are profiting from spreading misinformation.

**Just read the bold text if this thread is too long for you.** The bold text is the summarized version and it contains all of most important information within this long wall of this text. I did this for users who don't like to read long posts. I know it's still long.

**If you'r a bitcoin veteran and you already know a lot about bitcoin:** Skip straight to the two bold paragraphs second from the bottom. They contain information about most of bitcoin's recent developments and second layer protocols.

**Bitcoin is just a protocol. It was released in 2009**

**TCP/IP are just protocols that were released in 1972. You could call them the backbone of the internet. Look at how long it took us to get to the internet that we have today, where TCP/IP is the backbone.**

[**Click here to read a bit about TCP/IP and blockchain technology.**](https://hbr.org/2017/01/the-truth-about-blockchain)

HTTP is just a protocol that was released in 1991. You could call it the backbone of the world wide web.

SMTP is just a protocol that was released in 1982. And IMAP is just a protocol that was released in 1986. You could call these protocols the backbone of email. Many people used to say that email was useless and nobody would ever use it.

TCP/IP was actually developed by cypherpunks just like bitcoin, PGP, and many other great protocols and technologies. In fact, two cypherpunks by the names of Hal and Len actually lived near each other and both helped develop TCP/IP. And they are also two of the three most likely candidates for being Satoshi. But that's not important.

People used to say computers and the internet was a useless waste too. Computers do use far more electricity than bitcoin mining. So perhaps they were right after all.

We are in the early majority. Bitcoin hasn't had it's Windows 95 moment yet, and I'll explain that statement below.

**Do you remember back in 1990 when everyone had heard of the internet but you didn't know anyone who used it? This is much like bitcoin right now, and even less people use the lightning network. Both are still in beta. February 1991 is when AOL for DOS was released. AOL for DOS made the internet fairly easy for everyone to use. But you still probably didn't know anyone who used it, and you probably didn't use it yourself. The internet didn't start getting popular until Windows 95 came out and most people still didn't use it for more years.**

**I can't wait to see where bitcoin is in a 12 years where it will be 23 years old. It was 1995 back when TCP/IP was 23 years old.** 

[**Click here to watch/listen to some news clips talking about the internet and email back in 1995 when TCP/IP was 23 years old.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95-yZ-31j9A) This was also the same year that Windows 95 was released.

**Bitcoin has the potential to be the backbone of the financial system.** And that's what people like the rocket scientist Michael Saylor are betting on. Michael Saylor is the same MIT graduate that predicted the mobile wave.

I want to inform you all that **I am not a bitcoin maximalist.** And my favorite cryptocurrency is actually an altcoin. I know you're shocked to hear that. But bitcoin holders please fear not, because **I still see bitcoin as the safest bet. And I also see bitcoin as the only protocol that has the potential to be the backbone of the financial system.** If this happened, then companies and countries would be using on-chain payments to settle large payments. There could be bitcoin backed currencies (like gold backed currencies of the past) and even bitcoin banks. **Hal Finney predicted there would be bitcoin banks in the future all the way back in 2010** Most people would be using second layer payment protocols to send bitcoin in milliseconds and costing almost no fees. And these **second layer protocols like the lightning network take a negligible amount of electricity to operate. Bitcoin can scale to handle as much demand as the world can create because of it's second layer protocols.**

Satoshi didn't create bitcoin to get rich. **He created bitcoin to allow online payments to be sent directly from one person to another without requiring trust or permission of anyone else.** Over 99% of altcoins were created to enrich their founders and over 99% of them have no future. None of them are as secure, as decentralized, or launched as fairly as bitcoin. **Bitcoin has the most users, largest infrastructure, no premine, no developer fund/tax, no leader, longest track record, is the most secure, is the most decentralized, and bitcoins circulated freely for 18 months before ever having any monetary value which can never even be replicated by an altcoin because the genie is out of the bottle now.** And unlike the founders of every altcoin, Satoshi never cashed out. The issuance schedule and maximum supply of bitcoin are both clearly defined and will never change. Bitcoin development is decentralized and anyone can contribute because Satoshi published bitcoin under the MIT license so that it's open source and anyone is free to do anything with the source code. Bitcoin protocol rule changes are also decentralized because they require nodes to come to consensus.** All of this is why bitcoin is so vastly different than altcoins.

Cryptocurrency is full of scammers/grifters, ignorance, and people that actually believe the lies because they've been sucked into altcoin cults. Gamblers use altcoins for trading/gambling to increase their bitcoin stack [or even their ETH stack if they don't understand bitcoin and cryptocurrency,](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T89gsJ2MsG8&amp;t=47m24s) and they aren't aware that Gary Gensler, the current Chair of the SEC, just said that ""a lot of crypto tokens, I won't call them cryptocurrencies for this moment, are indeed non-compliant securities"" this week. And nobody told them that the SEC disregarded previous claims made by Bill Hinman, former director of the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance, who suggested that offers and sales of ETH are not securities transactions. But enough about that.

Gambling on altcoins can be very profitable during a bull run because the altcoin market is basically a short term casino where you actually have a good chance of winning. It's a relatively easy way to increase your bitcoin stack. 

**If you properly handle your private keys, then your bitcoin can't be stolen or seized and nobody can stop you from sending it to anyone else.** 

**Any protocol rule change that doesn't make any previously invalid blocks now valid is called a soft fork.** This would be a miner upgrade and is easier to accomplish, we can give the mining nodes a chance to upgrade, bip9 can be used, or the nodes can just run compatible software.

**All protocol rule changes must be agreed upon by fully validating bitcoin nodes.** Even if the mining nodes don't agree, if the full nodes come to consensus and make a rule change, people will continue to mine as long as it's profitable to mine, so the miners have to deal with it or piss off and other people will mine. The mining difficulty will adjust every 2016 blocks regardless. So when it comes down to it, only the users who run fully validating bitcoin nodes are in charge of bitcoin. 

**Fully validating bitcoin nodes must come to consensus on any rule change that makes any previously invalid blocks now valid, and that's called a hard fork.** This would be a pretty big upgrade, and it would be difficult to pull off with bitcoin because it's decentralized. And that's a good thing.

**There is a maximum supply of 21 million bitcoin**, and that will never change. Satoshi designed the protocol so that **miners solve a block every 10 minutes on average**. The block reward started at 50 BTC. **The block reward gets divided by 2 every 210,000 blocks** (4 years if the hashrate remained constant), which we call the block reward halving. The block reward is currently 6.25 bitcoin and the next block reward halving will happen around April 2024. And then the block reward will be 3.125 bitcoin. **The mining difficulty adjustments every 2016 blocks** which is approximately 2 weeks. So if it's profitable for people to mine, then hardware gets turned on and the mining difficulty increases. But if the price of bitcoin lowers so that some hardware is unprofitable to run, then it gets turned off and the mining difficulty decreases. And as the block reward gets divided by 2 every 210 thousand blocks, the **transaction fees will continue to incentivize miners to secure the network even when the block reward is minuscule.**

Many users here like to repeat that the last bitcoin wont be mined until 2140. And while it is true that the last satoshi will not be mined until 2140. It is also true that **approximately 97% of bitcoins will be mined by 2032**, and the block reward will just be 0.78125 BTC at that time. But if bitcoin is worth, for example, a million dollars, then the block reward alone in 2032 would be worth more than the current block reward + transaction fees at this time. That's not even accounting for all of the transaction fees that the miners will also be collecting from the transactions that they include in blocks. 

Bitcoin is constantly being developed.  **Bitcoin also has second layer protocols that are constantly being developed and they don't require any consensus.** So anyone can just create second layer protocols for bitcoin and nobody needs to agree on anything. It's up to the users of bitcoin if they want to use various second layer protocols that maximize the user experience. **One of bitcoin's second layer payment protocols is called the lightning network. It's still in beta but it already allows an unlimited amount of users to send and receive bitcoin transactions in milliseconds for extremely minuscule fees.** 

[**Bitfinex**](https://www.bitfinex.com/), [**Okcoin**](https://www.okcoin.com/), and [**Strike by Zap**](https://beta.strike.me/faq) have already integrated the lightning network so that people can deposit and withdraw bitcoin using it and [**Kraken**](https://www.kraken.com/) **will be integrating the lightning network later this year.** Kraken even has a US banking charter and [**Kraken Bank**](https://www.kraken.com/en-us/bank) plans to offer most typical banking services later this year.

**For newbies wanting to try out the lightning network:** I only recommend you to use [**Muun**](https://muun.com/) wallet or [**Phoenix**](https://phoenix.acinq.co/) wallet. They're both user friendly and they allow users to send and receive on-chain transactions or lightning transactions, all from the same wallet. [**BlueWallet**](https://bluewallet.io/) is also a great choice but it's more advanced than Muun and Phoenix.

**For US residents only:** Consider trying out [**Strike**](https://beta.strike.me/faq) by Zap. It has no fees and it allows Americans to use cash in their bank account to buy bitcoin and have it be sent anywhere in milliseconds using the lightning network. Or they can send a lightning payment and receive cash in their bank. So Americans can use Strike app to fund lightning integrated exchanges with bitcoin instantly, to fund their lightning channels with satoshis, or to make instant bitcoin lightning payments, and all without any fees. I believe that Strike is also capable of sending and receiving on-chain bitcoin payments

**Bitcoin has second layer protocols like the lightning network and statechains. The lightning network allows an unlimited amount of users to sent and receive bitcoin in milliseconds for almost no fees, and uses minuscule electricity. Bitcoin also has a second layer protocol called statechains that allow non-custodial off chain transfers which bypass paying transaction fees and waiting for confirmations. And statechains can also be turned directly into lightning channels at will. So statechains allow users to open and close lightning channels without performing any on-chain transactions, without paying a transaction fee, and without waiting for a confirmation.**

**Bitcoin is also switching to schnorr signatures and activating taproot this year which will improve privacy, security, and efficiency. This will also lower the operating costs of running a node and the transaction fees for exchanges by an expected 30% and it will also allow us to use many more second layer protocols that have been developed. This will also allow us to create massive multi-signature transactions that are substantially smaller in size, and will even allow users to aggregate all the multiple signatures of a transaction into one (multiple signers can produce a joint public key and then jointly sign with a single signature). Shnorr signatures and taproot will also allow us to use the coinswap protocol which is pretty self explanatory, the musig2 protocol which will allow aggregating public keys and signatures, new discreet log contracts which increases privacy and scalability minimizes the trust required in the oracle which provides external data for the contract, and point time locked contracts which will improve the privacy of bitcoin payments using the lightning network. Trustless cross chain atomic swaps should also be available towards the end of this year. Schnorr signatures also makes multi-signature and single-signature transactions indistinguishable on the blockchain so an observer will not even be able to tell if a multi-signature transaction or a trustless cross chain atomic swap has happened by viewing the blockchain. NFTs can also be done on bitcoin and that's where they were done first back in 2012. There's also various sidechains in development, including liquid network. There's the RGB protocol which will allow smart contracts to be done using bitcoin on the lightning network. And much more.**

**Money (not fiat currency) always evolves in four stages** (this is from the *what is money?* section of *The Nature and Creation of Money* chapter of a college course on *Principles of Macroeconomics*). **Bitcoin is currently going through the second stage of the evolution of money, which is a store of value.** The next stage is a widely used medium of exchange. Bitcoin may evolve into the third stage in 5 years, in 7 years, in 12 years, or **bitcoin may never evolve passed the second stage**. The final stage of the evolution of money is a unit of account. Bitcoin is also currently going through price discovery. **Bitcoin's true value needs to be found before it will ever be a widely used medium of exchange The lightning network also to be adopted by the users, merchants, and exchanges before it's even possible for bitcoin to evolve into a widely used medium of exchange.**",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Need advice on owning my personal taxes,"I’ve never filed my taxes by myself. I’ve always had for example H&amp;R Block do it for me. With that being said, I’m quite concerned with how much taxes are being taken out of my paycheck every pay period. I understand what taxes are supposed to do for our communities and country. Though it’s disheartening to see that 25% (observed and assumed though may not be fully 25%) of my paychecks are being taxed. I’m married, no kids, and lower middle class. I work for my money, and don’t like to see so much of it go to taxes. I would like to somehow get this money back during tax time. Is this possible? Potentially through an LLC? Or is what I pay in taxes state and fed just the cost of being an American who is employed (rhetorical though a sincerely concerned question). 

• how can I structure my taxes to work for me? 
• what tax program would you recommend for me to file my own taxes come tax season? (I understand that tax lobbyists make it very difficult for us to file our own taxes)
• do you recommend any tax related content for me to learn more about understanding and taking control of my taxes
• what’s something you’ve learned about taxes personally that has really helped you
• what are the dos and do nots  

I’ve been hearing lately that only poor or uninformed people pay taxes. That financially literate people have much of their money tied up in investments and LLC’s, so come tax time, not much is in their name, therefore, lower taxes are withheld. I just don’t want to be that fool who should of known better and just didn’t do anything about it.

2. There are also always going to be people who don't care about the macroeconomic and technical realities of the world, but just the reality presented to them in their bank accounts -- these are the people who are going to think ""Elon's rich, so if I do with my money the same thing he does with his, I'll be rich too!""

Ultimately, the crypto sector gives us the ability to be free from the Fiat-denominated financial services, and that opportunity should be open to everyone who wants to be a part of it. However, the only way to *really* enjoy that freedom is to understand the underlying tech and monetary policy, e.g., what it is that you're actually paying for. You don't have to be a computer scientist or a macroeconomist to pull this off, but you do have to have the patience for some content that will get rather technical.

We are living in modern times, during modern times people are more open to new innovations and ideas. Our current information systems (think all the data the gov handles or sees) simply isn’t strong enough nor scaleable for this global economy were witnessing being built 

Some countries spent time understanding the internet, and others spent time exploring and finding ways to monetize it.  And now the networks and programs built on the same protocol that all countries had access to are vulnerable to the people that took the time to understand it. 

On a more personal level, I am seeing it in my workplace. I find super talented business Information Engineers and I place them with companies going through “digital transformation” projects. Since the start of COVID, things in the private sector (gov agencies on both fed and state levels) have been very active. Sorta obvious though - WFH, people need to access work from home etc etc. However, things are picking up, requirements are rapidly growing. The outlook has changed a bit... private sector companies are paying over 2x going market rates for immediate Cloud-Based Software Architects to come in scope out a plan to roll off old technologies and systems and into the cloud for security purposes.

Whether it be Bitcoin or some other project our Information and data systems need to be updated. We have the opportunity to scrap an old, unsecured, and untrusted system here.

One thing you hear continuously throughout the book is that a house is a liability, and I'm sitting here thinking, hey maybe he's right if you look at it as real estate and rent it out you would make x amount of dollars a week which adds up over the years. 
What the book fails to point out however is the fact that everyone needs a place to live and you will still end up paying rent somewhere.

He discusses mortgage repayments as a ""trap"" that will get you stuck in the ""rat race."" Now I'm no expert but say I went out tomorrow and borrowed about $400k. My monthly repayments would be around the $1.8k mark. I'm already paying $500/wk in rent which works out to about $26k a year. 

The author says that a house is a liability, this would imply that you do not build any equity in holding a property. if you bought a place interest only and rented it out for 4 years you might pocket around $30k and that's great and all but how are YOU going to live?
 
By spending in the ballpark of $100k in rent, that's how. So at this point, you're down $70k and have no assets. 

Now for the flip side, buy the house with a $100k deposit and pay the mortgage repayments for 5 years. $1.8k x 12 = $21.6k. 
AND
You will build about $40k in equity with a 2.5-3% interest rate.
AND
You have the option to now invest an extra $4k elsewhere every year.

SO YOU HAVE TWO OPTIONS:
A -  You can either buy real estate rent it out and pay rent somewhere else and lose $70k in 5 years.
OR 
B - Buy your own place for $400k ($500k total) with a $100k deposit save/invest $20k over 5 years, build $40k in equity, and possibly even make some nice CG if you're in the right area.

Please tell me I'm missing something... because from where I'm sitting the author of this book is a scam artist and I have no idea how it is so popular.

-mobile check deposit
-minimal to no debit usage
-pay credit cards

I'm waiting for the account to settle to see my new allocation, but I'm certainly under 50% stocks at this time. I have no debts.

I have been a buy &amp; hold index fund investor for the 20 years of my adult life. It always sort of bothered me that I didn't understand the underlying mechanisms of the markets I was investing in. At some point in the last decade I learned about the Schiller p/e index and thought ""hmm, this doesn't seem good..."" I read *Random Walk,* and I think I understood most of it.

**The Bug Out:**

Recently, I heard a Grantham interview and read some Hussman, and their gloomy prognostication really struck a chord with my natural inclination towards pessimism. They say current prices are unthethered from the underlying assets and and that this is true across all sectors of the market. My friends and the forums are full people  throwing money at speculative investments (crypto, SPAC, etc). My elders are telling me to blindly invest in an index fund and forget about it, because 'historic returns, don't miss the market's big days, it worked for them, etc.'

My armchair diagnosis is that there are a lot of people like me that are blindly investing in broad index funds that could care less about the underlying value of the assets as long as the price keeps going up. I suspect at some time in the future we'll look back and see that index funds were a craze like any other and laugh at the certainly we currently feel that these assets will return 6-8% on average until the end of time. Looking at you Vanguard (who recently told me that a 'normal asset allocation' was 90-95% stocks...hmm). I also think we'll look back and see that the last trick the boomers played on us was propping up their asset valuations with Fed policy and leaving us to hold the bag.

Worst of all, it doesn't seem like anyone I speak these concerns to (friends, family, investment advisors) is really taking them seriously or even hearing them. Am I turning into a flat-earther? Is the king wearing any clothes?

**What Now?**

I've been told you shouldn't try to time the market, and I've read the explainers about how I'm likely to mistime by selling below the peak, buying before the trough, and missing out on gains while out of the market. Frankly, I'm at a point where I don't believe in the market at all. Is not believing in the market at all the same as timing it?

I've heard that market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent. I've also read that by definition there is never greater certainty in the market than the day before the bubble pops.

I'm not sure I can just put all of my money in an index fund and sleep at night.  I have the following questions. Have some of you had a bug-out like I'm having now and that led you to value investing? Do you still believe in index funds in this current market? The knowledge requirements to be a value investor seem much higher than for an index-fund investor. It's crazy intimidating. Do I just start reading your investment bibles and leave my money on the sidelines until I understand how make investment decisions in individual companies?

tldr2; I am questioning the fundamentals of my buy-and-hold index fund approach to investing. What the hell do I do?

CryptoCurrency,"Current ""Cryptocurrencies"" aren't Currencies at all, they're Assets","For the people wondering why the entire Crypto market can drop due to the tweet of a single billionaire, it's because the current generation of Cryptocurrencies are all assets. They aren't being made to be used solely as a medium of exchange, they're being made to be invested in exactly like stocks, stocks you can pay with.

A currency shouldn't be able to inflate/deflate 10% in a single day, that isn't what a currency is. Until the Crypto community becomes less concerned with profit and more concerned with a global currency that can't be majority owned and moved by a set of whales, Cryptos will always be nothing more than payable assets.

I get it, you believe in your project and that's great... That doesn't change the fact that no currency should ever be able to inflate and deflate at the drop of a hat. 

The USD inflates based on the whims of the Fed, citizens have absolutely no control over it. We've seen what happens when currencies inflate/deflate wildly, look at Lebanon and it's worthless currency. 

A true decentralized currency isn't an asset. It isn't something you can 'invest"" in and expect it to just grow. It should have a set value that isn't increased or decreased based on any governmening body or based on the US Fed.

Also, ""stablecoins"" are absolutely ridiculous. The entire point is to completely move away from government controlling any aspect of the value of our currency yet stablecoins are backed by what? The US Dollar. Who controls the US Dollar? The Federal Reserve..",cryptocurrency
stocks,Helpful Sources for Understanding the Lumber Industry and the Value of Lumber Companies,"Based on questions I've been getting the last couple weeks, I want to share all the various sources I’ve used to keep myself educated on the industry and get my “feel” for long term exit strategies.

This post isn’t about doing EPS or IV projections.  It’s simply about how you can keep doing ongoing research about the general direction and prices of lumber the commodity, as well as any major news/opinions out there that could affect the commodity’s future direction.  

I find it **very** helpful, because on weeks like this one where everyone lost their fucking minds because the price of used cars went up a bit, I held strong because in the end I knew the CPI report and the panic selling that followed didn’t change the market fundamentals driving the lumber industry’s record profits.  I didn’t panic when futures went red the last few days, because I know how well these companies will do even if lumber prices drops another 30% and I knew that the cash markets were doing just fine.  So this “market feel” research helps you have confidence in your investment so you can ignore the daily noise.

**Basic Links for understanding the Current State of Lumber Industry**

I think it will be helpful for people to know exactly why lumber is surging and the market dynamics that caused it, because you can then use that to make educated guesses at whether your various companies still have long term value and have confidence in your investment when the fundamentals are still there.

Here are two excellent podcasts from two industry insiders discussing the current state of the industry:

[Odd Lots Podcast with Deacon Lumber CEO Stinson Dean](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/why-the-price-of-lumber-has-soared-day-after-day-after-day/id1056200096?i=1000518629853)

[Building Optimal Podcast with Dustin Jalbert; Fastmarkets RISI Senior Economist; Episode #71]( https://buildingoptimal.com/episodes/)

Both are great podcasts to help you understand what’s causing the surge from the people that know.  Hint: it’s not due to an industry-wide conspiracy.  This will help you start to figure out whether you should stick with your investment when lumber dips from it’s high after the summer.


**Apparently Social Media Actually has a Positive Use**

I don’t use social media, but I got a twitter account for work related reconnaissance and then found out that a handful of extremely knowledge people in the lumber industry are tweeting at each other non-stop about things going on in the cash markets / futures, as well as the occasional opinions.  These people often post articles on the area or new podcasts.  So it’s a great way to keep yourself educated.  Also, they are just good people and it can be entertaining to see what’s going on with them any particular day.

It can be insightful (and calming on red days), especially since normal members of the public can’t see what’s happening in the cash markets real time, but sometimes these guys will let you know.  The other day, when all the futures were nose diving, cash markets were still up, meaning the immediate price of lumber was doing just fine and it the red was really from the speculators jumping ship (which is a good thing!).

[Deacon Lumber CEO Stinson Dean](https://twitter.com/LumberTrading?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) – The King of Lumber Twitter.  Nice guy and great insights.  Don’t ask him what the price of lumber will be in Q4.  No one fucking knows.  

[RISI Senior Economist Dustin Jalbert](https://twitter.com/2x4caster) – Also a very prolific poster in Lumber Twitter and will share great insights.

[Forestry Insider Bryan Davis](https://twitter.com/bryandav1z) – Another knowledgeable insider who likes to share insights on the industry and some of the main lumber stocks.

[Housing expert/Chief Economist Ali Wolf](https://twitter.com/AliWolfEcon) – The housing market is driving this surge.  The lumber industry uses housing demand/data as the canary in the coal mind.  You probably should too.  If housing demand is still going bananas, then lumber will do so as well.

[Madison’s Lumber Prices](https://twitter.com/LumberNews?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) – They post Lumber Cash Prices, typically about 2 weeks behind, but that’s still way ahead of whenever the company’s next earnings statements, and provides a break down by the major types of lumber.  Sometimes you even get a video interview/update.

[RISI Analyst Bryan Smith](https://twitter.com/bryansmithrisi?lang=en) – He tweets out when some of these forestry companies declare wood pulp price increases (which extra is a significant source of income for a lot of these companies).  I find it a helpful data point.

Those are main ones.  But if you follow these people enough, you will see them talking to other insightful people as well and sharing informative content.

**Publicly Open Websites That Help You get a Sense of Market Direction**

Here’s the link for lumber futures: [CME Lumber Futures](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/lumber-and-pulp/random-length-lumber.html#) - This is the closest thing to a general market gauge of the lumber industry.  But this isn’t an exact predictor and this price is pegged to the Western SPF KD 2x4 #2&amp;Btr.  There are many different types of dimensional lumber, some cost more (like Eastern SPF) and some cost less (like Southern Yellow Pine – SYP).  But this can help you get a sense what the future outlook may look like generally.  But remember, these prices can change.  They can go up or down, these aren’t guarantees of the future price of lumber.  Just because January futures trading at 1100 doesn’t mean it will stay that way.

[Nasdaq Lumber futures Graph](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/commodities/lbs) – a nice little graph showing the general price of lumber futures at the time of each expiration.  Helps you get an idea for where we are historically.  Why is this important?  Because you can look at the 2018 levels, see how well these companies did then.  If our current price is HIGHER than the 2018 peak, then you really don’t need to panic.  

The industry’s breakeven price is generally around $400 mfbm.  2018 hit $600 for three weeks and it was a great year for them.  So maybe you don’t need to panic sell when the futures dip below **$1200** from their $1600/1700 peak.  What matters is where it settles.  Also, you can see that in 2020, the Price dropped hard and came right back up because demand was still booming like crazy.

[Madison’s Lumber Reports]( https://madisonsreport.com/) If you hate twitter, here’s another way to look at cash prices for the main types of lumber.  Again, the free stuff is typically about 1.5-2 weeks old.

[US Housing Data Releases](https://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/pdf/newresconst.pdf) – US Census release new data typically the third week of every month, posting the data from the prior month.  This is a HUGE stat in the lumber industry.  It helps you see what home construction rates will look like now and in the coming months (due to housing permit numbers which precede starts by 2-3 months).  When the number drops month after month, don’t panic. Make sure you consider other sources for context.  But a large drop over time, that’s when you know the party is over.

[Shanghai Pulp futures](https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/VLH21/futures-prices) – This isn’t lumber.  But most of the lumber companies also produce wood pulp and it makes up a large part of their income when doing well.  This is the closest thing to a price indicator for the general wood pulp market.  There are many different types of wood pulps, of varying price, but this is turning into a decent gauge of the general direction of the wood pulp market.  [Here’s a recent publication praising it and giving you more info on the current pulp market.](https://www.fastmarkets.com/Media/Files/PRA/FMV2/pdfs/Promotional%20materials/The_future_of_China_pulp_futures.pdf)

**Non-Lumber Specific Tools**

[Open Insider](http://openinsider.com/) is a website that lets you look up the insider buying/selling of any stock.  

[Whale wisdom](https://whalewisdom.com/) is another excellent website that lets you look and see which hedge funds own the stock your looking at.  Lets you know are they buying or selling en masse, calls or puts.  It gets their data from 13-F’s so it isn’t real time but it is a helpful data point nonetheless.

Overall, there is a lot of publicly available information that you can use to inform yourself on how the industry is going and if the immediate future is looking good or bad.  It may be a good idea to look at prior earnings presentations in whatever company your invested during the periods lumber was up, and see how they did at those prices.  That will help you gauge whether these companies will still do great even when lumber prices drop below $1K, because at some point they will.  Monetary policy/QE is not causing this.

If there is one place you *shouldn’t* go for insights on lumber stocks/industry, it’s Motley Fool / CNBC or frankly any of the tops results from google.  That free content is dogshit.  You can look at my post history to see how horribly off the mark these free websites are in recommending “lumber stocks.”  You are not the customer in their eyes, you are the product.  Keep that in mind.

**TLDR:** there is a lot of simple, free stuff out there to help you evaluate your investments or whether you should invest in lumber companies.  I am not a financial analyst or an industry insider.  Do your own research and make your own decisions.  Don’t panic sell because some internet dipshits who know nothing of this industry are calling the peak (but not backing that talk up with puts).  Don’t FOMO buy just because “the sucker’s going up.”

**Disclosure:** most of the stock I hold is in RFP, but I also hold some WFG and LPX.  Anyone have thoughts on what they like more LPX vs WFG long term (the next 6-18 months), please share and why.  I can’t decide which I want to buy more of.  For the Canfor/Interfor Bros out there, I don’t need to hear how cheap your otc stock is. :p",finance

CryptoCurrency,What would the impact be if an individual government agency started to accumulate and hold Bitcoin (and possibly other cryptocurrency) for use in some of their regular operations? Could they even do that?,"I understand that this may be a vague topic and there are multiple layers here. So heR me out. The first organization that seems to spring to mind on this would be the Social Security department in the USA, which eve before the pandemic had posted official audits showing outflows would be greater than inflows by the end of the 2020s, and at the current rates would run out of money by the mid 2030s.  

If they need an influx of cash flow, could they possibly buy crypto with their treasury assets, then get cash to pay out to their beneficiaries by getting loans on the crypto they have accumulated? This seems like it could be the best way to generate semi sustainable cash, as with the rising rates of most crypto now they could borrow against say BTC when it is valued at 50k each, then get another loan when valued at 75k, 100k, etc and keep paying it off as crypto rises. Even if they sold it outright, as Tesla did, they could still make a profit on the sale, far more than any Treasury notes they may hold at least.

My only question is can it be done? We hear of places becoming more crypto friendly, for instance Puerto Rico having their own 0% capital gains taxes, Wyoming issuing s bank charter to Kraken, and Miami wanting to become a crypto hub, but none of these are happening at the federal level which has been indifferent at best, and shuffles back and forth between tolerant and intolerant at times.

“If you would allow me to continue.. .”
Ford nodded dejectedly.
“Thank you. Since we decided a few weeks ago to adopt the leaf as legal tender, we have, of course, all become immensely rich.”

Ford stared in disbelief at the crowd who were murmuring appreciatively at this and greedily fingering the wads of leaves with which their track suits were stuffed.

“But we have also,” continued the management consultant, “run into a small inflation problem on account of the high level of leaf availability, which means that, I gather, the current going rate has something like three deciduous forests buying one ship’s peanut.""

Murmurs of alarm came from the crowd. The management consultant waved them down.
“So in order to obviate this problem,” he continued, “and effectively revalue the leaf, we are about to embark on a massive defoliation campaign, and. . .er, burn down all the forests. I think you'll all agree that's a sensible move under the circumstances.""

The crowd seemed a little uncertain about this for a second or two until someone pointed out how much this would increase the value of the leaves in their pockets whereupon they let out whoops of delight and gave the management consultant a standing ovation. The accountants among them looked forward to a profitable autumn aloft and it got an appreciative round from the crowd.

CryptoCurrency,The gamification of finance,"Uniswap, Sushiswap, BurgerSwap, Yam Finance, BakerySwap, PancakeSwap, Cake, Syrup, Bunny, …

Apparently people like food…and bunnies.  (Okay, obviously bunnies.) If you're not familiar with all these terms, at least in a crypto-currency context, it's okay, neither was I.  For those that remember the ICO craze, catchy names were bountiful as projects tried to draw capital into their projects from eager investors.  The underlying projects themselves ranged from ambitious to non-existent but no matter what, every team knew they needed solid marketing to attract eyeballs and ultimately cold hard cash. 

A lot of us are ""joiners"".  In fact, as humans, we're probably hard-wired this way.  We have an internal drive to feel a sense of belonging, to be part of a group or a team…or a cult.  If something exciting is going on, we want a piece of it, even a small piece, just to feel like ""we were there"".  We also value experiences and the memories we take away from them.  I watched a great discussion of how our memories work that talked about how we recollect our vacations.  We tend to assign a lot of value to specific moments of happiness or enjoyment and gloss over the hours spent travelling or waiting in line.

I think the above ties into why many of us are comfortable taking chances on high-risk investments…sure, we'd all love to make a fast (or slow) buck, but really, I think a lot of us are more interested in feeling like we are part of the crypto movement.  Because make no mistake, whichever projects ultimately succeed, Blockchain Technology and one of its biggest valid use cases in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) are here to stay and will (continue to) change the world.

The latest ""gold rush"" in crypto is DeFi, or more particularly, liquidity mining/yield farming.  Cartoon graphics and promises of astronomically high returns are drawing people back into the war for their capital.  Considering the low interest rates outside in the real world, a broad population of potential investors are dipping their toes into the world of DeFi.  But what I personally found interesting about liquidity pools is that staking them is not so much lending your support to either of the two tokens used in the trading pair (e.g. BUSD-BNB), rather, you are really supporting the exchange itself.  Your rewards are paid out in the form of an exchange-specific reward token (e.g. CAKE) and as such, your returns depend on the continued stability and viability of that exchange. 

I originally experimented with DeFi on the ethereum mainnet, and quickly realized (as many of us have), that without substantially more capital than I had available, the fees would outstrip any potential returns.  Which means in order be a ""joiner"" and feel like part of the movement, I had to move over to the Binance Smart Chain (BSC).  Here the fees were manageable, the options were varied and the sense of community was present.  But at the end of the day, the viability of my investment is heavily correlated to the success or at least continuity of the BSC ecosystem.

DEXs are incented to draw in as many people as possible, give them a bunch of options to vacillate between (generating fees along the way) and to keep their eyes and capital glued to the site as long as possible.  How do you do this effectively?  You make it fun.  Some people are willing to drop hundreds to thousands of dollars on freemium gaming.  If you can make finance fun, it's basically a ""gaming"" experience for those of us who desperately want to feel like we're part of the movement.  This is why we're seeing the lotteries, the cute graphics, the NFT collectibles and so on.  It's hard not to imagine a future where \*all\* mobile/freemium gaming is tied to blockchain and defi.

Bitcoin,Can you be investing too little to be worth it?,"Good afternoon. I recently started investing a little in Bitcoin as a long term place to hold money. I have money in a savings account and I'm noticing that the interest rate isn't enough to keep up with inflation any more so my money is essentially losing value while sitting in the bank.

I set up with coin base for bi-weekly purchases of $50 so $100 a month in bitcoin and I also purchased $500 during the recent dip when it fell below 50k.

Looking at my portfolio, I'm at about .017 btc or 1.7%. I'm thinking long term like 10 years what it could be worth, but I'm wondering if there is an amount that is so small that it's not really even worth it to bother trying to save. I'm not comfortable enough to pull out what I have in savings or even half of it and purchase Bitcoin. Even all of it wouldn't be a tremendous amount. Not even .50 btc. 

So is it worth it to invest so little? It's impossible to know the future but I'm not interested in chasing a quick buck gambling on memes and I don't want to go down that rabbit hole.

oil,"""U.S. capital running out of gas, even as Colonial Pipeline recovers "" REUTERS - 19 MINUTES AGO","WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. capital was running out of gasoline on Friday, even as the country's largest fuel pipeline network ramped up deliveries following a cyberattack and Washington officials assured motorists that supplies would return to normal soon.

The six-day Colonial Pipeline shutdown was the most disruptive cyberattack on record, demonstrating how vulnerable vital U.S. infrastructure is to cybercriminals.

Widespread panic buying continued two days after pipeline network restarted, leaving filling stations across the U.S. Southeast out of gas even in areas far from the pipeline.

With more Americans taking road trips as pandemic restrictions ease, pump prices are at their highest in years, two weeks before the peak summer driving season kicks off. The average national gasoline price has climbed to almost $3.04, the most expensive since October 2014, the American Automobile Association said.

On Friday gas station outages in Washington, D.C., climbed to 87%, from 79% the day before, tracking firm GasBuddy said. President Joe Biden assured motorists supplies should start returning to normal by this weekend.

""Most of these states/areas with outages have continued to see panicked buying, which is likely a contributing factor to the slow-ish recovery thus far,"" said GasBuddy's Patrick De Haan. ""It will take a few weeks.""

Colonial Pipeline announced late Thursday it had restarted its entire pipeline system linking refineries on the Gulf Coast to markets along the eastern seaboard.

Some states experienced modest improvements but still had a lot of gasoline outages. About 70% of gas stations in North Carolina were without fuel, with outages in around 50% of stations in Virginia, South Carolina and Georgia.

In Washington, D.C., Dennis Li was stuck on Friday at a Sunoco gas station that was out of fuel. He had tried to find gas at four stations during the day, but had no luck.

""I'm running on empty to the point where I don't want to drive anymore,"" said Li, who is from Annapolis, Maryland. ""I canceled my plans for today and this weekend because I didn't realize shortages were so severe.""

The hacking group blamed for the attack, DarkSide, said it had hacked four other companies including a Toshiba subsidiary in Germany.

Colonial Pipeline has not determined how the initial breach occurred, a spokeswoman said on Thursday. The privately held company has focused on cleaning its networks, restoring data and reopening the pipeline.

Colonial has not disclosed how much money the hackers were seeking or whether it paid. Bloomberg News reported that it paid nearly $5 million to hackers.

To speed delivery of fuel supplies, four states and federal regulators relaxed restrictions on fuel truck drivers, and Washington issued shipping waivers allowing U.S. refiners Valero Energy Corp and Citgo Petroleum to use foreign-flagged vessels to move gasoline and diesel from the U.S. Gulf Coast to East Coast ports.

Congressional committee members on Friday reintroduced legislation to support efforts by the Department of Homeland Security to secure pipelines and pipeline facilities from cyberattacks.

Gulf Coast refiners that send fuel to market through the Colonial Pipeline have cut production because they have been unable to move gasoline, diesel and jet fuel through the pipeline. A smaller, alternative pipeline filled to capacity quickly after Colonial shut its network last Friday.

""Imports are likely to increase from Europe to offset the shortfall but will take time to arrive,"" said Chris Midgley at S&amp;P Global Platts.

Bitcoin,BITCOIN IS ENERGY,"Finally I have seen Pompliano say what I been trying to post on this unforgiving Reddit thread for months. I always get downvoted, maybe now that Pompliano is saying it, you will upvote me.

MONEY IS ENERGY, please people get that through your heads.

There are so many ways to explain this and yet I don't understand why so many people don't get it. Either there is way too many idiots among us or those who think like me are way ahead.

Since the dawn of time people used different things as money, shiny rocks, metals, gold, food, etc.

What made any of those things valuable is not the time it took to create them, it's not that they were unique, it's not that they were shiny, what made them valuable is the amount of effort it took to create them. And effort is energy, calories, joules, watts, volts, whatever you want to call energy.

When you work at a farm nobody is paying you because you look pretty standing there for an hour. It's because your energy is required to work at a farm. Even if you are just using your brain for a cognitive task, that still is energy.

When I give you 100$ to spend, I am giving you 100$ worth of stored energy. Sure, you can spend it something stupid which took very little energy to create such as art, but that $100 will eventually hit a maximum energy limit of what it can buy. The higher the price of the item, the higher the amount of energy it took to put the object you are buying into existence. Your $100 can only buy a certain amount of energy.

When you get gold out of the ground by mining it, nobody cares how long it took to extract. What they care about is the cost of extracting it and the cost is measured in energy. The amount of energy in terms of human resources, machines, all of that combined is the energy it took to extract it.

Let's imagine a world where to extract gold all we have to do is to wait for the rain to fall on the ground so that it reveals gold and the water clumps it together on it's own. Nuggets of gold float at the top, even if they are rare would just float to the surface and stick together to form nuggets, no energy required just rain. Well in that world nobody would give a damn about gold !!!!!!

What matters is the amount of energy it took to extract gold, that is gold's true value.

BITCOIN'S TRUE VALUE IS THE ENERGY IT TOOK TO CREATE IT !

They will try to convince you that there are blockchains which use very little energy and are faster than Bitcoin. But those are the same ones who created the Federal Reserve to facilitate printing of money. They want it to be easy, they want you to believe that money should be easy and cost nothing so that THEY can create it with no effort and make you pay ridiculous amounts of YOUR energy for something it took them no energy to create.

Bitcoin is an energy unit, and a very solid one. Electricity is Bitcoin's link to the physical world. The more electricity it takes the more physically present it is and the more it has value.

I'm just sick and tired of watching idiots around me get rich and have a financially free lifestyle and those same idiots will sell Bitcoin just because they listen to other idiots talk about how energy intensive Bitcoin is. I'm sick and tired of naysayers, journalists, syndromic CEOs, haters, and general idiots, all who never took the time to sit and think, instead they repeat what someone else has said.

Think about what Satoshi has created, a pure energy unit. Yes, it uses electricity which isn't entirely from renewables, but it is 75% renewable and moving towards even more green energy.  Bitcoin incentivizes electricity to be generated from low cost resources, renewable resources. Bitcoin uses energy where otherwise it would go to waste. Many power plants cannot store their excess energy, it goes to waste, that is where many Bitcoin mining rigs are, where energy is cheap and green.

Don't listen to syndromic CEOs, they got many issues to deal with beginning with their own syndrome, you focus on your own research and upvote this!

I am looking for a way to create a short documentary video on Bitcoin's power consumption and why money is energy and why Bitcoin is pure energy. Stay tuned, still trying to finance the project.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Refinanced mortgage; credit score dove; need to buy new car,"tl;dr: Had good credit my whole life, but buying land on a loan and then a mortgage refi have jacked my credit. Car broke down and need to purchase, and trying to understand if I have any options of not getting screwed on a crazy high interest rate from being seen as a financial risk.

More info:

We refinanced our mortgage to take advantage of the low rates. Had a bit of credit activity over the last 9 months: purchasing a land loan, and refinancing our mortgage.

I generally have strong credit in the high 700’s. Pay off all balances on time, always. Made a mistake a few years ago closing old credit cards to consolidate with the wife so that has impacted things a bit.

Looked today and score has dropped from \~720 last month to 550. Due to a young mortgage account, 5 hits for credit checks for the two loans this last year, and a high credit card bill right now (bought a vacation) have thrown an outlier to my credit.

And as luck has it, I blew an engine so now need to purchase a car. I am worried that my poor credit is going to tank my ability to get a good interest rate. The plan was to see if I could get a 0.9% from the dealer and slow play payments on the car, as we’re trying to steer cash away to build a vacation home on the land we bought so cash flow is our priority.

Consider my choice for the car and to take a loan on it non-negotiable.

Anything I can do to mitigate impact? Here are the options I think I have:

* Defer a purchase for \~45 days after a new credit score is pulled and the CC vacation balance has been paid off. Not ideal since, uh, I still need a car before then. Also with supply of inventory as an issue and the dealer having what I want in stock (new and kind of rare model), this is not my ideal choice.
* Suck it up and pay whatever interest rates someone with a 550 credit score has!?
* My wife’s credit hasn’t been impacted as bad as she has some credit cards from childhood still open that help protect that category, so she’s . Thinking about getting her to co-sign or be sole on the loan.

Credit score has never been an issue my whole life, but now a lot of balls in the air all at once, resulting in an exceptional condition for me to deal with. Is there anything about maybe being an average of the last few months of credit scores instead of the current month?",finance

personalfinance,Large 0% interest loan from family member,"A family member wants to give me a $100k 0% interest loan to be paid back over 30 years. This is obviously an incredibly generous offer and I am extremely grateful.

My question is: How do we best avoid any tax consequences?

Here's my understanding after 30 minutes of Googling:

0% or low interest loans can be considered taxable by the IRS (understandably so). The interest that my relative ""should"" have charged me will be considered taxable income for them. There's an exception for gifts under $10k (not applicable) or up to $100k, but the latter won't apply since I have investment income of over $1k annually.

I understand that there will be no tax consequences if my relative charges me the IRS's AFR interest rate of 2.16%, but that's not ideal since the intent is to provide an interest free loan.

Is it possible that I could pay 2.16% interest annually and my relative could simply gift it back to me?

Is it possible to avoid any taxes by considering the loan a $100k gift? If I understand correctly, a gift over $15k would need to be reported to the IRS, but wouldn't have any tax consequences for either of us unless my relative were to exceed the lifetime gift exclusion of $11.7 million (definitely not going to happen). For context: trust would not be an issue here (for repayment of the loan if it were given as a ""gift""). I am this person's legal Power of Attorney and have full access to all of their banking and investment assets, so they must trust me.

If there's a better subreddit for this, please let me know.

Many thanks!",finance

personalfinance,Where should I put an extra $5k?,"Throw away account due to lots of personal financial information. 


I recently inherited a little less than $5k in the form of bonds my grandparents gifted me throughout my early childhood. My husband and I split finances, so this is ""my"" money.


Jointly we have $25k in savings, as well as $30k each in retirement funds. I have $5k in my personal savings and no debt to speak of (no car payment, no student loans) other than our mortgage. We have a 30yr fixed, but are working hard to pay it off in 20-25yrs. My company doesn't have an employee 401k program, and I'm already maxing out my IRAs. I also have a small acorns account with about $3k, which I use exclusively for vacations and travel.


I've considered opening a regular money market account that has different options than my IRAs for a little bit of diversity and security. I've also thought about long term CDs, but didn't love the interest rate there. Finally, I considered putting it into my own savings, for a little extra padding since $5k is only about a month's salary for me. Oh, and if I were being reckless, I'd put it towards my dream car 🙃


Our joint savings account is for large home projects and a safety net for big things that may come up such as tornado damage, new appliances, etc.


So, what would you do with an extra $5k?",finance

personalfinance,Feeling car trapped and not sure what to do.,"Ford Edge 2016. Bought it at the height of the pandemic on credit due to extremely low interest rates. We have 9k left on it to pay over the next 4 years. Have not planned to pay extra off because we invest what we have left over bc the interest rate and monthly payment is so low. 

A couple weeks ago, the sunroof started “popping” as it was shutting. Trunk also stopped opening. Decided to take it in to have it looked at and to fix the trunk. Trunk repair will cost about 800-1k to fix. No problem.

They told me today that the sunroof frame is completely shot and needs to be replaced. Basically the entire fixture except the glass. Gonna cost about 10k all said and done. 

There’s no way in hell I would ever spend that much on repairs for this car, especially since we could (have) sell it for more than we bought it for right now. Unfortunately, there is now a gap in the sunroof and the car because it will not shut fully. So the car is absolutely screwed, and I don’t know how we will sell it.

Anyone have any advice? Repairing it will sap the majority of our emergency fund. Only thing I can think of to do would be to fix it, sell it, use the funds to try and pay off the car and recoup some of our emergency fund, then buy my wife a clunker.

Edit: going to try to get it forced shut myself, then go from there. Then try an aftermarket or mechanic to see if they can shut it if I can’t. Thanks for everyone’s help!

Edit 2: wanted to add this in case anyone stumbles upon this looking for help with their Ford Edge. If you have similar problems, try pressing the buttons to open it all the way, then hold down the button until it shuts as far as it will go. Then, hold down the close button for about 10 seconds, or until it either shuts itself or opens itself up. This should reset the “computer”. Then do a good cycle of opening and shutting it, and it should be fine. Saved us about 10k in repairs.",finance

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, May 14, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, May 14, 2021**

Stocks continued yesterday’s momentum, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closing 1.51% up, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 2.21% up, while the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 1.11% up. The price action this week has been nothing short of remarkable, with the market selling off in the first three days of the week before recovering Thursday and Friday. In my view, this week was like a battle between the inflationary fears spooking market participants that the Fed will tighten rates sooner than expected while the April Job report, which greatly missed estimates and marked a sharp deceleration in job growth compared to March bolstered confidence in the Fed’s commitment to maintaining monetary policy accommodative until it sees a “string” of strong labor reports like the one in March. While I said all week that I thought the initial sell-off was an overreaction (and it seems to be that way judging from the last two days), short-term volatility may continue going into next week, too early to tell if the market is beginning a new uptrend or is just bouncing.  

On Wednesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the consumer price index (CPI), which measures a basket of goods as well as energy and housing costs, rose 4.2% from a year ago, compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 3.6% increase. The monthly gain was 0.8%, against the expected 0.2%. Excluding the volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI (this is the main measure of inflation) increased 3% compared to the same period in 2020 and 0.9% on a monthly basis. The respective estimates were 2.3% and 0.3%. 

Yesterday, the producer price index (PPI), which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output, rose 6.2% compared to April 2020 and 0.6% monthly increase. The core PPI, which excludes volatile items like food and energy rose 4.6% year over year and 0.7% in April. Economists polled by FactSet were expecting a 0.3% monthly increase in April and 3.8% year over year. This is the biggest jump since 2014. In tandem with the CPI report, this shows prices for both consumers and producers have increased more than expected. 

However, while the readings in inflation definitely are not good, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be “transitory” as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, “We want to see a string of months like that \[like in March\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, there’s a very large group of people who are not.” The April Job Report bolsters Powell’s argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy. 

In addition, at a separate event in April, Powell said that quantitative easing would likely taper “well before” the interest rate is increased. He said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.” In short, while the inflationary readings are not great, I’m fairly confident fears that the Federal Reserve will tighten policy sooner-than-expected are overblown. Just my two cents.

personalfinance,IRS begins correcting tax returns for unemployment compensation income exclusion; periodic payments to be made May through summer,"WASHINGTON — The Internal Revenue Service will begin issuing refunds this week to eligible taxpayers who paid taxes on 2020 unemployment compensation that the recently-enacted American Rescue Plan later excluded from taxable income.

The IRS identified over 10 million taxpayers who filed their tax returns prior to the American Rescue Plan of 2021 becoming law in March and is reviewing those tax returns to determine the correct taxable amount of unemployment compensation and tax. This could result in a refund, a reduced balance due or no change to tax (no refund due nor amount owed).

These corrections are being made automatically in a phased approach, easing the burden on taxpayers. The first phase is underway and includes the simplest returns. The next phase will include the more complex tax returns which the IRS anticipates will take through the end of summer to review and correct.

The first phase of adjustments is being made for single taxpayers who had the simplest tax returns, such as those filed by taxpayers who did not claim children or any refundable tax credits.

The IRS will issue refunds resulting from this effort by direct deposit for taxpayers who provided bank account information on their 2020 tax return. If valid bank account information is not available, the refund will be mailed as a paper check to the address of record. The IRS will continue to send refunds until all identified tax returns have been reviewed and adjusted.

These refunds are subject to normal offset rules, such as past-due federal tax, state income tax, state unemployment compensation debts, child support, spousal support or certain federal nontax debts (i.e., student loans). The IRS will send a separate notice to the taxpayer if the refund is offset to pay unpaid debts.

The IRS will send taxpayers a notice explaining the corrections, which they should expect within thirty days of when the correction is made. Taxpayers should keep any notices they receive for their records. Taxpayers should review their return after receiving their IRS notice(s).

Correction to any Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) without qualifying children and the Recovery Rebate Credit are being made automatically as part of this process. However, some taxpayers may be eligible for certain income-based tax credits not claimed on their original return, such as the EITC for their qualifying children. If so, they should file an amended tax return if the revised adjusted gross income amount makes them eligible for additional benefits.

More complex corrections will begin upon the completion of the first phase and involves couples filing as married filing jointly.

Unemployment compensation is taxable income. The American Rescue Plan excludes $10,200 in 2020 unemployment compensation from income used to calculate the amount of taxes owed. The $10,200 per person exclusion applies to taxpayers, single or married filing jointly, with modified adjusted gross income of less than $150,000. The $10,200 is the amount of income exclusion, not the amount of the refund. Refund amounts will vary and not all adjustments will result in a refund.

The legislation also suspends the requirement to repay excess advance payments of the Premium Tax Credit (excess APTC). If a taxpayer paid an excess APTC repayment amount when they filed their 2020 return, the IRS is also refunding this amount automatically. If the IRS corrects the taxpayer's account to reflect the unemployment income exclusion, the excess APTC amount that the taxpayer paid will be included in that adjustment. The IRS is also adjusting accounts for those who repaid excess APTC but did not report unemployment compensation on their 2020 tax return.

I currently owe $0 interest on them right now so I don't have to worry about the interest capitalizing when forbearance ends. And I just can't bring myself to make payments on them every month when my money could be getting me interest elsewhere.

My question is: where can I put this monthly payment for the next 7 months to get interest?

All I have is a Roth IRA that has automatic contributions that should get it to $6k by year end. My current idea is to contribute the $250/mo to my Roth on top of my normal contributions, and then pull out any contributions over $6k before 12/31 and use that to make a big payment on my loans. Obviously, any interest gained is stuck in my Roth until I retire, but I'm totally fine with that because it's still free money.

IRA - $142,000

Crypto Holding Partnership - $50,000

Personal Crypto - $46,000

**Debts**

Mortgage - $485,000

HELOC - $112,000

&amp;#x200B;

To be honest, I had been investing my money over the past three years and letting the HELOC debt grow, mostly because the money I invested was growing at a much higher rate than the interest rate on the HELOC. But with the market seemingly heading for a downturn and my crypto appetite full, is the right move to attack the HELOC until fully paid off? Should I suspend IRA contributions as well? For more context, I make $100K annually. I'd rather not draw down on my crypto or brokerage to pay off my HELOC. 

Circling back to retirement, I'm hoping to buy another home by the time I'm 40 and move out of my city condo. From there, I'd like to rent it out (roughly $3000-3200 monthly) and refi that to a 15 year loan (so it's paid off by 55). So hopefully my retirement savings will be supplemented by real estate income. 

I guess what it comes down to is that the HELOC is giving me serious anxiety. The terms are 10 years of drawdown followed by 20 years of paying it off, with no penalty for paying it off early. Is it nonsensical to just put it on the backburner, not worry about it, and pay it down over that period?

Damn, I rambled on for too long after all. Sorry!",finance

personalfinance,Looking for advice on home buying in this market,"So I will try to keep this as summarized as possible.. Basically me and my longterm SO have been renting and never owned a home. We planned on buying a home this year after our 1.5 year lease contract was up, then the market went crazy. We have been searching for months, looked at dozens of houses, offered on 5 and lost them all. We make decent money and are trying to buy a home to stay in for 20+ years and raise a family, then only get rid of the home once we want to downsize after kids leave.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm very bad about never wanting to spend more than I should on anything, we have a sizeable amount of savings. The issue is every house we are looking at (around 300k-350k) keeps going way over asking price. If we don't find a house soon we have to renew our lease which then costs \~$2k to break, plus $1k+ per month in rent, and our preapproval will expire and interest rates can start creeping back up soon.

&amp;#x200B;

How stupid is it to overpay on a house in our situation if it's something big enough, close to family, and all the other things we are looking for? We have been very picky and learned a lot on this journey of what we want in a house but everything that fits our criteria ends up slipping away then we start over from scratch. The current house we are looking at is listed for 300k but we are expecting it to go 320k-335k even though it needs lots of work such as new carpet, flooring, paint walls, appliances, the roof is older, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Even if we overpay, it is still well within our budget and the monthly payment is very doable but I don't want to have major regrets 5 years later thinking how much we paid for the house. At the same time, if we keep waiting we will just throw away more and more money to renting and eventually breaking a lease, plus if interest rates go back up that factors in too.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice here would be appreciated, I'm so torn between adding the extra 5k-10k ontop of already going 20k+ over asking price just to be done with this process but I want to try and handle this in the most financially responsible way long term while also thinking of my families future",finance
investing,Lyn Schwartzer on Inflation Trends,"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4426754-investing-with-inflation-150-years-data

Say what you want about Seeking Alpha, but this writer is generally considered the most analytical author there and in no way limits her team's work to Seeking Alpha. I notice some people don't like the website, which is fine, but this woman could write for Forbes or academic journals etc. if she wanted to do so, in my opinion.

The article looks at inflation, money supply, international responses to inflation, and its effects on different classes of people. It also touches on how different asset classes may play out under different conditions.

Of note is her conclusion that people who scream hyperinflation are farcically wrong, but she also notes when short term heavy inflation rears its head it stays on and doesn't dissipate. Say, if 5% inflation happens one year, it remains, even if it doesn't feature heavier inflation going further. Like many things in investing, the likely outcome is the middle road.

She also points out how the macro economy may be trending more towards labor over capital. Overall I think such effects would balance out, as better wages and cheaper equities seem great to me personally, although she doesn't delve very far into the thought.

My portfolio is equity REIT heavy so I especially liked her explanation of how real estate does okay with both higher inflation and higher interest rates, contrary to popular belief. Entry point is key--fixed rate debt is of course the best to have in an inflationary environment. 

""Interest rates: When interest rates rise, it puts downward pressure on most asset prices, as we saw in the inflationary decade of the 1970s. When interest rates remain low, then monetary inflation remains a decent environment for asset prices, as we saw in the inflationary decade of the 1940s from the market bottom in 1942.""

""Pendulum swings: Whenever the balance of power favors the wealthy, due to some combination of offshoring, automation, and the political environment, then monetary inflation is more likely to translate into asset price inflation. Whenever the balance of power shifts towards labor, due to labor onshoring, labor organization, and/or populist politics gaining a foothold, then monetary inflation is more likely to translate into consumer price inflation. This is largely correlated to wage increases or lack thereof, as well as being correlated to the size and scope of government transfer payments and tax policy.""

""Inflation: During periods of moderate to high inflation, gold and commodities tend to do extremely well. Equities outperform bonds more often than not, but it depends on the type of equities and their starting valuations, and therefore have a huge variance. Real estate does well, mainly because leverage attached to it gets melted away from inflation. Bonds do poorly in inflationary environments.""

""Deflationary shock: If temporary deflation is caused by a deflationary shock, such as a recession or depression, bonds are the place to be, and outperform everything else. Gold also generally does fine compared to other assets. Stocks and commodities usually perform very poorly.""

""Productive deflation or disinflation: Bonds and stocks do well in goldilocks periods of strong real growth, with low inflation and high productivity gains. Between the two, stocks can do better. Commodities and gold are prone to poor performance in this type of environment.
My base case going forward continues to be that with the combination of sizable broad money supply growth, along with public opinion pushing the pendulum back away from globalization, consumer price inflation is likely to be higher in the 2020s decade than in the 2010s decade.""

These points may be common knowledge to some, but I found it informative. Consumer price inflation is pretty identical to what we think of as ""inflation,"" so it seems fair to submit inflation will be higher than we are used to but not catastrophic or anything. So, for me, I like to think my REITs, most of which have pretty strong rent escalators linked to CPI (up to 3% annually with base increase no matter what), will do fine over a multi-year period. 

I hate precious metals since I don't really think of them as hard assets--it's just a series of price quotes to most people who hold it--there is some correlation to real estate. Consider how the ticker LAND had pretty extreme outperformance compared to its own asset class during 2020 which is still ongoing since that REIT focuses on owning specialty crop farmland with water rights. It outperformed gold swiftly, yet probably appeals to the same kind of buyer and pays cash dividends. 

I'd also like to remind people many REITs invest in free-standing properties on a triple net basis and that retail stores are still opening up en masse, largely among discount retailers which easily co-exist with internet commerce in poorer areas (think Dollar General, which works with companies like Instacart). Even with covid there was no retail apocalypse among corporate discount retailers. Most of these lease to REITs and pay a good deal of rent.

It may also be worthwhile to consider that with higher than usual inflation comes a risk of higher than usual interest rates being implemented, again, not to a catastrophic scare mongering level. Financials that focus on offering floating rate loans may do well over the coming years. Burry recently invested a good deal of money in a multi-cycle weathered business development company, Ares Capital, which would organically benefit from even minor rate hikes.

I think the best thing I pulled from the article is: don't worry so much. Inflation will happen, but it won't be insane. Perhaps focus less on long duration equities, ie. very high multiple tech corporations, and at least consider adding assets that are more down to Earth.",finance

cardano,Concerning implications of the transaction fee FORMULA.,"So I was looking into when looking into transaction fees i came across this [reference](https://docs.cardano.org/en/latest/explore-cardano/cardano-fee-structure.html). There i found that:

&gt;  
&gt;a/b are protocol parameters  
&gt;  
&gt;\[and\] Protocol parameters are values that can be altered by Cardano’s update system to react and adapt to changes in transaction volume, hardware prices, and ADA valuation.

A constant (in a and b) which is at the discretion of the Cardano governance sounds analogous to some FED monetary policy powers. If I'm mistaken please explain.

stocks,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning May 17th, 2021","Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 17th, 2021.

# **Earnings reports and the Fed will test the market rally in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/14/earnings-reports-the-fed-will-test-the-market-rally-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; Investors will see whether stocks carry their newfound momentum into the week ahead, as major retailers, including Walmart and Home Depot, report earnings and housing data dominates the calendar.
*****
&gt; The Federal Reserve may also play a role. Minutes from its last meeting will be released Wednesday, and after April’s hotter than expected consumer and producer inflation, market pros will watch it closely.
*****
&gt; Central bank officials are also scheduled to make comments, including Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida who speaks next Monday.
*****
&gt; Stocks have been volatile. The rally on Thursday and Friday was unable to reverse the week’s heavy losses. The defensive consumer staples, financials and materials were on track for a positive week among major sectors. The worst performers were consumer discretionary, off about 3.7% for the week, and tech, which was down 2.2%.
*****
&gt; Technology shares were among the best performers in Friday’s rally, up about 2.1%. Energy was the best performer, up more than 3%.
*****
&gt; “Watch it with a certain amount of trepidation,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. “It’s not like the things that spooked us this week, like inflation, are going away...I think the fact we bounced at the end of the week is constructive.” He added that he still expects the market to move forward with fits and starts.
*****
&gt; But a positive for the market and the economy was the announcement on Thursday from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention that vaccinated people do not need to wear masks.
*****
&gt; Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee said in a report Friday that he now expects small caps and stocks that were hardest hit in the pandemic, like airlines and hotels, are ready to rise off the bottom.
*****
&gt; He is still concerned about the tech sector, which big investors are using as a source of funds as they rotate into staples and health care.
*****
&gt; # Fed Ahead
&gt; The Fed minutes should basically be a replay of the last central bank meeting. But that was held before April’s Consumer Price Index was reported to be up a sizzling 4.2% year over year.
*****
&gt; That last meeting also took place prior to the April employment report that showed just 266,000 payrolls, a quarter of what was expected.
*****
&gt; “I think the Fed is willing to look through these weird data points. They’re thinking that one data point is not a trend,” said Joseph Song, senior U.S. economist at Bank of America.
*****
&gt; But the markets have been focused on whether any data helps clarify how soon the Fed may start to talk about winding down its bond buying. That would be a precursor to slowly ending the $120 billion a month asset purchase program, and also a signal that it is one step closer to raising interest rates.
*****
&gt; Hogan said when the weak employment report was released, the market view shifted away from the idea that the Fed could discuss tapering its bond buying when it holds its Jackson Hole Economic Symposium in late summer.
*****
&gt; But the market moved back to that view when the hot CPI report was released Wednesday.
*****
&gt; “We saw hot CPI, hot PPI,” said Hogan, referring to the producer price index. “That tells us the Fed could be behind the curve.”
*****
&gt; The Fed has said it expects a transitory spike inflation, but concerns it may not be a temporary spike rippled through the market. But Hogan said investors took some comfort from declines in iron ore and copper, down nearly 2% for the week.
*****
&gt; # Retail earnings and housing
&gt; Big retailers report quarterly earnings throughout the week. Walmart and Home Depot will report Tuesday. Target, TJX and Lowe’s release results Wednesday, and B.J.’s Wholesale and Kohl’s on Thursday.
*****
&gt; Another disappointing data point was Friday’s April’s retail sales, which came in flat with March. But they are still at a high level. Hogan said based on the sales report, retailers should have done well.
*****
&gt; “You’re likely to hear the usual suspects are outperforming. It used to be Walmart, Target, Home Depot, Lowe’s,” said Hogan. He said now others have joined the list, like TJX and Gap, and should do well.
*****
&gt; Besides earnings, there is housing data. The National Association of Home Builders sentiment index will be released Monday, and housing starts are published Tuesday. Existing home sales will be issued on Friday.
*****
&gt; Hogan said depending on the data, it may help the homebuilders which fell hard in the past week. He noted that D.R. Horton and Hovnanian were both down for the week.
*****
&gt; “The home building index is off 5% for the week, even with it being up 1% [Friday]. This is a red-hot sector that has lots of implications,” he said. “What’s good for home sales is good for auto sales. It’s good for Home Depot and Lowe’s.”
*****
&gt; Homebuilders were part of a broad swath of the market that was bouncing Friday.
*****
&gt; Scott Redler, chief strategist at T3Live.com, said by the end of the week, some of the growth and tech names were trading better, like Facebook and Alphabet.
*****
&gt; “The S&amp;P 500 held the 50-day moving average, which is constructive,” he said.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 came within about a dozen points of its 50-day, which is the average price of the last 50 closes. It is often a level that acts as support, but if it is broken, it can signal a negative trend.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was down about 1.5% for the week at 4,173.85. The Nasdaq ended the week at 13,429.98, down 2.3% on the week.
*****
&gt; “The tech sector, which has been under pressure, held its yearly uptrend earlier in the week. Today it felt a little better than the rest of the week,” Redler said Friday. “It doesn’t mean you can go into everything, but you can tell traders are picking away at better acting stocks at these prices.”

&gt; # 5 Charts We Are Watching

&gt; Last week’s monthly nonfarm payroll was disappointing, but it usually takes a long time for jobs to come back after a recession, so maybe we shouldn’t have been so surprised. In fact, looking at the 10 previous recessions, it took 30 months on average to recover all the jobs that were lost. Given we still have 8 million jobs to make up this time, we could still be quite a ways away from getting the labor market back to where we were pre-COVID-19.

&gt; The current bull market has tracked the start to the 2009 bull market nearly perfectly. “Be aware that right about now is when the 2009 bull finally took a break, falling more than 16% into the summer,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “We don’t expect that type of a pullback this time, but after an 89% rally, maybe a pullback or consolidation is in the cards.”

&gt; Copper is breaking out to new highs after consolidating for 15 years. The last time it did that it eventually gained more than 150%. Every time is different, but with the global economy soaring back and demand for copper not ending anytime soon, we expect this industrial metal to continue to lead.

&gt; The financial press has discussed the well-known “sell in May and go away” market saying, but did you know it actually starts on May 5th? As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, the middle part of May is historically quite weak for stocks as the broadly weaker period begins. The calendar, you could say, isn’t doing anyone any favors even if the economy still is.

&gt; # NASDAQ 100 Finds Support

&gt; Our go to leading market index indicator of late, the NASDAQ 100 (NDX), which is tracked by the widely held exchange traded fund (ETF) Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ), may have found some support on Wednesday in the big sell off near 13000. Actually, using our wide chisel-tip Sharpie we would draw this current near term support between the black line support levels in the 13000-13200 range on the accompanying chart.

&gt; While we still do not expect any major decline here, we do not foresee any major upside either over the next six months – the Worst Six Month of the year May-October. We zoomed in and updated a few lines and notations on the charts we presented in our May Outlook and in our NDX Uptrend Broken, Support Under Pressure blog post earlier this week.

&gt; We are rather comfortable with our timely April 22 Best Six Months Seasonal MACD Sell Signal and with our outlook for a more typical “Reposition in May” period. The Fed can print money faster than the market can decline and more fiscal stimulus is coming down the pike as well as continued fuel from pent-up pandemic demand.

&gt; Look for NASDAQ and NDX to rebound and lead the rally into early July through the rest of its Best Eight Months November-June and the historically strong first half of July in keeping with seasonal market patterns. Though, we do see resistance at the recent April highs near NDX 14000.

&gt; If we do break below this 13000 support level there is support at the uptrend line since the September/October lows around 12900 and 12750, which would be an 8-9% pullback from the April 16 14041.91 closing Doji candle high. Below that are the March lows 12200-12420 which would be an 11-13% correction.

&gt; In our view all the stimulus, pent-up demand and Fed money will prevent any major down draft, while seasonals, valuations, technicals, internals, sector rotation and sentiment will keep a lid on the upside most likely until the fall. Please enjoy a more normal summer.

&gt; # Door is Open For Developed International Stocks

&gt; We’ve warmed up to developed international stocks recently for several reasons. For one, the U.S. stock market has staged a tremendous rally—this week notwithstanding—since last March which has prompted us and others to start looking for other opportunities that aren’t pricing in so much optimism. Valuations, though not great timing tools, are more attractive in Europe and Japan. And we expect the US dollar to weaken which could boost non-US stock returns.

&gt; Another reason to take a closer look at international is the recent resurgence of value stocks. The developed international equity market (mainly Europe and Japan) is much more value-focused than the U.S. market, based on the MSCI EAFE Index and the S&amp;P 500 Index. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the relative performance of value stocks versus their growth counterparts has been well correlated to the relative performance of developed international stocks compared to those in the U.S. In other words, international tends to work when value works.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5.13.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “Should strong performance by value stocks continue—and we suspect it might—international stocks will have their best chance in over a decade to sustain outperformance,“ explained LPL Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. “The strength in cyclical value stocks such as financials, industrials and natural resources, coupled with tech sector weakness, gives European and Japanese markets a fighting chance of keeping up with the U.S. as those economies fully reopen.”

&gt; We can see how developed international stocks are more value-focused when looking at sector breakdowns for key indexes. As shown in the graphic below, the U.S. equity market (represented by the S&amp;P 500 Index) has a much higher technology sector allocation, making it a more growth-oriented index than the MSCI EAFE Index benchmark for developed international equities. If digital media (think Google and Facebook, which are categorized as communication services) and e-commerce (think Amazon, which is in consumer discretionary) are included in this sector comparison, the technology gap widens even further. In essence, for international to outperform, U.S. technology leadership needs to hand the baton over to cyclical value. That transition has been happening over the last couple months and very well could continue.

&gt; At this point the primary factor holding us back from upgrading our view of developed international stocks to neutral from our current negative view is the pandemic. As Europe and Japan fully reopen and see the accelerating economic growth that the U.S. is seeing now, those markets may be in an even better position to outperform. Until then, we maintain our slight preference for U.S. stocks over developed international.

&gt; # Bullish Sentiment Down Big

&gt; The past week has been one of the worst short term runs for the major indices of the past several months, and sentiment this week is reflecting that negative price action. Bullish sentiment as measured by the AAII weekly sentiment survey took a spill, dropping 7.8 percentage points to 36.5%. Whereas just over a month ago bullish sentiment hit a multi-year high at 56.9%, this week's reading was the lowest since the last week of October.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051321-AAII-Bull.png))**

&gt; The over 20 percentage point decline in that time was the biggest drop in a span of five weeks since a 22.73 percentage point decline in the five weeks ending February 8th, 2018. In the table below, we show the past 11 periods in which bullish sentiment fell by at least 20 percentage points in five weeks without another occurrence in at least a year. Overall, they have consistently preceded solid runs for the S&amp;P 500 with frequent moves higher that are on average larger than the norm. One and three months later have both seen the S&amp;P 500 trade higher 81.8% of the time and a half year to a full-year out has seen the index lower only one time (in 2007). Additionally, each of the prior instances since 2009 has been marked by the S&amp;P 500 trading higher across all time frames.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051321-AAII-Bull-Table-b.png))**

&gt; With bullish sentiment lower, bearish sentiment gained 3.9 percentage points. At 27%, it is at the highest level since early February though still a few percentage points above the historical average of around 30%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051321-AAII-Bear.png))**

&gt; That has resulted in the bull-bear spread dropping 11.7 points to 9.5. That is the first single-digit reading in the spread since the first week of February, but it still indicates that overall sentiment remains biased towards the bulls.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051321-AAII-BB-Spread.png))**

&gt; While bearish sentiment has only risen modestly, neutral sentiment is flying. After gaining another 4 percentage points this week, neutral sentiment hit the highest level since the second week of 2020. Similar to bullish sentiment, the move higher in neutral sentiment over the past few weeks has been one of the largest in roughly three years.

&gt; # ""Inflation"" Trends

&gt; You know it's getting bad when inflation starts to trend on Twitter, but that's where we find ourselves this morning with the terms '#GasShortage2021' and '#inflation' both trending on our Twitter feed.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051221-Inflation-twitter.png))**

&gt; On Google, the frequency of searches for the term inflation looks like it's on its own path straight to the moon.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051221-Inflation-trends.png))**

&gt; These real-time indicators of concerns over inflation also manifested themselves in the 'official' inflation data this morning as y/y CPI surged to 4.2%, eclipsing the prior post-financial crisis highs. Not only that, but if CPI is unchanged on a m/m basis in May (highly unlikely), the y/y reading will climb to 4.3% given the decline last May. If we assume that May's m/m change is the same as the average so far this year, it would imply a 4.8% y/y change.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051221-CPI-SInce-2010.png))**

&gt; Even assuming that inflation only rises at the average m/m rate so far this year may be conservative at this point. That's because the rate of increase on a m/m basis has now accelerated for six straight months. Going all the way back to the 1940s there's never been a streak that long. Just for some perspective, if CPI increases by the same rate in May as it did in April, headline CPI will clock in at 5.1%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051221-InflationStreaks.png))**

&gt; While the current level of CPI looks very high relative to the post-financial crisis period, from a longer-term perspective, it still has yet to show signs of breaking out from its thirty-year range. Based on the pain from prior spikes, let's hope it stays that way.

&gt; # Small Businesses Growingly Concerned About Inflation

&gt; In today's Morning Lineup, we covered some of the details of this morning's release of the NFIB's monthly survey on small business sentiment. The survey showed rising prices, tight labor market conditions, and overall improving demand.

&gt; The NFIB also surveys businesses on what they consider to be their single most important issues. For the majority of businesses, cost or quality of labor and government requirements or taxes are the most prevalent. In total, 64% of businesses reported one of these as the biggest problem. Meanwhile, the percentage of businesses reporting weak sales as the most pressing issue continues to fall which is indicative of a further recovery in demand. One other interesting decline was in the issue of competition from 'big business'. Only 7% of businesses reported this as their biggest problem which is the lowest reading since October 2017. While up 1 percentage point in April, cost or availability of insurance is also still around some of the lowest levels of the past decade. While that mention of costs has ticked only slightly higher similar to the cost of labor which rose 1 percentage point in April, inflation more broadly is increasingly on the minds of small businesses. 6% of businesses reported higher prices as the biggest issue which is triple the reading from February and is the highest level since August 2013.Click here to view Bespoke's premium membership options for our best research available.

CryptoCurrency,Debunking the Marketcap myth,"Analysis of the potential market capitalization of cryptocurrencies is fundamentally flawed because it relies on a paradigm that will be challenged and replaced by the very success of crypto adoption.

We live in a world that is not yet globalized when it comes to macroeconomics, because economic/trading treaties and monetary policy are both centralized at Government level.

The value of an economy is expressed through its fiat currency, its exchange rates to other countries' fiat, and generally perceived by the marketcap of their stock exchanges, where the value of an economy is more or less expressed through the value of its top enterprises.

The foreseeable future: Cryptocurrencies will replace this because they're worldwide currencies. An American, a Dutchman, and a Japanese man can all be payed in crypto, buy their services/products in crypto, and presumably be able to pay their taxes in crypto, in complete disregard of their country's fiat.

This last point is what will settle it all. It's almost unthinkable for governments to let go of their power to control their economy through changes in monetary policy. So the regulation of cryptocurrencies yet to be defined will indeed be the base to the new paradigm of ""value expressed through currency"", at that point at a global scale.

Back to marketcap: if cryptos come to represent a significant amount of both the wealth and value creation worldwide, its market cap will much more likely reach $100 than $10 trillion.

Cryptos are in their infancy. We're early adopters in a sense, but there's already so many of us that a future without crypto seems impossible. And the very success of crypto will change the paradigm of value expression.",cryptocurrency

retirement,D0 we postpone retirement because it's followed by death ?,"I plan to retire in 20 months, no reservations, i have two boys at home and i plan to devote the next decade to sending them out into the world.

But I see this hesitation that i see on a lot of my peers, they clearly have enough money (federal, pension plus TSP) and they keep working without much enjoyment.

So it occurred to me, looking back over my life (which has been a blast) that the next life milestone is death.   That doesn't bother me, it just drives me to do more faster.  BUt i imagine a lot of people who are not wired like me, get really  hung up on that.

personalfinance,Help with massachussetts tax filing extension,"Hello! I am a non resident and filed my taxes with Sprintax. The federal tax report was instant and I already put it in the mail. The state tax report however “needs manual preparation by the company”. Which I don’t understand but apparently that’s how it is. I don’t want to file late, but apparently have to wait a few days for the state tax report. How do I file an extension? I have no problem paying if I owe something, but simply don’t know if and how much I owe. I googled it, but the extension form is only possible to fill out if I already had a previous tax return in massachussetts. I understood that there is an automatic extension if you don’t owe the irs, I do owed federal tax and therefore think that this is also the case for ma (is there an easy way to calculate this quickly?).

Any help is appreciated! Thank you!",finance

personalfinance,"I would like advice on a car buying decision, please.","My wife and I would like to buy a larger vehicle because we have three young kids and her mom comes with us to a lot of places that we go, traveling, road trips, etc. Neither of our current vehicles will accommodate all six of us.  

The last car I bought was my current one, a 2004 Acura TL, for $12,700 cash, no financing. I’ve had it for about 9 years and it’s been the best car I’ve ever owned, hardly any issues other than regular service. Ideally I would buy another car with cash again but I think to get what we want, now that we have a larger family, we will have to finance a portion of it. 

We want a vehicle that has:
Third-row seating
AWD / 4-wheel drive (we live in a region with lots of wet and snowy weather)

I’ve owned Hondas/Acuras my whole life and our current Toyota has been amazing, so my top choices would be a Honda Pilot, Toyota Highlander, or Acura MDX (all three about the same in price, since we would look for the higher trim packages, leather, sunroof, etc, in the Honda or Toyota). 

I was thinking of buying a used vehicle with under 60,000 miles with a budget of $25,000 total including all taxes and fees, putting $15,000 as a down payment and financing $10,000 over 60 months at a 2.99% interest rate (I’m conditionally preapproved through PenFed). That would put the monthly payments at $180. But it would mostly deplete our savings. 

To get the 2.99 rate at 60 months I have to borrow at least $10k, so if I go less than $25k for the vehicle, I would put less than $15k for the down payment—one vehicle I was considering came out to $23,000 total, so I would put $13,000 down and keep the other $2,000 in the bank. 

Here is our situation: 

$17,000 in savings

No CC debt 

No car payments

Student loan debt around $10k for each of us, paying about $150/month on each ($300/month total)

Mortgage payment $1,079/month 

Income: $6,400 net take-home monthly income after insurance, taxes, etc. 

Our retirement funds/401k:

$42k mine

$48k wife’s

Currently own two vehicles:

2004 Acura TL with 168k miles

2008 Toyota Rav4 with 99k miles 

I was planning to sell the 2004 TL but I am not sure how much I can realistically get for it at this point, and since it’s paid off, I might just keep it and drive it until it’s undriveable. If I sold it, maybe I could get $2k? 

Just wondering if anyone has any thoughts or advice on what I should do. We definitely need a larger vehicle, but if I lower the budget much more, whatever we get will have significant mileage on it, and we need this to carry our family for probably 7-8 years.",finance
CryptoCurrency,Hey YOU,"If you’ve been lurking on this sub and aren’t invested into any crypto and are still skeptical of it all let me break some things down. “Digital money isn’t real”, people say this because it isn’t tangible but if you look at China they’ve already introduced their digital yuan. The US is beta testing their own digital currency this summer. So when your money becomes digital you’ll realize that digital money is real money. Second thing is that the FED along with other countries have created an outrageous amount of money in the past year. If you want to protect your purchasing power ur better off holding at least some crypto than dollars IMO. There are so many other reasons to invest in crypto but these are just two of the glaring reasons why. IMO Cryptocurrency is inevitable and it’s just a matter of when and not if it’ll displace the current financial system.",cryptocurrency
Bitcoin,Stay Calm and HODL,"Let's remember the fundamental truths:

3. Traditional asset classes at record valuations

   2. Real estate rental income does not match real estate prices
   3. Bonds prices are artificially propped up
4. Crypto is a unique asset class and Bitcoin is the one with the biggest brand and institutional acceptance

Traditional and non-traditional asset classes will fluctuate over time.  Stay diversified.  Invest only money you don't need.  Keep some dry powder so you can take advantage of any pullbacks.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Question about refinancing,"Hello everyone. I was hoping to get some opinions regarding refinancing our house. Currently we are 3 years into our mortgage where we pay $2500/month on our 30 year mortgage ($2300 is due but we overpay) and are looking at two refinancing options: 
15yr 2.00% rate, $2040 principal and interest, about $2750 closing costs + escrow. 
30yr we are at 2.75%, $1295 principal/interest payment, about $1k closing costs + escrows.
The idea of paying less for a 15 year seems the obvious choice but I I’ve the following factors to consider:
My wife is starting grad school and will most likely go to part time. This will result in a 25% drop in our income.
Cost of her grad school will be about 100k over 3 years. Most likely aid through federal loans.
Our current home is very much a starter home and we will likely want to move in 3-5 years.
There is a chance during grad school she will need to stop working entirely and will need to go onto my health insurance. This will be about 300/ month. 
My take home income is about 57k a year after taxes.",finance

personalfinance,All sorts of confused regarding form 1098-T; is the amount on box 5 wrong?,"So I'm doing the taxes for my parents. My mother was at least a half-time student for 2020 and she also had a (W-2) job. I'm looking at the form 1098-T from her school because she received more grants (box 5) than qualifying education expenses (box1). Box 5 reports just the amount of the Federal Pell Grant for 2020 but it doesn't include the Federal SEOG. I read that the school doesn't have any reporting requirements regarding the Federal SEOG which explains why it's not included in box 5. Since the amount in box 5 is greater than the amount in box 1, the difference is considered income and must be reported.

UPDATE: Apparently the school did include the FSEOG as well as the FSEOG amount from fall 2019. So basically in 2019 they didn't report the FSEOG for fall 2019 but they includes it in the 2020 1098-T but they didn't include the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund grant she got and based on what I read, it's not supposed to be reported but my question still stands whether I include the HEERF as part of the income calculation or not

UPDATE 2: Ok this is getting more complicated now. Apparently FSEOG and HEERF under the CARES act are not taxable nor should they be included in your income. So does that mean that if all scholarships and grants (box 5) consists of Federal Pell Grant + FSEOG, only the FPG amount should be included because the FSEOG is under the CARES act?

UPDATE 3: This is a breakdown of the financial aid she received in 2020:

* Federal Pell Grant = 3136
* FSEOG = 300
* HEERF = 450

The HEERF is not reported in box 5 but the Pell grant and the FSEOG are as well as the FSEOG from fall 2019. I really don't understand this. Based on what I'm reading online, FSEOG and HEERF are not taxable income and should not be reported so only the FPG portion should be in box 5. It could be that the school issued the 1098-T before official guidance from the IRS came out but I really don't know what to do here.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

1. When calculating the difference between the two amounts, do I adjust the amount in box 5 to include the Federal SEOG or just use the amount that's in the box?
2. Box 7 is also checked (""includes amounts for an academic period beginning Jan - Mar 2021""). I looked at her account on the school's website and the amount in box 1 includes everything that was paid in 2020 and nothing in 2021 so I don't understand why box 7 would be checked. The financial aid office is closed (weekend) and I can call them on Monday (filing deadline) but I'd rather get it all done today so I'm assuming if box 7 was checked by mistake, I shouldn't report it as checked on the tax preparing software?

personalfinance,"Looking for alternatives to working as a mailman. Love the exercise + day-job structure, but the hours are so unpredictable so am missing out on teaching music for much higher pay.","# I'm seeking advice on behalf of my husband.  He has been a mail carrier for the USPS since Sept 2020, and is considered a ""CCA"", which basically means he does the same work as a mailman, but doesn't yet qualify for full benefits/pay.  Once he hits his 2-yr mark, he will qualify for these.  Currently his pay is ~17.50/hr, and he works 35-45 hrs/wk.

He really likes the work (the exercise, going about his route on his own, talking to people as he delivers their mail, etc.).  For his whole adult life pre-Covid, he has been a professional musician in a niche genre, and as it turns out, the consistency of having a ""day job"" type schedule has been mostly really good for him.  BUT, the main drawback of this job is the completely unpredictable schedule.  Similar to a retail job, the schedule is posted a week or two in advance for the following week, and his one day off per week always rotates randomly.  Also, at any moment, he can get called in on his day(s) off, kept later than planned, etc.  This means it's very difficult to plan anything outside of work.  The downside is that now, even though he has the ability to teach music lessons on Zoom and plenty of students he could teach (for $50/hr), he can never predict his schedule so is not able to teach lessons.  

We thought we'd use the time during the pandemic to experiment with him getting a day job, since performing/traveling to teach music was put on hold with Covid.  There are a lot of things about the job that are great for him, including that we now look much better to a bank for mortgage purposes (of course the market is now out of reach) but it means he is missing out on the opportunity to do 10 or so hours a week of much higher paying work (teaching music) because the schedule is so unpredictable.  

My question: does anyone have suggestions for jobs that might be good alternatives?  He only has a GED, so prior to working for the USPS, he always thought he'd have a hard time finding any kind of day job.  Are there jobs we aren't thinking of that have good benefits, would use the skills/dependability/work ethic he's demonstrated at the USPS, but would have predictable hours?  Are there federal or state type jobs like the USPS that we're just not thinking of?  

Thanks so much for any ideas!",finance

* I never signed for any utility bills under my name (since I never had any permanent housing).

**If I don't have to file my 2020 tax return as a CA resident, are there any benefits to me filing as a part year resident?** I would be filing as a single filer.

I may potentially try to work from WA in the future by asking my employer to switch me to a WA payroll. I've heard that CA has a hard time letting go of people, so if I never establish any expectation of being a CA resident, maybe it will be easier to escape CA's clutches?

For completion's sake, during 2020, I lived, roughly:

* 5.5 months in California
* 4 months in Canada
* 1.5 months in NY (crashing at a friend's)
* 1 month in WA (sublease/airbnb)

I have been living in WA since the end of 2020 and am currently still in WA. Again, no permanent housing, just a few short term subleases.

Given that I don't really have any strong residential ties to any state, is it fine for me to file my federal return as a resident but my state return as a partial year resident of CA? Since I do not have any source of income other than my California based employer, I figure I don't need to file a WA or NY return.",finance

What did I do with that extra $1000+ per month? Kids, school, food, medicine, mortgage, some small fun and some of it even got invested. This year I probably was only able to invest about $2000 of it, which thanks to some weird market antics I doubled.

CryptoCurrency,How to Make More Money Off Staking Than Your Annual Salary - Challenge (Currently Using Pancakeswap &amp; Pancake Bunny),"# CHALLENGE: I’M STAKING HALF OF WHAT I MAKE IN A YEAR TO TRY AND MAKE MORE THAN MY ANNUAL SALARY

# BASIC EXAMPLE:

You make $40,000/YR

The Goal - Stake $20,000 and make an additional $40,000

So Total Assets equals $60,000 at the End of Year

# THE MATH:

Target Annual Percentage Rate (APR) = 110% (You need to maintain 110% or better) to achieve this goal.

If you average 110% APR on your investment over the year that will = 199.9201% (Rounding up to 200%) Annual Percentage Yield (APY) with daily compounding your earnings.

A 200% APY means your interest equals 2x your investment.

If you want to check my math here is a link to a handy Compound Interest Calculator - [https://financial-calculators.com/compound-interest-calculator](https://financial-calculators.com/compound-interest-calculator)

NOTE - To cover daily fees for reinvesting your earning I target at least 1 extra percentage point and leverage the cheap fees on the Binance Smart Chain (111%) if you do this on the Ethereum Network count on needing to offset much higher fees.

# WHAT IS WORKING SO FAR:

    Current Setup:
    50% OF FUNDS:
    - Earning 95% APR
    - PancakeBunny CAKE Pool
    - Auto Compounding - but only the CAKE so still needs to be compounded daily
    - Earning CAKE and BUNNY
    
    50% OF FUNDS:
    Earning 144% APR
    Pancake Bunny -BUNNY Pool
    Earning WBNB used to buy Bunny or CAKE daily to compound and even out pools.

Combined APR = **119.5%**

NOTE - Pools APR fluctuates daily but has maintained above target 110% Goal

# WHY DID I PICK THESE INVESTMENTS:

I believe the CAKE coin has more short term upside in price than BUNNY so I am splitting half on CAKE with the lower interest rate and half on BUNNY to maintain my target APR.

I believe these may be viable options until Eth 2.0 is imminent. Cardano (ADA) smart contracts will also likely be a disruptor so I am watching that carefully. There is a good chance as Eth 2.0 and Cardano inevitably see the launch of new AMM (Automated Market Makers) and dApps (decentralized Apps) that I will explore for competitive APRs and secure underlying assets. I have already DCA into ADA for a while in anticipation of having to possibly sell off CAKE and BUNNY at some point and move to a Cardano AMM

NOTE: I don’t chase the 1000% plus pools and farms… they ARE real but usually require buying a lot of a coin I don’t trust, the other issue is those high APR’s are usually only introductory and after a day or two it usually drops below what I am already achieving. Basically it is too much to manage and adds risk.

# RISKS:

There are of course tons of risks to this challenge. I am not a financial advisor and of course you should DYOR

\#1 - Personally I am avoiding staking Liquidity Pairs to avoid Impermanent Loss - Crypto is an inherently volatile space and I feel it will be too much to manage against impermanent loss if I am running multiple LP Farms. If you don’t know what Impermanent loss is Google it, it is basically when the two Assets you have tied together in a Liquidity pool start to move in opposite directions of each other it can cause you to lose money. LP’s may be my only option at some point to continue to hit target APR.

\#2 Staking an asset that loses value - If your farm is making you the targeted 110% but the underlying asset keeps losing value and won’t rebound… You could easily lose money.

\#3 Will I be able to find opportunities to stake at/over 110% for an entire year?

\#4 You need to compound daily to hit targets - some options have auto compounding, some do not - this will take a bit of maintenace.

\#5 You will likely have to move investments as the DeFi Space matures and new options influence the market (Cardano, Matic, Eth2.0). This is less about perfectly timing the market (cause that’s impossible) and more about following the higher APR’s around that are founded in coins you have decided you can somewhat trust.

\#6 More adoption in DeFi likely equals lower APR’s but more security… this may be the last year this is possible - Who knows?!?

\#7 Learn how to use Bridges, transfers, transactions…etc. Really, Really Well. There are countless complaints out there of failed transactions, screwed up transfers, cash outs timing out….etc. I have actually had almost no issues but you have to learn how to up your gas fee during massive SHIB selloffs (from like 12 cents to 35 cents). You have to understand how to bridge ERC20 tokens back and forth to the Binance Smart Chain using tools like MetaMask (this seems overwhelmingly hard at first but is actually easy…. Watch a YouTube tutorial). You need to make an excel sheet to track for taxes… and on and on…. There will always be something that 1M people are freaking out about on why this stuff is Hard but really it just takes a bit of research and then you realize it is pretty simple and works pretty well… The risks remain though… Never invest money you can’t afford to lose.

# THE RESULTS SO FAR:

1.5 Months in - I have easily maintained between 114% - 119% APR so I am ahead of schedule on interest earnings.  I am make more on Staking than I do on my salary. I have more than doubled my income for the last month.

One thing to Understand is if you aren't in the position to let all that money ride and actually need more monthly passive income... instead of compounding your earnings you could cash them out monthly ( after doing daily compounding) and you would still achieve a \~50%+ bonus on top of your annual income.

If you like this… I will get Monthly updates out on progress and moves. Hopefully this was helpful to someone that also understands the risks. Thanks for being a great community.",cryptocurrency

My credit score is 730 his is 690 because it went down due to the recent house and car loan. But my length of credit history is only 1 year and 6 months whereas he has consistently built credit for 5 years. 

Since we’re not married I basically pay rent to him $500 a month. Even though my pay is much lower my living expenses are very low with work being close I only spend $25 a month on gas and $200 for food. After all living expenses including 401K I’m able to save $650 a month to spend on whatever I want. 

Me and my boyfriend want our dream home theater setup for $35K and would like to get a personal loan for it. We can both easily afford to pay up to $350 each. 

Through my credit union who I have good history with my car loan and credit card, is it better to apply for the loan myself, or to have my BF co-sign it with his lower credit score or to have him be a joint borrower? 

We’ve thought about this extensively and it’s what we both want and $350 a month to get our dream theater setup right away while we’re young is worth it to us even with a higher interest rate as long as it’s not crazy high like over 10%. 

10% would mean only paying $3500 in interest total over the course of paying $650 a month for 5 years for the $35K loan.

economy,The current Situation of the stock market,"Personally, i feel that this is a unprecedented period in history, after being locked up for almost a year, most of the world is finally getting back on it’s feet, the 3 major indexes in the US have surpassed the levels we were at back in 2019. In my opinion this is not justified because, even though some tech companies did benefit greatly from the pandemic, most companies probably aren’t worth the 30+ P/E Ratio they are sitting at right now. It feels like people who invest their money (me included) are doing it because of the FOMO on last year’s massive gains, hoping that it will continue. 

Here’s my what I think on what’s happening to the stock market:

- Stock prices have been inflated due to quantitative easing which has caused rampant speculation.
- As more of the economy has finally reopened, companies that were closed during the pandemic are finally able to make money again. This has lead to massive gains as people rush to buy stocks that they think are going to benefit from the economy reopening.

However I feel that the future is quite bleak after this initial phase of growth, because of the following reasons:
- Rising inflation because of the quantitative easing measures that the government has enacted, increased consumer spending while the supply side is trying catching up will inevitably lead to buyers outbidding each other
- Inflation would lead to the tapering of quantitative easing and interest rates rising.
- Interest rates rising would in turn mean that businesses are now borrowing less money, which would in turn lead to slower growth popping the bubble we are in right now.
- Also of concern is the new COVID 19 strain from India, I live in Singapore with some of the COVID-19 regulations and recently there have been new clusters appearing due to the increased infectiousness of this strain. Although the vaccine will help reduce the fatality of the disease, It seems that you still can be infected and spread it to other people. I think that the CDC removing masks regulations on vaccinated people is a mistake and if no measures are implemented to slow down this down right now, future lockdowns would be inevitable.

In conclusion, I think the market is a particularly precarious and dangerous position right now, while there is still a bit of room to grow, a major correction would probably be in order by next year. I think However do take my opinions with a grain of salt, this is just my opinion on the state that the market is in. Please do tell me how you feel about the current situation of the stock market and what’s going to happen!

personalfinance,Student Loan Repayment Strategy - International,"Hi, 

I hope you are having a great day.

I just had this question regarding a loan repayment strategy. 

I took a student loan from my home country, India from HDFC credila which gave me an interest rate of 12% for a loan of approximately 30k and since, it was an unsecured loan, the rate of interest I found was pretty high but I still glad that I got this opportunity to take and study in Canada. 

I have finished my education in Canada now and I got a job and I am earning 75k. 

I was checking the websites for CIBC or other loan providers and thinking of getting a personal loan or line of credit which as advertised will be approximately under 3% or let's say under 6% for the sake of it. I feel that if I take a personal loan and pay off my student loan in my home country at once and then pay off the personal loan here on monthly basis. I think of two advantages :   


1. I am avoiding high-interest rates which otherwise, I would be paying at 12% but now it will be reduced to 6%. 
2. Since I'll be taking a loan in Canada, it will help me build a credit history which I think would be a great thing to do since I don't have much of it. 

I was wondering if I am missing something or is this a decent strategy. 

Any help or follow-up questions, I am open to answer but I am extremely new to this. I really appreciate any advice on this.",finance

This is my situation: wife and I are relatively high earners (I’m $130K, she’s just got a raise to $100K, with some potential for side income (earned ~$10K in 2020)), both 29, in a HCOL. After tax after retirement income is about $11K/month. Our rent is $2.5K/month for a 2 bed (no roommates, not an option either), we can probably live off another $1.5K if pretty strict (a little more than in Covid, when we had no expenses), so $4K in monthly expenses total. All to say we have $7K/month to put to work towards our goals. 

Here’s the challenge. We’d love to start a family soon (start trying in the next year or so) for personal and biological reasons. That will carry with it significant costs—a great post on r/newparent (I think) estimated 10K in set up costs, and $2-3K/month for child care, food etc (please let me know if this is an underestimate), which will make it harder to save for a down payment. But if we want a decent home in our HCOL with 4 bedrooms (we’d like to have 2-3 kids) it will cost us $800K at the very least, probably closer to $1M

Add on top we have $210K in student loans (paid down $50K from $260K in 2020; we both finished graduate school in 2019). $80K of this is refi-d at 3%, $130K is fed at 6%+ (currently 0% forbearance)

We also have $58K saved (literally everything, not counting retirement savings)

My questions: Do we try to pay down the debt first? Do we save for a down payment? Do we try to have 1 kid now while we’re young and throw what’s left over each month to debt or home savings? It feels like we can only pick 2 of the 3, but any choice comes with tradeoffs 

Last thing is we are fine with no frills. We drive a beater of a car, are fine not taking crazy vacations, want to send kids when we have them to public schools, etc

Bitcoin,What's worse than Bitcoin's energy consumption?,"What's worse - Bitcoin's energy consumption or....

The dollar staying the world reserve currency? This is the reason Bitcoin's energy consumption argument is dead in the water.

Anyone who understands Bitcoin at a deeper level than 'oh I just throw my money into any crypto and I pull out way more cash than I put in! Memecoin to the Moon!!!!11', understands that the goal of Bitcoin consuming this much energy is to propel it into global reserve currency status.

Why is this such a massive benefit over the dollar being the world reserve currency?

Our modern culture has never known a monetary medium that wasn't deflationary.

Let that sink in for a second.

Maybe you don't understand why an inflationary currency is bad. It's directly led to unsustainable borrowing, extraction of Earth's natural resources, and ignoring what may come tomorrow for gaining whatever we feel like we 'need' (read '*want*') today.

This has led to climate change, endless wars, and our instant gratification, throwaway, cutthroat capitalist culture that has fed off of the inflationary system in place for a hundred years.

How does Bitcoin fix this?

When you have a disinflationary reserve currency, you put off what you could spend today in hopes for a better tomorrow. Enough people start thinking this way, and the value held grows and grows, and the better tomorrow becomes reality because governments can't fund wars by printing money, and debt is no longer possible because no one in their right mind would hand out loans against a constantly increasing in value asset.

All these people buying meme coins and coins moving to a untested PoS system don't understand why the energy needed for bitcoin is so important to Bitcoin's success. It threatens the global establishment. No other coin can do this. They are uninteresting because they can be taken over by bad actors much more easily than Bitcoin can precisely because they don't have the PoW Bitcoin does.

Bitcoin's hashrate has been increasing thoughout this FUD to an all time high of 180 exahashes. If you don't get what that means on the most macro of scales, then you're running out of purchasing power every day until you do.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,"(PART 1/2): Non-intuitive crypto concepts: Decentralized Justice, and how it can facilitate Universal Basic Income and decentralized social media.","Hi r/Cryptocurrency! This week I had to go pretty deep into a topic that I think doesn't get discussed nearly enough in our community, and I thought I could drop some of my notes and findings in here.

Over the last months, I see that this sub became populated by lots of new people who tend to care about Elon Musk, prices, DOGE, and MOONs perhaps too much. However, I don't see nearly enough discussion and educational materials about what will really decide whether we all change the world (and maybe get rich) or not: The *technology*.

So, I'd like to contribute my little grain of sand towards teaching you about a rad ass concept, **Decentralized Justice**.

## What's the fucking deal with Decentralized Justice?

Decentralized Justice is perhaps one of the noblest use cases for blockchain technology. Just a few of its possible applications are:

* Solving international disputes.
* Executing and applying for insurance.
* Decentralizing tech giants and making their systems fairer.
* Protecting freelancers.
* Enabling permissionless token listings.
* Content moderation in decentralized social media.
* Solving Intellectual Property claims without the need to train and maintain AI.

Of course, these are all pretty big claims, and you're on Reddit, not a textbook, so I won't go over in detail about every single use case. For in-depth explanations, you can go to the whitepapers of [Kleros](http://kleros.io/) or [Jur](http://jur.io/), the two biggest competitors in this space. For now, let us concentrate on the most important part of the equation before we circle back to immediate use cases.

## Smart contracts and machines are not enough.

In blockchain land, we love to pretend that everything's going to be solved by decentralized machines running automated programs based on magic Internet money. And hey, for the most part, that actually holds up! As we've seen with Uniswap's V3 launch, smart contracts are great for implementing near-perfect efficiency in markets and in anything that we can automate.

And, with oracles taking care of feeding the machines more and more data, we will likely be able to expand what we can automate further and further as years go by.

However, some things machines are just not good at. A machine can beat you in a finite game with well-defined rules and a limited number of possibilities (even if they seem far too great for your human mind), such as chess, but it has trouble noticing whether the furry mammal sitting on your lap, meowing, and that eats cat food, is a cat or the latest physical print of David Foster Wallace's *The Infinite Jest.* It takes tremendous effort, development, and it is crazy expensive to develop AI to do things that humans can do in seconds, such as:

* Detect whether a face with a shadow or reflection projected over it is actually human.
* Assess evidence to determine whether one party of a freelancing contract was treated poorly or received low-quality work.
* Determine whether a picture posted on Twitter should be classified as gore or not.
* Figure out whether you're committing intellectual property theft or covering a piece of music.

Hence, companies (and even governments) have no other option but to hire humans to perform these tasks.

## And that's how they get you! If a company hires an arbitrator, chances are that they will have their employer's interests in mind, not fairness.

Now we've gotten to the juicy part. Just as you suspected, the billionaires and centralized systems are fucking us over. In fact, a lot of problems arise from centralized arbitration systems:

* **It's inefficient.** When's the last time you heard about a company hiring more employees than necessary to make sure they'll be able to keep up with support tickets? What often happens is that these tickets will create a queue that can span for months on end (just go to r/Binance if you don't believe me!)
* **It's biased.** We covered this before. On a dispute that's a close call between who's right, you or Amazon, an Amazon arbitrator has an incentive to screw you rather than their employer.
* **It's overly bureaucratic.** Arbitrators are often incentivized to enforce the playbook to its every word, not to exercise common sense.
* **It's reliant on human failure.** When you only have one arbitrator, he or she could be having a bad day, misjudge, or not like you and fail incorrectly against you.

## I know what you're thinking now: That's all (for the most part) reasonable, but how does crypto solve this?

If it seems like I've been beating around the bush too long before getting to an actual Decentralized Justice explanation, it's because once you understand the fundamentals, then you can deduce all the possible use cases from one example.

Let's say I, Carlos, come up with an idea for a decentralized video website to combat the censorship of the single mainstream solution. I do an ICO, IDO, SHO, or whatever the cool kids are doing nowadays, and I raise 69 million dollars to build it on the blockchain so that it's self-governed. Obviously, I call it **MeTube**.

Obviously, even if I have a pretty cool MOON-like system to pay people for getting likes, the people who have a higher likelihood of joining this site are... well, people who want to post shit that wouldn't fly elsewhere. Basically, I'd get the crew that's banned from Youtube, both the ones that got outright censored for no reason and the ones posting dark stuff. However, I'd like MeTube not to allow graphic content. That's the only rule. You can say what you want, be as extreme in your views as you can, and even infringe copyright law. But no graphic stuff in MeTube, since it conflicts our values.

**Now, I'm in a dilemma:** With this being a centralized site, I don't want it to be run like a company. I don't want to hire moderators, pay them, or have to be looking at it all the time. Ideally, I wouldn't even *WANT* to give individuals the power to remove stuff since that could lead down censorship and centralization lane.

## What do I do? I connect to Decentralized Justice.

But hey, I'll finish telling you the tale another day. It's been over 1,000 words, it's 3 AM, and I would ideally like to see if you guys like this kind of posts before spending another 2 hours telling you all the nitty-gritty on Decentralized Justice and how it's gonna save the fucking planet. If you do, let me know in the comments! Even if only a couple of people find this helpful, I'll still finish this up on Monday and add the link to this thread. If you'd like me to remind you, let me know and I will :)

investing,"S&amp;P 500, Realty Income, and S&amp;P 500 Long Duration","Below is a simple backtest from 2016-2021, without rebalancing, of the passive ETF VOO, the equity REIT O, and the mutual fund PSLDX. We all know of the first two entries, and the third is a fund that holds the S&amp;P along with a complex array of derivatives. 

[https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=2016&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2021&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=0&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;showYield=true&amp;showFactors=false&amp;factorModel=3&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=VOO&amp;allocation1\_1=100&amp;symbol2=O&amp;allocation2\_2=100&amp;symbol3=PSLDX&amp;allocation3\_3=100](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=2016&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2021&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=0&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;showYield=true&amp;showFactors=false&amp;factorModel=3&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=VOO&amp;allocation1_1=100&amp;symbol2=O&amp;allocation2_2=100&amp;symbol3=PSLDX&amp;allocation3_3=100)

The outperformance of PSLDX is pretty clear. I am not very familiar with its methodology, but I did some reading and encountered the opinion its outperformance may not last due to a potential rise of interest rates. So I looked at a couple of other metrics--please keep in mind I don't know much about the bond market overall and would be happy to learn I have examined things incorrectly. 

I chose 2016 because it captured when the Federal Fund Rate started to meaningfully rise (they also started to rise in 2015, but I chose a nice 5 year slice). They increased steadily into 2019, then plateaued a bit, then of course were struck down by covid.

[https://www.macrotrends.net/2015/fed-funds-rate-historical-chart](https://www.macrotrends.net/2015/fed-funds-rate-historical-chart)

Next I looked into the daily treasury yield curve rates from this period. The 10 Year rate fluctuated steadily all throughout 2016 but ultimately ended the year higher. It fluctuated similarly through 2017, ending very slightly lower. It increased during most of 2018, then only ended slightly higher by the end of the year. It lowered through the end of 2019.  It ended much lower by 2020. And through today it is higher than in 2020, but still much lower than it has been in years. 

[https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/pages/TextView.aspx?data=yieldYear&amp;year=2016](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/pages/TextView.aspx?data=yieldYear&amp;year=2016)

Below is a plot of the dividends paid from PSLDX, where all the gains are to be had.

[https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PSLDX/dividends/history](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PSLDX/dividends/history)

You'll notice the higher dividend payouts tend to correspond to where the higher interest rates are plotted. Granted, the fund holds the S&amp;P, so its outperformance can in part be explained by the general rise of the S&amp;P 500 equities since 2016. But, I did not find where higher interest rates pose a risk to its performance. I also noticed its highest-ever dividend payout was in 2013, where the federal funds rate was miniscule and the 10 Year increased from 1.86 to 3.04 by the end of the year. And even when interest rates are very low, say from 2020-2021, the fund still outperforms the S&amp;P ETF listed, much less our favorite REIT. O, I can forgive, since I believe in its long term success. 

[https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio#analysisResults](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio#analysisResults)

It appears the fund generates a great deal of alpha the higher interest rates become. It also generates alpha when interest rates are low. Drawdowns can indeed be high, so if one were to invest in the fund, it is likely best to put money into it after it has experienced a drawdown, or simply do what investors should do and put money into it that you don't plan on using for many years. 

The share price is low--this is common with many mutual funds. Someone recently mentioned that as a drawback to it... yes, it is lower than the 10 dollar price in 2007... but I think if you understand this is a particular sort of fund and not some silly low budget penny stock, the difference is clear. It is a volatile fund, yet appears to have an overall stability over time, with extreme dividend payouts. While I think broad market ETFs are great for capturing the mood of the overall corporate economy, the more I read about this particular fund, the more I find it to be a good choice for outperformance over a multi-year period. People worry about so many things: expense ratios, volatility, weird methodology. Yet, total returns tend to present their own strong argument for an investment. 

It appears to benefit from higher interest rates, and also does fine with lower interest rates. That is what I find to be especially interesting (ha). It's not a 3x leveraged daily fund subject to decay or anything like that, to my knowledge. It may even be simpler than your average PIMCO CEF.  

I plan on trying to learn more about the fund before I actually put money into it, since I want a firmer grasp of its mechanics and especially want to determine if it can maintain its performance over more time. In the meantime, I think it's overlooked by everyone but niche investors. Plenty of garbage tickers are passed around on Reddit (hello bizarre mortgage REITs that obviously destroy value over time and fraudulent SPACs) but there is little popular information on this fund which is still kicking out solid performance since the Great Recession when derivatives really were the devil. 

Anyway when I post on Reddit, I do so to learn. I very recently posted about the fund here--this was before I looked at interest rates and how they may correlate with it. I am becoming more convinced it is a good investment and would like to know arguments against it beyond the fact it's more complex than a simple passive ETF.",finance

Bitcoin (from \~2020) and Dogecoin (from \~2060) have a lower inflation than the Fed's US dollar inflation target (2%).

It got me thinking about inflation a bit more. What's so bad about low inflation?

Inflation means that your money has less purchasing today than it had yesterday. Nobody likes that, but the consequence is that you spend your money, which seems good to me. It is good for adoption and you prevent people from only HODLing and other people from FOMO buying in.

I think there is too much of a focus on the store of value component of money and too little on the means of exchange. Currently there is too much HODL and speculation and too little just using it to buy stuff. To shift this focus, there should be a crypto currency with a built-in constantly low inflation per year (maybe it already exists idk?)",cryptocurrency

No one has any idea if Binance will turn over its clients for IRS tax evasion fraud. 

People have said that bitcoin can reach to 100k but I don't see that in the near future. In fact, it has been factually proven that the coin is highly unstable once it reaches $1 trillion in market cap. From February through May it has hovered in the 50k to 58k range for the majority.

Could a major reversal by the Fed on money printing and a subsequent quick raise in interest rates be the worst outcome for Bitcoin? 

This would probably make institutions and non coiners rethink their treasury allocations if the dollar offered a greater, less volatile return...

However, the current S&amp;P yield is around 2%. If central banks raise interest rates to tame inflation, valuation of bonds and stocks will have to ajust to offer a higher yield. So if the 10 year US bond yields reach 3-4%, you can’t justify a 2% yield on S&amp;P considering it’s a riskier asset. So current stocks valuations should fall. But then, when the S&amp;P valuation is adjusted, it would be the perfect timing to buy/hold and hedge against inflation.

Sanctuary, an astrology startup that also sells psychic readings to users for no low price. U.S. laws around psychic readings are patchwork at best, with CEO and founder Ross Clark arguing the app is offering entertainment rather than fortune-telling—exempting it from the more onerous of state laws. The readings, Clark says, is a practice in empathy rather than actually peering into the crystal ball. But still, the question remains, is funding the practice ethical? 

Some investors think otherwise. Lux Capital’s Josh Wolfe on Twitter did not mince his words upon hearing news of the startup’s seed funding: “Seriously shame on anyone funding or encouraging this bullsh\*t. No doubt there is demand, but this isn’t peddling entertainment, it’s encouraging slippery slope snake oil flapdoodle.” Here too is Vinod Khosla at Khosla Ventures in response to Wolfe’s tweet: “Agree. There is also demand for heroin, fat, sugar… I’d be ashamed to fund such a venture.” 

Proponents argue that astrology and psychic readings play a similar role as religion or therapy, while its detractors argue the practice is rooted in pseudoscience.

**TSLA**\- recently big dip.  They do have decent advantage in EV market having good tech but there is tons and tons of money being burned by competitors to catch up and overtake. Currently \~36% down from its 52 week highs.

&amp;#x200B;

**ETSY**\- 37% off its 52 week highs. Still vulnerable because growth stock and these will be the first sacrificed in any major downturn. But it is rapidly growing and it is the only one focused solely on creative goods made by artists/entrepreneurs. Gross merchandise sales \[3.1 billion\] 132.3% YOY increase in Q1, net income \[143.8 billion\] up 1048.1% YOY. Yahoo price target consensus at 226.13. Did turn a profit. 3.52 EPS, 46.32 P/E. 20.73 Billion market cap. I own some and have been happy. Seems like they use debt sparingly and have a good cash flow. So probably would sell off in major downturn but doubt would be in danger of bankruptcy or not being able to weather a storm.

&amp;#x200B;

**LOVE**\-Lovesac- American furniture retailer. I’m not sold here but they do modular furniture and apparently doing pretty well. 4 years of double digit net sales growth, expanded digital channels during pandemic, makes products from recycled plastic bottles and furniture built to last lifetime so that is appealing. Yahoo price target consensus for one year at 74.50 which is lower then the \~75 its at now. EPS .96, P/E 79.07. Would think about it if pulled back but not at current price myself.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Some REITS to consider: 

&amp;#x200B;

**FRT**\- Federal Realty Investment trust, focusing on shopping centers, street retail, mixed use. Major markets in LA, DC&lt; NY, Silicon Valley. Many tenants like grocery stores, restaurants, fitness centers, service based business. 3.8% dividend.  I would be worried about the markets they are in as there is a recent exodus from cities like this in favor of the new tech centers such as Austin and Miami. 

&amp;#x200B;

**IIPR**\- Innovative Industrial Properties- this one has been on my radar for a year +, I got in fairly early and sold last march to reap the profits as thought downturn was going to be longer lasting.  I am back in a couple shares and happy. It specializes in medical cannabis growers. So they just set up the warehouses and have triple net leases IIRC so they have virtually no ongoing costs and just reap rent profits. Cannabis use seems to be up big in the pandemic so may be a lasting trend and with it becoming legal in more and more states I think this is a long term smart play.  3.16% dividend on the normal shares and does sell preferred shares with larger dividend as well. Only have one share in the normal, down 3.76% on stock price I bought at and \~4 shares in the IIPR/PRA 9% preferred dividend I am up \~14%. No plans to sell either.

&amp;#x200B;

**STAG**\- stag industrial, inc. invests in warehouses across country, \~40% of portfolio is leased to e-commerce tenants. Biggest tenant is AMZN, but AMZN constantly looking to cut out middle men and achieve vertical monopolies in every field they operate it seems.  The good thing for STAG is that IIRC, this came up on my radar a while back and many of their properties are located in key areas around international airports and there is only so much warehouse space available that is located in key spots like this, so while AMZN can very well replace them in areas that have space, this may not be possible for reasonable costs in metropolitan areas, especially around airport hubs. I do have a couple shares in here and am up \~20% with no plans of selling at this time.

&amp;#x200B;

Will be interesting to see how we do as Mask Mandates are ending across the country as we approach the 4th of July and summer traveling season.  Will enough of America be vaccinated/have natural immunity due to infection to prevent another spike? Will the world get it together before we create and spread a variant that does not respond to vaccines? Time will tell, and possibly present some fire sales if the panic and fear sets in again a la March 2020.

&amp;#x200B;

**CriCut**\- MarketBeat presented this as a very interesting company but my subsequent \[quick research\] did not back that up. Allegedly company that helps people design and build any idea they might have. Growth at triple digit rate. Not profitable. Added 600k new users last quarter. Paid subscriptions up 140% to 1.6 million paid subscriptions. Yahoo price consensus around 27 with 5 analysts weighing in from a low of 23 to a high of 35. Currently \~24-25. Something I will look into...searching online just brings up a bunch of fancy label makers though a nod on website not seeing this design and build any idea so not sure what this article is talking about. If anyone sees something I missed let me know because from article looked very interesting. Not so much after looking at website and reading the wiki.

personalfinance,State tax refund difference dilemma,"My wife is self employed and I was attempting to send in a lump sum estimated FEDERAL tax payment of $7k at the end of last year. By (really dumb) accident I sent the payment to NJ state instead.

I figured, well, that's ok, if I calculated that I was getting a $350 refund from NJ then I'll just get $7350 back; sucks but I made the mistake. Well, I got a state refund but it was far far less than the amount I thought I would get back.

How should I go about finding out how NJ calculated my taxes to come up with only refunding some of my expected refund? The calculation on their end might be right, I just have no clue how they arrived at that number and just want to know.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,Buy new house but keep existing house ?,"We are in a HCOL area.

We have a house currently worth a little over $800k and we have $350k equity in it.

We also have $150k to go toward a down payment on an a new house.


We are looking to upgrade to a more expensive house - $1.2ish million. 


The question is - sell home to go toward the new home? Or rent first house ? The rent would easily cover the existing mortgage and property tax. Our house has appreciated a lot so I am also happy we have lower property taxes. 

Our $150k down payment is about 12% down payment, not the full 20% but we still qualify with a good rate. 

How do you decide whether to rent first house and keep it for long-term gains (have renters pay off the mortgage), or sell to go toward new more expensive house ?


Interest rates are very low - we refinanced our house for 2.7% so that’s another reason I don’t want to sell it.",finance

I am a Texas resident moving to Washington DC in late July for work within my company. With this move comes a 10% salary bump due to the higher living expenses in DC effective the 2nd of August. I will be living in Washington DC proper for the remainder of 2021, but my actual work office location will be in Virginia. When it comes to filing my 2021 income taxes, I'm fairly confident federal taxes will be normal but I am unsure how to file for DC's ""state"" income tax, which I believe is the only municipality i have to file in due to the reciprocity agreement with Virginia.

Is it possible one single alt coin can erase this debt by become the new and future currency therefore making the old fiat completely obsolete?

CryptoCurrency,Musings on Bitcoin,"Something is wrong

There is something wrong we are living in. Not wrong with nature, not wrong with physics, but wrong with the world we have created. Human civilization is broken.

How is it broken?

It is all around us. Those of us that choose to participate in this society, feel it. It is like a pressure; like a vice closing in around you from all sides. Increasing prices of assets, services, and goods; these are problems for the blessed, who have can obtain credit and try to grow wealth. For more and more, the vice has closed so tight they are unable to even participate in this process. This is demonstrated by the decreasing labor force participation rate. Many are opting out; but do they know why?

Some of those who do participate can see it. Inept middle management, years worked with no reward, no promotions, no raises. Watching incompetency get rewarded. Cost of affording your life increases. The vice closes. You cannot work one job you are good at and be productive; no. You must always strive for more in order to maintain the lifestyle you envisioned for your family.

Those in finance buy bigger and better things. People that move numbers around on Wall Street, people that sell exploitative financial instruments, continually get rewarded. The difference is their income is generated by the money pouring in from the printers. They earn their money closer to the people that conjure the cash from thin air.

Watch your family and friends that are employed and contribute to society in real ways have their income inflated away. Teacher, police, retail workers, waiters, blue collar workers, productive men and women who create the world around us fighting over less and less. Asset prices continue growing and so many millennials can never afford them. Bitterness between generations grow. What one salary used to buy now takes two. Children being raised by nannies and daycares.

Planned obsolescence. The world around you, everything you buy and do, is now made to deteriorate by design. Our system needs you to buy. Savers are punished by inflation, those that take out debt are rewarded. As we consume, we destroy our world around us. Climate change is a real problem but the causes is misunderstood. An inflationary economy requires constant growth in consumption to feed the markets and we are forced to destroy our world at an exponential rate. Conspicuous consumption boils our oceans. Our only chance is to break this system.
Yes you can succeed in this inflating world. Romanticize the entrepreneur, the business owner, the landlord. Those who take risks deserve to be rewarded, but the line between reward and exploiting the hourly employee continues to blur.

And as the vice closes, people become desperate. They will through their money at any promise of reprieve. They saw their favorite CEO tweet about a new currency of the people that will take you to the moon. Maybe this is the way? Desperate people are vulnerable, and those with excess seem to have no qualm in leading them astray. See those poor refugees over there, maybe they are the reason your wages have stagnated. Blame them. Build a wall. They divide us to distract us.

Who broke it?

Maybe it was the politicians and economists over the last hundred years or so. Maybe it was before that. Did they know what they were doing? Did they do it malignantly or as an unintended consequence? Do the people know what they even lost? Certificates for gold, then gold confiscated, then certificates for nothing. Fiat currency backed by nothing, generated at will, devaluating the time of the labor force, is one of the greatest crimes in human history. Those disparately trying to cling to this failing system may prove to be the most dangerous to us.

Can it be fixed?

It is clear to me and many more every day. For those who participate in this system and do not see the fractures, they stills feel the pressure. Something is going to crack. Social unrest, violence may be in our future. Those in power will feel increasing pressure to airdrop fiat currency to the masses to keep them calm; however this will only squeeze the vice tighter over time.
Our Founding Fathers did not include the ability to print money as a power of the Federal Government. This tax on the working class, the people who build our world, who create lasting infrastructure and things worth owning. Our time is being stolen from us. Our lives are being stolen from us.
Climate change, income inequality, wage stagnation, time theft — it is all tied together. The answer is complicated and is easily missed if you are not paying attention.

Fix the money, fix the world.

investing,"Turkcell Communication Services ($TKC), why you should/shouldn't invest in it. Fundamentals of an undervalued stock.","Hi everyone! This is gonna be a long wall of text, I will write a tl;dr as well so please check the bottom if it scares you.

**Why TKC?**

So I have been researching about Turkcell, a Turkish company that is traded in BIST (Istanbul stock exchange) and NYSE. It had my attention because its been under performing compared to both global stocks and Turkish stocks (even though it's been performing really well financially compared to other companies traded in BIST). Before dipping to $4.67 USD due to pandemic in late march - early april, it was traded for $5.77 USD (early march 2020) and it was around 10-11 USD during 2018. As of today, it's traded for only $4.56 USD. Biggest reason for that freefall of the stock price is downfall of the Turkish economy and the devaluation of the Turkish lira but other Turkish stocks doesn't seem to care as much as TKC does. For comparison, march 2020 dip of XU100 (adjusted by the USD exchange rate of that time) index was 114 (857/7,5), now it is 171 (1441/8.4). There has been a Turkish stock exchange rally even in USD terms as well, which TKC missed. Not to mention that Turkish banks performed terribly and they have around 17% [weight in the XU100.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EqbtfSZXUAEnwu0?format=png&amp;name=small)

**About the company**

So the company is primarily a telecommunication company (like Vodafone). Even though it offers value added services like BiP (mainly whatsapp alternative), Fizy (spotify alternative, TV+, Paycell (fintech), Pasaj (e-commerce mostly selling tech products), Lifebox (cloud service), Yaani (search engine), Dergilik (digital publishing platform) it's primary source of income is telecommunication and internet for home via Superonline (Turkcell company). The company operates in Turkey, Ukraine (lifecell), Belarus, Azerbaijan, Cyprus, Netherlands and Germany (though their operations in the last 2 are not directly profit seeking afaik). Main competitors in Turkey (main market) are Vodafone and Turk Telekom. Vodafone and Turk Telekom offers cheaper prices but Turkcell offers better service and as of today it has the highest share of the market with 42%. Turkcell also invests more than the combination of the competition, [you can check their mobile data segment investments here](https://hwp.com.tr/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Mobile-yatirim.jpg). One last fundamental thing about company's operations is that it is part of the [TOGG project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOGG) (electric car company founded recently and according to their CEO, they will start the mass production is 2022) and owns 19% of the TOGG as well. The taxes for foreign made cars in Turkey are extremely high and the rumor is that the government is thinking about subsidizing this project to decrease country's account deficit by both not depending on foreign made cars and oil (which Turkey doesn't have).

**Financials**

I don't want to rewrite what is already written in detail so I will provide some sources instead.

[1st Q 2021 presentation (1.1B TL net income)](https://s.turkcell.com.tr/hakkimizda/en/yatirimciiliskileri/InvestorReportLibrary/Presentation-Q121-ENG.pdf)

[Annual report of 2020 (4.24B TL net income)](https://s.turkcell.com.tr/hakkimizda/en/yatirimciiliskileri/InvestorReportLibrary/Turkell-IAR-2020-ENG.pdf)

Their net income kept growing for a while, you can check more about their financials [in their website here.](https://www.turkcell.com.tr/en/aboutus/investor-relations) Check [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yIDdTqig4k) as well.

**Possible things that may drive the value up.**

I already talked about the TOGG project above, but the investors seem to didn't care about it. I think they have their doubts about the project (which is understandable due to fragile Turkish economy). But I believe if the mass production starts in 2022 it will have a really good impact on the stock.

Another thing is possible IPOs. In february this year, CEO stated that they are considering the IPO of their home internet company, Superonline. According to bloomberg, they started talking with the investment banks about it in April. You can read more about it [here.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-06/turkcell-is-said-to-approach-banks-on-ipo-plan-for-internet-unit) Also, they were considering the [IPO of Global Tower in 2016](https://www.reuters.com/article/turkcell-globaltower-idUSL8N1CU4JX) but they didn't do it calling the market unsuitable for a new IPO. Considering the IPO madness happening in Turkish market, they may also consider it. I also want to remind you that vodafone did a similar IPO last year and they had a pretty good valuation.

Lastly, the stock had management issues before. The company couldn't share dividends and it had decision making issues as well. But as of June 2020, this problem is solved because Turkish Wealth Fund bought the stocks from Telia and Karamehmets. Now the company gives dividends quarterly (0.39 TRY per quarter and the stock is valued 15.20 TRY atm in Turkey, not sure about it in NYSE). I believe investing in TKC just because of the dividend is an enough reason.

**One important thing that caught my eye**

Last month one of the foreign institutions sent the [mandatory notification](https://www.kap.org.tr/en/Bildirim/932236) that their shares passed the 5% barrier. I was watching their aggressive purchases and they keep buying. [This is the buyers-sellers chart for the last one and a half month](https://imgur.com/a/juARwKD). Gedik investment made the 77% of the purchases. Gedik then transferred it to Deutsche bank. During that period amount of shares which are **held by the foreigners increased by 30 million stocks.**

**Why you should NOT buy/why is it undervalued?**

As I mentioned above, TRY is not performing well. Lately, Turkish Lira lost good portion of it's value. This is the main risk for this stock in my opinion. But the thing is, **82% percent of the float is held by the foreigners**, and even though the foreigner's interest in Turkish stock exchange kept decreasing, their shares in Turkcell kept increasing. It seems they think that it is a good buy despite the risk of Turkish Lira. I also believe that it is a buy for sure long term, but it is risky for the short term. Also, even if the TRY performs well, there is a possibility that with the possible interest rates increase, **DXY may start it's bull run which will negatively affect the stock.**

Another thing is, in October, Letterone will have the ability to sell some of their shares in the stock exchange. It is not clear whether they will or not, but it is risky since it will increase the shares traded. Last year, they sold some of it on the market for 15.5 liras per share (15.20 is the current price of the stock).

&amp;#x200B;

**Summary**

I believe that this stock is a good buy because of their financials, dividend, investments (mainly the electric car project TOGG), incoming IPO and accumulation of the stocks by certain investment group. But there are 2 main risks as well, fragile Turkish economy and the stocks held by Letterone. But even with those risks, I dont think it will devaluate more at this point.",finance
personalfinance,Comparison between 2 Refinance (Mortgage) Options,"After a week of solicitation and quotes, I've narrowed our options down to 2 choices but trying to make sure I understand how they compare to each other.  My thoughts below...just trying to see if my approach to these are correct.

&amp;#x200B;

Both 15 years, waiving escrow, closing costs rolled into loan.

Total Closing Costs includes Origination, Points (if applicable), Lender Credit, Prepaids, Title Fees, Taxes, etc.

Loan Amount (before costs): 300,000

&amp;#x200B;

Option 1 Rate: 1.875

Option 1 Closing Costs: 5,157

&amp;#x200B;

Option 2 Rate: 2.125

Option 2 Closing Costs: 2,870

&amp;#x200B;

Based on my understanding, the two is close to each other with the difference being Option 2 being slightly better up until about Year 10/11 where the break-even point of the additional cost occurs which would make Option 1 more favorable.  So if we move/sell prior to that break-even point, Option 2 would've been better.

Option 1 would also be more favorable in scenarios of prepayments due to the lower interest rate.

Assuming we maintain the entire 15 year, the summation is we would be paying an additional 2,287 (difference of cost between Option 1 &amp; 2) to save 3,136 (total payments difference).",finance
personalfinance,Credit Score Question,"In the last year, I've paid off nearly 15k of CC debt. I've lowered my CC debt to credit available ratio from around 75% to 37%. A rough breakdown of interest rates on cards with a balance is below:

Card #1  
8% Interest  
25% of credit being used

Card #2  
10% Interest  
50% of credit being used

Card #3  
14% Interest  
65% of credit being used

Card #1 has about 25% to go and has a maximum limit of $5,000. I've considered maxing it out from Card #3. That won't come close to paying off Card #3, but it will reduce my overall interest cost. My question is the impact on credit. I've seen a considerable jump in my score in recent months to due to the reductions in debt. We've mostly been doing the snowball technique.

We also may need to buy a car in the coming months since our current one is on its last leg, hence my focus on a good score.  We're not buying new or anything, but we live in a location with no mass transit and our family is single-car only, so I'll probably buy something from Enterprise.

Is it better to keep Card #1 maxed out by transferring over money every few months or pay it off and focus efforts on the next high interest card.

Update #1 - I forgot to note that Card #1 is a joint card between my spouse and I. Card #3 is not. So it would have implications for her score too.

Update #2 - Transfers are free on all my cards. Cards are also no longer in use.",finance
stocks,Trying to understand the pros and cons of buying on a margin,"Hi, I’m relatively new to investing. I started buying stocks in February and you have really gotten into it and enjoy it immensely. There are however, a lot of parts of investing that I really don’t understand. I google stuff constantly and try and do my own research but it can get pretty confusing. 
My current question is about margin buying. I was recently offered the ability to use margin buying on RH and was given an $11,000 margin which seems dangerous to me because from what I have gleaned from my research, buying on margin is like using credit from whatever platform you’re using to invest. 
Let’s say I use $500 on the margin to buy stock, when I deposit more money will they automatically take that $500 back? Is that how you pay it off? Are they making money off of this? Like hidden fees and exorbitant interest rates and stuff like that?I guess what I mean is, overall, is it sketchy? Should I avoid buying on a margin? 
One reason I’ve seen given as a benefit is that you’re able to buy more stock at the time when you need to and therefore can make more profit because it gives you additional capital to invest. That makes sense, but again I wonder what their angle is. I really don’t want to get myself in a bad situation because I’m ignorant.

My state requires me to e-file my State returns if the taxes were filed through software, and the fact that I cannot e-file my Federals is preventing me from filing my taxes on time.

personalfinance,Starting my PF journey - have some questions about savings accounts and investing,"Hi guys,

First time posting but long time reader of the sub. I recently got a really good job paying much higher than my previous job so I want to start my PF journey for my own peace of mind. 

I've learned a lot of the Wiki but I do have some questions. I live in El Salvador currently with my parents so I do save up quite a lot of money on rent and some on food (I pay for half). I do have some CC debt which I'll be paying off by the end of the year and I also  have a car payment which will be fully paid for by next year. 

I want to start an international savings account (sort of like Ally, but Ally requires you to be a US citizen or permanent resident), mostly because interest rates in the country are very volatile. Does anyone have any experience or recommendations of where I can open an account? I guess I could open just a regular checking account here but I figured I'd ask. 

Secondly, I would also like to start investing when the time is right. However, I'm not quite sure if I can invest in an ETF or the stock market as an non-US resident. Are there any alternatives for internationals? 

Thanks in advance for any advice and have a great rest of your weekend!",finance
CryptoCurrency,Noise vs Signal,"We all know that Mr.Musk is saying some things that are tanking the market. But here are some questions? Has anything fundamentally changed about your crypto? Did the fed somehow take back all of the money they created? Is inflation not happening? What we are experiencing rn is just some fud, if you’re stressed calm down and buy the dip if you have some fiat on you. For the technicals we could potentially test the 43k support and if that doesn’t hold we could have a quick wick down to 38k. I’m expecting this wick to be bought up very fast and I expect we resume back up to 65k pretty soon. Enjoy the discounts because this won’t last forever.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,"1 Year Post-Grad, Best way to tackle $59K in debt?","Hey all! I'm new here but looking for some general financial advice on the best way to tackle my debt. I'll give some background.

I'm 24 y/o, I graduated in May 2020. I ended up doing 6 total years in undergrad, because I transferred schools and essentially had to start over. I did not realize how much of my ""financial aid"" was loans vs grants. I have almost $16K in Sallie Mae private loans and another \~$35K in federal.

I've paid off over $15K of Sallie Mae loans since graduating.

I'm currently living at home and working full time, making $45k gross (about \~$2800/month after taxes). I'm also doing a bit of freelancing work in my field to bring in anywhere from $400-$1000/month, depending on the month. Previously, there was a long stretch where I was unemployed.

I'd also paid off my Ford Focus last summer but it had a ton of issues so I ended up buying a different (used) car and currently have another $7700 in the auto loan on that one. Still doing okay as far as money for now. I really would love to pay it \[the car\] off as soon as possible while still paying down my student loans.

Right now, I'm only paying my car insurance ($82/month), phone ($30), and probably spending way too much on eating out and groceries BUT, I know I won't be able to live with my mom forever and would like to move out in 6 or so months. I've invested about $2K in crypto/stocks as well.

I guess I'm just wondering what the best course of action is here. I feel like I don't even know where to begin. The majority of my checks go straight into my debt which can be pretty demoralizing but I guess is just the way it is until I can pay them off. Any tips on how to make the most of my money and how to be smart in terms of saving, investing, and also avoiding living a miserable life in terms of being too frugal.

edit/note: My credit is luckily in the good range currently after a lot of work on keeping credit usage low, paying on time and more than needed, etc.",finance
CryptoCurrency,CRYPTO is still on. This dip is due to hedge funds liquidating to meet Margin Calls for GME/AMC,"Guys relax. 

I’m invested and actively trading in crypto, GME, and AMC, and I’ve been following the “DD” extremely closely on Superstonk, GME, etc. 

This is public knowledge now, but hedge funds are in the process of being margin called. In fact, the FED just released an approx $500 billion 48-hour relief loan package to 36 hedge funds. I believe they are trading in the crypto market because they don’t have to report yet (some regulations can be a good thing!), and if you look at the GME/AMC price action side by side with BTC, ETH, LTC, Etc, the charts look identical. Coincidence? No. Their liquidating to pay margin calls AND pay back the flash loans. 

So every relax. Everything is fine. Hell, Musk is even talking about making his OWN coin - which would be so annoying don’t get me started. That being said, ZOOM OUT. We are hitting all time highs like a week ago. 

The market is currently undergoing a “liquidity test” enacted by the DTCC/FED/SEC because of the recent stock manipulation and massive margin:cash leverage some players have. 

Relax. Gobble up those coins. Trade in projects you have researched and feel confident in. Be patient. You should only be invested in good projects for the long term anyways, but I suppose that relies on your preferred level of risk aversion. Capped coins only, at least, please?

If you’re feeling stressed, it’s because you may be over leveraged or invested in coins you’re not confident in. Do your research, and don’t invest/trade what you can’t afford to lose. 

ALLL ABOARD 🚀 🚀


EDIT: Thanks for the awards, especially the two anonymous “All-Seeing Eyes!” Mysterious! 

All of the downvoting is just confirmation bias to me. If my theory does prove true, then of course hedge funds are all up in these subs monitoring sentiment, posts, DD, etc. I’d do that if I were them. I am sure you would too.

CryptoCurrency,Perfect Explanation as to Why we are seeing a Dip.,"As you all know, Memorial Day is coming up, and that's pretty huge.

People have been so fed up being locked down, and not having any social life that they just want to get out a party big-time. 

Strobe lights, DJs, tons of alcohol, massive cookouts with top of the line meats and DRUGS.   Lots of cocaine , and the ones who already use drugs are gonna be using drugs even more.  

All that meat to BBQ. Food prices are up.
Cocaine is very expensive too.
DJs and Strobe lights? 

All this costs tons of money.   This gives you an idea how much money will be spent on meat, travel etc This is 2018, combine inflation , and that's Billions spent on meat 

https://www.business2community.com/trends-news/memorial-day-2018-by-the-numbers-02069263

Collectively BILLIONS. 


So what does this have to do with anything?  

Obviously, everyone is cashing out their cryptos to fund these massive events. 

I myself want to have whole elephants shipped over and rotisserie them..  

Have any idea how much money it costs to get an elephant shipped to the US, then set up rigging equipment to be able to spin that thing over massive fire?    Do you know how many pounds of spices you're going to need to rotisserie an elephant?

So I can totally see people who want the same type of cookout I do with enough in Bitcoin to sell off for this event .  would sell their crypto to get it done. 

So don't panic. People just want to party.",cryptocurrency
dogecoin,A Comment on the Narrative Surrounding Doge and Crypto in General... Thoughts?,"1. The ""Infinite Supply"" Objection. (Assumption: for a coin to have an infinite supply, it must be impossible to calculate/measure/determine how many coins exist at any single point in time.) 

This is just something that irritates me. 

With regard to Dogecoin, technically speaking, it's supply is FINITE. We know exactly when and how many dogecoins will enter the market (capped at 5 billion per year). A basic equation might look something like this (give me some rope here)...

X = A(n) + C

X = maximum dogecoin supply at a given point in time.
A = annual cap on newly created dogecoin (currently 5 billion)
n = number of years into the future (i.e. how many times will ""A"" be added into the market)
C = current market supply (currently 128 billion, next year it will be ~133 billion, and so on).

Granted, it is impossible to know whether/when the annual increase in the supply of doge will end or change. Nevertheless, we can determine at ANY point in time the number of dogecoin in existence (just pick any number of years into the future), regardless of how far into the future one wants to examine. 

2. The ""Market Cap"" of Cryptos. (Assumption: ""Market Cap"" is a term of art representing the total market value of a corporation's outstanding shares and therefore does not have any meaning, use, relevance, or applicability in the context of cryptos). 

Not a day goes by that some article mentions how Dogecoin's market cap ""is now greater than real companies like [insert company name here]."" Many of these articles rely on this to support their claim that a crypto-bubble is forming. Naturally, this benefits short sellers (perhaps even comes at their behest) since it adds FUD and ultimately leading retail investors investors sell now to avoid imminent doom. 

My gripe here is that stocks and cryptos are not comparable to one another. It is irresponsible (at best) or deceptive (at worst) to analyze and discuss the state of the crypto market using market cap comparisons. While it certainly misleads investors, which is a major problem, I worry that something much more significant is fueling this narrative. 

Left unchallenged, this Narrative will make it much easier for the SEC to claim that cryptos are ""securities"" and ""investor protections are needed"", just like stocks, that are available through regulations. Biden's nominee to the SEC has already come out and said that, in his opinion, ""cryptos are securities"", which (to his benefit) would give the SEC broad regulatory authority over the crypto market. Naturally, the SEC loves to exercise whatever power it receives, especially in the Wild West known as crypto. (For a counter argument/view, [here](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/president-biden-s-nominee-sec-chairman-what-does-it-mean-crypto)

Such regulations would erode two essential characteristics and fundamental benefits of cryptos - liquidity and decentralization. Regulations would increase the difficuty, expense, and risk of buying and selling. Each transaction would require a careful examination of the applicable regulations and exemptions prior to execution to avoid violations.

And, since public filings would nearly always be required prior to the issuance of any crypto, one entity would need to control each crypto, thereby removing the benefit of decentralization. 

Finally, by defining cryptos as securities, the federal government assumes jurisdiction over every crypto where it would otherwise have little to no jurisdiction over. Let me explain: crytos are generally divided into two categories, (1) currencies (bitcoin?) and (2) assets (ethereum?) The federal government arguably could ban any crypto-currency, but would have little to no authority over crytpo-assets. Now, some people use the terms interchangeably, while others distinguish one from the other. From a legal perspective, the distinction matters significantly. 

However, by saying all cryptos are securities, that problem is avoided entirely. This would allow the government to assume broad control over the entire market, rather than assess each crypto issuance on a case-by-case basis to determine whether a security exists. 

The most notable example is Ripple/XRP, a case which has been misrepresented/misunderstood virtually everywhere. The SEC is not arguing that XRP is a security, but rather the distribution of profits in the form of XRP creates an ""investment contract"", i.e. a type of security. While the SEC is right in this case, it would not follow that every crypto is therefore a security. In other words, the SEC must prove that this particular circumstance created a security (and repeat for every other new circumstance). However, under Biden's nominee's definition, the SEC relieves itself of that burden by simply concluding ab initio that EVERY crypto, regardless of circumstance, is a security.

End of rant. There was more but I forgot and got tired. 

Tl/dr: (1) dogecoin's supply is not infinite, (2) market cap is irrelevant in the context of cryptos, and (3) cryptos are not securities.

Condensed version of Lecture #5 of the Plutus Pioneer Program by Lars Brünjes on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VbhY162GQA)

## Overview

This lecture is all about Native Tokens!

We'll be looking at how to Mint and Burn tokens, also how to define minting policies; which define under which conditions native tokens can be minted or burned.

## Value

First of all each UTxO has both an `Address` and a `Value`.

In EUTxO, each UTxO also has a `Datum` (for which we have seen multiple use-cases in weeks 1-4).

Up until now `Value` was always Ada (or Lovelaces)

*Note:* one exception being the Auction example from Week01. Although we did create an NFT to be auctioned, we did it by using a Playground feature that created this NFT at Initialization.

We identify tokens by its `CurrencySymbol` and `TokenName`.

For Ada these are both *empty strings*.

If we look at [Plutus/V1/Ledger/Value.hs](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus/blob/master/plutus-ledger-api/src/Plutus/V1/Ledger/Value.hs) of the [Plutus Repository](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus)

This combination of `CurrencySymbol` and `TokenName` is also called an `AssetClass` as defined on line 183

    newtype AssetClass = AssetClass { unAssetClass :: (CurrencySymbol, TokenName) }

The `Value` type, by setting the Integer, just says: how many units of each `AssetClass` are in this value.

Line 210

    newtype Value = Value { getValue :: Map.Map CurrencySymbol (Map.Map TokenName Integer) }

Although it is important to know what `Value` is, we should never construct a `Value` directly with Maps; there are helper functions for this that should be used.

For Lovelaces, we have the `lovelaceValueOf` function, which takes an `Integer` and returns a `Value`.

As I said, for Ada both the `CurrencySymbol` and `TokenName` are empty strings, for Ada these are defined in [Plutus/V1/Ledger/Ada.hs](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus/blob/master/plutus-ledger-api/src/Plutus/V1/Ledger/Ada.hs) of the [Plutus Repository](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus)

We can use them by calling `adaSymbol` and/or `adaToken`; both of which contain an `emptyByteString`.

Line 47-48

    adaSymbol :: CurrencySymbol
    adaSymbol = TH.currencySymbol emptyByteString

Line 52-53

    adaToken :: TokenName
    adaToken = TH.tokenName emptyByteString

If we call the `lovelaceValueOf` function with a Integer valued 123, we can see our generated `Value`.

    lovelaceValueOf 123
    Value (Map [(,Map [("""",123)])])

As you can see, both the `CurrencySymbol` and `TokenName` are empty, by which we know this is a value of 123 lovelaces.

## lovelaceValueOf for other tokens

To create `Value`'s for Tokens other than Ada, we can use `singleton`, it is specified as:

    singleton :: CurrencySymbol -&gt; TokenName -&gt; Integer -&gt; Value

`CurrencySymbol` must be a valid hexadecimal value (for example: `a8ff`) (we'll get to ""why"" in a second)

`TokenName` can be any arbitrary byte string

For example:

    singleton ""a8ff"" ""TOKEN"" 10

would return a `Value` of

    Value (Map [(a8ff,Map [(""TOKEN"",10)])])

*Note:* to use strings as we do here, we must activate the OverloadedStrings extension, in the ghci we do this by calling: `:set -XOverloadedStrings` in our scripts we would need to add the language pragma `{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}`

## Combining Value's

The `Value` class is an instance of `Monoid` (check out week04 for a more in depth explanation).

Because of this, we can use the `mappend` functionality that Monoids give us, to combine 2 (or more) `Value`'s.

*Note:* the mappend function also has an operator for it: `&lt;&gt;`

Example using `lovelaceValueOf`

    lovelaceValueOf 15 &lt;&gt; lovelaceValueOf 10

Which would give us a `Value` of 25 lovelaces.

When combining multiple `Values` of different Tokens (so not only lovelaces), we'd get a `Value` with multiple Maps. e.g.

    singleton ""a8ff"" ""ABC"" 7 &lt;&gt; lovelaceValueOf 42 &lt;&gt; singleton ""a8ff"" ""XYZ"" 100

which would return

    Value (Map [(, Map [("""", 42)]), (""a8ff"", Map [(""ABC"", 7), (""XYZ"", 100)])])

Now if we'd want to retrieve for example our 100 'XYZ', we can do so by using the `valueOf` function

    valueOf :: Value -&gt; CurrencySymbol -&gt; TokenName -&gt; Integer

First for ease of use, we'll assign our two singletons and lovelaces to a variable

    let v = singleton ""a8ff"" ""ABC"" 7 &lt;&gt; lovelaceValueOf 42 &lt;&gt; singleton ""a8ff"" ""XYZ"" 100

Which we can now use with `valueOf`

    valueOf v ""a8ff"" ""XYZ""

To get our 100 ""XYZ"".

Last but not least, there is the `flattenValue` function, which.. well.. flattens the `Maps` in our `Value`

    flattenValue v

To get a flattened list of triples

    [(a8ff,""ABC"",7),(a8ff,""XYZ"",100),(,"""",42)]

## Minting Policy

In every transaction, there is a rule.

That rule states: ""What comes in, must come out.""

*Note:* one exception is the `Fees`

This is important because this would mean we could never mint/create tokens in a transaction, as this would break that rule.

This is where Minting Policies come in.

Our `CurrencySymbol`, in all of our created `Value`'s, was always the hexadecimal string ""a8ff"", why?

Well the `CurrencySymbol` is the Hash of a Script; our Minting Policy (or `MonetaryPolicy`)

For each transaction that wants to mint or burn native tokens, `CurrencySymbol` is looked up, this script is now executed alongside other validation scripts, that then decides if the transaction is allowed to mint/burn native tokens.

For Ada this applies as well, here our `CurrencySymbol` thus our Minting Policy (or `MonetaryPolicy`), is *empty*.

Because there is no script here, we have no way of minting or burning Ada; which is exactly what we expect. The amount of Ada is fixed, and cannot be changed.

If we look at the definition of ScriptContext in [Plutus/V1/Ledger/Contexts.hs](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus/blob/master/plutus-ledger-api/src/Plutus/V1/Ledger/Contexts.hs) of the [Plutus Repository](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus)

Line 115

    data ScriptContext = ScriptContext{scriptContextTxInfo :: TxInfo, scriptContextPurpose :: ScriptPurpose }

We have a `ScriptPurpose` here (defined on lines 94 - 98)

    data ScriptPurpose
        = Minting CurrencySymbol
        | Spending TxOutRef
        | Rewarding StakingCredential
        | Certifying DCert

Until now we have only been using `ScriptContext`'s with a `ScriptPurpose` of `Spending`; now we'll have the Purpose `Minting`.

`ScriptContext` also has a `scriptContextTxInfo` of type `TxInfo` (lines 101 - 113)

    data TxInfo = TxInfo
        { txInfoInputs      :: [TxInInfo] -- ^ Transaction inputs
        , txInfoOutputs     :: [TxOut] -- ^ Transaction outputs
        , txInfoFee         :: Value -- ^ The fee paid by this transaction.
        , txInfoForge       :: Value -- ^ The 'Value' forged by this transaction.
        , txInfoDCert       :: [DCert] -- ^ Digests of certificates included in this transaction
        , txInfoWdrl        :: [(StakingCredential, Integer)] -- ^ Withdrawals
        , txInfoValidRange  :: SlotRange -- ^ The valid range for the transaction.
        , txInfoSignatories :: [PubKeyHash] -- ^ Signatures provided with the transaction, attested that they all signed the tx
        , txInfoData        :: [(DatumHash, Datum)]
        , txInfoId          :: TxId
        -- ^ Hash of the pending transaction (excluding witnesses)
        } deriving (Generic)

For all the examples (weeks) till now, the `txInfoForge` was always 0; though for our Minting Policy, this may contain a `Value` with 1 or more `AssetClass`es (see chapter `Value`).

For each `AssetClass` in `txInfoForge`, the corresponding script is run (`Minting Policy` / `Monetary Policy`).

If we remember from week 3, our Validator script got 3 values to work with: Datum, Redeemer and ScriptContext.

Minting Policies only get the ScriptContext.

Datum and Redeemer would both not make sense; the Datum belongs to a UTxO, and the Redeemer to input, but the Forging (`txInfoForge`) belongs to the transaction, not to a specific Input or Output.

## Free ! (Minting Policy example)

Open the file `Free.hs` in plutus-pioneer-program/code/week05/src/Week05/Free.hs

Lines 34 - 39

    {-# INLINABLE mkPolicy #-}
    mkPolicy :: ScriptContext -&gt; Bool
    mkPolicy _ = True
    
    policy :: Scripts.MonetaryPolicy
    policy = mkMonetaryPolicyScript $$(PlutusTx.compile [|| Scripts.wrapMonetaryPolicy mkPolicy ||])

Here we have defined our most basic `MonetaryPolicy` there could be. (same as we did when we started learning about Validators)

`mkPolicy` only receives the ScriptContext (so no Datum or Redeemer), and we just ignore the ScriptContext input (`_`) and return True! (no validation whatsoever).

Then, same as for our `Validator`'s we'll compile it into Plutus Core by using `mkMonetaryPolicyScript` and inlining our `mkPolicy`.

*Note:* this should all feel quite familiar. If not? Check out [week 02](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/mumpdx/week_02_plutus_pioneer_program/) which is all about the Validator\`.

Now we'll create our `CurrencySymbol` (Lines 41 - 42)

    curSymbol :: CurrencySymbol
    curSymbol = scriptCurrencySymbol policy

Great, we're all done with the on-chain part.

For the off-chain part, we want to be able to Mint and/or Burn tokens of this `CurrencySymbol`.

For doing so, we still need our `TokenName`, and a amount (Integer) to either mint or burn. (`Value` consists of those three values)

Lines 44 - 51

    data MintParams = MintParams
        { mpTokenName :: !TokenName
        , mpAmount    :: !Integer
        } deriving (Generic, ToJSON, FromJSON, ToSchema)
    
    type FreeSchema =
        BlockchainActions
            .\/ Endpoint ""mint"" MintParams

We'll create a new Endpoint with both our missing arguments (TokenName / Amount)

If the Amount is a positive Integer, we would be Minting Tokens, if it's negative we would be Burning them.

Time to write the contract itself.

Lines 53 - 60

    mint :: MintParams -&gt; Contract w FreeSchema Text ()
    mint mp = do
        let val     = Value.singleton curSymbol (mpTokenName mp) (mpAmount mp)
            lookups = Constraints.monetaryPolicy policy
            tx      = Constraints.mustForgeValue val
        ledgerTx &lt;- submitTxConstraintsWith @Void lookups tx
        void $ awaitTxConfirmed $ txId ledgerTx
        Contract.logInfo @String $ printf ""forged %s"" (show val)

Lets go through it.

First our Contract return type arguments:

* `w` \-&gt; Tell/Writer, is not used here, so not specified (hence it being written in lowercase to indicate exactly that)
* `FreeSchema` \-&gt; `BlockchainAction`'s and access to our endpoint(s) (in this case the ""mint"" endpoint we've previously created)
* `Text` \-&gt; Type of error messages
* () -&gt; Void / Unit, returns nothing.

Secondly, our `val` which is our `Value` (created with `Value.singleton`) with our `CurrencySymbol` (curSymbol) and both the TokenName and the Amount specified through the endpoint ""mint"".

Now in order to create a Transaction (`tx` in our script), instead of creating this transaction ourselves, which would be very tedious, as it would require us to compute the fees, and a whole lot of other things.

Another (better/easier) approach was taken.

We define constraints. In other words, we define conditions which this transaction must fulfill, and let the library do all the tedious work for us.

All of these constraints-creation functions, start with ""must"" e.g. `mustForgeValue`, `mustPayToPublicKey` etc.

`tx` is `Constraints.mustForgeValue` (our `val`), which will give us a transaction that we can now send to the chain via `submitTxConstraintsWith`.

Important to note: `submitTxConstraintsWith` may fail. For example if we don't have enough funds.

`submitTxConstraintsWith` also uses the lookups variable, it is there to include additional information to (hopefully) validate our `Constraints`.

In this case, lookups contains our MonetaryPolicy (the one that always returns True for now).

We need to do this, because our create `Value` (`val`), only contains the Hash of our Policy script, but in order to validate this transaction, we need the Script itself (not just the hash), so that we can execute it.

Other possible lookups: UTxOs, validation scripts

Last but not least the `awaitTxConfirmed` function, waits for our transaction (`LedgerTx`) to confirm.

*Note:* if this transaction fails to validate, for now this line blocks forever. This will change in the near-future though, as the Plutus team will provide more handling here (e.g. detect if this has failed or not)

At the end of this script we'll just log how many of the Token we have forged.

Lines 62 - 69 contains some more boilerplate code mostly for the playground (which you, if you followed along with weeks 1-4, should be familiar with)

    endpoints :: Contract () FreeSchema Text ()
    endpoints = mint' &gt;&gt; endpoints
      where
        mint' = endpoint @""mint"" &gt;&gt;= mint
    
    mkSchemaDefinitions ''FreeSchema
    
    mkKnownCurrencies []

## Testing

For testing our simple contract, we could do two things, either run it in the playground, or write custom tests which we can run in our terminal.

## Playground

Copy the lines 1 - 69 of `Free.hs` into the Playground and compile them.

Now setup 2 wallet with both 1000 lovelaces.

&amp;#x200B;

[Wallets \(Free.hs\)](https://preview.redd.it/5td4y4tmekz61.png?width=641&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34cd3928f48cbe35df3bed0315cf3e35c533ea88)

And a few actions to test:

&amp;#x200B;

[Actions \(Free.hs\)](https://preview.redd.it/9ibu4k2pekz61.png?width=639&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=235770178b73c456de195a0c9e20ae34f6ea471a)

Now if we evaluate this.

* Wallet 1 will mint 555 of the ABC token.
* Wallet 2 will mint 444 of the ABC token.
* We'll wait 1 slot.
* Wallet 1 will burn 222 of the ABC token.
* Wait another 1 slot.

Everyone of these transactions will cost a fixed total of 10 lovelaces, although this will change in the near-future to a calculated amount of lovelaces.

&amp;#x200B;

## EmulatorTrace

Lines 71 - 89 of Free.hs

    test :: IO ()
    test = runEmulatorTraceIO $ do
        let tn = ""ABC""
        h1 &lt;- activateContractWallet (Wallet 1) endpoints
        h2 &lt;- activateContractWallet (Wallet 2) endpoints
        callEndpoint @""mint"" h1 $ MintParams
            { mpTokenName = tn
            , mpAmount    = 555
            }
        callEndpoint @""mint"" h2 $ MintParams
            { mpTokenName = tn
            , mpAmount    = 444
            }
        void $ Emulator.waitNSlots 1
        callEndpoint @""mint"" h1 $ MintParams
            { mpTokenName = tn
            , mpAmount    = -222
            }
        void $ Emulator.waitNSlots 1

Of course here we do exactly the same, only without the use of the playground.

## Realistic example (Signed)

For a more realistic example, we will use the `Free.hs` script as a starting point, only this time we will restrict minting and burning by transactions signed by a specified public key hash. (kind of like a central bank)

Open the file `Signed.hs` in plutus-pioneer-program/code/week05/src/Week05/Signed.hs

Lines 35 - 37

    {-# INLINABLE mkPolicy #-}
    mkPolicy :: PubKeyHash -&gt; ScriptContext -&gt; Bool
    mkPolicy pkh ctx = txSignedBy (scriptContextTxInfo ctx) pkh

The policy now has the extra parameter `PubKeyHash`, which we need to check if this transaction was signed by.

`ScriptContextTxInfo` in our `ScriptContext` (ctx) contains all the signatories of the transaction; by using `txSignedBy` we can check if our `PubKeyHash` is in this list.

`txSignedBy` takes the `TxInfo` and a `PubKeyHash` and returns a boolean.

    txSignedBy :: TxInfo -&gt; PubKeyHash -&gt; Bool

Lines 39 - 46

    policy :: PubKeyHash -&gt; Scripts.MonetaryPolicy
    policy pkh = mkMonetaryPolicyScript $
        $$(PlutusTx.compile [|| Scripts.wrapMonetaryPolicy . mkPolicy ||])
        `PlutusTx.applyCode`
        PlutusTx.liftCode pkh
    
    curSymbol :: PubKeyHash -&gt; CurrencySymbol
    curSymbol = scriptCurrencySymbol . policy

Here we are just parameterizing our `PubKeyHash` (for more information check out [week 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/n3evg4/week_03_plutus_pioneer_program/) chapter Parameterized)

Lines 57 - 65

    mint :: MintParams -&gt; Contract w SignedSchema Text ()
    mint mp = do
        pkh &lt;- pubKeyHash &lt;$&gt; Contract.ownPubKey
        let val     = Value.singleton (curSymbol pkh) (mpTokenName mp) (mpAmount mp)
            lookups = Constraints.monetaryPolicy $ policy pkh
            tx      = Constraints.mustForgeValue val
        ledgerTx &lt;- submitTxConstraintsWith @Void lookups tx
        void $ awaitTxConfirmed $ txId ledgerTx
        Contract.logInfo @String $ printf ""forged %s"" (show val)

to get the `pubKeyHash` of our contract, we'll use the `pubKeyHash` function together with our `Contract.ownPubKey`.

Using the `&lt;$&gt;` operator, which is just a synonym for `fmap`. [Source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37286376/what-does-mean-in-haskell/37286470)

If we now run this script (Signed.hs) in either the Playground or by using our EmulatorTrace tests, we can see that for wallet 1 and wallet 2, there are 2 different tokens.

    Final balances
    Wallet 1:
        {, """"}: 99999980
        {7183b1cf81e44b26c558ddf442c4a7161a1b504b61136a8773dc2e4960323521, ""ABC""}: 333
    Wallet 2:
        {2a964fa6314803cf1b61165aeb1d758e355aae9480a29e282b58e76983f101ba, ""ABC""}: 444
        {, """"}: 99999990

The lovelaces went down by 10 because of the fees.

Wallet 1 has 333 of the ABC Token, but even though it has the same TokenName, the CurrencySymbol is totally different. (because now it is based on our PublicKeyHash).

Same for wallet 2 only with an amount of 444.

Simply put.

Only wallet 1 can ever Mint or Burn the ABC Token with CurrencySymbol ""7183b1cf81e44b26c558ddf442c4a7161a1b504b61136a8773dc2e4960323521"".

And only wallet 2 can ever Mint or Burn them with CurrencySymbol ""2a964fa6314803cf1b61165aeb1d758e355aae9480a29e282b58e76983f101ba"".

## NFT (Non-fungible Token)

The infamous NFT: Tokens that can exist only ONCE. There is only one of each in existence.

## Option 1

With our current knowledge we could, in the Policy look at the Forge Field (`txInfoForge`), and add a condition that only one token is forged.

But that won't do us any good, because that would mean during one transaction we could only mint one token. It wouldn't stop us from doing multiple transactions though.

## Option 2

Another option, one that is already used right now on the Cardano Blockchain (since Mary) to create NFT's, is by setting a deadline; after which nobody is allowed to mint or burn any more tokens.

We could then mint 1, wait until the deadline has passed, and there you go. An NFT.

The problem with this is, to check if an NFT is really an NFT, we'd have to check the blockchain (with a blockchain explorer), which is not that easy...

## Plutus power (Is it a bird... Is it a plane?.. NO. It's Plutus.) 😂

Using Plutus though we can create REAL NFTs.

If you know the policy script that corresponds to the currency symbol; you can be sure, that only one such token can be in existence. (without having to use something like a blockchain explorer)

To not have the same problem that we had in option 1 (doing multiple transactions for minting that would all validate), we have to have some unique value, that can never be used again, thus never allowing minting of this token again.

For this we can use the UTxO. Which is ALWAYS unique.

By only allowing one UTxO to mint, we will have a true NFT.

UTxO -&gt; Output of a transaction; Transaction ID + Index of the output of the transaction.

Because transactions are unique as well, so is our UTxO.

Now why are transactions unique?

Interestingly they wouldn't be, if it wasn't for fees.

Without them, we could have a transaction with 0 inputs, and only outputs without value.

Such a transaction could exist several times; but because of the fees, we always need an input to provide the funds to pay the fees for the transaction.

And as soon as we have an input, that input must come from somewhere, it must come from a previous UTxO; thus, as soon as we have fees, we can never have the same UTxO more than once.

## Plutus NFT Script

Open the file `NFT.hs` in plutus-pioneer-program/code/week05/src/Week05/NFT.hs

Lines 34 - 48

    {-# INLINABLE mkPolicy #-}
    mkPolicy :: TxOutRef -&gt; TokenName -&gt; ScriptContext -&gt; Bool
    mkPolicy oref tn ctx = traceIfFalse ""UTxO not consumed""   hasUTxO           &amp;&amp;
                           traceIfFalse ""wrong amount minted"" checkMintedAmount
      where
        info :: TxInfo
        info = scriptContextTxInfo ctx
    
        hasUTxO :: Bool
        hasUTxO = any (\i -&gt; txInInfoOutRef i == oref) $ txInfoInputs info
    
        checkMintedAmount :: Bool
        checkMintedAmount = case flattenValue (txInfoForge info) of
            [(cs, tn', amt)] -&gt; cs  == ownCurrencySymbol ctx &amp;&amp; tn' == tn &amp;&amp; amt == 1
            _                -&gt; False

We will be parameterizing both `TxOutRef` and `TokenName` to be used in our policy.

`TxOutRef` is a value in `TxInfo` from our `ScriptContext`:

    type TxInfo :: *
    data TxInfo
      = TxInfo {txInfoInputs :: [TxInInfo],
                ...

`TxInInfo` in `txInfoInputs` is defined as:

    type TxInInfo :: *
    data TxInInfo
      = TxInInfo {txInInfoOutRef :: TxOutRef, txInInfoResolved :: TxOut}

There is our TxOutRef, which in other words is an identifier for our UTxO, which is exactly what we need.

Our defined `hasUTxO` function, checks if the TxOutRef provided as parameter to the policy, is in our `txInfoInputs`, by using the `any` function. If not, throw an error with `traceIfFalse`.

    any :: Foldable t =&gt; (a -&gt; Bool) -&gt; t a -&gt; Bool

Lars gives us an example how `any` could be used (which is pretty self explanatory):

    any even [2 :: Int, 3, 5, 7]
    True
    
    any even [1 :: Int, 3, 5, 7]
    False

Now with the `checkMintedAmount` function, we will limit the amount of possible minted tokens to 1. Guaranteeing an NFT. (also with `traceIfFalse` for error handling)

We'll use `flattenValue` to receive a flattened list of triples for all values in the `txInfoForge` variable, (Chapter Combining `Value`'s), which we'll compare to our custom list containing (CurrencySymbol, TokenName, Amount), in this case (cs, tn, 1) (the amount 1 is the important thing here, which is going to prevent anyone of minting more than one of this token).

We do have one Chicken-egg-problem here: our `CurrencySymbol`.

This hash is computed from the policy script, but in order to run this script, we first need the `CurrencySymbol`...

For this we have the function `ownCurrencySymbol`, with this we get access to the `CurrencySymbol` during execution of our Policy Script.

We just need to feed it our ScriptContext, and it'll give us the correct `CurrencySymbol`.

Lines 50 - 59

    policy :: TxOutRef -&gt; TokenName -&gt; Scripts.MonetaryPolicy
    policy oref tn = mkMonetaryPolicyScript $
        $$(PlutusTx.compile [|| \oref' tn' -&gt; Scripts.wrapMonetaryPolicy $ mkPolicy oref' tn' ||])
        `PlutusTx.applyCode`
        PlutusTx.liftCode oref

        PlutusTx.liftCode tn
    
    curSymbol :: TxOutRef -&gt; TokenName -&gt; CurrencySymbol
    curSymbol oref tn = scriptCurrencySymbol $ policy oref tn

Here we just parameterize both our oref and tn (TxOutRef / TokenName).

We're done with the on-chain part.

For the off-chain part we need the Contract / Endpoints:

Lines 61 - 63

    type NFTSchema =
        BlockchainActions
            .\/ Endpoint ""mint"" TokenName

For the endpoints we now only need the TokenName.

Lines 65 - 77

    mint :: TokenName -&gt; Contract w NFTSchema Text ()
    mint tn = do
        pk    &lt;- Contract.ownPubKey
        utxos &lt;- utxoAt (pubKeyAddress pk)
        case Map.keys utxos of
            []       -&gt; Contract.logError @String ""no utxo found""
            oref : _ -&gt; do
                let val     = Value.singleton (curSymbol oref tn) tn 1
                    lookups = Constraints.monetaryPolicy (policy oref tn) &lt;&gt; Constraints.unspentOutputs utxos
                    tx      = Constraints.mustForgeValue val &lt;&gt; Constraints.mustSpendPubKeyOutput oref
                ledgerTx &lt;- submitTxConstraintsWith @Void lookups tx
                void $ awaitTxConfirmed $ txId ledgerTx
                Contract.logInfo @String $ printf ""forged %s"" (show val)

Because a wallet can only spent it's own UTxOs, the UTxO used for our NFT restrictions, must be done via a UTxO at our own address.

This can be done with `utxoAt` defined as (in Plutus.Contract):

    Address -&gt; Contract w s e Ledger.AddressMap.UtxoMap

Basically when calling this with an address, we'd get a UtxoMap back, which contains all the UTxOs at this address.

For our purpose (since all UTxOs are unique), it doesn't matter which one we pick; anyone is fine.

Now whats an 'address', we don't really need that now. All we need to now is we can call the function `pubKeyAddress` which will turn a Public Key into an Address; which is exactly what we need.

`pk &lt;- Contract.ownPubKey` will contain our public key, which we will then turn into an address using the `pubKeyAddress`, running it through the `utxoAt` function, to get a UtxoMap with all our UTxOs; since we don't need all the values it provides, but only the UTxO keys, we'll use the Maps.keys function to only get the UTxO Keys.

We'll start a `case`, where if the UtxoMap is empty, just return an error

    [] -&gt; Contract.logError @String ""no utxo found""

Now if we look back at our constraints-creation functions; they all start with ""must"" e.g. `mustForgeValue`, `mustPayToPublicKey` etc.

We already used `mustForgeValue`, now we need the `mustSpendPubKeyOutput` constraint, defined as:

    mustSpendPubKeyOutput :: TxOutRef -&gt; TxConstraints i o

It takes an TxOutRef and returns a constraint. Awesome. Exactly what we need.

Since we already have the `mustForgeValue` constraint, the question is: ""how do we combine constraints?"".

Constraints are of type `Semigroup`, which lets us combine multiple `Semigroup`s by using the `&lt;&gt;` operator.

    tx = Constraints.mustForgeValue val &lt;&gt; Constraints.mustSpendPubKeyOutput

## Testing

Lines 88 - 95

    test :: IO ()
    test = runEmulatorTraceIO $ do
        let tn = ""ABC""
        h1 &lt;- activateContractWallet (Wallet 1) endpoints
        h2 &lt;- activateContractWallet (Wallet 2) endpoints
        callEndpoint @""mint"" h1 tn
        callEndpoint @""mint"" h2 tn
        void $ Emulator.waitNSlots 1

These are just simplified, we just removed.. well.. almost everything. Fixed value for our TokenName and no way to specify the amount.

If we now run our test (which you of course could also run in the Playground), it would return:

    Final balances
    Wallet 1:
        {9d969e597d45fcd1732ce255e12a97599e883f924b4565fc3a2407bc08d34524, ""ABC""}: 1
        {, """"}: 99999990
    Wallet 2:

personalfinance,Is refinancing a smart move for me?,"Right now refinance rates are pretty good and I am very interested in refinancing. I technically have 20 years left on my mortgage although I've been paying extra for the past 6 or 7 years at least. My current rate is 4.375% and I have the option to buy points to get a 1.8% rate while cashing out about $15k to pay off an auto loan and pay for the points and what not at closing. Without the points the interest rate would be 2.375% which is also good being a 2% drop from my original. I'm tempted to get the ball rolling on this tomorrow and the guy I'm working with seems to be on the up and up with no high pressure or ass kissing. Buy his math I'd be saving over $50k in interest versus if I kept going the way I have been for the past 10 years. Does this sound like a good idea?  Am I overlooking something?  My monthly payments will also be a little less and I'd continue to pay what I've been paying at a little over $100 extra/month.

personalfinance,Quick Sanity Check: Last year's taxes I owed federal and got a refund from state. This year it's the reverse. Did I mess something up?,"I've been doing my own taxes using Credit Karma for the past couple years. I haven't had any problems with them so far, though I'm a bit suspicious with this year's results. This year (2020) I ended up getting a small refund from federal and owing on state (California). Last year (2019) it was the reverse, I owed on federal and got a refund from state.

I'm not sure if this is normal and perhaps I'm just overthinking it, or if I should look into it further. The only difference that really changed for me from last year (2019) to this year (2020) is that I got a pretty big promotion and made more money (I made about $80k in 2019, and made about $95k in 2020, so about $15k more). I also made about $2k more from stocks as well (all long-term gains). Other than that, everything else was roughly the same (same withholdings, etc.).

My only guess is maybe California just has a higher tax rate once you reach a certain income level causing the reverse, or maybe there were changes to the 2020 tax laws due to Covid-19 that I just wasn't aware of.

Anyway, I've never seen this before, so this is just more of a quick sanity check to see if maybe I'm missing something or if I'm just overthinking it and I should go ahead and click the submit button already.

Numbers for reference:

2019 Federal: Owed $71

2019 State: Refund $61

2020 Federal: Refund $79

2020 State: Owe $167

EDIT: I guess the main question that I'm asking is, why do I owe less at the federal level after making more money (that's the part that confuses me)?

EDIT: Looks like I found the answer. The actual amount that was withheld for Federal was much, much higher than I expected even with the same withholding allowance of 1. I learned something new and I can move on now. Thanks everyone.",finance

My question since I can't find much information about it and, from my understanding, it's federally illegal in the US to purchase due to sanctions is: since crypto pricing is supply vs demand (in the most basic form) couldn't we, the crypto enthusiasts, help at all by creating a pump to the price by buying into it? It would definitely need to be a trust system that we don't subsequently crash it by having everyone sell.  


Once again, sorry for the ignorance on the situation in relation to the coin (learned a lot on the socio-political reasons). Do everyday people even use the coin?

CryptoCurrency,"Bitcoin's correction is a good thing. Every correction brings more adopters, holders, believers in, and removes more panic sellers.","**tl;dr: I love crashes. It means I can buy more.**

**In the chart below we can see Bitcoin outpacing the 2016-2018 cycle**. Several mathematical and economic theories suggest that this shouldn't happen. You could call what's happening *unsustainable growth*—growth that is influenced greatly by external forces: COVID-19, mass fiat printing, institutional involvement, and social media influencers among others.

**The same happened in 2012-2013 as the market outpaced the 2009-2010 cycle.** Again, this type of growth is unsustainable, so what happened in 2012-2013 to cause a *bubble?*

* (March 16, 2013) Residents of Cyprus [struggled to gain access to cash](http://money.cnn.com/2013/03/27/news/economy/cyprus-capital-controls/index.html?iid=EL) and the situation caused doubts of the banking system all over Europe.

This was due to events occurring in Greece related to their monetary policy. In Bitcoin's early days, news like this was enough to force a bubble. Today, Bitcoin rises and falls at much smaller degrees but may still be susceptible to the same laws that make sense of the world, humans, and markets. We could see it continue to correct or rise from here onwards.

**On a personal note: I like to think a big correction would be a good thing.** Lots of people were getting into the market with the notion that they'll be rich in a matter of days. People who didn't realize this quickly enough moved on to more volatile coins—hence, Bitcoin's three-month consolidation. Going as low as \~$43k, Bitcoin is now reentering a price when Elon first mentioned his involvement (\~$38k). Elon's influence is leaving Bitcoin and so will a bulk of his followers. Old money who wanted out, and new panic holders, they are gone.

# But someone needs to buy their sell orders, who buys them?

**Adopters, holders, believers in this space and technology.** People who have wanted in for a while. These people aren't selling anytime soon, because they believe that this thing is going to revolutionize the world. Every crash brings more of these people in and removes more panic sellers. A decrease in the number of people waiting to jump off the ship; a new floor is established.

# Now a higher percentage of holders believe in the product they are holding 

And they are unwilling to sell for the panic prices of the last week—less volatility and more sensibility. This is why crypto keeps bouncing back from pullbacks and reaches new higher ceilings and floors each time. 

# Rather than seeing the correction as a disaster see it as a time to start fresh.

CryptoCurrency,How come USDC won’t inevitably become the main future cryptocurrency?,"Probably a noob question, but I have been wondering this. 

Crypto is the future. It’s absolutely going to happen and I don’t doubt it. However, volatility is wild in crypto and I personally wouldn’t want to use it for general day-to-day use. I understand there are many uses for crypto and different coins for different purposes. However, I must not be the only one feeling that this might be getting more complicated than it should be? 

Why can’t we just use a crypto like USDC or something similar? I know it isn’t technically decentralized, but wouldn’t the federal government either:
A) Create their own crypto.
B) Somehow outlaw crypto or impose unfair regulations. I know this option seems a bit malicious/extreme, but I would imagine the government needs to somehow impose control on the people rather than risk a collapse in the US dollar.

I guess I am wondering why wouldn’t we just do USDC? it seems to be the most logical solution for the people (less volatility) and the government (more control and legitimacy). Perhaps I am missing some key concepts that would totally dismiss this idea. Welcome to hear all opinions on the matter!

Edit: 
Seems a lot of people are saying it is because it is tied to the US dollar, thus would suffer inflationary implications et al. 
My counterpoint: This allows for a regulatory body to step in and ensure full transparency and thus reduce the likelihood that the fed would run the money printer endlessly as it has in the past. With this being the case, wouldn’t the US currency be even further strengthened?",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Using a personal loan for home loan down payment?,"Some background first. I am buying a new house. Only my name will be on the mortgage but I will add my wife's name to the title. I have cash for putting 15% down but would prefer to put 20% down instead because I'm getting a better interest rate. I plan to sell the house I currently live in after I move to the new house and that will generate some cash but obviously I won't get that cash until I buy the new house and sell the current house. So the question is how do I get the extra cash right now to afford the 20% downpayment instead of the 15% that I have cash for in my bank account. One idea I have is that my wife can get a personal loan and we can use as that as the extra cash I need for the 20% downpayment. In about a month, we will move to the new house, sell the current house and pay the personal loan off so won't have to pay too much interest on the personal loan. I want to know if there are any legal issues with this approach? I know most mortgage companies won't allow personal loans to be the source of the down payment. But in this case my wife is taking the personal loan and giving the cash to me as a gift which I will use for my down payment. Is this ok to do ?

[ 2020 Top Ten Summary ](https://preview.redd.it/hazp9s1vjoz61.png?width=993&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0bcf5a73029e6bab6fc01c27eaa581038b20902b)

Welcome to the best performing of the four [Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/), by far.

The 2020 Top Ten Portfolio is a machine.  It picked up an additional 353% since the end of [March](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-15), 100% of this group is in the green, all have at least *triple digit price growth* with two cryptos in *four digit growth territory*. 

The **+952%** return of the Top Ten Index approach has *outperformed eight of the individual component cryptos contained within the Index.* It has also absolutely dwarfed the returns of the S&amp;P 500 over the same period of time (more on that below).

## April Movement Report, Ranking, and Dropouts

A lot of movement this month with 2020 Top Ten cryptos:

**Top Ten dropouts since January 2020:**  after sixteen months, 40% of the cryptos that[ started in the Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-ten-month-one/) have dropped out:  **EOS**, **BSV, Tezos,** and most recently **Litecoin** have been replaced by **Cardano,** **Polkadot, UNI,** and **Doge.**  Yes, **Doge.**

**EOS** and **BSV** are out of the Top *Twenty* and **XTZ**’s is out of the Top *Thirty.*

## April Winners and Losers 

***April Winners*** –  **XRP** (+172%) easily had the best month, followed distantly by **BNB**, up +78%

***April Losers*** –  For the first time in the 2020 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment, **Bitcoin** had the weakest monthly performance, down -5% in April.  

## Tally of Monthly Winners and Losers

After sixteen months, here’s a snapshot of the 2020 Top Ten Experiment’s monthly winners and losers:

[ 2020 Top Ten Ws and Ls ](https://preview.redd.it/bt828bp1koz61.png?width=334&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f27b845e5326ed40a61940f8c862cffb5d3b2dcd)

With four monthly victories, **ETH** has doubled the wins of the tied for second place **BTC, USDT,** **BNB, XRP,** and **Tezos.**   **Bitcoin’s** loss in April was its first of the 2020 Top Ten Crypto Experiment.

## Overall Update – BNB up over 4,000%, 100% of cryptos in triple digit positive territory, worst performer (EOS) still up +157%.

The 2020 Top Ten continue to outperform the other [Top Ten Crypto Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/) and this month pulled further ahead of the second place [2019 Top Ten Portfolio](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-28).    All cryptos (except **USDT** of course) are up at least triple digits and **Ethereum** and **Binance Coin** are up quadruple digits.

**BNB**’s gains since January 2020 have been off the chart. The initial $100 investment into **Binance Coin** is currently worth **$4,387**, a gain of +4,286%.   

In second is **Ethereum,** also in the quadruple digit gains club, up +2171%.

Besides **USDT**, the worst performer in the 2020 group is **EOS.**  But **EOS’** \+157% gains are over *five times the return of the stock market* over the same period of time (see below).

## Total Market Cap for the Entire Cryptocurrency Sector:

[ Total Crypto Market Cap since Jan 2020 ](https://preview.redd.it/dod3jr6bloz61.png?width=706&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4acd79fb59e3ad1f4f0bded1ed834ef7f0cf86df)

Over $286 billion dollars was added to the market in April. The crypto market is up **+1066%** over the sixteen month lifespan of the 2020 Top Ten Experiment.  For the seventh month in a row, the month-end market cap has set new highs for the 2020 Top Ten Experiment.   

If you were able to capture the entire crypto market since [January 2020](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-ten-month-one/) (+1066%), you’d be doing better than the Experiment’s Top Ten approach (+952%) and much, much, much better than the S&amp;P (+29%) over the same time period.  The index fund strategy has outperformed eight of the ten individual cryptos held within the index.   

## Bitcoin Dominance:

https://preview.redd.it/hjxsjdjiloz61.png?width=616&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a558732b66beec9ad65ede265e187efa3ca01005

A big drop for **BitDom** in April: this month’s 48.2% is the lowest level so far in the life of the 2020 Experiment, by far.  You’d have to go back to [last September](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-9/) to find the next lowest **BTC** dominance level.

## Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2020:

A massive jump in value for the 2020 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio in April.  The initial $1000 investment into the 2020 Top Ten Cryptos is now worth **$10,5236**, up +952% compared to +589% just [last month](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-15). After some time behind the [2019 Top Ten Portfolio](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-27), the 2020 Portfolio is now far and away the best performing of [the four Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/). 

Below is a month by month ROI of the 2020 Top Ten Experiment, to give you a sense of perspective and provide an overview as we go along:

[ Monthly ROI of the 2020 Top Ten Portfolio ](https://preview.redd.it/l1kai45oloz61.png?width=469&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81c04226916a79668710d422fa359502391035b5)

At +952%, it is another record ROI month for the 2020 Top Ten.  Although the portfolio has never experienced a red month, it has definitely seen ups and downs:  a little over a year ago in [March 2020](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-3/), this same portfolio saw a COVID induced low of +7%.

**Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios** 

So, where do we stand if we combine four years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-40): up +56% (total value $1,556)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-28): up +653% (total value $7,527)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-16): up +952% (total value $10,522)
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-4): up +393% (total value $4,927)

Taking the four portfolios together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line: 

**After a $4,000 investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$24,532** ($1,556 + $7,527 + $10,522 + $4,927).

**That’s up +513%** on the combined portfolios, another record high for the Top Ten Index Fund Experiment project, up from +333% last month.

Lost in the numbers? Here’s a table to help visualize the progress of the combined portfolios:

[ Combined ROI of all four Top Ten Experiments ](https://preview.redd.it/ytdcacnsloz61.png?width=571&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=576b9c78fed19e4f0dd652b059fd8ed14075d415)

***That’s a +513% gain by buying $1k of the cryptos that*** [***happen***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFptt7Cargc)***ed to be in the Top Ten on January 1st, 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021.***

## Top Ten Index Approach vs. All-In Approach

But what if I’d gone all in on only one Top Ten crypto for the past four years? While many have come and gone over the life of the experiment, five cryptos have started in Top Ten for all four years: **BTC, ETH, XRP, BCH,** and **LTC.** Let’s take a look:

[ If playing by the Experiment rules, all in on ETH would have been your best bet, by far.](https://preview.redd.it/56413mqvloz61.png?width=984&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c71724fa7ed7930346cf89f2c8debc3ad4075db4)

**ETH** is well in the lead and the still best “if-I-had-a-time-machine” choice.  As of today, $4,000 into Ethereum in $1k chunks on four consecutive New Year’s Days would be worth **$52,705**. That’s up **+1218%**. That’s nuts.

In second place, going all in on **Bitcoin** with $4,000 USD would have yielded **+638%**, turning the initial investment into **$29,530**.  

Third place? The Top Ten Index Fund approach!

As you might expect (as indexes are designed to mitigate risk), the **+513%** gains of the Top Ten Index Fund approach fall somewhere in between.  The Top Ten strategy isn’t keeping up with **ETH** or **BTC** but it is outperforming a hypothetical all-in investment in both **XRP, LTC,** and **BCH** by a healthy margin.

**Bitcoin Cash** would have been the worst four year all-in bet, but you’d still be +249%.  

So that’s the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments snapshot. Let’s take a look at how traditional markets are doing.

## Comparison to S&amp;P 500

I’m also tracking the S&amp;P 500 as part of my experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets. March saw yet another all time high for the S&amp;P.  The S&amp;P has returned +29% since January 1st, 2020.

[ S&amp;P, up +29&amp;#37; in 15 months ](https://preview.redd.it/e01j61j8moz61.png?width=682&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a615d5c29eca7e2918b08c76788fed1bc0be81b6)

Pretty amazing returns for a period of time largely dominated by a pandemic. This more than triples the 8%/year figure that many financial planners use for predicted annual market returns.  

That same [$1k I put into crypto](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-ten-month-one/) in January 2020 would be worth $1290 had it been redirected to the S&amp;P 500 instead. 

Crypto over the same time period? The 2020 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio is returning **+952%**. The initial $1k investment in crypto is now worth **$10,523**. 

***That’s a difference of $9,233***. 

***On a $1k investment!*** 

But that’s just 2020. What about in the longer term? What if I invested in the S&amp;P 500 the same way I did during the first four years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments since January 1st, 2018? What I like to call the world’s slowest dollar cost averaging method?  Here are the figures:

* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1564 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1670 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1290 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1110 today

So, taken together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line for a similar approach with the S&amp;P: 

**After four $1,000 investments into an S&amp;P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, my portfolio would be worth $5,634** ($1,564 + $1,670 + $1,290 + $1,110)

That is up **+41%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+513%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios, a difference of 472% ***in favor of crypto.*** 

To help provide perspective, here’s a quick look at the combined four year ROI for crypto vs. the S&amp;P up to this point.

[ Combined crypto vs. combined S&amp;P](https://preview.redd.it/pwk8urcgmoz61.png?width=619&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5fe76c1097361aee9a2227eb5ed089c499fa3d3)

That’s seven straight monthly wins and nine out of ten monthly victories for crypto.

## Conclusion:

Despite **Bitcoin’s** stagnation in April, the 2020 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio is approaching a four digit ROI.  With **Bitcoin** **Dominance** plummeting 10%, it’s starting to get interesting.  For those who weren’t around in 2017/2018, we’ve seen this movie before: **Bitcoin** pumps, alts follow, then all crash.  We’ll soon see if history repeats itself.

For those who have supported the Experiments over the years, thank you.  For those just getting into crypto, I hope these monthly reports can somehow help with perspective as you embark on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, think long term, don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose, and most importantly, enjoy the ride!

CryptoCurrency,"Is this the end of the bull run? No, for one very simple reason: interest rates are still at 0%","The stock market has been throwing a bit of a wobbly at the moment, the catalyst being inflation fears, but really the fear being interest rate rises.

_What's this got to do with crypto?_, I hear you ask. Check out this chart: https://imgur.com/7M2gsis

It shows BTC's historical price on a log scale on the top, and on the bottom is BTC's correlation coefficient with the S&amp;P500.

What you can clearly see is that in March 2020, we entered a period of the highest correlation in the history of Bitcoin. We like to think that this bull market is driven by the halving, but it's not. It's driven by the same thing that the stock market has been driven by, which is cheap debt. Billions have been pumped into the market due to historically easy money.

The sell-off affected Bitcoin quite severely, we're down around 35% from the peak at the moment, and it was clearly exacerbated by Elon Musk's Twitter antics. But, there is no reason to assume that this bull market has ended, because the conditions that were in place during the bull run - and that caused the bull run of the stock market too - are still in place. Nothing has changed. There will be no immediate interest rate rises, as the Fed and Treasury have signalled (in fact, there's too much debt to raise rates, so it's likely they'll put it off until it's impossible to do so, but that's another story).

CryptoCurrency,Coins and tokens with a different kind of appreciation,"Questions for smart people: 

BTC’s main rationales for appreciation seems to be 1. First to market and related momentum in market cap and fame 2. Its value proposition, or best function currently, is store of value.

Are there coins/tokens that could have other features to provide holders with value? Something equivalent to dividends or royalty payments or interest? 

I’m aware of staking, which is similar to loan interest. I’d also like to ask if coins can realistically be staked forever, like will CAKE be stakeable five years from now? It seems like a central feature of CAKE, but is staking a *permanent* integrated feature? Also, will the “interest rates” stay as high as they are as adoption of those coins increases and more capital is available to stake? Seems like no. 

But besides staking, what else is out there (functions, integration into our lives, and/or actual coins) for crypto to deliver payments or value besides appreciation of principal? Something that might justify literally a 20 year hodl.",cryptocurrency
stocks,Help Me Understand CME Futures And Inflation,"So right now, the mainstream narrative is that inflation is going to run red hot mostly due to a rally in commodity prices. This inflation has the potential to be more than transitory, meaning it lasts more than a couple of quarters at most and will result in forcing the FED to raise rates and crash growth stocks. This is why apparently, tech stocks are underperforming while value, or more specifically, manufacturing and mining companies outperform (look at XME for example). 

My question is if that is the case, then why are steel futures for U.S. Midwest Domestic Hot-Rolled Coil Steel going down [CME Link](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/ferrous/hrc-steel_quotes_globex.html)? Right now they peak in June at $1,520 a tonne before steadily going down for the foreseeable future.  

Similar things can be said about other commodities such as copper, which remains relatively steady before gradually going down going into next year [Copper Link](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/base/copper_quotes_globex.html). 

On the agriculture side, major commodities like corn appear to be peaking in the near future as well [Corn Futures](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/grain-and-oilseed/corn_quotes_globex.html). 

So taking all of this into account, it would appear that the shape of the futures curves would indicate that commodity prices would peak in near future before gradually going down as supply meets demand.

investing,"When interest rates go up, do stocks and bonds get hit the same?","Obviously there is a lot of uncertainty right now and going forward in the markets (inflation, presumed high equity valuations, Covid/variants, re-opening, wars, cyber-attacks, the Fed tapering bond purchases, the imminent invasion of an army of meth-addicted rabbit warriors from the Xarthrax System), but assuming that all of those things are neutral, which asset class gets hit harder by an interest rate increase (if/when it happens)?

I've read that equities usually take a hit because it becomes more expensive for companies to borrow (so they borrow and invest less and are therefore estimated to have earnings decrease relative to some previous amount/projection, or they borrow the same but have to earn more of it to pay it back, which is harder for them to do or siphons profits from dividends/re-investment et cetera).

I've also read bond values in general take a hit because people don't want to hold a 10 year bond at 1.5% when they can hold a 10 year bond at 2% so they sell the lower-yield bond and there are fewer buyers so the price goes down and all that. Different bond durations react differently, but they all decline, at least temporarily.

If these two understandings are generally true, which usually gets hit worse from an interest rate increase, stocks or bonds? Or do they both get hit the same? Is there a duration element to the decline in value that each experiences, or is that the same as well? Basically, all else being equal, simply from a growth point of view, which is better to hold when interest rates go up?

personalfinance,"31 years old with 12k in savings, making $55k annually. Now what?","Hello good people of r/personalfinance

I have been lurking around the community for sometime now. I have read through the side bar of links, but I am having a hard time deciding what to prioritize now, since I am new at this.

As the title says, I am 31 years old. During the last year, I finally got to a point where I am not living pay check to paycheck. I paid of my high interest credit card, and have saved up enough of an emergency fund to last about 6 months.

Basic Stats:

* 55k - annual salary
* 46k - mortgage debt (5.2% interest rate)
* 10,800 - auto loan (6.79% interest rate)
* 8,000 - student loan debt (not sure of the interest rate off hand but its high)
* $1272 - Monthly Expenses (not including gas &amp; groceries at about $400/month)

I will be eligible for a non-matching 401k through work after 1 year of employment. I also have looked into opening a ROTH IRA, but haven't yet.

What should my next step be? Basically, I have about $1000 a month that is not spoken for, and I will spend it on Amazon if I don't get a game plan.

EDITED TO ADD: Obviously, I want to pay off the debt. I guess my question is more should I focus on aggressively paying off my debt, begin retirement savings, or do some of both. 

Thanks in advance for all your kindness, patience and input.",finance

personalfinance,I can't afford a car I was pressured into buying,"Long story short, I was pressured into buying a car that I couldn't really afford. My current vehicle at the time was barely worth $1000 and needed almost $3000 in repairs. I didn't want to go through with that so I started looking into financing a new car. I knew what payments I could afford and I was trying so hard to be steadfast when it came to getting what I could afford, but then my gf, who cosigned, got involved and pressured my into taking something way out of my price range because a.) i think she thought we was getting a good deal, and b.)I was told (which i figured was a lie b/c car dealer) that I would be able to refinance in about six months. It's been almost a year now, and no one will refinance me, so I'm struggling to pay a $436 dollar car payment + rent every month with only about $1300 a month on a good month. After utilities and other bills I almost have nothing left. If you can help, that'd be really awesome. I've talked to a family friend who is also a car dealer and he basically says I'm fucked. I owe 23,413.89 with a 5-7% interest rate. So far the highest offer has been from carmax with 20,200, but I haven’t tried carvana yet. It’s in good shape. Runs well. There’s some damage to the front bumper because of a mishap in a parking deck on a rainy day.

EDIT: to be clear, my gf thought she was helping. She's not like, mean about it or anything. She's just better with money all around, and while I'm really really trying to get better, it's really hard when there's so much on me. She has better credit than me, but makes less than me.

UPDATE: So as of right now my gameplan is this.

1. See about the possibility of selling to a dealership. So far my highest offer is Carmax with 20,200, with Carvana following at 18,376, and Vroom being the least at around 14,000.

2. If I can't find someone to help with the remaining money on the car, I will try to refinance with a digital credit union as someone else suggested. 

3. If THAT doesn't work, I will try to sell privately. 

Any other suggestions?",finance

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, May 17, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, May 17, 2021**

The market fell modestly on Monday, as concerns over rising inflation, marked by a higher than expected print in the April Consumer Price Index (CPI), continued. Technology stocks continued their volatility, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) going as low as 1.42% down intraday before recovering and closing 0.59% down. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed 0.26% down and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed.

Stocks are coming into this week on the heels of an extremely choppy trading period recently, which saw the SPY pulling back 4% before recovering Thursday and Friday of last week after the April CPI and Producer Price Index (PPI) came in higher than expected. The CPI, which measures a basket of goods as well as energy and housing costs, rose 4.2% from a year ago, compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 3.6% increase. The monthly gain was 0.8%, against the expected 0.2%. Excluding the volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI (this is the main measure of inflation) increased 3% compared to the same period in 2020 and 0.9% on a monthly basis. The respective estimates were 2.3% and 0.3%. 

The PPI, which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output, rose 6.2% compared to April 2020 and 0.6% monthly increase. The core PPI, which excludes volatile items like food and energy rose 4.6% year over year and 0.7% in April. Economists polled by FactSet were expecting a 0.3% monthly increase in April and 3.8% year over year. This is the biggest jump since 2014. In tandem with the CPI report, this shows prices for both consumers and producers have increased more than expected. Market participants are concerned that high levels of inflation may cause the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. 

While the readings in inflation definitely are not good, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be “transitory” as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, “We want to see a string of months like that \[like in March\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, there’s a very large group of people who are not.” The April Job Report bolsters Powell’s argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy. 

In addition, at a separate event in April, Powell said that quantitative easing would likely taper “well before” the interest rate is increased. He said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.” In short, while the inflationary readings are not great, I’m fairly confident fears that the Federal Reserve will tighten policy sooner-than-expected are overblown. Just my two cents. 

There are several factors, in my opinion, contributing to the rise of inflation. First, after the collapse in prices during the height of the pandemic and lockdowns, it is not surprising to see prices comparatively much higher than last year as demand and consumer spending surges as the US economy reopens. 

Second are widespread supply shortages and manufacturing bottlenecks in key materials, limiting production capability and driving up delivery time, and as a result, driving up prices. One prominent example you may be familiar with is the global shortage in semiconductors, which is causing automobile manufacturers across the industry to limit production. A similar situation is happening across an array of consumer goods. As the economy in the US reopens thanks to effective distribution of the vaccine, supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand, which of course, causes a rise in prices. As the economic reopening continues and supply in various consumer industries is able to catch up, inflation is expected to slow down. In a nutshell, this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures as expected and transitory. In an April 28 meeting, Jerome Powell said, “Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.” 

Third are historic levels of fiscal spending by the Federal Government in the form of stimulus and other benefits. Federal debt—incurred when the government sells Treasury bonds, bills, notes, and other securities to cover its costs—recently hit an all-time high. However, policymakers are not concerned with the debt at current levels. Jerome Powell said, “Given the low level of interest rates, there's no issue about the United States being able to service its debt at this time or in the foreseeable future.” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen echoed a similar sentiment in a recent interview, saying “Even with inflation data coming in hotter than economists expected, long-term bond yields declined, indicating the market has been anticipating inflationary pressures for a while and are reassured by the Federal Reserve’s commitment to move slowly when raising rates.

personalfinance,Should I get more money from my tax refund?,"I folks this is one of my first reddit posts and I’m on mobile so I’m sorry for any errors. I’m a full time student but I’ve worked part time this past year so I made some money, just not a lot. I’m filing my taxes on TurboTax and it says my federal return is $119 and my state is $76. The problem is I used the H&amp;R Block return calculator before starting and it said my estimated return would be ~$1,000. This is a big difference and I’m worried I’m doing something wrong. Or would this be just a difference because of the calculator’s inaccuracy.

Edit: Thanks everyone for the quick response! I half expected to not hear anything so this was an incredibly pleasant surprise. What I’m noticing the difference is what H&amp;R Block has listed as a “Recovery Rebate Credit” which I’m gathering is what you get if you didn’t get a stimulus check (however could be very wrong). I think the difference is because I am claimed as a dependent still (I’m 20 and going into my senior year of college). So if I’m claimed as a dependent, I don’t think I qualify to receive a stimulus check. Is this correct?",finance
personalfinance,I can't figure out how to amend my 1040 that I filed,"Edit: Thank you all so much, I didn't realize I could manually write the year into my 1040-X. I really appreciate your help.



I recently e-filed my taxes using TurboTax, but they severely messed up my taxes, adding $11,000 to my earned wages when I never made close to that amount. 

Turbotax customer support was a complete joke, so I don't want to ever use them again. Aswell amending my return on their website doesn't even let me review my own 1040-X before filing it. 

So, I am trying to manually file a 1040-X to amend my earned wages to the $2,200 I made in 2020. My issue is that on the IRS website, the 1040-X pdf only allows for 2019 and before, not 2020. 

Can I not amend my returns until a year has passed? Should I just pay the federal and state taxes I don't genuinely owe? I'm thought I was understanding how to amend my taxes, but now I'm just confused and worried I will have to spend $600 on state and federal taxes.

investing,Historical look at inflation (CPI) spikes over past 30 years,"CPI spikes in past 30 years versus CPI one year after the spike:

October 1990: 6.4%, drop to 2.8% one year later

January 2001: 3.7%, drop to to 1.2% one year later

September 2005: 4.7%, drop to 2.0% one year later

July 2008: 5.5%, drop to -2% one year later

September 2011: 3.8%, drop to 1.9% one year later

CPI spike in 2021 is likely “transitory” as suggested by the Fed, due to economic reopening and supply chain constraints caused by last year. We are also still far from full employment and the tech driven deflationary forces are not going away.

Also keep in mind that the current ongoing inflation is procyclical: prices in the US have risen rapidly because the economy reopened rapidly. This is not the same as the countercyclical inflation of 1970s. Over the past 30 years, the SP500 has performed most strongly during periods of rising growth and rising procyclical inflation.

personalfinance,Cash-out refinance to invest?,"I was wondering what the personalfinance hivemind might think about the situation I'm in.
Have a house where I am currently refinancing to a 2.75 30y fixed rate (including 4500 in lender credits)

Appraisal just came in and it is, somewhat predictably, a high value. 

I was thinking to do a cash-out refi instead of a rate-and-term, take out ~100k in cash to bring up the mortgage to 80 percent of the new value.  I could afford this with my monthly budget but it would be tighter, around half my net pay after taking out all taxes/401k/hsa/roth contributions.  The rate would stay the same but I'd have to pay 1k in points instead of receiving a 4500 lender credit.  (or I could get a 2.875 rate with a 2k lender credit).

My thinking was that, because the loan interest rate is so low, it makes more sense to grab the cash and then invest it (index fund, rental property, etc) rather than keep it in the house piggy bank.  Inflation is high these days, so I wasn't looking to keep much in cash - but I did want to increase my emergency fund slightly before investing the rest.

Do people think this is a good idea or is it better to keep the LTV lower and stick to a rate and term refinance?

CryptoCurrency,Tax loss harvesting. One method to legally reduce your taxes (in US),"**DISCLAIMER:**  *This post is not financial or legal advice and should be considered educational only.  It is intended to get you thinking about tax loss harvesting but you should consult other resources and not rely on this post alone for financial planning.  Tax liability can vary based on circumstances and it is impossible to cover all possible circumstances in a single post.  If this is a life changing amount of crypto and thus a life changing amount of taxes I strongly recommend you retain the services of a CPA.*

# What is tax loss harvesting?

Tax loss harvesting is simply selling crypto that you want to continue to hold but which currently has an unrealized loss and then rebuying it.  **You sell while you are down and then immediately rebuy.**  That ""locks in"" the loss while you still keep the crypto and benefit from any future price appreciation.

In the US taxes code gains/losses are either unrealized or realized.  Gains/losses are unrealized until you sell/trade/spend a crypto and unrealized gains/losses do not affect your tax liability for the current tax year.  If you are ""up $2,000"" on your ETH holdings but haven't yet sold/traded it that is an unrealized gained.  Only by selling/trading/spending crypto do you make a gain or loss realized and thus reported for the current tax year on your schedule D.

As a hypothetical situation lets say so far this year you have $20,000 in net realized gains.  When you file your 2021 tax return you will pay taxes on that $20,000.  How much will depend on if they are long term or short term gains and your income bracket.  Lets assume for this example it is short term gains and you are in the 25% bracket. That means you will be looking at $5K in extra federal taxes (plus whatever your state rate is).

Lets say you also hold some crypto that currently has an unrealized loss (current price is less than purchasing price). For this example you bought 1 BTC at $64,000 (ouch) and right now it is trading at $44,000 so you have a $20,000 loss.  You can't deduct that loss from your gains because it is unrealized.

**However you could right now sell that 1 BTC for $44,000 lock in a $20,000 loss for the 2021 tax year and then immediately rebuy it.  You still have have roughly 1 BTC** (you will pay fees which will slightly reduce your holdings unless you have some cash available to cover the difference).   So for the current tax year you had $20,000 in existing net realized gains plus this new $20,000 realized loss resulting in $0 in net realized gains and thus $0 in capital gains taxes due for 2021.

# What about the 'wash sale' rule?

This strategy can't be used for stocks because there is a regulation call the 'wash sale' rule in the IRS code section 1091 which says any sale of a security for a loss followed by a buy of the same security within 30 days does not count as a loss.  It is as if the sell and rebuy never happened.  You can try to tax loss harvest with stocks but you would need to wait 30 days between the sell and rebuy and the stock could gain significantly while you wait making it problematic and risky.

[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1091](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1091)

However section 1091 specifically limits the 30 day ""wash sale"" rule to ""*stocks and securities*"" (likely because it was written 60 years prior to crypto currencies).  The IRS has ruled that crypto is property not a security thus the wash sale rule doesn't apply to crypto and you can sell and rebuy without any waiting period.

[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-14-21.pdf](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-14-21.pdf)

Changing section 1091 to cover crypto currencies and other non-security assets would require new legislation.  Although that could be done by congress at some point in the future, right now in 2021 it doesn't apply to crypto.  **The lack of a wash sale rule on crypto is what makes this powerful technique to delay taxes possible.**

# Can I lock in more losses than I have in gains?

Yes.  Any excess losses just roll forward to future years where they can offset capital gains.  As an example say you have $20K in gains and you create a $30K loss.  First the the loss will offset the $20K in gains resulting in no taxes from trading.  Next you can deduct a maximum of $3K against your regular income reducing your taxes from income/wages.  Finally the remaining ""excess"" $7K will roll forward to 2022 to offset any capital gains.  If you have no capital gains in 2022 then it would keep rolling forward to 2023, 2024, 2025 until you eventually have capital gains to offset.

# Aren't losses limited to $3,000 on your tax return?

No. This is a common misconception and goes beyond tax loss harvesting.  **Your capital losses are limited to net loss of $3K.  That is to say $3K more than your capital gains in a given year not a static $3K.** So if you have $100K in capital gains and $120K in capital losses, then the first $100K in losses wipes out all your capital gains, the next $3K you can deduct against your regular income, the last $17K you can't use this year but it rolls forward to future years.

# So tax loss harvesting makes my taxes disappear?

No.  It merely delays you paying taxes.   Someday you will sell that crypto which you sold and rebought and hopefully it will have gone up in price.  So when you sell you will have a gain and end up paying the ""delayed"" taxes as well.

If we look at the example above you bought 1 BTC for $64K and then later sold and rebought it for $44K.  You harvested a $20K loss in 2021.  However lets imagine in 3 years you sell that 1 BTC for $200K.   If you hadn't done the tax loss harvesting you would have a $134K gain ($200K - $64K).   If you did the tax loss harvesting you would have a $154K gain ($200K - $44K).  Note it is $20K larger gain which is exactly the amount of gains you avoided paying taxes on in 2021.

# Wait so if I still have to pay taxes someday how does that help?

Delaying taxes in most circumstances is very financially beneficial.  In our example you avoided paying $5K in taxes in 2021 meaning you could buy $5K more crypto this year.  That crypto helps to grow your portfolio quicker.  Any money not spent today on taxes can be used to improve your net worth.

I would gladly pay the IRS all my 2021 taxes in 2025 if they would let me.  There are very few situations where you can legally just delay taxes without interest or penalties which makes this an incredibly powerful technique.  Yes someday though you will still have to pay the taxes.

# When should I not use tax lost harvesting?

There are some situations where tax loss harvesting could increase your taxes.

1. If your taxable income for the year is less than $40K ($80K if married) you should not harvest to avoid any long term capital gains because they are already taxed at 0%.  You can still harvest enough losses to delay any short term capital gains.  If you only have long term capital gains and income below $40K ($80K if married) you should not use this strategy at all in the current year.
2. If you currently have a long term realized capital gains that you want to offset and you feel you won't **keep the crypto you are harvesting for at least one year after rebuying it.**  Understand that when you sell and rebuy the crypto you reset the 1 year capital gain clock.  So if currently you have a long term capital gain taxed at say 15% (most common) and you harvest a loss to delay paying taxes in 2021 but the crypto you sell and rebuy you only hold for six months then the gain when you sell in 2022 will be taxed as a short term capital gain which could be \~25%.  Generally speaking delaying the tax but paying a much higher rate is not a good trade.  On the other hand if you hold the ""harvested"" crypto for a year (or more) after rebuying it then it also would be taxed at the same 15% you avoided meaning no increase in the tax rate.
3. Related to #2 is you aren't sure you will be able to hold for a year after rebuying or just are concerned that you might not.  In that case a conservative way to use this is to pay any long term capital gains (lower rate) now and offset just the short term capital gains.  You won't delay all the taxes you could but you won't ever be replacing long term gains with short term gains.
4. You anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in the future.   Lets say you are a student right now but will have a significantly higher income in the coming years.  You would be avoiding taxes at a low rate today for a higher rate tomorrow.  That may not be ideal. Another situation is you are currently single but will be getting married soon and your spouse has a significantly higher income than you.  Your tax rates filing jointly are likely to increase.  The higher and the more stable your income is now the more advantageous this method is.  Anything that could cause your income to rise significantly faster than the rate of inflation or cause your deductions to decline in the future is something to consider.

# What if I bought crypto at multiple prices?

This can still be used but gets a little more complex.  You are allowed to choose the costing method when declaring trades (FIFO, LIFO, HIFO).  You need to ensure the costing method you use will sell the crypto with the highest price that usually means HIFO or LIFO costing method.  The IRS allows you to pick the method used to select which coins are sold however you need to keep good records and you need to be consistent.  If you are using software to assist you ensure it either allows you to pick the costing method or the costing method it uses will result in your high priced coins to be the ones that are sold.  See this article on costing methods:

[https://cryptotrader.tax/blog/cryptocurrency-tax-calculations-fifo-and-lifo-costing-methods-explained](https://cryptotrader.tax/blog/cryptocurrency-tax-calculations-fifo-and-lifo-costing-methods-explained#:~:text=FIFO%20(first%2Din%20first%2Dout)%2C%20LIFO%20)

# What about fees?

Exchange fees are a cost to engage in this tax avoidance move.   Generally speaking if your losses are small it may not be worth it because exchange fees are usually a fixed percentage.  Say your exchange charges 0.35% so 0.70% round trip.  Paying 0.70% to delay taxes due to a large loss is likely worthwhile but not for delaying a small loss.  In the example above the hodler had bought at $64K and harvested at $44K .  If he bought at $45K and harvested at $44K then fees would greatly cut into the potential benefits.  In both cases the fees would be $308 (0.7% \* $44K) but in the first case paying $308 in fees would allow you to delay $20K in gains while in the second case it would only delay $1K in gains.

# What if it keeps dipping?

You can just keep selling and rebuying.  In the example above the holder bought 1 BTC at $64K when it dipped to $44K be sold and rebought it.  If BTC crashed further to $28K he could just sell and rebuy it again and lock in more losses.  Due to trading fees you likely don't want to do this too often but instead on a significant move downward.

# Can I do this at anytime?

Yes although you need to have a realized capital gains for the year and an unrealized capital loss to harvest.  **They also have to be in the same tax year.**  If you have $20K in realized capital gains this year you would need to sell and rebuy to lock in a loss prior to January 1st.  If you waited until after January then that loss wouldn't apply until the next tax year so it wouldn't offset your gains for this tax year.  **It would be a good idea to review all your gains and losses but realized and unrealized in December to see if there are any last minute harvesting trades to make.**

# Could this change in the future?

Yes it could.  The SEC is currently fighting a case that XRP is a security not property.  If they win (which seems unlikely) that could cause the IRS to offer new guidance that not all crypto is property.  It is my belief that even if the SEC wins in the XRP case or some other future case any ruling would be narrowly tailored as in ""XRP is a security"" or ""xyz crypto is a security"" not that all crypto is a security.  If that happens then this post should be re-interpreted to exclude any crypto deemed a security by the IRS however as of today no crypto has been deemed a security.

**The other more serious threat would be new legislation.**  Understand the wash sale rule on securities (stocks) sales was implemented to prevent EXACTLY this type of tax delaying tactic.   This technique can be incredibly lucrative.  On a long enough timeline I imagine that Congress will eventually pass legislation to close this loophole.  They haven't yet though and even once they do it it would be forward looking not retroactive.

# What should I tell my CPA or tax preparer?

Since most people don't own crypto your CPA might not actually be aware there is no wash sale rule on crypto transactions.  Just point him towards the wording of Section 1091 of the IRS code (""wash sale rule"") and the IRS guidance (notice 2014-21) that crypto is property not a security or currency.

# Is this tax evasion?

No tax evasion is the willful violation of the tax code to avoid paying tax liabilities. Tax loss harvesting is a tax avoidance technique meaning using the legal limits of the tax code to reduce or delay potential taxes as allowed by current law.  Remember tax loss harvesting doesn't erase your taxes it just pushes them to a future year.  Also keep in mind if Congress wanted to they could remove this capability by revising the wash sale rule in section 1091 to include assets other than securities.

# What about countries other than the US?

I have no idea.  You will need to see if your country has something like the wash sale rule and if it applies to crypto sales.  Many countries tax crypto similar to the US but it really comes down to the exact laws in your country so don't assume this applies to any country other than the US.

# How do I know you are correct?

You don't.  The point of this is to be educational and get you thinking on the possibilities.  You should do your own research.  Here are some other resources:

personalfinance,Personal loan to pay off credit card debt the way to go?,"Hello Personal Finance,

I am in a pickle. I am currently in about 15k in credit card debt. My interest rates range from 12% to 20%. My credit score last time I checked was around 675-690. Iv applied for COVID delayed payments on some credit cards which let me not pay for a month or two, so I could catch up, but I was still charged interest as per the terms. I’m not sure if this had a negative affect on my credit score. I am now up to date on all my credit card payments as of 2 months ago.

So I was reading around here and from what I believe would be the best for the improving my credit, I was wondering if a personal loan would be the right move. I have received offers from companies like Sofi, Upstart and Bruins Capital with interest rates as low as 3.09%. But I’m hesitant as this sounds too good to be true. Have any of you used these companies ?

If I use the personal loan, from what I’m reading is that I would save so much more money and have lower minimum payments.

I have just been paying the minimum on most of this stuff and investing my spare cash in order to pay it off and I am close but I also don’t want to sell of all my investments off. 

Im no financial expert, but does taking a personal loan sound like a good idea? I’m kinda lost here.

Any help would be awesome.",finance
personalfinance,"Dentist Said I'm 100% Covered, I now Owe $1k (It's my fault, but would like adult advice on how to approach negotiating please)","[Link to a screenshot of one of the insurance EOB's -- https://ibb.co/3d3QvP1](https://ibb.co/3d3QvP1)

Hi, I'd like to preface this by saying I'm 22 and under my dad's insurance plan, I recently fled home due to a DV environment and am not able to rely on my family for help/information. I'm trying to be succinct in my request and I appreciate your patience and consideration. I'm a competent individual sincerely requesting advice, please refrain from any unnecessary comments. I feel for others with more dire circumstances in the other posts and am grateful for my privileges.

Since leaving my family situation &amp; old dentist, I thought I was being smart in finding a new dentist, I went on my insurance's website, picked them from a list of ""in network providers"", called and asked insurance/the dentist if they were in network. I was told by the Front Desk Manager that everything is covered (I had 10 fillings, long story, but I'm now addicted to flossing &amp; seriously use 2 diff types of toothbrushes) and was given a thick stack papers of diff fillings/what it cost for them all. I asked every time I went if I had a co-pay or anything and was told everything was covered and my plan had ""no maximum whatsoever which is unusual but good""

Now on my insurance claims, the EOBs say that I owe \~$1k under ""patient's responsibility"" Called insurance and was snidely told by a rep that ""composite fillings are not covered under my plan and its my responsibility to know what my plan is"". I'd just like to disclaim that I'm absurdly kind to customer service people and am literally a receptionist myself, but she sighed/huffed and puffed WAY too much. I've had the same dental insurance for the past decade (my dad has had the same job and we've had the same childhood dentist). The dentist I've seen all my life has definitely given me and my family composite fillings before, no one has a single silver filling. We've never paid a dime, no copay, nothing. I'm now somewhat worried that we may owe that dentist money, since I'm not sure my parents understood how our insurance worked either.

I did research and now understand that it's entirely up to me to cross check everything with insurance before I get anything done, I read that I need to get the medical codes from drs and call insurance to get price quotes &amp; possibly also ask the office to send an authorization to insurance so I get something in writing. I understand that insurance is confusing even to dental offices and it is apparently not their responsibility to really give me correct info. I also read that some people negotiate with the dental office to bring the price down if they were mislead.

I'm feeling quite annoyed/panicked at the situation and know I would need to approach calmly and kindly, but I would like advice on how to proceed. The place is kind of skeevy imo (every time I went I was pressured to write them a Google review on the spot. I finally relented since technically everyone was nice). The front desk manager who first told me everything was covered has since left and the new manager recently told me I owed $80 but didn't mention anything else. the dental work I had done is from jan - April so I would assume it would all have shown up for her already. The front desk manager is very informal and we have a vague ""We're both receptionists rapport"" For that same reason, I can tell that the place isn't run that professionally (just met her and she filled me in on past front desk drama/sucky management).

Should I bring up the owed balance to her? Is it not actually owed? If I'm bringing it up, I figured I would just tell her, ""Hey I know this was the past manager who told me this misinformation, totally don't want to make your day any harder here or get you in trouble. Would it be possible to communicate to management that I'm very upset/left a glowing review and would like to get a reduction on the amount owed?"" I don't want to take the ""I left you a good review route and can change it to reflect more accurately on my experience (didn't give me a cleaning prior to 10 fillings, I'm pretty sure the FD manager didn't maintain her records correctly as she called to tell me I have 3 fillings left when I'm pretty sure I got them all done already, have heard management make snide comments to her, feeling pressured to write a review, etc.) Am I even in a position to negotiate it down? I figure it does not hurt to ask, but really need some help.

Very long post, apologies, I'm just not able to afford paying that much right now as I need to figure out how to pay for my own insurance soon (dad lost his job and insurance will end after June) and also will need to rent my own apartment soon in pricey NYC while going to school/working 2 jobs.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; how do I navigate negotiating my dental bill for composite fillings down from $1k? I was told everything was covered under my plan, however, I see otherwise on my insurance claims (dentist office has not said I owe anything still, beyond $80?)",finance

personalfinance,Selling stocks for house downpayment?,"Hello, and thanks in advance for any advice.

My wife and I are looking to swap our condo for a house in what feels like the worst time ever to be looking for a house. Our toddler is quickly outgrowing the confinement and lack of easily accessible outdoor space in our current situation and we desperately need an upgrade. Due to the nature of the market, we are planning to buy a house first, then sell our condo which we hope to eventually net around $50K on.

We are currently positioned to put around 5% down, and we have a lead on a house we may be able to secure off-market. We are pre-approved with a lender that doesn't add PMI, and were given an estimated interest rate of around 4.25% on our pre-approval (I assume the high rate is due to the low downpayment %). In terms of assets beyond cash, we both have 401(k)s and Roth IRAs which we are maxing out contributions to, and we also have around $40K in retail trading accounts.

If I were to sell off those retail accounts, that would push our cash balance into 20% downpayment territory which, as I understand, could improve our interest rate quite a bit, as well as lower the hit on our monthly budget and create opportunities to reinvest over time.

I realize there are a lot of layers to that, including tax ramifications and missed time in the market. I also recognize that the timing of this isn't especially great - the holdings in these accounts were worth 30+% more just three months ago.

What I haven’t been able to understand is how much *should* we put down given our financial health and diversification of investments?

10% down payment (for a particular home we are vying for) is roughly 15% of our net assets including savings, investments, and retirement. A 20% down payment would be 30%. Almost all of our investments are in the market (and some crypto) because we’re young and don’t mind taking the risks. We’d have to sell some of our investments to make a 10% down payment, but we have enough in long term gains and losses that we can minimize our tax implications. A 20% down payment would require selling some investments at short term gains. So if needed we could put 20% down, and it would involve pulling more out of the market, but would we want to?

CryptoCurrency,China’s digital currency could be the future of money – but does it threaten global stability?,"[https://theconversation.com/chinas-digital-currency-could-be-the-future-of-money-but-does-it-threaten-global-stability-160560](https://theconversation.com/chinas-digital-currency-could-be-the-future-of-money-but-does-it-threaten-global-stability-160560)

**Summary of the Article:**

The **digital yuan is a version of the normal Chinese currency deployed on a blockchain**, which is the tamper-proof online ledger technology that underpins digital coins like bitcoin and ethereum. However, this blockchain **is permissioned, meaning the People’s Bank decides who can use it**. China has been trialling the digital yuan cross-border between Hong Kong and neighbouring Shenzhen and is developing a platform for making the currency internationally viable that involves Thailand, UAE and the Bank of International Settlements.

Every step forward increases the prospect of China becoming the first country to put its currency fully on a permissioned blockchain. In contrast, western central banks like the Federal Reserve, Bank of England and to a lesser extent the European Central Bank **have all been moving more slowly on so-called central bank digital currencies (CBDCs)**. They worry about things like getting privacy right when **all transactions will be publicly visible on the blockchain**, and about the effect on retail banks. Yet a digital yuan raises profound questions about global financial stability. The question for the world’s other major economies is how to respond.

**Advantages of digital currencies**

1. The digital yuan already has the **status of legal tender**.
2. **The digital yuan bypasses the need for the banks**. There is no service fee, unlike these payment alternatives, and in theory, the speed of payments can be even faster.
3. Unlike cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, the currency is also backed by a government. This means that the issuance of digital yuan is the same as the issuance of cash in circulation, making it just as secure. It **gives the government better control over the money supply** since unlike with cash, **officials can see all the transactions taking place at any given time**.

**Dangers**

1. Most transactions between different currencies currently use the US dollar as an intermediary, via the SWIFT international banking protocol. **Transactions using digital yuan won’t need SWIFT or the dollar,** with implications for dollar usage in international trade.
2. A second danger is that if central banks don’t meet the demand for digital money, market forces will. Contactless credit cards have become ubiquitous during the pandemic. Digital money is better still as it costs less to use.
3. Countries that fail to embrace digital currencies **could find their central banks losing control over monetary policy to cryptocurrencies** – be it decentralised initiatives like bitcoin or centralised ones. If these non-sovereign coins become widely used for payment purposes, central banks will find it harder to manage their economies by setting interest rates or changing the money supply.

Amid heightened tensions between the US, Europe, China gets the first-mover advantage over this new type of currency. Given how much is at stake, it is vital that the US, EU and UK begin testing their own digital currencies urgently. **Blockchain is reinventing the way we conduct payments, and the risks of being left behind are too great to ignore**.

personalfinance,(CAN) Budgeting the cost to start doing Uber Eats on a bike when you're on a tight budget to begin with to help pay off my debts faster.,"Hello all. 

Some back story:

I've got a low income. Covid was a tragedy for me. Sometimes it was even hard to eat, I lost 8 pounds. I was a student and had 1 year left to graduate, but I had to pick between tuition or rent with the savings I had. Couldn't afford both since I lost my job. I chose to split it. I did one semester, so I have one most semester left to graduate, and the rest of my savings I used to live for an entire year without a job. (while I searched, of course)

Debt, and paying it off. 

Last month, I would have run out of money if it weren't for getting the job I have now. I applied to it in November and they got back to me. Minimum wage, $14.25/hour (Ontario). 

I accumulated $3,000 of credit card debt during covid; it's my phone bill, groceries, and utilities. If I hadn't used credit for these expenses, I wouldn't have had enough cash for last month's rent, so it was good that I did it. 

My goal is to pay this off. Happy to be working now! But after rent, utilities, transportation, cell phone, food, and some miscellaneous stuff, I only have $300 left per month to put towards my credit card payments. $300 and change. And that's already being pretty frugal. That'll take almost a year to dissolve, which just doesn't seem fast enough to me. 

So if I can't decrease my spending, then I should increase my income. I've tried for a long time to get the job I have now. For the past 2-3 weeks I've been trying to find a job that will allow me to work Saturday alone, so that it doesn't interfere with my main job. I've also been applying to higher paid positions. Nothing yet. 

Soooo that brings us to the point of this question. 

Is Uber Eats worth it to do on a bike, if you don't already have a bike? 

Here is what I've brainstormed so far. Please let me know if there are other financial factors I should consider. 

- I would have to pay for the cost of a bike. If you're going to get one that isn't stolen and then listed craigslist or something, most bikes are between $200-$600. I'm rather short, so I need something with a smaller sized tire. Bike repair from scrap or parts is not an option, as that would require purchasing tools first. So let's say $200 for an okay bike. 

- Uber insulation bag (Uber doesn't provide one, you have to buy it). I'm seeing $40-$70 being standard. You need to make sure the food gets to the person at the desired temperature - lots of people say tips make up 50% of their earnings.

- Bike rack for rear of bike. Required for holding the insulation bag. $50.

- Helmet, bell, bike lock, lights, reflectors ??? I'm guessing perhaps $50-$80? Some of these I might be able to get cheap.

- Battery pack to keep phone alive. $20-$40

- Taxes - some money cannot be immediately spent.

And how much do you make hourly doing Uber Eats? 

The annoying thing is that it varies. It depends on things like where people are ordering from (someone getting a $6 poutine from Mcdonalds or a $4 coffee from Starbucks is not going to tip big). It also depends on the length of the trip - the shorter the trip, the more trips you get per hour. The time of day also matters - uber will give you a boost if you make deliveries during peak periods. 

Even if you get good at maximizing these features, you can't do it consistently because lots of these things are out of the control of the delivery person. 

However, I have seen lots of people saying that it essentially pays $10-$20/per hour. You can probably get more out of it if you are good at knowing which orders to accept/reject, and if you know good short cuts around your city, and only go during peak periods.

Considering I will be starting out new, none of those things really apply to me. I'm also a relatively short young woman, and honestly not in the best of shape after sitting my butt down for months on end doing nothing but reformatting my resume endlessly and staying away from people during covid. Let's say I make the lower end of average, at $10 an hour, to account for my inexperience and for lowering cyclist speed averages. 

And what should I be saving in taxes? Considering I'm likely in the lower end of tax brackets, 15% federal tax and 5% federal tax at minimum. Really, it'll depend on how much I do Uber Eats. Let's just say 20% to make it simple. 20% of what I make should not be touched at all. 

So, for every hour I work at a rate of $10/hour, I can really only spend $8, and the rest should be saved for taxes come next tax season. 

Expenses have totaled at least $350. 

$350 / $8 /hour = 43.75 hours

I will have to work over 43 hours doing Uber Eats after my full time job in order to break even. 

Initially that doesn't *look* like a lot of time. But if you're truly using Uber Eats to supplement your income instead of doing it full time, you're probably going to do it casually at 5-10 hours per week, and try to target times where you make the most money (lunch and dinner). 

Assuming I work Monday - Friday at my regular job and then 5 hours each day on uber on the weekends, it would still take me over 1 month to simply recoup what I've spent in starting supplies. In my case specifically, it would also mean I'm paying more interest on my debts for an additional month. 

There are other factors I haven't considered as well. 

- I want to get a separate phone number for uber, since occasionally customers can get your phone number through contact methods that aren't anonymized. I have a second SIM slot in my phone so I won't need a separate phone altogether, but honestly, if I'm going to be traipsing around the city with messy hair and all sweaty.. I wouldn't put it past some people who have been in covid sexual slumbers to mistakenly think it's appropriate to use my phone number to reach me (some ways to contact uber eats/uber drivers do not shield phone numbers from customers/delivery people). As a safety precaution I think it's necessary. I think a talk/text plan should be sufficient for communicating, and the data can come from my existing plan.

- increased food consumption. If I'm spending multiple hours per day burning +200 calories an hour, I'm going to need to eat more food to maintain my weight. I'm already underweight as it is. But at least it's tax deductible.

- tax deductions. No clue how this will work TBH, but I still plan to save at least 20% of my earnings.

- tools for bike repair. I think I will try to lean on bike clubs to help me out here, but for on the go fixes, it might be necessary to invest over time.

- insurance. part of me is nervous that if I get in an accident I'm entirely screwed, as I absolutely need functioning hands and wrists for my main job. What kind of insurance is available in the event that I sprain my wrist slightly and am rendered useless at my primary job for a week or two?

Even after all of this, assuming I kept a pace of $10/hour, I would be earning roughly how much? Assuming 5 hours each weekend at $8/hour net after I've recouped my costs and saved for the tax man, that's about $64 per weekend day. With about 8 weekdays in a month, that's an additional $512 per month. 

So, I'd pay off nothing (but the minimum balance) on my credit card for June, because my $300 savings would go towards ""start up"" costs. But then, if I work consistently and never take a day off work for July, August and September and October, I can put $800 down towards my debt each month. 

I draw the line at biking during the winter. It's unsafe and impractical, plus, for me, it sounds like hell to be honest, so that's a no go.

Is 4 months without a single day's rest worth paying off my credit card ASAP?

Are there other factors that might help me to be a little bit more precise in my estimation?",finance

personalfinance,We can (mostly) afford our dream house but is it the right decision?,"My fiancé and I are in the exploratory phase of buying a new construction home. It’s a total dream home but I’m concerned about whether it’s a “just because we can doesn’t mean we should” purchase. 

Our combined gross yearly income is around $280,000 per year through our salary, bonus, stocks and rental properties. Our debt is just a mortgage on the duplex we house hack and our savings are around $150K cash and $100K stock. My fiancé’s parents are not wealthy but want to help us out a bit as well. 

The home we’re looking at would be ~$1.3MM finished. We pay $95K for the builder deposit and 20% down and end up with a $1MM mortgage.

We got preapproval from my fiancé’s lender for this jumbo mortgage and surprisingly the financials work out. The mortgage payment is 18% of our gross income and our DTI would still be 26% with the second mortgage. The monthly payment is 28% of our annual net. 

Financially, my concern is we will need to save a lot over the next 12 months to get the down payment of $250K and drain our savings (currently we save my paycheck and spend his but will need to push way more). Also, we will be spending a lot initially as the loan amortizes and if one of us lost a job it would be tough. If we ever ran into trouble our parents can help us short term so we are lucky for that safety net. Finally, we can’t lock an interest rate until 60 days out from a one year completion so I’m afraid of inflation or other factors raising our monthly payment. 

So, thank you for reading all of this. The question is, do you think the financials work out? If someone told your the above, would you think it was a good decision or tell them to wait or dream smaller?  Feel free to ask additional questions.",finance

financialindependence,"My First Year Towards FIRE in Review - Positive NW for the First Time! (26m, 78k/yr)","Hi everyone. I have what I feel is a pretty average salary and situation (for this subreddit), so I wanted to share what my first (semi-successful) year forward was like. Maybe it can help someone get motivated, or maybe there are some things in here that will assist further those already on their way. I began getting interested in FIRE a couple years back, and it wasn't until 2019 that I started taking things seriously and actually working towards some goals. I was living in a VHCOL region that made it almost impossible to save anything on my salary, though rampant consumption and lack of direction also contributed to failure in that area. Around May 2019 I spoke with my employer about transitioning into a remote only role and, after a couple of months of back and forth they finally agreed. This was the first serious step I took towards FIRE. In November that year, I relocated to a VLCOL area in the Midwest. My salary was reduced 15%, bringing it to about 78k/yr, however, by my calculations at the time the savings rate by moving far exceeded 15%. The only additional expense in moving was that of a vehicle; as in, one was now necessary for day to day life.

Bullet Points for the above period of time:

\- Relocated from VHCOL area to VLCOL area

\- Salary was reduced 15% to 78k (70k base w/ some bonuses through the year)

\- In Dec 2020, I purchased a small SF home for under 70k that needed no work (FHA Loan, 3.375% 30 year). Total out of pocket was around 6k and my mortgage payments, w/ pmi, escrow, etc are 450/month. It is a 2br/1ba 730sq house with a small yard and driveway.

\- NW, after closing on the house, was about -12k

So, the chunk of time I am dubbing my first year towards FIRE is the year of 2020. I've tracked my finances incessantly in both Mint and Personal Capital (both have their pros/cons), and most of the graphs and snapshots I'll provide will be from either of those sites. Here is a graph of NW over the course of the year: [https://i.imgur.com/yd1DDMc.png](https://i.imgur.com/yd1DDMc.png). I ended 2020 at 10.5k, a 22k climb and the first time I have had a positive NW since before I was 18 (bad habits ran deep).

Mint gives me the way to view changes in spending over time, so I've compared 2019 to 2020 for a couple of different categories. My biggest habit change was a massive reduction in the amount of random purchases I made. I like electronics, a lot, and while I might not not spend a lot of money on clothing or furniture, I definitely wouldn't think twice about a TV, speakers, or computer parts: [https://i.imgur.com/hl2tzjV.png](https://i.imgur.com/hl2tzjV.png). The purchases I made in 2020 were things I considered essential and nothing else. Next, I ate out a less (around 1.7k less for the year): [https://i.imgur.com/I0YJ0Ct.png](https://i.imgur.com/I0YJ0Ct.png). Of course the category with the largest change was housing, which dropped from 17k in 2019 to 6k in 2020. Interestingly enough, transportation stayed about the same transitioning from public transpo and Uber to driving a truck. Insurance, gas, and even used vehicles themselves are drastically cheaper here. This can all be summed up in a graph comparing monthly net income for both years. The numbers here are a little weird (income has been difficult for me to track cleanly in mint) but the take away is many more months saving money and not spending more than I made: [https://i.imgur.com/JiUozIK.png](https://i.imgur.com/JiUozIK.png). Some other things that made a difference:

\- Utilities are now much cheaper. Water/sewer went from 60/month to 20/month for example

\- Taxes, in general, are much lower (sales, state income, local income)

\- Other lifestyle changes, like how my free time is spent, alcohol consumption, and less travel

\- Addition of appreciating assets, such as the house, investments, and believe it or not my truck (weird world right now)

Lastly, I figured I could highlight what exactly I was doing with the additional income each month. First and foremost, I paid off credit cards. I also had a personal loan that I paid down very quickly. Otherwise, I just stuck some money in savings and the rest is going towards investments:

\- Following this Financial Panther guide, I've opened 2x of these 'high interest on the first 1k' accounts, and these (along with some other cash) comprise my emergency fund: [https://financialpanther.com/netspend-account/](https://financialpanther.com/netspend-account/)

\- Opened a brokerage account, and have only been purchasing VEA, VOO, and VYM (Developed markets etf, S&amp;P500 etf, and high dividend yield etf)

\- Increasingly contributing to employer 401k

\- Increasingly contributing to a Wealthfront Roth IRA

\- Light individual stock investing

\- Home improvements that raised the value of the house

For this year, I am focusing on reducing my taxable income and trying to stick to the healthier financial habits I've been forming. Maxing out my 401k should drop my MAGI below 66k, making me eligible for the full Traditional IRA deduction come tax time (will switch to traditional from roth this year for this reason). Between the 401k max, IRA deduction, and the standard deduction my total taxable income will be entirely in the 12% bracket and all that should save me around 5.7k on federal taxes (and more at the state/local levels). The percentage of my salary I save, on paper, is 67%, and I would like to get that above 70% by reducing the cost of food and utilities if possible.

So yeah, if you made it this far, hopefully there was something helpful or interesting in there. I would love any suggestions, feedback or constructive criticism and, while not an expert by any means, if I can help or answer any questions feel free to ask!

TL;DR - relocated and changed some spending habits to climb out of debt and into the FIRE.",finance

personalfinance,Anyone into drop shipping as a side business?,"Maybe not exactly a personal finance question, but side hustles can be somewhat personal finance related, at least as much so as real estate investing is, so thought I'd ask here.

I ordered some cleaning supplies from Amazon, they arrived directly from Sam's Club which I thought was weird because the seller wasn't Sam's.  (I get FedEx emails about incoming shipments, was clear it was coming directly from Sam's Club.)  Seller was some random no name small business.

Looked up what the product is selling for at Sam's, and looks like I bought it at a 60% markup.  And I think if you have a Sam's membership shipping is free.

This happened to me earlier this year too.  I bought some dumbbells, they came directly from Walmart, looked up the price at Walmart, significantly cheaper.  (Obviously I'm an idiot and should have looked up Walmart's prices when buying, instead of only checking Amazon.)

Anyway, just curious if anyone has done this on their own as a side hustle.  It seems pretty low commitment/effort since you aren't holding inventory anything, literally just buying from one store and having it shipped directly to the customer while the customer pays you more.  Is it hard to get sales?  Are most buyers smarter than me?  I assume if it was that easy everyone would be doing it, and nothing's ever that easy.

Edit: Additional googling, apparently this is not really allowed by Amazon:

personalfinance,"Need a new car for the first time in a decade. Can pay full (or almost in full), but should I?","I haven't bought a new car since 2010/2011, but now I *need* to. My old car's repairs are getting too frequent and too expensive to justify keeping.

I realize that there are *tons* of variables and factors that could go into much you should pay or what way you should pay, so I'm just looking for *general* advice so I can make sure I'm heading in the right direction.... 

- What's some overall advice for figuring out which price range I'm *actually* in for a car? Let's say I currently have somewhere in the range of $40k-$50k, so would looking at a $20k-$25k car be reasonable? Or is that too big of a chunk of my current money to justify? 
- If I *am* able to pay in full, should I? Or is it actually more advantageous to have car payments, even if you're not paying it off for that long? 
- If I *shouldn't* pay in full, should I still try to put down as much money as possible so that my car payment is as low as possible and/or my term length is as short as possible? 
- If I'm going to finance, is it better to go with my own bank or let the dealer give me options and then choose whatever has the best interest rate? 

All in all, my big thing here is that while I'm certainly not rich by any means, I personally have more money than I ever had. 

So A) I'd like to get a car that's nicer than what I would normally get (20k-25k range vs. my usual 10k-15k range), and B) I hate car payments so I'd love to pay something in full (or close to full) if I'm able to.

My understanding is that the new burning scheme will represent a consistent but modest decrease in the total supply of ethereum although I don't understand the profile of how this will change over time? Is this even correct? Is it front loaded? Will it burn at an increasing rate over time?

Are there other factors here that will affect the amount of ETH in circulation?",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Student loan mess,"Throw away account, trying to understand my options. I am currently attending full time university in Texas and a little over half way done as I did about a years worth in community college. Just finished my first full year of university and I had got a student loan for that full year. My parents just got out of bankruptcy as the school year started so they were unable to co-sign a loan for my school so I had asked a family friend to co-sign till my parents were out of bankruptcy and the courts told my parents once it is done you’ll be able to get a loan. That was not the case. A year after their bankruptcy and loans still will not touch them and my dad being the only parent that can work as my mom is on disability from a very bad car wreck. When I apply for federal student loans with my dad co-signing they do not offer enough for me to attend college once they see how much he makes but that goes not take into account that most of that money goes to medical bills my mom still gets from the continuing doctors appointments and surgeries. (Like she just had to have back surgery) I’m trying my hardest to get this family friend off of the student loan but everywhere I look ends up being a dead end.

personalfinance,Buying a motorcycle for a short term to sell later?,"Hi all, love this subreddit and how straightforward and reasonable it is.

Anyway, I am planning on living in two locations for a short period. The first is right now, where I will be living somewhere in the states until August. Then, I will likely be living in Europe through the end of the year, in which case I will return to the states. I am solid on these plans and am making financial preparations. One of my big questions, however, is what to do about my transportation in that time. 

I have transportation right now, and it is reliable and inexpensive (my loan is 95% paid off) but in general it sucks. I want something different for the summer, but used car prices are astronomical. Furthermore, I will be leaving in a few months so buying a car right now seems like unnecessarily effortful and expensive, especially since I'll be making payments on it and not able to drive it while im gone. Buying a reselling a full car seems like too much effort and risk.

This got me thinking of vehicles I could get for sub \~$7k, and the idea of a newer motorcycle popped in. I've always wanted a motorcycle, I have my motorcycle endorsement already, as well as all the gear. Ive got a project bike that I own in full, but it requires a few more months of effort and probably around $1k to get it riding well and safely.  So basically, I am set up to be riding at almost no cost (gear, training), but I don't have something ride-able currently and probably wont by the time I move. 

My thought is to purchase a used motorcycle around $4-6k, and then sell it when it's time for me to leave in August. Motorcycle sales are strong in the summer, so I'm not worried about trying to sell it in the winter or when the market is weak. I would still plan for around 2-3 weeks to sell it, and if I don't, I can afford it financially. 

To get a loan, I can expect around a 4-5% interest rate, and no money down. Thus, at a cost of $5000, my interest cost at 3 months at worst would be around $62.

Of course the big risk, at least I think, comes in whether I can resell the motorcycle at cost, or close to cost. The motorcycles I am looking at typically hold their value very well, but I am looking at options that are of lower condition (around ""good"" condition, not great or perfect) and thus could sell well because of the price-point, but also could struggle to command a desired price because of condition. 

If this works, I would probably try to pursue this same strategy while I am temporarily living in Europe. I expect buying there will be more challenging, but otherwise the risks to be the same.

Is my thinking sound here? Is it a good idea to purchase a motorcycle, or other vehicle, for a short term period with the intention to resell it after your usage period? Why or why not?

*Edit: I should add that I expect to put around $4-500 into new on/off road tires so that I can take the bike on dirt. So my costs are more in the $600 range total. I would not expect to recoup this cost, it would be purely an entertainment type purchase.",finance
economy,PMI Index,"[pmi index](https://preview.redd.it/h1tnzd9h7xz61.jpg?width=800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f371b037af5767068109d9671c719d5c375c69d)

&amp;#x200B;

The PMI index is published every month in two forms as manufacturing and service pmi index. The service PMI index gives a better idea about the economy than the manufacturing PMI index. PMI is the purchasing managers trend index. It is one of the important indicators that gives information about the increase in production in the next period. Since it is published at the same time around the world, it plays an important role in creating both an indicator and a standard in the course of the world economy and in the comparison of the economies of the country. It gives insight into the growth of economies. It gives information about whether the production will be alive or stable. The PMI index is measured against 50 basis points. It is compared with the PMI index of the previous month. According to the previous month’s PMI index, if this month’s index exceeds 50 points, purchasing managers will take raw materials, inputs, etc. They are purchasing means that production will increase. If the index is below 50 points, it makes us think that production and economic activity will slow down or stagnate. In the unfavorable economic conditions caused by the health problem we are in, the PMI index also declined to critical levels. Some of the reasons for this are disruption of the supply chain, stagnation of economic vitality and insufficient demand. PMI index cannot be updated again after it is published like inflation data. The PMI index is an important source of data needed by all segments of the economic society, primarily central banks, governments, households, and investors. For example, if the PMI index is over 50 points, it gives individual investors the idea that economic activity will be positive. Central banks also use this index as an important data source in their monetary policy agenda.

* Roth IRA: Since this is my first house, I could open and pull up to $10,000 of what I invest in the Roth IRA without any form of deductions. However, since the account will be less than 5 years old, I will be taxed for what I pull out as income.

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, May 18, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, May 18, 2021**

Stocks held steady today, with the three major indexes trading within a 0.5% range of the even line. It’s encouraging to see the market holding steady after the volatility experienced in the last few weeks. As I have said before, I thought the initial reaction to the April Consumer Price Index, where technology stocks sank and the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) fell 4%, was overblown for a few reasons that will be explained below. 

Last week, the market tumbled in the largest loss since February after the Bureau of Labor Statistics released the April Consumer and Producer Price indexes, which showed a larger increase than expected.  The CPI, which measures a basket of goods as well as energy and housing costs, rose 4.2% from a year ago, compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 3.6% increase. The monthly gain was 0.8%, against the expected 0.2%. Excluding the volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI (this is the main measure of inflation) increased 3% compared to the same period in 2020 and 0.9% on a monthly basis. The respective estimates were 2.3% and 0.3%. 

The PPI, which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output, rose 6.2% compared to April 2020 and 0.6% monthly increase. The core PPI, which excludes volatile items like food and energy rose 4.6% year over year and 0.7% in April. Economists polled by FactSet were expecting a 0.3% monthly increase in April and 3.8% year over year.

While it’s difficult to pinpoint exact causes, there seem to be several factors contributing to the rise in inflation, none of which I think pose a significant threat to the sustainability of the current bull market.  First, after the collapse in prices during the height of the pandemic and lockdowns, it is not surprising to see prices comparatively much higher than last year as demand and consumer spending surges as the US economy reopens. 

Second are widespread supply shortages and manufacturing bottlenecks in key materials, limiting production capability and driving up delivery time, and as a result, driving up prices. As basic economics shows us, when demand begins to outstrip production capabilities (aka supply), prices inevitably go up. One prominent example of this you may be familiar with is the global shortage in semiconductors, which is causing automobile manufacturers across the industry to limit production. A similar situation is happening across an array of consumer goods. 

Third are historic levels of fiscal spending by the Federal Government in the form of stimulus and other benefits. Federal debt—incurred when the government sells Treasury bonds, bills, notes, and other securities to cover its costs—recently hit an all-time high. However, policymakers are not concerned with the debt at current levels. Jerome Powell said, “Given the low level of interest rates, there's no issue about the United States being able to service its debt at this time or in the foreseeable future.” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen echoed a similar sentiment in a recent interview, saying “Even with inflation data coming in hotter than economists expected, long-term bond yields declined, indicating the market has been anticipating inflationary pressures for a while and are reassured by the Federal Reserve’s commitment to move slowly when raising rates.

Now that we understand why inflation may be rising, these are the reasons I think fears are overblown. With the US economy reopening, we are seeing a surge in consumer spending (we saw a 10.8% increase in spending in March), supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand, which of course, causes a rise in prices. As the economic reopening continues and supply in various consumer industries is able to catch up, inflation is expected to slow down. In a nutshell, this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures “transitory”. In an April 28 meeting, Jerome Powell said, “Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.” 

Moreover, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be “transitory” as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, “We want to see a string of months like that \[like in March\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, there’s a very large group of people who are not.” Finally, the April Job Report, which showed the economy gained only 266,000 jobs compared to the 1 million expected and marked a sharp deceleration in growth compared to March, bolsters Powell’s argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy. 

**Highlights**

* The US dollar dipped on Tuesday for the fourth straight session, reaching its lowest level against a basket of currencies since late February on waning fears that inflation spikes could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner than anticipated, another great sign that inflationary fears are overblown. 
* In a Ford factory in Michigan, President Biden promoted his $174 billion plan to promote and accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles across the United States and planned to roll-back vehicle emission standards. According to the fact sheet, Biden's plan ""proposes cost-sharing grants to support new high capacity battery facilities in the United States” and backs grants to fund the retooling of shuttered factories ""to build advanced vehicles and parts.""
* Michael Burry, the investor famous for calling the 2008 housing market bubble and portrayed by Christian Bale in the movie “The Big Short”, recently unveiled a huge bearish bet on Tesla. Scion Asset Management, Burry’s firm, said in a regulatory filing it had put options on 800,100 shares of Tesla, as of the end of Quarter 1, a value of $534 million. Details on the strike price of the puts, their value and whether they are part of a broader trade are not publicly available. 
* Square (SQ), one of the leading fintech companies, launched services in Ireland, it’s first foray into the Eurozone as the company looks to expand beyond the US.
* Interestingly, Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) has sold nearly all of its Wells Fargo (WFC) stock, a position the company has held since 1989. In a regulatory filing on Monday, Berkshire said it owned just $26.4 million of shares of WFC as of March 31, down from around $32 billion in January 2018.

retirement,Paying off my house from TSP/401K ? Theoretical numbers versus real numbers,"TSP is the 401K retirement plan for federal workers.  But most of us also have a pension.   


In my case, the pension will be enough to live on OK.   I got really lucky in this crazy real estate environment and made some cash, i can it put into my retirement or pay off my house.   


I posted this question on the TSP sub and most people thought i was very misguided,   (i don't dispute that) But i thought i'd  put the question here where more people are actually retired. 

  
So we have a new 20 year mortgage of $130K. I expect to retire in 20 months with $200K in the TSP plus $50K cash we are making on the sale of our previous home.

The argument against paying it off says the gains on the market exceed the interest on the loan so your money will grow more if it stays invested.

Ok, but in real life it looks like this, the mortgage is around $750/mo.(+ escrow) Using the 4% rule the money is only producing $450/mo as an annuity.

So paying off the house frees up twice as much cash every month for the first 20 years of my retirement. And i still have all the equity in the house which i expect i will want to be rid of by the time i hit 80.

So it seems pretty clear to me but I'm wondering if I am looking at it the wrong way ?",finance

dogecoin,Can Doge reach $1000,"I suspect it could happen regardless of what self proclaimed ""experts"" say. Most of these people base their theories on fiat currency principles which likely do not apply as crypto is a developing technology. As the people of the world move away from Caesar's fiat money, away from ridiculous interest rates, manipulation and continue to invest in doge the price (respective to the US petro dollar) should continue to rise. Also to consider are holders of other crypto currencies who could also switch and go all in on doge, which could also affect price to the upside.

If doge was to become the currency of the world, there is absolutely no way to predict what it could go to. So what is the answer? Just Hodl. Why? Because SO many people say ""I wish I had bought it when it was just starting out.."" People said it about gold, bitcoin and everything that has ever gone up in value. 

This is YOUR opportunity to get in at the beginning of something big, regardless of what happens.. Personally, I'm in this for the long run, no matter what; 7 years and counting now, to be specific. People's lives have been destroyed because of fiat currency and the shenanigans that have ensued with it, such as mortgage  defaults (fractional reserve banking), income taxes (unconstitutional) collected under COLOR OF LAW, and so much other crap.

Bitcoin,Gray beard turned newbie again: Recommendations on storage strategy? Also any thoughts on how I've purchased this past week?,"Soooo I was very much into BTC back in the early days.  Friends and I had mining rigs, and I spent most of my energy flipping bitcoin, not really holding.  Only had maybe $1k in BTC just sitting there but amazed how it went from just a few bucks a coin to 60 something grand.  Family and I decided we'd start converting a good chunk a lot of our savings into bitcoin and hold until around retirement.  


Fast forward to this last dip.  I purchased 1BTC for around 51k as it seemed that it was the bottom.  Of course it's getting a little close to 42k so I went ahead and added another $2k of BTC to my portfolio.  I think I'm good for now.  A little miffed about missing the bottom but I'm sure long term it won't matter much.  So here are my questions.  


What is a rock solid, fool proof way of moving my BTC to cold storage where both my wife and I can access yet it's secure as possible.  I'd prefer not to rely on any online exchange or even a password locker such as lastpass.  Currently have a large amount in coinbase and want to move it out but super honestly speaking, I'm very terrified of keeping a wallet offline.  


Second question, is that usually frowned upon to buy more when you kinda went all in on one dip just to find another and spend a little more?  Feels kind of like gambling.  Definitely a lesson learned though about not purchasing all at once.  I guess I just felt some FOMO that I'd be missing out on this year's all time low...  


Anyway, I'd appreciate some honest feedback.  Thanks all.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,How much car to buy.,"Hi, a few days ago I made a post (which I’ve since deleted due to not enough information on my end) about possibly purchasing a 30k (used or new). 

A few of the responses said to do it, a few told me I’m in no position to spend that much. 

Here is a quick financial snapshot.

Married, 29 years old with combined income around 180-200k. 

Assets:

15k emergency fund. 

82k in retirement savings. (We paused for about a year to pay off debts).

~10k crypto investments. 

~2k for 18 month olds college 529

140k in home equity

Wife’s paid off car worth 23k currently. 

We have 81k in student loans. Recently refinanced around 52k of those for 700 a month for the next 5 years 

30k in federal loans on hold currently. 

Our net worth is somewhere around 200-220k. 

We both max our ROTH IRA’s, I contribute 6% to a 401k and my employer contributes 7.5%. We also contribute around 500-1000 a month into crypto. Put 250 a month into our sons 529 and save around 2200-4400 in cash depending on the month. 

I usually buy used cars, drive them around and flip them for a few thousand more. Currently, don’t have a car, and don’t really NEED one. I work from home but really getting the itch for something new. 

Since the last post, I’ve came to the conclusion that maybe 30k for a toy is probably not justifiable at all in our situation. 

Would spending 15k-20k on a vehicle be detrimental to our future finances? I realistically could put down 5-9k on a car by next month and finance the rest. I find joy in going for drives and like to work on and take care of my cars. 

Would like to hear your opinions and also when do you find a balance on spending money on something that is going to depreciate instead of investing/saving every dollar you make? Or try to. TIA

I suppose I am looking for the OK and a specific dollar amount to go ahead and spend and not regret it financially. 

Edit: We spent a year reducing our consumer debt from 166k in 2019 to 82k by September 2020.  Now the only debt we have is our mortgage and student loans. We can be disciplined and totally have changed our spending habits for over 2 years now.",finance
personalfinance,To student loan debt or not to student loan debt,"24, approximately two years through college, 2-3 left to finish, degree in Computer Science

I currently have one semester worth of federal student loans, $4k worth approximately. I moved to a larger midwest city to attend a higher tier school, which incurs additional expenses but it's a well ranked school. I might as well disclose it as being Columbus and Ohio State...shouldn't be too specific. I was briefly a premed major, hence the setback, but have neither the time nor money to get through all the required hoops.

I work to support myself. Currently making very, very good money since I've been working a sales job since January. I make significantly more money than any other job will pay, but eventually this amount will go down significantly, still being more than any other job would offer. I considered postponing education just because of how good the money has been, but I also know it's temporary. It's allowed me to save a good chunk and if I keep it up, will have a nice nest egg for the coming year. I'll likely still work part time, but at something different than sales, say returning to retail. 

Rent is currently $600, with roommates. I'd much rather live alone, so may be taking that step in August, so a small increase may happen. The peace of living alone is worth it to me. Some napkin math shows the lowest I can calculate my expenses vs income once I leave this role is a thin line. I own an affordable Asian car that will last me through college and beyond. Student loans are my only debt other than revolving things like credit cards.

Cost of tuition is probably...$12k a year, give or a take a little bit. Books, etc vary year to year, but it's officially like $11,500.

I'm having a hard time coming to terms with private student loans. I didn't need them before when I was in community college, but I feel like having a small extra cushion for the next year or two would be amazing. If I could just get enough between federal loans and private loans to cover tuition, that would be perfect and most living expenses can be covered through working. Unfortunately, I don't have anyone who can cosign, so I have to get approved based on my own financial merit.

Currently ineligible for most grants and scholarships until after Spring of 2022 when they recalculate eligibility.

Being a computer science major, it's also (generally) expected that I'll get a summer internship somewhere next summer, or within a similar timeframe. It can be a massive boost to the start of a career and I'd hate to pass it up because I'm financially destroyed and need to work, or because I work so much I further damage my academic success.

I guess I'm asking how I'm supposed to weigh the debt and interest of additional loans against the possibility that overworking myself impacts my academic and pre-career success. Any advice on doing so? Maybe I'm overthinking it?

A small side question...I've been contributing 6% to a 401k with a 3% match. Once a month with my commission, this is a significant amount. Would it make sense to abandon this in order to save more money towards college?

Edit to add: The reason I took a semester off and accepted the sales job is because I had been unemployed for a chunk of covid, had some small credit card debt, a bit of medical debt, etc. I knew it would pay well and I could rapidly pay that off and save some money. Additionally, the whole ""everything in college is online"" just wasn't working out for me.",finance

Bitcoin,The Bitcoin Standard,"I just finished reading “The Bitcoin Standard” by Saifedean Ammous, and I think I am finally beginning to truly understand what bitcoin is and how unique it is, a little over a year after first starting to dabble in it.

One quote (of a quote) that I had to reread multiple times was this:

*“I believe this will be the ultimate fate of Bitcoin, to be the ‘high‐powered money’ that serves as a reserve currency for banks that issue their own digital cash. Most Bitcoin transactions will occur between banks, to settle net transfers. Bitcoin transactions by private individuals will be as rare as… well, as Bitcoin based purchases are today”*

Some of my takeaways are this:

* Bitcoin was created to be a store of value (yes, perceived value, just like fiat, gold, etc., yet as long as it has perceived value then it is worth having).
* Although bitcoin can be used to purchase things in transactions, it really doesn’t matter if that happens or not.
* It doesn’t matter that bitcoin doesn’t have a “function” like ethereum or any other number of altcoins. 
* It doesn’t matter that bitcoin can increase the number of transactions per minute (they used the example of how Visa and MasterCard process thousands more transactions per minute than bitcoin ever can), because it wasn’t intended to be the sole currency used in the world.
* These recent dips and volatility also don't matter (unless you're treating bitcoin as a stock and are trying to day-trade with it...then it might matter to you) because it doesn't change what bitcoin was create to be. 
* Bitcoin really is digital gold- except that there is a finite supply, something totally unique to it.

Anyway, those are my takeaways from the book. I really don’t know much about the technology behind this all, I’m just trying to slowly learn. If you disagree with me- that’s fine, please be kind and share why you do- I’d really be interested in knowing!

CryptoCurrency,The Tether Ponzi Scheme,"Posted by u/VodkaHaze on badeconomics. Post also available on their blog.

────────

It's something awesome to live through one of the great bubbles of history. You get to see in real time some of the great speculative mania stories, like people paying millions for something conferring no legal claim to anything or the classic ""yoga instructor selling her house to go all in on speculation""

But what caused this cryptocurrency bubble? Today we're going to dive into a core driver, and likely the largest Ponzi scheme in history.

What's Tether?

USDT is a ""stablecoin"" -- a cryptocurrency whose price is supposed to be pegged to the US dollar -- managed by a company called tether.

Initially tether said they enforced the peg by having each USDT be backed by a USD in a bank account. Then tether ran into all sorts of hilarious hijinks over the years, many of which we only found out because they were made public in NYAG litigation, including:

 • Having all of tether's money in their lawyer's personal bank account (May 2017)

 • Not having any bank account anywhere in the world for 6 monthsto receive money in. Yet still emitting $400m new tethers in that period. Their lawyer's personal account had, at most, $60m at any point. Bitfinex had two institutional deposits in that whole period, neither of whom purchased USDT.

 • Failing to complete an audit and settling on an attestation (An audit verifies where money comes from. An attestation is just an accoutnant saying ""there was money in a bank account on that date"") for ""transparency"". The morning of the attestation, tether moved $380m from sister company bitfinex into a bank account the morning of the day of the attestation.

 • Losing $900M to their money launderer, and covering those losses by commingling bitfinex customer funds with tether reserve funds (2018)

 • Finding the last bank on earth, Deltec Bank from Bahamas willing to do business with them after Wells Fargo and HSBC fired them as clients. Remember HSBC has the kind of risk tolerance leaving them to willingly deals with drug cartels. No bank wants tether as a client.

Just read section 2 and 3 of the NYAG settlement. It's a blast. The best recap on the tether saga is by Amy Castor, but Patrick McKenzie also has a good write up. Note that Patrick's piece is quaint now -- it was written back in 2019 when tether's balance sheet was $2B. Tether now has over $58B on their balance sheet

As far as we know, there was no point in history at which USDT in circulation were backed 1-to-1 by USD in a bank account. At this point, they stopped even pretending -- each tether in circulation is backed by... tether's ""reserves"".

The ""Reserves""

For a long time, tether's ""reserves"" were a mystery. As found in the NYAG investigation, tether likely never had a dollar in a bank account for each USDT, at any point, ever. They're now forced to reveal the makeup in May 2021 as per the NYAG settlement. Tether found a 5-person accounting firm in the Cayman islands willing to do an attestation, which states they have 0.36% more assets than liabilities.

In anticipation for their forced public disclosure, tether recently posted this glorious pie chart

Which has prompted many more questions. First, we can view the actual debt in this form, as broken Intel Jackal (image)

Almost all of the reserves are in some form of loan to a commercial company (corporate bonds, commercial paper, secured loans). Only around 5% are in assets whose value we know (cash, T-Bills).

Inconsistencies

Tether's general counsel, Stuart Hoegner, posted a highly unusual blog post in which he claims this is good debt by any standard. This raises many inconsistencies, which are easy to see given the magnitude of the numbers at hand.

 • Stuart claims they don't hold Treasury Bills because the interest rate is close to 0%. If they hold this risky debt as reserves because it pays higher interest, why does tether only have 0.36% more assets than liabilities? Either thether's management is looting the interest rates on the assets and leaving USDT holders with the debt's risk, or we're being lied to.

 • With $20B in commercial paper at the time of the attestation, and 50% more USDT on the market since, tether presumably has $30B in commercial paper at time of writing. The entire commercial paper market in the US is around $1T per year.

We're supposed to believe that tether somehow holds 3% of the US commercial paper market at time of writing, and that they apparently bought 1% of the entire market in the last month alone.

 • The asset allocation strategy in the reserves seems to be copied from an investment fund at tether's bank, Deltec. This investment fund apparently manages $425M, rather than $60B.

 • If the reserves are such regular financial assets, how come respectable accounting firms won't even touch it for a simple attestation?

We know that some of the money used for USDT come from Chinese money laundering because a tether shareholder was recently charged. But we see no mention of frozen accounts in the reserves. Moreover, this amounts to less than $0.5B, and the perpetrator was nicknamed the ""Chinese OTC King"" -- so even in the charitable case where USDT are fully backed by money laundering, this raises inconsistencies.

Reminder: non-USD reserves for a stablecoin are a problem

As noted by Frances Coppola, it's dangerous to guarantee to clients that something is worth $1 when your assets backing it are not dollars. The value of the USD changes very little. The value of crypto changes a lot.

If you want to enforce a market price of $1 for something backed by not-dollars, then the quantity of reserves needs to go up and down with the asset price changes. Otherwise, you'll eventually become insolvent, when asset prices become lower than what you bought them for.

Who are these loan to?

Tether has lost the privilege of the benefit of doubt a long time ago. Here is how tether's Ponzi scheme likely works:

 • All their commercial debt is to the related exchanges (Binance, FTX, Bitfinex - see below) or their affiliated shell companies.

 • Tether make new USDT out of thin air and send them against a dollar-denominated loan to these affiliates

 • The affiliates use the new USDT to put market buy-orders for crypto, putting them on the new USDT on market

 • Crypto goes up in value becaue of the new demand pressure. This overcollateralizes the affiliated loans, justifying more loans.

 • Rinse, repeat.

We can track who new USDT go to directly by looking at their TRON, ethereum, OMNI and Solana blockchain addresses. By matching the blockchain addresses new USDT are sent to to known parties, we can track who are the ones sending new USDT on the market:

The counterparties are largely Binance, FTX, Bitfinex, and other exchanges. The commercial paper is presumably to affiliated shell companies. I wouldn't put those companies debt at a dollar-to-dollar valuation; for instance Binance is currently under investigation by the DOJ and IRS.

But how does the $1 peg hold?

This is an easy one. FTX happily admits to enforcing the dollar peg (image)

You can easily enforce the dollar peg by wash-trading around the $1 price and arbitraging on exchanges who don't.

FTX don't even need to be complicit to the scheme for this to make financial sense: if FTX can get new USDT for $1 on an infinite loan margin from tether, it's perfectly sensible to buy USDT when it's below $1 and shortsell USDT when it's above.

The Mississippi bubble, 2021 style

The cryptocurrency ecosystem is conceptually simple. Money comes in from new investors buying, and the same money comes out to pay those cashing out. It would be a zero-sum ecosystem, except for the fact that miners have to pay their bills in dollars

This is why ""bitcoin investors"" feel an immediate urge to tell everyone else to invest in bitcoin -- if no new money comes in, the financial structure eventually collapses under the miner's sell pressure.

Note how this is different than buying a company's stock. People buy and sell stocks on a stock exchange, but the companies independently have money coming in (from their clients). The stock of a profitable company is a positive-sum ecosystem. If somehow no one wants to buy the stock, a profitable company will be happy to buy it back itself.

When tether comes in with their scheme, they put demand pressure on BTC then add a supply constraint on BTC (also driving up the price!) by reducing the total supply of BTC to hoard in their reserves

Notice that even though bitcoin prices are higher, no additional money entered the ecosystem in the tether pump. Like a Ponzi scheme, we cannot pay everyone off at the inflated price using the pool of money that's in the crypto ecosystem (More specifically, the pool of money in the crypto exchange's customer fund bank accounts) When enough money starts looking for the exit door, a $60B hole gets torn into the ecosystem, and someone has to pay for it.

The danger zone happens when BTC drops below $18,500

Assuming that each new USDT is used to instantly buy BTC at market prices (This is a lower bound estimate, since USDT are issued on the market between mint periods, where price is increasing), we can track where the BTC ""price of no return"" is -- where reserve BTC were paid for more overall than they're now worth.

We can play around with parameters (they might buy ETH or Dogecoin rather than BTC, etc.) but most calculations land the death zone in the $17k-$20k range -- prices we were at around December 2020.

The scheme can easily collapse above this point. Bernie Madoff's customer deposits was around $18B against a $65B promised liabilities, but his scheme collapsed way before $40B in funds were withdrawn, because fraudsters tend to mismanage and embezzle some of the money for themselves.

Notice that the last point in time where BTC price went significantly below the death zone is the March 2020 COVID price crash -- which is also the point where USDT were started to be minted at a parabolic rate.

The DeFi boom started with the USDT flood

This is a sidenote to this story, but the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) boom started because of USDT flooding the market. DeFi is not a new invention: it's existed since the 2017 bubble. No one picked it up because it's a fairly useless idea: lock up more collateral for a crypto loan than the loan's value and use the loan.

DeFi is exclusively used to leverage trading - eg. lock up BTC, keep the BTC exposure, and use the loan to buy more BTC. You can't buy a house or start a business on a DeFi loan -- the point of normal loans is to use personal creditworthiness and undercollateralization to move future cashflows into the present. For these reasons, no one picked it up for years

But notice something happened around the same time as USDT exploded. We can track what happened to DeFi by getting historical borrowing rates and matching them to total money in DeFi (TVL), USDT in DeFi and total USDT

A clear story emerges:

No one used DeFi until tether joined the Ethereum blockchain in April 2019. Then a ton of new tethers, with no particular place to go, found themselves emitting DeFi loans. This floored the borrowing rates for DeFi, especially so in April 2020, after tether started printing themselves out of insolvency.

Once borrowing rates were appealing, DeFi started taking off.

Eventually, the DeFi ecosystem tried to distance itself from USDT, but the coin is still around 45% of the entire space.

USDT DeFi loans are generally USDT-denominated. If the USDT peg breaks significantly, these USDT DeFi loans will go into margin call one way or another.

The noose is tightening

At the time of writing, BTC crashed from a high of $64k to around $41k. But more importantly, for the first time in months, we're starting to see significant backflows into tether addresses, largely from Binance. Here are the outflows and inflows (excluding newly minted USDT) into the tether address on Tron, for example

The orange lines are USDT coming out onto market. The blue lines are USDT coming back into tether's blockchain address.

This is means people are recently withdrawing, a lot. The music could stop at any moment now. It could take hours, or it could take months.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Rent or Sell House that is Untenable for us,"Hello PF,

To preface, this is not happening in the US, but in Switzerland. I have put prices in USD to be more universal, using a CHF1 = USD1.1 as a conversion.

A couple of years ago I was fortunate enough to find a semi-detached house in Zurich, with a bit of land which needed some renovation work. Houses in this city are remarkably rare, even more so at a price I could afford at USD1m. I bought it with 70% mortgage at a preferential interest rate at the time of 0.45% for two years which expires shortly when I will have to choose how to renew. New interest rate at renewal would likely be in the 0.6% range.

The house was old, no kitchen, barely functional bathroom, but it was solid. I have spend around USD80-100k in renovations, making a new kitchen, bathroom, plumbing, and electrics as well as other aesthetic improvements.

Unfortunately it happens to be attached to less than considerate neighbours. I will not get into the details, but short of it is that if the situation cannot be resolved, it is too uncomfortable for us to continue living here. As a result, I am trying to decide what to do in this case.

As I see it I have two options if I have to move. Rent or Sell. I have had the valuation of the property done independently, and they are confident that if it were to sell in the current market I would be able to make a profit of around USD250k (before taxes/fees). Selling is a difficult pill to swallow as the house is extremely nice, and I will not be able to afford another similar place again due to their rarity and price. The neighbour situation will likely resolve itself in any case of the next decade.

Alternatively I can rent. The place would rent for USD2750-3250 a month + heating and electrcal bills. We work full time so would need to account for 10% fees of a rental agency - damages and other maintenance bills. 

Land in this city is extremely valuable, and is pretty reliable to go up in value (last year has been rather more than usual though). So the question is to take the money and run, or wait out the situation and take a regular income which would be offset with renting somewhere else with the potential to move back if we want. I fear I may be too sentimental to make a clear judgement on this.

Sorry for the wall of text. Happy to answer any questions.

tl;dr: May have to move out due to circumstances with the neighbour. Do I rent, or sell. Given the market its a good time to sell, but the property type is rare to find in the city, and I won't get another similar opportunity.",finance
Bitcoin,Bitcoin is a Revolution,"We all know, it's scary seeing the markets plummet. But when I woke up I expected to see some insane news that could have caused this, something that would have drastically changed the value proposition of bitcoin, but no - nothing. Pure fear. 

I feel bad for everyone who's down on their investment. But at the same time it's painful how many people let their emotions take the wheel and sell out at the slightest sign of red numbers. The people who've been investing in bitcoin for longer aren't stressing out. There's more to bitcoin than the price in USD terms. This is a revolution, a world changing idea, and an idea which will change our world in ways still unimaginable. The world needs a decentralised currency with fair rules for everyone. The world needs to shake off the tyrannical control that banks and countries have over our savings and monetary policy. The world needs a currency that protects it's savers from the invisible tax called inflation. 

I don't blame anyone if you recognise yourself in the panic selling - this is just an attempt to give some advice. Zoom out. Try seeing the bigger picture again. If your investment timeframe is so heavily evolving around what the bitcoin price will do **today**, you're invested for the wrong reasons. Think about the implications of the bitcoin ecosystem in 5 years. 10 years. 20 years. This is world changing, the legacy finance &amp; fiat systems are on life support. 

For the people using Dollar Cost Average among us, this dip is a gift. The lower it goes the more bitcoin you can secure for yourself before this thing will fullfil it's full potential. 

I'm not selling. I never will. Especially not at prices like this. Don't let panic blind you.",cryptocurrency
investing,The truth about tether and crypto prices,"DISCLAIMER: This is not my post.

What's Tether?

USDT is a ""stablecoin"" -- a cryptocurrency whose price is supposed to be pegged to the US dollar -- managed by a company called tether.

Initially tether said they enforced the peg by having each USDT be backed by a USD in a bank account. Then tether ran into all sorts of hilarious hijinks over the years, many of which we only found out because they [were made public in NYAG litigation](https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/2021.02.17_-_settlement_agreement_-_execution_version.b-t_signed-c2_oag_signed.pdf), including:

* Having all of tether's money in their lawyer's personal bank account (May 2017)
* Not having any bank account anywhere in the world for 6 monthsto receive money in. Yet still emitting $400m new tethers in that period. Their lawyer's personal account had, at most, $60m at any point. Bitfinex had two institutional deposits in that whole period, neither of whom purchased USDT.
* Failing to complete an audit and settling on an attestation (An audit verifies where money comes from. An attestation is just an accoutnant saying ""there was money in a bank account on that date"") for ""transparency"". The morning of the attestation, tether moved $380m from sister company bitfinex into a bank account the morning of the day of the attestation.
* Losing $900M to their money launderer, and covering those losses by commingling bitfinex customer funds with tether reserve funds (2018)
* Finding the last bank on earth, [Deltec Bank from Bahamas](https://www.deltecbank.com/) willing to do business with them after Wells Fargo and HSBC fired them as clients. Remember HSBC has the kind of risk tolerance leaving them to [willingly deals with drug cartels](https://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/hsbc-moved-vast-sums-of-dirty-money-after-paying-record-laundering-fine/). No bank wants tether as a client.

Just read section 2 and 3 of the NYAG settlement. It's a blast. The best recap on the tether saga is by [Amy Castor](https://amycastor.com/2019/01/17/the-curious-case-of-tether-a-complete-timeline-of-events/), but [Patrick McKenzie](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2019/10/28/tether-and-bitfinex/) also has a good write up. Note that Patrick's piece is quaint now -- it was written back in 2019 when tether's balance sheet was $2B. Tether now has over [$58B on their balance sheet](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-18-at-11.28.53-PM-1024x585.png)

As far as we know, there was no point in history at which USDT in circulation were backed 1-to-1 by USD in a bank account. At this point, they stopped even pretending -- each tether in circulation is backed by... [tether's ""reserves"".](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/reserves.gif)

The ""Reserves""

For a long time, tether's ""reserves"" were a mystery. As found in the NYAG investigation, tether likely never had a dollar in a bank account for each USDT, at any point, ever. They're now forced to reveal the makeup in May 2021 as per the NYAG settlement. Tether found a 5-person accounting firm in the Cayman islands willing to do an [attestation](https://tether.to/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/tether-assurance-feb-2021.pdf), which states they have 0.36% more assets than liabilities.

In anticipation for their forced public disclosure, tether recently posted this [glorious pie chart](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/glorious_pie_chart-1024x769.png)

Which [has](https://protos.com/tether-pie-chart-usdt-dollar-pegged-crypto-stablecoin-dollar-value/) [prompted](https://bennettftomlin.com/2021/05/13/for-every-1-of-tether-there-are-0-03-in-cash/) [many](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tether-first-breakdown-shows-token-120000439.html) [more](https://www.ft.com/content/529eb4e6-796a-4e81-8064-5967bbe3b4d9) [questions](https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2021/05/13/tether-publishes-two-pie-charts-of-its-reserves/). First, we can view the actual debt in this form, as [broken Intel Jackal](https://twitter.com/intel_jakal) ([image](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/piechart.png))

Almost all of the reserves are in some form of loan to a commercial company (corporate bonds, commercial paper, secured loans). Only around 5% are in assets whose value we know (cash, T-Bills).

Inconsistencies

Tether's general counsel, Stuart Hoegner, posted a [highly unusual blog post](https://stuarthoegner.medium.com/tether-is-setting-a-new-standard-for-transparency-and-responding-to-criticism-that-is-fc130e08319b) in which he claims this is good debt by any standard. This raises many inconsistencies, which are easy to see given the magnitude of the numbers at hand.

* Stuart claims they don't hold Treasury Bills because the interest rate is close to 0%. If they hold this risky debt as reserves because it pays higher interest, **why does tether only have 0.36% more assets than liabilities?** Either thether's management is looting the interest rates on the assets and leaving USDT holders with the debt's risk, or we're being lied to.
* With $20B in commercial paper at the time of the attestation, and 50% more USDT on the market since, tether presumably has **$30B in commercial paper** at time of writing. The [entire commercial paper market](https://sec.gov/files/primer-money-market-funds-commercial-paper-market.pdf) in the US is around $1T per year.

We're supposed to believe that **tether somehow holds 3% of the US commercial paper market** at time of writing, and that they *apparently bought 1% of the entire market in the last month alone*.

* The asset allocation strategy in the reserves seems to be [copied from](https://twitter.com/intel_jakal/status/1394562510070583296) an investment fund at tether's bank, Deltec. This investment fund apparently manages $425M, rather than $60B.
* If the reserves are such regular financial assets, how come respectable accounting firms won't even touch it for a simple attestation?

We know that some of the money used for USDT come from Chinese money laundering because a tether shareholder [was recently charged](https://protos.com/china-crypto-otc-king-zhao-dong-criminal-charges-court-docs-show/). But we see no mention of frozen accounts in the reserves. Moreover, this amounts to less than $0.5B, and the perpetrator was nicknamed the ""Chinese OTC King"" -- so even in the charitable case where USDT are fully backed by money laundering, this raises inconsistencies.

Reminder: non-USD reserves for a stablecoin are a problem

As noted by [Frances Coppola](https://www.coppolacomment.com/2021/05/tethers-smoke-and-mirrors.html), it's dangerous to guarantee to clients that something is worth $1 when your assets backing it are not dollars. The value of the USD changes very little. The value of crypto changes a lot.

If you want to enforce a market price of $1 for something backed by not-dollars, then the quantity of reserves needs to go up and down with the asset price changes. Otherwise, you'll eventually become insolvent, when asset prices become lower than what you bought them for.

Who are these loan to?

Tether has lost the privilege of the benefit of doubt a long time ago. Here is how tether's Ponzi scheme likely works:

* All their commercial debt is to the related exchanges (Binance, FTX, Bitfinex - see below) or their affiliated shell companies.
* Tether make new USDT out of thin air and send them against a dollar-denominated loan to these affiliates
* The affiliates use the new USDT to put market buy-orders for crypto, putting them on the new USDT on market
* Crypto goes up in value becaue of the new demand pressure. This overcollateralizes the affiliated loans, justifying more loans.
* Rinse, repeat.

We can track who new USDT go to directly by looking at their [TRON](https://tronscan.org/#/address/TKHuVq1oKVruCGLvqVexFs6dawKv6fQgFs/transfers), [ethereum](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5754284f345afc66a98fbb0a0afe71e0f007b949#tokentxns), [OMNI](https://omniexplorer.info/address/1NTMakcgVwQpMdGxRQnFKyb3G1FAJysSfz) and [Solana](https://explorer.solana.com/address/Q6XprfkF8RQQKoQVG33xT88H7wi8Uk1B1CC7YAs69Gi) blockchain addresses. By matching the blockchain addresses new USDT are sent to to known parties, we can track who are the ones sending [new USDT on the market:](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tether-to-exchanges-1024x530.png)

The counterparties are largely Binance, FTX, Bitfinex, and other exchanges. The commercial paper is presumably to affiliated shell companies. I wouldn't put those companies debt at a dollar-to-dollar valuation; for instance [Binance is currently under investigation by the DOJ and IRS](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-13/binance-probed-by-u-s-as-money-laundering-tax-sleuths-bore-in).

But how does the $1 peg hold?

This is an easy one. [FTX happily admits to enforcing the dollar peg](https://twitter.com/AlamedaTrabucco/status/1348773044873949185) ([image](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-18-at-11.12.17-PM-861x1024.png))

You can easily enforce the dollar peg by wash-trading around the $1 price and arbitraging on exchanges who don't.

FTX don't even need to be complicit to the scheme for this to make financial sense: if FTX can get new USDT for $1 on an infinite loan margin from tether, it's perfectly sensible to buy USDT when it's below $1 and shortsell USDT when it's above.

The Mississippi bubble, 2021 style

The cryptocurrency ecosystem is conceptually simple. Money comes in from new investors buying, and the same money comes out to pay those cashing out. It would be a zero-sum ecosystem, except for the fact that miners have to pay their [bills in dollars](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/crypto_is_simple.png)

This is why ""bitcoin investors"" feel an immediate urge to tell everyone else to invest in bitcoin -- if no new money comes in, the financial structure eventually collapses under the miner's sell pressure.

Note how this is different than buying a company's stock. People buy and sell stocks on a stock exchange, but the companies independently have money coming in (from their clients). The stock of a profitable company is a positive-sum ecosystem. If somehow no one wants to buy the stock, a profitable company will be happy to buy it back itself.

When tether comes in with their scheme, they put demand pressure on BTC then add a supply constraint on BTC (also driving up the price!) by reducing the total supply of BTC to [hoard in their reserves](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/crypto_is_usdt.png)

Notice that even though bitcoin prices are higher, **no additional money entered the ecosystem** in the tether pump. Like a Ponzi scheme, we *cannot pay everyone off at the inflated price* using the pool of money that's in the crypto ecosystem (More specifically, the pool of money in the crypto exchange's customer fund bank accounts) When enough money starts looking for the exit door, a $60B hole gets torn into the ecosystem, and [someone has to pay for it.](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/masterpiece.gif)

The danger zone happens when BTC drops below $18,500

Assuming that each new USDT is used to instantly buy BTC at market prices (This is a lower bound estimate, since USDT are issued on the market between mint periods, where price is increasing), we can track where the BTC ""price of no return"" is -- where reserve BTC were paid for [more overall than they're now worth.](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tether_insolvency_point.png)

We can play around with parameters (they might buy ETH or Dogecoin rather than BTC, etc.) but most calculations land the death zone in the $17k-$20k range -- prices we were at around December 2020.

The scheme can easily collapse above this point. Bernie Madoff's customer deposits was around $18B against a $65B promised liabilities, but his scheme collapsed way before $40B in funds were withdrawn, because fraudsters tend to mismanage and embezzle some of the money for themselves.

Notice that the last point in time where BTC price went significantly below the death zone is the March 2020 COVID price crash -- which is also the point where USDT were started to be minted at a parabolic rate.

The DeFi boom started with the USDT flood

This is a sidenote to this story, but the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) boom started because of USDT flooding the market. DeFi is not a new invention: it's existed since the 2017 bubble. No one picked it up because it's a fairly useless idea: lock up more collateral for a crypto loan than the loan's value and use the loan.

DeFi is exclusively used to leverage trading - eg. lock up BTC, keep the BTC exposure, and use the loan to buy more BTC. You can't buy a house or start a business on a DeFi loan -- the point of normal loans is to use personal creditworthiness and **under**collateralization to move future cashflows into the present. For these reasons, [no one picked it up for years](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-18-at-11.16.05-PM-1024x497.png)

But notice something happened around the same time as USDT exploded. We can track what happened to DeFi by getting historical borrowing rates and matching them to total money in DeFi (TVL), USDT in [DeFi and total USDT](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/defirates-1024x512.png)

A clear story emerges:

No one used DeFi until tether joined the Ethereum blockchain in April 2019. Then a ton of new tethers, with no particular place to go, found themselves emitting DeFi loans. This floored the borrowing rates for DeFi, especially so in April 2020, after tether started printing themselves out of insolvency.

Once borrowing rates were appealing, DeFi started taking off.

Eventually, the DeFi ecosystem tried to distance itself from USDT, but the coin is still around 45% of the entire space.

USDT DeFi loans are generally USDT-denominated. If the USDT peg breaks significantly, these USDT DeFi loans will go into margin call one way or another.

The noose is tightening

At the time of writing, BTC crashed from a high of $64k to around $41k (now 38k). But more importantly, for the first time in months, we're starting to see **significant backflows** into tether addresses, largely from Binance. Here are the outflows and inflows (excluding newly minted USDT) into the tether address [on Tron, for example](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/death-1024x567.png)

The orange lines are USDT coming out onto market. The blue lines are USDT coming back into tether's blockchain address.

This is means people are recently withdrawing, a lot. The music could stop at any moment now. It could take hours, or it could take months.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Not from the copy paste: I want to add to this, on the day of Elon's initial tweet about Tesla not accepting bitcoin, there was a drastic spike of bitcoin coming into exchanges JUST PRIOR to the tweet. Was this Elon, someone he told, or just a lucky trade? Who knows. However, after the tweet there was a sudden move of 650 million tether (so $650m)  onto exchanges to BUY bitcoin as the price was collapsing and this stabilized the price. In my opinion tether is being used to inflate BTC but unlike the federal reserve tether cannot print $$$$. **Oh, and tether clearly states they do NOT guarantee any redemption of dollars to holders of tether.** IE they are not assured you can trade a tether for a dollar like other stable coins

Tether make new USDT out of thin air and send them against a dollar-denominated loan to these affiliates

Like a Ponzi scheme, we cannot pay everyone off at the inflated price using the pool of money that's in the crypto ecosystem (More specifically, the pool of money in the crypto exchange's customer fund bank accounts) When enough money starts looking for the exit door, a $60B hole gets torn into the ecosystem, and someone has to pay for it.

The danger zone happens when BTC drops below $18,500

Assuming that each new USDT is used to instantly buy BTC at market prices (This is a lower bound estimate, since USDT are issued on the market between mint periods, where price is increasing), we can track where the BTC ""price of no return"" is -- where reserve BTC were paid for more overall than they're now worth.

We can play around with parameters (they might buy ETH or Dogecoin rather than BTC, etc.) but most calculations land the death zone in the $17k-$20k range -- prices we were at around December 2020.

The scheme can easily collapse above this point. Bernie Madoff's customer deposits was around $18B against a $65B promised liabilities, but his scheme collapsed way before $40B in funds were withdrawn, because fraudsters tend to mismanage and embezzle some of the money for themselves.

Notice that the last point in time where BTC price went significantly below the death zone is the March 2020 COVID price crash -- which is also the point where USDT were started to be minted at a parabolic rate.

The DeFi boom started with the USDT flood

This is a sidenote to this story, but the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) boom started because of USDT flooding the market. DeFi is not a new invention: it's existed since the 2017 bubble. No one picked it up because it's a fairly useless idea: lock up more collateral for a crypto loan than the loan's value and use the loan.

DeFi is exclusively used to leverage trading - eg. lock up BTC, keep the BTC exposure, and use the loan to buy more BTC. You can't buy a house or start a business on a DeFi loan -- the point of normal loans is to use personal creditworthiness and undercollateralization to move future cashflows into the present. For these reasons, no one picked it up for years

But notice something happened around the same time as USDT exploded. We can track what happened to DeFi by getting historical borrowing rates and matching them to total money in DeFi (TVL), USDT in DeFi and total USDT

A clear story emerges:

No one used DeFi until tether joined the Ethereum blockchain in April 2019. Then a ton of new tethers, with no particular place to go, found themselves emitting DeFi loans. This floored the borrowing rates for DeFi, especially so in April 2020, after tether started printing themselves out of insolvency.

Once borrowing rates were appealing, DeFi started taking off.

Eventually, the DeFi ecosystem tried to distance itself from USDT, but the coin is still around 45% of the entire space.

USDT DeFi loans are generally USDT-denominated. If the USDT peg breaks significantly, these USDT DeFi loans will go into margin call one way or another.

The noose is tightening

At the time of writing, BTC crashed from a high of $64k to around $41k (now 38k). But more importantly, for the first time in months, we're starting to see significant backflows into tether addresses, largely from Binance. Here are the outflows and inflows (excluding newly minted USDT) into the tether address on Tron, for example

The orange lines are USDT coming out onto market. The blue lines are USDT coming back into tether's blockchain address.

This is means people are recently withdrawing, a lot. The music could stop at any moment now. It could take hours, or it could take months.

​

​

Not from the copy paste: I want to add to this, on the day of Elon's initial tweet about Tesla not accepting bitcoin, there was a drastic spike of bitcoin coming into exchanges JUST PRIOR to the tweet. Was this Elon, someone he told, or just a lucky trade? Who knows. However, after the tweet there was a sudden move of 650 million tether (so $650m) onto exchanges to BUY bitcoin as the price was collapsing and this stabilized the price. In my opinion tether is being used to inflate BTC but unlike the federal reserve tether cannot print $$$$. Oh, and tether clearly states they do NOT guarantee any redemption of dollars to holders of tether. IE they are not assured you can trade a tether for a dollar like other stable coins

​

I would recommend avoiding BTC until tether is fully audited and we know what companies that commercial paper refers to.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Lost Tax Return - help?,"I’ve done some googling online and really cannot figure out what to do. So any help is sincerely appreciated. Filed taxes late February, have received state but not federal. 

I’ve done my taxes on TurboTax for the past six years but this year was a little more complicated but didn’t seem too crazy. My wife is self-employed and so we were able to benefit from the sick leave Covid credit as my wife took time off to care for our little ones. (Form 1040 I believe) TurboTax would not allow me to file that form electronically so I had to file everything via paper and mailed it. The IRS said if you filed that form you can wait longer times the normal to get your return so I waited… a while. Unfortunately here I am in the same spot, waiting. With no info about my return from WheresMyRefund it seems like either something was filled out wrong, it was lost, or something of the like. 

Should I amend my return? I don’t think I can remove that form though?

Should I re mail the federal all together as it originally was?

Are there any late penalties…? Even though my original was sent months ago?

I hope someone can help, just not sure what is best to do. This unfortunately is our family’s largest tax return to date so I am quite nervous.

personalfinance,What am I missing on a zero closing cost refinance?,"For context: I currently own a home with about $340k left, one year into a 20 year mortgage at 3.25%.  We pay $480 extra each month on principal. 

Looking at refinance rates, I’m mainly searching for lowest closing costs because we only plan to be in this house 6-8 years at most due to job requirements. Most like closer to 6. Don’t want to dump all the cash into fees when the break even time would barely be worth it. 

I have an offer from Loandepot for a “Zero closing cost” loan at 2.75% for a 15 year fixed, which I know isn’t a huge gain in rate, but at zero closing costs and shorter duration it still has to be worth it, right? Even with the higher payment it looks like we’d still be able to put about $200 extra toward principal each month without exceeding what we currently allocate monthly for mortgage costs, for even more interest reduction. 

So, what am I missing about a zero closing cost loan? I know it relates to the higher interest rate when there are better rates out there at higher cost, but it still seems too good to be true or like I’m fundamentally not understanding something.

Gold has been able to bounce from the dip of $1680 as we can see in this chart. Market sentiment went bullish on GOLD due to Powell being very dovish on the economy. He mentioned he would like to see sustainable inflation, economic stability, and maximum unemployment and employment before doing any sort of tapering. In the past few days, we've seen several fed members mention that it is time to start tapering for a couple of time, but Powell seem to not like it and he keeps on pushing back on tapering. Gold also benefit from the weaknesses of the USD and is also capitalizing well from Risk-Off mood sentiment which makes GOLD very bullish.

As for today, we saw enormous profit-taking from the crypto market which is really rough for crypto investors. Hedge Funds and other financial institutions will receive margin calls if they are not prepared for this massive short, so we will see them hedging their position by doing asset-allocation which they will hold their crypto position but hedge their portfolio by going LONG on GOLD to cover some losses.

In the near term, I still think GOLD has a little bit more room to reach $1900, but only time can tell. If the FED starts talking about tapering, we will see negative sentiment on GOLD. In this fast-moving trading environment where volatility remains high, I suggest traders should have a tight stoploss, always take partial profits when the market gives an opportunity so and learn how to adapt in a high and low volatile movement.

investing,Can we please throw out the idea that Bitcoin is an asset that protects against inflation?,"Throughout the lifecycle of bitcoin, I've heard this statement over and over again. ""Bitcoin is gold for the 21st century""... ""Bitcoin is protection against jpow's printer"".... ""Bitcoin prevents against USD debasement""...

I have nothing against blockchain tech on its own. I think there are some wonderful aspects to the technology. With that said, the amount of narratives used to sell bitcoin to others that are just completely wrong on a variety of levels is getting to be rather stupid. And given today's selloff, it's a good opportunity to explain how the narrative is completely disconnected from reality.

**Bitcoin As Inflation Protection = Bad Narrative**

I have said for a long time that bitcoin is a RISK ASSET. It's yet another in a long line of strong performing financial assets that have done well in our environment of excess liquidity and low inflation. In this light, it's not that different from the growth investing asset class.

If bitcoin actually served as any form of inflation protection, then why in the world did it tank 12% on the day that we got the highest YOY CPI print in over a decade? And nobody can argue that it was a product of interest rates rising... since they haven't risen in any significant way since that inflation print. And it's now tanked almost 40% at a time when you would expect any idea of inflation protection to be the strongest driver of the asset class. Something... doesn't add up here.

Why make up incorrect beliefs to justify purchasing something, when there are perfectly reasonable bull cases to be made that aren't dependent on misleading people on the economics of inflation and ""money printing""? And for whatever it's worth, Gold suffers from some of the same problems, although it obviously behaves a bit differently than crypto.

**Bad Economic Narratives Dominate Bitcoin Beliefs**

* How many times do people need to show you M2 charts before they actually take a minute and compare M2 to the actual inflation levels? Hint for those who aren't aware, growth in M2 is 100% meaningless if it causes an equivalent drop in the velocity of money.
* How many times do people need to call quantitative easing ""money printing"", without understanding how quantitative easing actually works? Hint: the ""money printing"" comes from temporary fiscal stimulus, not from the fed pushing reserves that are never used onto banks' balance sheets.
* How many times do people misunderstand that ""asset inflation"" (which is just another word for a bubble) is different than consumer price inflation? Hint: Real consumer price inflation is typically rather negative for more speculative risk assets (such as bitcoin).
* How many times do people need to suggest the US dollar is ""getting killed"" before they actually look at a price history chart of the US Dollar? Hint: the US dollar is more or less right in the middle of it's price range over the last 50+ years, is significantly higher than it was throughout the entire time period from 2005-2015, and hasn't even dropped that far this year despite the massive amount of stimulus + fed swap lines used since the Covid pandemic. You would think that if the US dollar was ***actually*** debasing, we would get more than a 5% drawdown during the largest stimulus package ever. 

&amp;#x200B;

My personal subjective opinion is that Bitcoin is yet another risk asset that benefits largely from too much money chasing too few assets. This IS actually in part a product of quantitative easing, but the irony here is that QE is not actually causing inflation. I think blockchain will likely be used in the future for a wide variety of uses, but I have no clue whether Bitcoin will serve any actual functions aside from speculative ownership. Note: I do not own any crypto or crypto-oriented stocks, so I don't have anything to either gain or lose here.

And by the way, this is not intended as a bullish or bearish post on bitcoin. Just trying to debunk some of the very obviously incorrect narratives that have been sold to the public over the years.",finance

economy,HOW INFLATION WILL AFFECT EVERYONE,"""Buy when there's blood in the streets"" - Baron Rothschild

As you've probably noticed, there is plenty of blood in the streets right now, but some people may not understand why, or the true severity of the inflation that may be on the horizon.

Inflation is nothing more than the 'inflation' of prices. In other words, everything becomes more expensive, but people have the same amount of money in the bank

Think of 1930's Germany

The combination of supply shortages, work shortages, excessive money printing, and increased demand has created a perfect storm for everything to get much more expensive. Everything from bacon and haircuts to gasoline and computer parts

Of course, this also translated into financial systems as well because as inflation ramps up, interest rates rise. For the most part, interest rates and the stock market have an inverse relationship. Meaning when one rises, the other falls

This all being said, even though there is a lot of pain in the economy right now, there is a few key things everyone should do if they want to avoid getting hurt badly by inflation

The first and foremost is, of course, understand that cash is trash. The reason why cash gets devalued during inflationary times is because everything else rises in price

So the question would be, would you rather own the pieces of paper that are constantly losing value, or would you rather own the assets that are constantly rising in value?

The answer is quite simple

Of course this is not financial advice, but I will say that if you're seeing your portfolio in the red, do not panic. Check out this video here on how else inflation will end up affecting all of us.

personalfinance,Two different house buying situations and advice needed...,"I need help and advice for a couple different situations. My brother and I each recently received $60,000 from a settlement. We are both looking to buy houses. Our situations are different and I would really like some advice on both situations.

Me &amp; My Wife

Jobs: She is currently a phlebotomist and is also attending online school to become a med tech. She is about a year into a two year college career. I am currently unemployed. My job was laid off because I worked for a well known photography company as a Retouch specialist. The job depended heavily on School/Churches and Covid cut that off. So, I've taken the role of house hubby since my wife is working full time and doing college courses. I do currently collect unemployment because my company has continued layoffs. However, I do not know if I will be returning because of transportation and the company has gone through a lot of changes (Buyout, dropping departments, moving the productions). I'm hesitant to find anything else right now because with us wanting to buy a house, and including other nearby towns, I would not have transportation if we moved to a different town than the one we live in now. We do plan on purchasing a second vehicle but it is second to buying a house. Plus, I won't lie, even when I lose unemployment, we both hope to keep me as house hubby until she finishes school. With her working 8 to 12 hours a day, depending on the week and having to devote 4-5 hours a day to school work, we both like me here to do all the cooking and cleaning and maintaining the house. A part time job is not out of the question either, but again, I wanna wait until I know where we will live. 


Why We Want To Buy: Our current apartment, we have been living in for almost ten years now. We both hate it and we have so many problems with our neighbors. It's a duplex and we have issues with our upstairs neighbors too. The apartment is tiny and we have no space, even with getting rid of pretty much everything we don't need. We are not in a huge hurry but I would really like to be in the process of finding a new home soonish. 

Financial: The area we live in (a small town in Ohio) is not super expensive. My wife makes about $24,268.80 a year but will be making quite a bit more when she is done with college and finds a job as a lab tech. Currently, on Unemployment, I make about $480 a week but that will end in the next couple months. We do have the $60,000 from the settlement and about $5500 that we had saved up over the years. We have no debt except for her student loans, which estimate to be around $10,500. However, we do not need to start paying on that until six months after she graduates so about a year and a half to two years from now. We have no current medical debt, car payments, or any other loans out. Both our credit scores are between 700 and 750. We both have credit cards but they are rarely used and paid off within a week or two of their use. We are both in our lower thirties and we're married. 

The Plan so Far: Now, we know things can change, but the plan currently is to find something 100K or less (which in our area seems to be average). Ideally, I want to put about 20K as a down payment. Possibly more if the house comes with more recent appliances (Less things to buy). My hope is to get a monthly payment in the realm of our current rent (Between $400 and $500). I'm not sure how realistic this is but it is the hope at the moment. We do have ideas of what we want in a house, some negotiable and some not. In my mind, I'm hoping to put 20K down and have to put less than 20k to 30k into the house to get it the way we want it. That second amount includes moving, buying appliances if needed, repairs if needed, and adding things if needed. For example, a fenced in back yard is a must. Preferably, already built but if not, I would try to fit that in the 20-30k budget allowance to have one built.  The 20-30k would also include closing cost, inspection and any other costs along that line. 


Our Progress so far: We have a checking and saving account at a Firelands federal credit union. We've been with them for seventeen years or so and we have done other loans through them and we like how they work. So ideally, we would go through them for the house loan. They are in the process of training a new person and setting up their office so we are supposed to call Thursday to set up an appointment for Pre-Approval. 


The Questions: I've been researching and there is so much information to take in. I know the different type of loans (FHA, VA, Fixed, etc). We wouldn't qualify for VA because neither of us are veterans. We're both children of vets but I don't think that matters. The two options that seem the best to us is FHA and Fixed Rate. I know FHA is great for first time buyers but I also know it is more for people with lower credit and not much of a down payment. I'm more than happy to put down the 20K on our end to get us a lower monthly payment. I know that with FHA, our monthly could be higher and the amount we owe could flux. Ideally, I would like to have a pretty smooth setup, with minimal surprises. So, I think that Fixed Rate may be the way to go. We would know what our monthly payment is and, with putting down 20%, hopefully that payment would be lower than if we went with FHA. Does this seem correct? Or am I misunderstanding the situation? Do any of you have a specifics suggestion which direction to go in my particular situation? 


We live in Ohio. Are there any programs or grants we could try for that might give us some money or help, without having to pay a ton back. As I said, we are first time buyers with good credit so I'm just wondering if there are any grants out there for people like us.
 

Any other suggestions in our situation? 



Now for my brother's situation.

He is currently living in a house he is renting. However, the landlord has offered to sell him the house for $20,000. The problem is, that it seems like the house may have foundation issues. So I managed to talk him into hiring an inspector to check everything out before he actually does anything official. I too am going to hire an inspector but I plan on doing that during the process. What does he need to do to find and hire an inspector if he is not going through a Realtor or loan process? Is it as simple as looking up one online and scheduling an appointment? Any advice for him in general in this situation? He is pretty intent on buying this particular house but I really hope he does it right and doesn't get stuck with a money pit. He is young (26) and I'm sure his credit is fairly low. His GF is on disability. He does have a well paying job for the area (like 16ish an hour I believe). 


Sorry for the long read and I know that we will probably go over a lot of this with the loan officer at my credit union. I'm just a person who like to have all their ducks in a row and likes to be as informed as much as possible before making life altering decisions. I sincerely appreciate any advice. Feel free to ask any questions and I will answer them to the best of my ability.",finance
personalfinance,"Should I send a debt validation letter? A debt collector called &amp; left a voicemail, but nothing is amiss on my credit report and I haven't received any written notifications from the CA","I received a call yesterday from Hunter Warfield. I didn't answer as the number I think the call came from looked spoofed (one of those numbers that is near-identical to your own) and I generally just don't answer my cell unless you're in my contacts or have a caller ID. They left a brief voicemail (transcript below) that doesn't tell me anything. I have **not** received anything in the mail from them. I have Informed Delivery from USPS and check the updates I get daily; that said the postal service in my city is at its worst since COVID right now.

I googled Hunter Warfield and quickly found resources like the ones here about disputing debts. I couldn't think of any debt I have/had that was overdue or would have gone to collections with the exception of a call I got years ago about a debt owed on a utility or something for an address I'd never lived at -- if memory serves, there was one common factor to the addresses, like the same street number, but I think the debt in question was at a business address and not residential. I think I told the called I'd never lived at that address and never heard more.

I checked my credit report and didn't see anything unusual or not in good standing on either TransUnion or Experian. 

This situation makes me nervous so I was about ready to send Hunter Warfield a debt validation letter. Should I go ahead and send one? Since I haven't received anything written from them I'm wary to give them more of my information than they already have -- as best I can tell, it's just my phone number and MAYBE my name.

personalfinance,Medical Bill Debt,"Hello All. I might be asking for the impossible here, but after all of the work I've done, I just want to make sure I've exhausted all potential avenues of relief. Maybe there are other thoughts and opinions out there that I have not considered yet. I am more than happy to hear what you all think.

**Background**: I am a 31 year old male, mechanical engineer working for a DoD contracting company. I make \~$100k a year. My company offers ""decent"" health insurance, but it's a HDHP with a $2,000 deductible and $5,000 out of pocket max (for in network providers).

I had a heart attack in October of 2020. I am generally healthy. I lift weights 3-4 times/week. I play weekly on a volleyball team. I run 1-2/week. I do not have any family history of heat disease. I don't do drugs. I drink socially a few times a month. I eat meal prep during the week and then I splurge on the weekends. The 80/20 rule. Frankly, the doctors think it's just stress. I do have a history of stress and anxiety. I do have chronic migraines, likely related to stress also. To top off my series of unfortunate events, I ended up passing a kidney stone in January of 2021, likely due to the migraine medicine, Topamax, that causes kidney stone buildup. New year, new deductible and plan max!

**Issue:** While I do make a lot of money, I do not have a lot of discretionary funds each month. I have $120k in student loans, a $20k auto loan, a $240k mortgage loan, and an $8k personal loan. I went into considerable debt when I was married for 7 years. My ex-wife was an illegal immigrant and we went into debt fixing that. She had a child from a previous marriage and we went into debt constantly fighting with her ex-husband over custody issues. We are divorced now, but I had to carry a lot of that debt as it was all in my name. I worked hard over the past few years paying it down. Lessons learned. Please do not judge me. I was young and dumb. That being said, I only have about $300/pay check (bi-weekly) after all deductions, debt and bills. Besides the debt, my other monthly bills are: utilities, car insurance, cell phone, internet, Hulu and Apple One. I have tried to eliminate all other unnecessary bills. Hulu and Apple One are really the only extra bills I have that I don't strictly need but that costs me about $30/month.

The medical bills are STILL coming in, 8 months later, but it looks like I will end up owing $7,000. Because of my income level, I absolutely do **not** qualify for the financial assistance offered by the provider.  I have worked hard on verifying the medical bills. I've created a spreadsheet documenting all of the claims and verifying the amount I was billed is correctly applied to my deductible and plan max. I have also tried to verify the billed amounts with usury costs in my area. Most of the bills do seem to align closely. Some are higher, some are lower, so I think it balances out. That said, I did try to negotiate a lower bill but they refuse to budge. For example, I showed them how the usury costs for a CT scan of abdomen and pelvis is $1,477 for my area but they charged me $2,081, which is over $600 higher than that average. They refused to change the bill: ""We unfortunately cannot change the cost of the CT scan."" After several back and forth emails and phone calls, they started spamming me with that same response. They simply refuse. I also tried to offer a lumpsum payment in exchange for them lowering the overall bill. They also refused.

Meanwhile, they threatened to send me to collections. I set up a payment plan just to get them off of my back while I figure the rest of it out. I was able to set up a $150/month payment plan which leaves me with $225/paycheck for the rest of my expenses.

I don't even think I can gain any tax break from this since the bills are split up between two different years and will not rise past the threshold in comparison to my income.

**Question:** Are there any other recourses available to me to help manage this medical debt? Am I doomed to simply pay the payment plan for the next 4 years? Are there any other ideas that I have not considered? Any and all help will be appreciate, thank you!

Edit. I forgot to mention that I do have an HSA and am making payments towards the medical bills through that.

Edit II: Adding my monthly budget here.

My bi-weekly gross pay is $3,848 and take-home pay is about $1,970, which makes it a monthly average of $4,268. I usually have about $1,000 in taxes deducted every paycheck ($503 Federal, $150 State, $273 Social Security, $55 Medicare). Health insurance premium is $52. I take out about $600 for my 401k (my company matches 100% of the first 5% and 50% for the next 2%) and another $75 for a 401k loan and then $150 for the HSA.

My recurring monthly bills are:  
Mortgage Loan:                $1225   
Federal Student Loan:      $551   
Private Student Loan:       $342   
Personal Loan:                   $525   
Auto Loan:                           $450   
Electricity:                            $155   
Gas:                                       $55   
Water/Sewage/Trash:        $45   
Car Insurance:                    $57   
Cell Phone:                          $71   
Internet:                              $58

personalfinance,Looking for advice on low APR credit card options that allow balance transfers!,"Hello all, I am looking for some advice. Posting on a throwaway account so no identifying info can be linked to my main. 

I am not the most financial savvy but I am trying to learn. I would love some advice on what would be a good credit card to apply to, so I can transfer my current balance to something with a lower APR. I receive offers in the mail all the time but I am never sure what is good and what is a scam, and I don't want to apply to too many cards and rack up hard inquiries. I have a decent amount of debt but good credit and a strong financial background currently, I've put a lot of effort into rebuilding my credit recently. 

I'm not concerned about fancy rewards or anything. I really just want to work towards being debt free, and having a lower interest on my current credit card debt would go a long way.

I would be incredibly grateful for any advice or recommendations!! My whole financial situation is below. The big factor is that I need to be able to transfer my current credit card balance so I can close my account with Capital One, which has an APR of 22% (yikes). 


~~~

28yo female in the USA, salaried job 41k, currently renting so no mortgage, single and childfree. 

I have good credit, 720, something I have been working very hard on since getting screwed over on some medical bills a few years ago. 

I have one main credit card through Capital One with a ~6k balance that I am trying to pay down. However, I took it out in 2014 when my finances were pretty awful, so it's at a 22% APR, which makes paying more than the minimum monthly payments a little hard. I use it as little as possible but it's just a money pit at this point. 

I've already talked with Capital One, they do not lower interest rates, and I cannot apply for a new card with them and transfer the balance internally. I have only missed one payment since 2014, I was 3 days late on a payment this fall due to issues with Covid. 

I have one other open credit card, a store card that I always pay off the same week I make purchases. I have a federal student loan with ~18k remaining, and a car loan with ~9k. For both of those I have never missed a payment and consistently pay over the minimum payment. I have no other debt, I just paid off my private student loan last month.",finance

financialindependence,"(US / FL / 7YR Update) - Married, Both 40, 2 kids, Just Broke $1M Net worth!","So approximately 7 years ago we made a reddit post asking if we would ever be able to retire.  

LINK: https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2y5bvl/need_advice_married_couple_in_mid_30s_with_4yr/

We received a lot of good advice which we tried to follow. We followed the financialindependence subreddit over the years for inspiration!

We have both now turned 40 years old.  Since then we had another child, and my wife was diagnosed with cancer a couple of times, but is currently doing well.  We were unable to contribute to our Roth IRAs for a couple years as we financially struggled due to medical bills and me being unemployed for nearly 18 months while trying to find higher paying jobs.  

Over the past 7 years I pursued additional training and began job hopping to increase my income.  Below is our current progress, and I think we met our goal! 

  **Combined Yearly Income: $132,000** (PREVIOUS: $73,942)  
  Occupation (Hers): K-5 Teacher at State / Public School (Unchanged)  
  Occupation (Mine): IT at a Defense Contractor  

  Roth IRA (Mine): $128,000 (PREVIOUS: $46,674)  
  Roth IRA (Hers): $128,000 (PREVIOUS: $46,674)  

  FL Retirement Investment Account (Mine): $58,000 (PREVIOUS: $26,614)  
  FL Retirement Investment Account (Hers): $94,000 (PREVIOUS: $46,674)  

  401k 100% Match at up to 4.5% (Mine): $4,700 (NEW)  

  **Total Retirement Funds = $408,000** (PREVIOUS: $155,611)  

  Home Purchase Price: $245,000  
  Current Estimated Value: $380,000 (PREVIOUS: $250,000)  
  Remaining Mortgage: $160,000 (PREVIOUS: $191,000)  
  Pay Off Year: 2043  
  Interest Rate: 3.375% (Looking to refinance)  
  Mortgage Credit Certificate: $2,000/yr Tax Credit  

  **Total Home Equity: $220,000** (PREVIOUS: $59,000)  

  **Cash On Hand: $45,000** (PREVIOUS: $18,460)  

  Credit Card Debt: $0  
  Car Loan Debt: $0  
  Student Loan Debt: $0  

  **Crypto Investing Windfall: $630,000 - $126,000 (Capital Gains Tax) = $504,000** (Technically cash at the moment)  

  **Rough Net Worth: $1,177,000.00**  

  Life Insurance (Hers): $150k (Work Provided)  
  Life Insurance (Mine): $300k (Work Provided)  

  Even without the Crypto Windfall, I think we were on track to retire comfortably.  Right now I am attempting to decide where to put the $504,000 in estimated post-tax long-term crypto profits/gains.  I had a friend recommend Raymond James, and another just tell me to put it into Vanguard.  Raymond James seems to be very high in fees (1.5%). I am unfamiliar with what investment account I should use, or if there are any tax advantage accounts that I could utilize.  Otherwise I was just going to transfer it to Vanguard and put it into a mix of mutual funds or perhaps even use their personal advisor service.  Our Roth IRA accounts are already in target retirement funds at Vanguard. So any suggestions or advice on this would be helpful.  

  I still have not setup any type of college funds for my children, although it is something I am considering. Hopefully it may reduce my tax liability for 2021 due to the significant Crypto windfall.  

  I am currently concerned about tax implications from the Crypto gains/sale, so I am in the process of trying to locate a CPA this year.  I did not do any day trading and the only transaction was the transfer of the crypto from a wallet to an exchange, and then selling it and transferring to my bank.  I held it for 7 years so it should be considered long term, which I believe is only 20%, although I am still trying to research this.  

  I am currently getting into shape and will be purchasing my own Life Insurance (outside of my employer). I also realize that the home value is market-dependent and that prices may decrease in the near future.  I am looking to refinance as well to see if that is a worthwhile pursuit.  I have thought of paying off my home with our Crypto windfall but have been told that the mortgage with the $2k yearly MCC tax credit is too ""cheap"" and I should instead invest the funds.  

  According to rough estimates from retirement calculators we will be fine.  Although if someone has a reliable ""realistic"" retirement calculator, please share!  

  Everything that has happened over the past 7 years was mainly from my previous thread, we took a lot of the advice from everyone and worked hard to try and make it happen.  It was a struggle until the recent Crypto windfall, which was a blessing.  

  Many put in so much work guiding us many years ago, I thought I should have the courtesy of giving an update to let you all know how things turned out.  

  The financialindependence subreddit was a huge inspiration for us! Please realize your stories and testimonials were motivating! We thank you guys so much!",finance
personalfinance,What first? Solar financing or HELOC/Mortgage refinance?,"We're looking at adding solar to our home. We expect to get 101% solar offset, but would need to take a loan on the install (and some needed electrical upgrades elsewhere in the house). After tax credits, the loan would be about 12k at 0.99%. I'm shopping around different solar companies to get the best deal.

We also have a mortgage through a Bank and a HELOC through a local Credit Union. We've been wanting to look into refinancing with the Credit Union to see if we could combine those into just a mortgage with them. The HELOC financed new siding which bumped our property value quite a bit.

In summary

* Mortgage is about $124k at 5.85%
* HELOC is about $30k at 4%
* Latest assessor numbers put the house at $177k
* Therefore approx 20k equity
* Solar company estimates a $14k value add

Is it better to get the Solar installed and financed, so I can have the added home value in place before talking about a mortgage refinance? The refinance is only worth it if the interest rate comes down, but is there another reason I shouldn't try to combine them?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: What I'm thinking after reading some responses is that I shouldn't be so confident in the increased value of my home, so doing solar first might not impact the refinance enough. Refinancing is good and could probably improve my loan-to-value, but there may be nuances of loan-position that complicate things. I think I'm also hearing that there might not be enough in it for me to pull the trigger right now on solar, and increasing LTV and paying down other debts should be a priority, which is fair advice.",finance

personalfinance,Feeling like we're at the end of one financial chapter and beginning of the next. Help us!,"30m &amp; 30f, Southeast Michigan. Self employed household take-home income of $55k per year.

No debt besides our brand new mortgage - we owe $187k on a 30 year mortgage. Interest rate is 2.75%. Got a fair price for the house (comparatively in this the market) - $195k.

Cars are paid off and running excellently. Worth approximately $10k together.

We own our previous starter home outright. We purchased it on a land contract 5 years ago, and managed to pay it off. It's tiny (760 sq ft) and has a lot of quirks - but it's ours. It's an hour from our house now, and we aren't quite sure what we want to do with it yet. It has a bit of cosmetic work that needs to be done this summer. We are considering renting, and also considering selling although there are some open permits and quirks that make this seem like it would be more complicated. Property tax is approximately $1k a year.

As summer hits, I expect to be making pretty good money. On track for my best year by a small amount. There are a couple small projects we want to eventually have done around the new house. We have started to seriously think about starting a family. We've waited because we wanted to have a solid foundation before diving in headfirst.

We don't have any real savings or investments besides the houses.

Any suggestions on where I should start? Is there any sage wisdom on emergency funds / good practices for saving? Any help is appreciated.",finance
CryptoCurrency,"Speculation on why the dump (and rebound) happened today, and what's to come.","This is purely speculation. Some of this will be talking about the world  outside of cryptos - specifically other markets, equities, and a bigger picture. If that's not allowed on this subreddit, totally understood, but I thought I'd bring an outsiders perspective to this, since I am utterly unsurprised by the events of the day and have been expecting this (or something like it) for some time. 

This is not meant as financial advice. Do your own research. Make your  own decisions. If you think I’m right, great! Act on it. If you think  I’m wrong, great! Act on it. Do your own thing. I'm just some guy on the internet, and my opinions are about as valuable as a guy spinning a sign on a street corner.

Finally, this is not intended as a FUD post - if you come to  the same conclusions I have, there will certainly be fear involved, but hopefully no uncertainty or doubt, and you can make decisions that lead to healthy financial outcomes for yourselves and loved ones. I’d  like to post a TLDR that everything is going to be okay at the end, but I  don’t necessarily think that’s going to be the case. I think scary and volatile times lay in our immediate future. I have no crystal ball, and whether that's tomorrow or 3 months from now I don't know, but I think we're facing choppy seas. 

I believe we're about to see a major market correction, and the volatility in cryptocurrencies is just the beginning. I believe this will hit every sector of the economy, from housing prices to the value of the USD. I believe cryptocurrencies in particular will see extreme volatility, both in a downward trajectory and later, an upward trajectory. 

Here are some core premises this speculation will be based on. 

1. Cryptocurrencies have not yet found a price equilibrium that reflects  their ultimate value. Currently, they are a speculative asset.

2. Despite not having to file their positions on their 13F forms, hedge  funds and investment banks are very much involved in cryptos.

3. Cryptos are a relatively unregulated market, which makes pump and dumps a much easier prospect. 

4. In their current form, cryptos have not achieved any real detachment  from the US dollar. Meaning, that when the market goes up, cryptos go  up, and when the market goes down, so do cryptos. Their promise of  breaking from the USD an becoming an intrinsically stable currency appears to not have matured  for the moment. 

Here are some ancillary premises. 

1. In order to shore up the economy during covid, the government did a  few things: it started loaning money at 0% interest like crazy, and it  reduced collateral requirements to increase liquidity in the  marketplace.

2. Collateral is heavily rehypothicated right now. An example of this  goes as follows: company A has a 20 year treasury bond. It’s keeping it  on its books as collateral to meet its margin requirements so that a lender will give it money to invest on margin. Company A then proceeds to lend  that treasury bond to company B. Company A keeps it on its books though, because  they can recall it as collateral any time they need to in order to meet their own collateral requirements. B now goes to  a lender and says “hey, I have this treasury bond as collateral,  will you lend me some money?” This process is repeated several times, until you eventually have an absolutely massive amount of margin being lent out on a single treasury bond serving as collateral. Go take a peak at the repo market. People are literally paying borrow US Treasuries to hold as collateral because collateral has been so overleveraged. 

3. During Covid, the economy has suffered. unemployment is up, supply chains have been stressed, companies have been going out of business, and savings have actually gone up for the lucky people who have been able to hang on to their jobs, and they're not out spending money. This has lead to an abnormal situation in which the stock market, which is typically (at least loosely) tied to the economy and goes up or down in tandem with the economy as a whole disconnecting - meaning that while the economy is doing poorly, the stock market has boomed to a new ATH at an unprecedented rate. 

4. Margin debt in the financial markets has seen an enormous spike in the last year. The market as a whole is extremely leveraged - which means that small events can have enormous impacts, and wider market implications. 

And finally, here are some more speculative premises. These concern what I believe is, and will be the catalyst, and the hope for crypto in the future, but they're not essential for the argument that the market correction is imminent. 

 

1. Naked short selling is an enormous problem facing the US financial markets. To understand why, it's important to understand the difference between short selling (locating and borrowing a share, selling it, and promising to buy it back later on the hopes of a lower price), and naked short selling (creating a synthetic share that was never issued by the original company and selling it). 
2. Naked short selling has long seen lax oversight by the regulatory agencies. Through a series of revolving doors and allowing the markets to run their own regulatory agencies, this enormously profitable business gets a blind eye from the regulators tasked with stopping it, because those same regulators are ultimately also the ones who profit from it when they move back into the private industry. 
3. Naked short selling is the financial equivalent of creating a counterfeit share, selling it for profit at the cost to the shareholders and company, and having 0 intention of paying it back. This tanks company value, and effectively steals value from actual shareholders. It has been used for decades to drive companies out of business. Occasionally, you get a company like Overstock that beats the odds and sees a short squeeze followed by a share price resurgence, but it frequently results in a company going out of business. 
4. Naked short selling can be hidden in a variety of ways. While people frequently turn to the short interest as a way to examine how shorted a company is, there are a variety of methods that market makers can employ using options chains to create FTD's (shares that are a failure to deliver because they never had them in the first place, and never intended to find) and then recycling those FTD's ad-infinitum until the targeted company goes bust.  
5. When Covid hit, several hedge funds, banks, and market makers decided which companies they were going to short into oblivion, and profit off of their demise. They picked companies that would in theory be particularly hard hit by a reduction in customers that were used to entering a physical location.  
6. For many companies, those efforts failed. The companies did not go out of business, and these Hedge funds and market makers find themselves in a position where they cannot close their positions, they are losing money every day. The two most well known companies in this position are AMC and GME. 
7. Shorting a company exposes the short position to infinite loss. 
8. There has never been a perfect storm of a short squeeze as GME. AMC may squeeze to a lesser extent - but it has no where near the amount of shorts that GME does. 
9. There are a variety of catalysts that can cause GME and AMC to squeeze. Contrary to common opinion, the surge in share price in January and February was due to what's called a gamma squeeze, not a short squeeze, and the shorts have not covered.   


Which brings us up to today. I believe that multiple hedge funds and market makers are in very deep on their short positions, and that they are fighting on a day by day basis at this point to stay solvent. I believe that if the US financial market is the overloaded and unstable Jenga tower, these companies are the live hand grenade placed on top of the tower, and have had the pin pulled.   


However, whether or not they're the catalyst is relatively unimportant in the overall picture - the markets are over leveraged on crazy high margin right now either way. There was a liquidity test last week, and the results were not published, but the markets have been...sketchy at best since then. Because of how over leveraged the market is, I believe that virtually any hedge fund that gets margin called is too big too fail, because it's walking on that much of a knifes edge. And when it comes down, it's going to take everything down with it, from the real estate market (both commercial and residential). I believe that speculative assets in tech and crypto are going to be particularly hard hit. The house of cards is staggering like a drunk man that just got hit in the head, and doesn't know that he's bleeding internally and about to die of an aneurysm.   


So why did Crypto across the board see such a huge (and similar across different currencies) dip followed by a massive rebound? Because as a largely unregulated asset, it's extremely ripe for pump and dumps. Hedge funds can use it to inflate their assets on paper and get access to margin.   


And I believe that yesterday they got margin called. GME has been sitting above what the speculated margin call price should be for a day or two now (although nobody is certain what the exact price is at the moment, the speculation is between 170-180) and their lenders were demanding better collateral than the crypto they had on their books. When you get margin called, you have some time to come up with the required collateral before it's considered a default and your broker starts liquidating your positions. I believe they met their margin requirements this morning, managed to hold off default for another day, and immediately started pumping crypto again. They simultaneously shorted GME down and dropped the price from $180 to $165, thus probably lowering their margin requirements as well.   


Again, I can't stress this enough: while I believe that GME and the hedge funds and market makers massive short position is involved, the argument that a bunch of hedge funds got margin called yesterday is not dependent on that - the market has been dipping the past few days, and it could simply be a matter of being over leveraged and seeing a few red days in the market that caused a margin call. All of the people all over the world that have been buying GME at unprecedented rates for the past 4 months could be totally wrong. But even if they are, this crypto dump still has the looks of a margin call. Both BTC and ETH have dropped over 50% from their ATH this morning before the rebound. The timing of hitting their low points 3 minutes before OCC-007 (which raises collateral requirements for the month) came into effect seems telling to me that somebody was really close to going under.   


And I believe that this is the first of many margin calls, and eventually, somebody is going to default, and the dominos will begin to fall, leading to a massive market correction (or collapse, depending on how you want to look at it) that leaves everybody hurting bad.   


What happens next, and how I personally plan to respond is more up in the air. The Fed can respond to this in a variety of ways. They can opt to fire up the printer and start devaluing our currency to try and buy our way out of debt with a worthless USD, or they can opt to embrace the pain and raise interest rates and create a few decades of pain and stagnation while we dig our way out of a deep depression through long term austerity. Whether or not I (and everybody else betting on the GME thesis) are right will also play a big role in what happens next. If we are correct, it's going to create what is essentially a black hole for liquidity in the markets, as money flows out of the hands of the wealthy and leaves big reliable blue chip companies, and moves into the hands of GME holders. If that's the case, money is going to be flowing into the hands of people who have a deep, deep distrust of the US financial system and the regulatory agencies, and I anticipate a massive boom in crypto's as people look for places to store their money outside of US financial market control. If my speculation is correct, we'll see bitcoin hit the teens (or maybe even single digits) before they begin to climb back up, and we'll eventually see surging and setting new ATH's in the near future afterwards, and a similar story for ETH. I'm less certain about the less well known coins - my assumption is that they will not see nearly as much of a rebound as BTC and ETH, but who knows.   


If the GME thesis is not correct, but the economy does crash and the fed Fed fires up the printer, I still anticipate a huge rebound in crypto - it is, afterall, still ripe for pump and dumps, and at the end of the day, it is in theory a pretty good place to store value in an inflation resistant location.   


If the Fed opts to raise interest rates and embrace deflation over at the opposite end of the spectrum though, than cash will be king and crypto will be utterly screwed for the next 5-10 years I'd bet. If hyper inflation is a great way of turning a Weimar Republic into a Nazi Germany, deflation and austerity are a great way of turning into Greece. Neither are great options though. Hopefully some smarter people can come up with something better.    


TLDR: If the market crashes, which is very likely, Crypto is set to take an enormous dip with it. Every hedge fund that's dipped its toes in is going to dump it like a hot potato, and if you thought it dipped fast this morning when it dropped over 20% in an hour, what comes next will make your head spin. But for now, they met their margin call and live to fight another day. Eventually though, somebody is going to trip and the economy is going down with them. And when that happens the Fed will be forced to embrace either inflation or deflation, and I expect Crypto to rebound if they choose inflation. Additionally, if the theory of GME turns out to be correct, there's going to be quite a few new millionaires with money burning a hole in their pocket to be spent, and they'll be looking for speculative inflation resistant assets that are not subject to corrupt US regulatory agencies. There's always the possibility that over the next few months, companies slowly manage to deleverage and increase their collateral without causing a market wide panic for the exits, and simultaneously the GME theory of everything is wrong, and the markets continue largely as they have been now.   


Whatever the case, I believe it's going to be a bumpy ride with more volatility in the near future, and I wish all of you the best. Good luck to everybody.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,23 years old. Serious debt,"Hey guys, I’ve looked to this sub for a while to make me feel better about my debt/figure out a plan. I am in a pretty confused part of my life and haven’t really known who to turn to for advice on this, as none of my friends are in this kind of situation. 

Debt:
Credit card-$730
Unsubsidized Gov’t Student Loan: $28,430
Sallie Mae Student Loan: $33,876
Car: $17,800 

$2k in savings 

I am still in my grace period for the student loans until August since I graduated in December. (BA in Criminal Justice &amp; Business Management) 

I just passed my 6-20 adjuster exam and plan on starting up as an independent claims adjuster in the next few weeks. I did restoration roofing for a while, so I somewhat knew the business already.

I am expecting a large personal injury settlement (around 150k) over the next year. 

My current plan with the settlement is to pay off the Sallie Mae loan, car payment, and any credit cards I have when I receive the money. I plan on paying off the federal loan over time in case of possible mass loan forgiveness.

I’m curious as to what you guys think of my plan, and would love some professional input if you have the time. Thanks guys!",finance

personalfinance,How to plan for an expected loss of employment?,"There is a very good chance that I am going to get fired from my job or I will be forced to quit it in the next 1-2 months. Without getting too much into the weeds about why, I am dealing with some severe burnout from working a job that is not suited to my strengths and it is severely impacting my performance. 

While I am in the process of getting upskilled to make a career change asap or possibly go back to grad school, I need to plan for this case of unemployment. 

I am a late 20's single guy with minimal federal student loans and no major debt and, besides 401k / IRA money, I have about 3 months living expenses saved up if I cut back on my standard of living some. I also have some HSA money saved for emergency medical expenses.

personalfinance,Open a Roth IRA or Increase 401k Contribution or Save More?,"Currently 22 with a steady job in accounting/finance. $60K salary and living with my parents (for now). Have $10K in checking and $15K in savings. Monthly expenses are low and I am considering opening a Roth IRA (most likely with Vanguard).

I currently contribute 4% Roth to my 401k and I get my company’s 4% match. About $50K in private student loans and $20K in federal student loans (deferred until Sept due to COVID). I consolidated my private student loans with SoFi to reduce the interest rate to about 4.5%. Monthly payment is about $650 on private loans with SoFi.

Ultimately, I have some extra cash laying around and need to know what is the best way to use it!

Main Questions:
1. Since my 401k is Roth, should I still open a Roth IRA? Is too much Roth a bad thing? I am expecting to be in a higher tax bracket when I am older which led me to Roth.
2. I am saving up for an engagement ring and rent for an apartment. Should I pay more than the minimum balance on student loans to pay it off faster or save more or invest more in Roth IRA?
3. Also, do I need to do anything with my 401k investments? Or can I just let them sit and ride it out?",finance
stocks,"Here is a Stock Market Recap for today Wednesday, May 19, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, May 19, 2021**

The stock market opened deep in the red but managed to climb throughout the session to pare much of the losses. For example, the Nasdaq (QQQ) opened 1.73% down but managed to close the day 0.12% up. Despite the market declining modestly the last three days, it is encouraging to see volatility decreasing this week  after the wild swings the market experienced in the last few weeks. As said before, I thought the initial sell-off after the April Consumer Price Index was released was overblown for several reasons and am encouraged by this week’s price action.  

Leadership in equity markets has see-sawed between cyclical and value stocks and technology stocks, as market participants weigh the prospects for a strong economic rebound as the US economy continues to reopen with the possibility that the pick-up in activity may generate a surge in inflation. After leading the market higher in April, in the last month, the Nasdaq is down 4.77% compared to 0.79% down in the S&amp;P 500. In my view, this dip could represent a great opportunity given earnings have been extremely strong and many companies have significantly raised guidance moving forward. 

The Federal Reserve released its April Meeting Minutes (basically a written record of what happened in the meeting), which said that “participants generally noted that the economy remained far from the Committee’s maximum-employment and price-stability goals” and reiterated, for like the millionth time, that they did not believe a near-term adjustment of monetary policy was needed. Much of the recent volatility in the market is due to investors afraid that a surge in inflation may cause the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy, so hopefully this commentary by the Fed can calm things down. [Read the entire meeting minutes here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20210428.pdf)

However, it is important to note, the minutes covered the meeting before the release of the April Jobs Report, which came in much weaker than expected (which bolsters the Fed’s argument that employment remains far from their goal) and the Consumer Price Index, which showed a greater-than-expected increase in consumer prices. That said, the recent reports are extremely unlikely to change the Fed’s view given Powell and other monetary officials have said they expect any inflation to be “transitory” and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports before adjustments to the current policy are considered.

As the US economy reopens, we are seeing a surge in consumer spending (we saw a 10.8% increase in spending in March), supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand, which of course, causes a rise in prices. As the economic reopening continues and supply in various consumer industries is able to catch up, inflation is expected to slow down. In a nutshell, this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures “transitory”. In an April 28 meeting, Jerome Powell said, “Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.” 

Moreover, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be “transitory” as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, “We want to see a string of months like that \[like in March\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, there’s a very large group of people who are not.” Finally, the April Job Report, which showed the economy gained only 266,000 jobs compared to the 1 million expected and marked a sharp deceleration in growth compared to March, bolsters Powell’s argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy. 

**Highlights**

* After declining in recent weeks, the sell-off in cryptocurrencies across the board intensified, with Bitcoin (BTC) falling below $40,000 after the People Bank of China (PBOC) doubled down on it’s stance and released a statement reiterating that digital tokens shouldn’t be used for transactions. The PBOC posted in their official WeChat account, “Virtual currencies should not and cannot be used in the market because they’re not real currencies”. It’s important to note the statement doesn’t have any new regulatory steps, according to Yu Lingqu, a vice director at the China Development Institute think-tank in Shenzhen. 
* Ford Motor (F) is expected to unveil an all-electric version of its bestselling F-150 pickup truck tonight
* The US dollar dipped on Tuesday for the fifth straight session, reaching its lowest level against a basket of currencies since late February on waning fears that inflation spikes could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner than anticipated, another great sign that inflationary fears are overblown. 
* Nvidia (NVDA) is extending its cryptocurrency mining limits to newly manufactured GeForce RTX 3080, RTX 3070, and RTX 3060 Ti graphics cards. After nerfing the hash rates of the RTX 3060 for its launch in February, Nvidia is now starting to label new cards with a “Lite Hash Rate” or “LHR '' identifier to let potential customers know the cards will be restricted for mining. NVDA offers a separate, specialized mining processor that has the best performance for mining but will not be able to handle graphics. 
* In a Ford factory in Michigan, President Biden promoted his $174 billion plan to promote and accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles across the United States and planned to roll-back vehicle emission standards. According to the fact sheet, Biden's plan ""proposes cost-sharing grants to support new high capacity battery facilities in the United States” and backs grants to fund the retooling of shuttered factories ""to build advanced vehicles and parts.""
* Michael Burry, the investor famous for calling the 2008 housing market bubble and portrayed by Christian Bale in the movie “The Big Short”, recently unveiled a huge bearish bet on Tesla. Scion Asset Management, Burry’s firm, said in a regulatory filing it had put options on 800,100 shares of Tesla, as of the end of Quarter 1, a value of $534 million. Details on the strike price of the puts, their value and whether they are part of a broader trade are not publicly available.
* Interestingly, Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) has sold nearly all of its Wells Fargo (WFC) stock, a position the company has held since 1989. In a regulatory filing on Monday, Berkshire said it owned just $26.4 million of shares of WFC as of March 31, down from around $32 billion in January 2018.

btc,BCH is no better than BTC. Buy silver.,"I believe that Roger Ver and BCH-advocates have a very good heart. But I want all of you to realise that you aren't accomplishing anything worthwhile by advocating for BCH. BTC as everybody here knows is a con, because if even 0.1% of the population tried to use it, even on the Lightning Network, it would break down and be unusable. That's the small-block-size problem. But you don't have the solution either. You can't possibly scale BCH into a world currency without ending up like BSV, where everything is completely centralized. Large block sizes fix nothing when you try to get serious about it. Both small and large block sizes eventually lead to centralization.

Consider also the fact that, when China and Russia dump the dollar, they will adopt gold, not any cryptocurrency, as money, and BCH (along with all other cryptos) will instantly dump to zero. (This is the opinion of Alasdair Macleod.)

Also consider the fact that, if Adam Back really is Satoshi (as I believe BarelySociable has conclusively proven from circumstantial evidence), he can rug you at any time by dumping his coins.

By the way, projects like Kinesis Money show that you can have a network of cryptocurrencies just as efficient as BCH while also being backed by fully-allocated gold and silver. And unlike BCH you don't need to worry about one single entity eventually controlling the hash when it comes to gold- or silver-backed cryptos. Because you can have multiple cryptos using multiple vaults in multiple countries which are all of equivalent value.

If you really want to change the system, buy silver. First because it is the real wealth, secondly because it breaks the 500:1 paper-to-physical short position of the banks, thirdly because silver can actually be used AS A CURRENCY (without eventually being completely centralized), fourthly because freeing its price exposes inflation and kills the fiat dollar, and therefore the NWO and the Fed (who use the fiat dollar as their instrument of evil). Buying cryptocurrencies simply makes a number on the screen go up.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Buy parents' home and let them live there (US Cali),"Hello Reddit,

Throwaway because personal details, but I've been pretty active on this sub since it taught me to budget in about 2012.

My parents own their home, purchased just before the housing bubble burst. They could afford it, right up until my mother got injured and became disabled. I paid the mortgage for years because federal disability takes forever, but once that came in (took 5 years) they were able to make most of the mortgage payment. I still pay about $400/month to help out.

I have siblings, but my parents intend to leave the entire house to me when they’re done with it. I’ve decided I want to buy the house from them and the current arrangement to continue: they live there and pay their current X amount, and I pay whatever remainder of the mortgage. 

\-Current Zillow estimate of value: $320k

\-Purchase price in 2005: $370k

\-Current mortgage owed: $260k @ 4%

\-I make $115k/year, very steady employment, and have been preapproved for the refin or the purchase with interest rate \~3%

\-I do not currently own a home, nor can I afford one in my area so it’s a long way off. 

I spoke with a local credit union and they gave me 2 options: buy the house at market value, or refinance the loan into my name and my parents sign off the deed. I want to go through with this, but first I wanted to ask PF if anyone has any advice on what to look for and what to be prepared for.

Topics of interest:

1. The mortgage payment in either case (buy or refi) will be about what it is now, which is also below market rate for rent in their area. Does that mean I can’t get tax breaks as if it is a rental?
2. If it can’t be considered a ‘rental,’ does their portion of the payment still become taxable income for me?
3. I’m aware of the 5 year ‘look back’ period if they need Medicare in the future. Is there anything else that can sneak up on me?
4. Is there a significant difference in taxes if I buy the house vs refi? For reference, they paid about $70k more than it is currently worth (yay bubble…. Then and now), but luckily owe about $50k less than it’s worth.

Other things to note: They do not need cash out, so buying isn’t required. They’re 100% on board with just refi-ing and signing it off to me. I also have 100% loyalty to keeping them from becoming homeless (meaning if I don’t buy the house, I will still pay the mortgage no matter what, and then at some point Medicare could result in it being taken, or my siblings can contest the will/trust or cause other headaches because that’s what family is for, or any number of other things out of my hands could take it and all of the money I’ve sunken into it). 

I hope that wasn’t too disjointed. If any more details would be useful, please let me know. Any advice or suggestions greatly appreciated.

Which one do I tackle first? I was thinking of the higher interest rate but I'm unsure. My current idea is to pay $600/week or $2400/mo on student loans alone. I'd still like to budget in my savings, necessities, and a very SMALL amount of personal desires. Any advice is appreciated!

stocks,Can anyone explain what Wall Street actually likes?,"Alright, I've been trading since February so I'm still very wet behind the ears. I've been trying to figure out exactly what Wall Street likes and dislikes and it's super confusing.

During the recovery, I learned that they hate higher interest rates. They also really hate inflation. They hate tech stocks when things they hate are happening (like inflation or interest rates). They hate high job numbers because economy is racing back, but also hate low job numbers because economy isn't racing back fast enough.

I understand most of that is connected, but what is the true catalyst of major selloffs in the tech industry? Fears of interest rate inceases? Is that their main fear and they're ready to sell at any potential hint at anything that could trigger rate increase?

Or is there something else they're scared of more than rates?

And is there an actual situation they like which encourages massive buying? Or is it just easier to short right now so hedge funds are pretending any little thing scares then but in reality the value of stocks are on the high side so they're riding them down before loading up and riding them back up?

This is so confusing. 

And can you also explain your tips on making low risk plays during market sell-offs? Like buying calls and hoping they land OTM?

solar,Ground mount solar install 16.8KW DC / 11.4KW AC,"Just completed the installation of my new ground mount solar PV today. Building inspection tomorrow and then waiting on utility for permission to operate.

System is located south of Minneapolis, MN and has 42 JinKo 420 watt panels in 3 strings of 14 panels each. Using Solar Edge optimizers and a Solar Edge 11.4KW inverter located at the panels, 250 ft A/C to house.  Racking is held down with 18 ground screws which are each 4 feet long.

I recorded the progress as time-lapse, took some photos, and a couple of drone flights to document the progress.
Worked with a vendor over winter for the design, had to convince my township that we should have building code for solar which took 2 months, and started install last week.  Time line was:  

- Tuesday - measure for wire and conduit.  
- Wednesday - trench for cable run (250 ft), mount new meter boxes &amp; disconnects.  
- Thursday - Layout racking install and start putting in the earth screws  
- Friday-Sunday - off days
- Monday - complete racking install, rack inverter, complete A/C side wiring.
- Tuesday - install the 42 panels, wire management.
- Wednesday - AM - install the wiring cover under the panels, reseed the lawn.
- Thursday - building inspector
- Unknown - Permission to operate from utility.

Edit for follow-up questions:


1. The wire gauge from house to panels is 3 AWG x 3 conductors + a smaller ground wire. Conduit was 1.5"" diameter.

2. The racking is APA Ready Rack for the solar panels with ground screws. You will also see Unistrut holding the inverter/shut-off.

3. The fabric is to prevent wild life from chewing on cables and humans from disconnecting powered connections.  Code in MN. Not sure of the brand as the crew brought it in an Amazon box each piece is about 8' x 50'. They used one piece and a partial to cover the back.  It is fastened with self taping screws and a washer at every vertical strut and to the panel ends.  The installer says ""not a specific brand, just something we get online. It is an outdoor, UV-rated mesh that is often used for privacy screening on fences, tennis courts.""  Added an image https://i.imgur.com/rh2QJvD.jpg

4. System is 69 ft long by 13 ft 2 in bottom to top.  Top is just over 9 ft off ground and bottom is 30 inches.

5. No tax credit from MN nor my utility. I pay 13 cents for power and they buy at 10 cents which is their generation cost. Nice that the feds extended the 26% tax credit.

6. Due to distance and slope, 30 ft down the hill, unlikely to remove snow in winter.

7. The racking looks crooked compared to the A/C equipment because the panels are running slightly down slope by 4 feet along length.

8. Had to get local code updated to allow residential solar which took a couple of months. Ground mount restricted to 3+ acre lots. Roof mount doesn't have a lot size requirement.  I'm the first residential ground mount in my city.

9. How much did it cost.  Upfront costs is $46,980 after FTC credit @ 26% is $34,765.  See https://imgur.com/gPHrv2Y for comparison of top three vendors.",energy

CryptoCurrency,"Here's some advice from someone that had $40,000 in debt in mining rigs when the 2017 crash happened.","In late 2016 my friend asked me if I wanted to help him setup some mining rigs. It seemed like a no brainer. Buy the rigs, have a 6 - 8 months ROI, live like kings, and if the market crashes he could sell all the GPUs at his PC/cell phone repair shop.

I have stupid good credit and qualifed for 2 credit cards with $20,000 limits each and 18 months of no APR. He buys all the rigs, put them on my cards, he pays me back as the crypto flows in, and once it's paid off I get a small percentage of the profits for being the bank.

You know the rest. Market crashes, we panic sell all the cards, they are basically worthless at the time because everyone is dumping their cards, and 2 years of transferring the credit card balance around to other cards with no APR promotions so we don't drown in interest.

If we would have stuck it out, kept mining, and HODL the amount we would have made makes me sick to my stomach. The moral of this story is you don't loose money till you give up all your assets. Whether that is mining rigs, or crypto you bought, just hold on tight because things will recover. Maybe not today, or tomorrow, or maybe this year but it will eventually recover.

Also, never invest more than you're willing to loose. This go around I've been mining with 4 cards and dumping $20 - $50 a month into shitcoins to see if they go anywhere. While I'm sad to see my portfolio get cut down, it's only money I was already willing to loose.

TL;DR: Stay chill and be smart.

Bitcoin,Capitulation is awesome :),"Markets are funny. I haven't been in bitcoin for long, but have gain much transferrable experience from other markets. The feeling over the last 24h was almost similar to watching oil crash in march/april 2020 and stocks crashing during COVID.

Guess what:

Oil front month contracts sold to negative in 2020 went all the way up to 65 bucks a barrel.

Equities got smashed and basically catapulted to new ATH.

I am fully aware of rising yields and equity volatility in recent weeks. But unless you have balls so big to say the fed is willing to start tapering and we're going through a 1930s style deflationary era for years to come, I can't see how this capitulation period is anything but a buy signal. And if we're going through 1930s style deflation, I can say btc crash will not be my only problem....

Also, I have 60k in loans from school, but I'll qualify for federal loan forgiveness of 20k/year so the plan is to have the loan repayment fully pay off the loans within 3 years while my wife and I focus on saving and investing from our salaries. My wife wants us to FI in 20 years.

After the loans are paid off, I'm planning to return to school for a doctorate of nursing practice DNP), with the end goal of working in the US Foreign Service. I've also looked at joining the Air Force either as active duty or Reserves and doing travel nursing.

Does anyone have any advice they would be willing to share? In our heads, becoming an NP will help increase our income, but we would prioritize having it paid off by loan prepayment options available.

cardano,My view on the future of Cardano,"I have been reviewing Cardano emerging blockchain technology and I have developed a hypothesis for future purpose that blockchain technology may potentially serve. 

It no longer makes sense for a company to make a public offering on a stock exchange in dollar value when a properly developed blockchain will have a decentralized governance features on an asset class that is naturally deflationary and can be used as leverage for DEFI 

Not only that but smart contracts and identity management (both features of ADA) will make it so that the public has better insight into the health of a company, this will create a market where strong business choices (employee pay for retention) will make 10x more sense than they do now where dollar based assets have to continually beat inflation in order to stay relevant for investment inflows

personalfinance,Not sure how taxes are currently being applied to my paycheck,"I just got my most recent paycheck today, and I decided to do some math to try and figure out the amount I'm losing to taxes. Here's some of the information from it:

* Gross Pay: $3,062.50
* Pre-Tax Deductions
   * 401K Contribution: $91.88 (3% of Gross)
   * Dental: $4.50
   * Medical: $50.00
   * Medical Reimbursement: $10.00
   * Vision: $3.00
* Taxes Withheld: $765.78
   * OASDI: $185.72
   * Medicare: $43.43
   * Federal Withholding: $377.13
   * State Tax Idaho: $154.00
   * WA State Supplemental Pension Tax: $5.50
* Post-Tax Deductions
   * Roth IRA Contribution: $91.88
   * Critical Care: $6.05

This sums up to $765.78 in terms of the taxes withheld. My year to date gross pay is 31,025.02. Unless my math is extremely wrong, what is being withheld on taxes is nearly 26% of my pay (after pre-tax deductions). Is this correct? I thought that the rate wouldn't go higher than 12% until I exceeded a certain amount of year to date earnings.",finance
personalfinance,Prioritize student loans or home down payment?,"My wife and I are both graduating law school this week (woo!). Total debt is $100k (all student loans) and base salary of $165k but potentially another $25k in bonuses. Assume no pay raises over time, even though that’ll likely happen. Student loan interest rates average 6%. All federal.

I’m firmly convinced that we should put a sizable amount toward retirement each month, but I’m torn on what configuration to throw at student loans or down payment on a house. Here are a few things I know:

1. We don’t want this $100k hanging around for ten years. The soonest I see us paying it off is about 3 years, but anything between 3 and 7 is kind of up for debate.

2. Housing is crazy and I know my wife really wants to get into one sooner than later. Part of me thinks scraping together 10-20% now should take priority.

3. I really want to get student loans down to a “If you get fired, any other attorney job could service these loans.” At $100k, that’s not exactly there yet. At $60k or so, I’d feel more comfortable. 

So currently I’m thinking throw $40k at student debt in the first year and a half to get it down to roughly $60k. After that, maybe $10-15k per year and throw the difference at a house down payment. I’d consistently put $1500-2k per month in retirement until we’re in a house, and then ramp up retirement to $4k+ per month.

Does this make sense? I apologize if I’m leaving out any crucial info. We’re living and working in a low COL city in the Midwest and our living expenses are $2500 per month (rent, food, utilities, insurances, etc.). Let me know if more context is necessary.

personalfinance,Looking for Australian specific advice,"I've seen a few threads like this before which seem to be targetted more towards the US, and apologies if this isn't for aussies, i'll delete if this is the wrong spot.

My mother is mid 60s and works a fairly physical job which I am concerned may begin to get too hard in another 5 years or so. She is on her own, has minimal retirement savings and rents by herself. I'm not sure exactly how much the pension is, but I don't think it's enough to pay rent, food, bills etc.

I've previously suggested to her that she starts saving the majority of her wage to help supplement the lack of super annuation, but I think a few years have passed since I originally mentioned this and I don't think she has. She's got some savings but is not in super hoarding mode.

I've previously looked into the ability to obtain access to housing commission here but it seems almost impossible. I also once looked into possibly getting her to buy an apartment and paying it off but given her age the banks are reluctant to provide a mortgage (I think it needs to be paid out by retirement age). I have considered doing this under my own name and having her rent pay the mortage, which would work at the moment with really low interest rates, but it could put some pressure on my family once interest rates go up. This is still an option I guess.

I guess I'm just looking for anyone who's had a similar scenario and what options there might be that I don't know about.",finance

algorand,What's the optimal frequency for compounding my ALGO rewards? (formula inside),"So I was wondering if doing a daily null transaction for compounding my rewards made sense, and what was the optimal frequency for a given amount of ALGO, since obviously if you have very little ALGO it makes sense to make your null transactions less frequently, and if you have a lot of ALGO it makes sense to make them more frequently.

I googled the Compound Interest Formula and used it to create my own formula for 1 year of compounding ALGO:

Compound Interest Rate = (coins * (1 + interest rate / CF)^ CF - coins - fee * CF) / coins * 100

Example:

Interest rate: 5% (0.05)

Compounding Frequency: Once per week (365 / 7 = 52.1429)

ALGO: 1000

Fee: 0.001

---

Compound Interest Rate = (1000 * (1 + 0.05 / 52.1429)^ 52.1429 - 1000 - 0.001 * 52.1429) / 1000 * 100

Compound Interest Rate = 5.12%

---

Using this I made this little table to save you time:

&gt; Optimal Compounding Frequency for 100 ALGO: once per month

&gt; Optimal Compounding Frequency for 1000 ALGO: once per week

&gt; Optimal Compounding Frequency for 10000 ALGO: once per week

&gt; Optimal Compounding Frequency for 25000 ALGO: once per day

Hope it helps!

Disclaimer: If you think I messed the math I'm all ears. I'm no mathematician. Also I'm not sure what's the exact interest rate for ALGO. I think it's 5% so I used that.",cryptocurrency

Bitcoin,Why you don't (and won't) see many applications built on blockchain,"All the hype about crypto and the sky high valuations are based on the idea that in the years to come we will start seeing lots of decentralized applications built on some of these networks. While I'm optimistic about the use of blockchain in a few domains, overall I think that applications built on blockchain won't ever be as common as one may think, here is why:

1 - Cost. Many applications greatly benefit from economies of scale and centralization, which allows them to offer very low prices to users. Let's look at the crypto the ""Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)"" for example. They want to allow users to build applications directly on the internet instead of on the cloud using AWS, Google Cloud, etc. All the devices in the IC network would process the transactions and run any calculations. Companies like Google have specialized hardware and many engineers working hard to optimize all the traffic in their servers. Sometimes the servers will be under water to save cooling energy. There's no way a network of smaller servers, phones, or computers is going to be more cost-efficient than that.
How about building a decentralized bank on ethereum, where anyone can lend money to anyone at any interest rate? Big banks have a lot of data that they use to train models and optimize the interest they put on any loan, so they can offer competitive rates. As an individial I can't compete against that because I don't have nearly as much data or experience to build such models. Same happens with many other applications where collecting data in a centralized manner allows the entity to offer a cheaper and better service.
What about a social network built on blockchain? Would each message be a transaction? Even if each transaction cost 1 cent, it would add up quickly. Cryptos like Nano have no transactions fees, but they assume that the nodes will work without being rewarded economically, which is not realistic.

2 - Liability. In a decentralized system I'll likely be responsible for securing my private keys. If they get lost of stolen, my data and assets will be compromised and that's a high risk. But what if someone else has my data and/or assets (i.e. a bank, a broker, etc.). If they lose them I can sue them and be compensated. In most cases I won't even need to sue them, they (or their insurance company) will take the losses on my behalf and I'll be fine.
Surely enough I can give my private keys to someone else to store them, but then I'll be trusting them with all my data. What if the government requests my private keys to the entity that stores them?

3 - Privacy. In most blockchain networks the transactions are public. Let's imagine again a social network built on blockchain. Everyone could see who you messaged to and when you did it. Your account number is the only thing that keeps you anonymous, so it wouldn't be too hard for someone to find out who you are if they really want to. And the content of your messages would be safe as long as the privaye keys of the contacts receiving your messages remain safe... Are you going to rely on that? I'm not saying centralized networks are great at protecting your privacy either, but blockchain is far from being perfect in that sense.

4 - Democratization. The same way blockchain can be used to democratize, it can be used for quite the opposite... Imagine that every digital asset that has a copyright is turned into an NFT. Anyone could know whether that video or song that you have was acquired as part of a legal blockchain transaction. If it doesn't show in the blockchain, they can assume you ilegallly acquired such copy of intelectual property and prosecute you.

5 - Trustless. In some applications like sending money, blockchain works well because the smart contracts dictate who sends what to who. In that case, the contracts don't contain any real world information, but the blockchain contains information about the blockchain itself. If you see a validated transaction, you know it's real. And if it was fake, it does no longer matter, the network now dictates that it is real for all practical purposes (because it was validated).
How about many other real world applications though? Using the blockchain to create and track birth certificates doesn't guarantee that the certificates will be right to begin with. You still need to trust whoever is making that certificate. The only thing the blockchain guarantees is that nobody editted the certificate once it was created. But what if you do need to edit the certificate because it was wrong initially?
How about buying/selling a house? Sure, there could be a private key associated to the house that guarantees that if there's a transaction about your house it was because you allowed it to happen. But would you trust your house with your private key? If your key is stolen anyone could use it to say you donated your house to them and now that's on the blockchain and everyone assumes the transaction was legit. I'd rather sell my house by signing a contract in front of a notary who checks who we are and that the transaction is consentual.",cryptocurrency

If everyone holds their bitcoin, then there is no market which devalues it into oblivion. Is it logical to think the market is going to scramble over bitcoin chicken feed when it could just create a new crypto currency instead?

If bitcoin was going to increase (as a certain celeb-de-jour says, ""forever"" - Michael Saylor), then as a currency it wouldn't work. People would buy a bulk of bitcoin/sats and not purchase an item until the currency goes up enough for them, perhaps not even buying the item at all. Vendors would continually have to monitor and lower their prices and with wild crashes no vendor would be prepared to do this. Even with dynamic pricing where the buyer has to scan a barcode to find out the current btc price it would require a significant change to store commerce.Yes, stores. Not everything can be purchased online.

tl;dr; by building bitcoin up as an investment increases the price which benefits the whales the most and these are creating the most positive noise about bitcoin. They don't care about you.

CryptoCurrency,"US futures inch lower for fourth day as investors digest Fed minutes, while bitcoin rebounds after crypto crash","* **""US futures inched lower for a fourth day on Thursday, after stocks slipped a day earlier.**
* **Investors are concerned that growth and inflation may force the Fed to cut back its support.**
* **Bitcoin rebounded somewhat after plunging as much as 30% on Wednesday in wild trading.**

US stock index futures inched lower for a fourth day on Thursday after equities fell in the previous session amid concerns the Federal Reserve might cut back on support for the economy sooner than expected and as cryptocurrency markets crashed.

**Bitcoin** rebounded somewhat after falling as much as 30% on Wednesday in the wake of Tesla's U-turn on payments and a decision by China to crack down on the token's use.

**S&amp;P 500** futures slipped 0.15% Thursday after the index fell for the third consecutive day on Wednesday. **Dow Jones futures** were down 0.22% but **Nasdaq 100** futures were up 0.05%.

European stocks rebounded from sharp falls on Wednesday, when fresh concerns about the economic recovery and the actions of central banks came to the fore. The continent-wide **Stoxx 600** was 0.5% higher.

In Asia, China's **CSI 300** closed 0.27% higher overnight, while Japan's **Nikkei 225** eked out a 0.19% increase.

Markets had a rocky day on Wednesday, with US stocks falling sharply before rebounding to **close only slightly lower**.

The release of the minutes from the Fed's last interest rate meeting unnerved investors. A single line showed the central bank had discussed the possibility of eventually starting to **talk about cutting back on bond purchases** as growth and inflation pick up.

""A number of participants suggested that if the economy continued to make rapid progress toward the committee's goals, it might be appropriate at some point in upcoming meetings to begin discussing a plan for adjusting the pace of asset purchases,"" the minutes said.

US bond yields, which move inversely to prices, jumped as investors digested the minutes. The yield on the key **10-year US Treasury note** rose as high as 1.692%, after starting the week at around 1.63%. Yet it slipped back to 1.661% on Thursday.

Analysts were not entirely sure how to interpret the Fed minutes, causing gyrations in stocks. Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at trading platform Oanda, said the minutes ""restored a sense of order"" by confirming that the Fed remained committed to its ultra-loose monetary policy for the foreseeable future.

Yet Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank said they showed Fed policymakers ""have indeed talked about talking about tapering.""

Many investors are highly concerned that rising inflation will erode the value of their portfolios. They are equally as concerned that it will force the Fed and other central banks to reduce their support for the economy, weighing on stocks and growth.

In a sign that investors are becoming wary of high asset prices, bitcoin **plunged as much as 30%** to $30,000 on Wednesday following a breakneck rally in the first months of 2021 that took the price near $65,000 in April.

The digital asset rebounded later in the day and continued to claw its way higher on Thursday, rising 4.2% to $39,949.

Bitcoin's rapid multi-day slide was triggered by Elon Musk saying Tesla would no longer accept it as payment for cars due to its **""insane"" energy use**. But the catalyst for Wednesday's crash was a move by Chinese regulators to step up their pressure on the token's use.

Analysts said the crypto crash made itself felt across the wider market. ""Typically, moves in the crypto arena are rather isolated,"" Michael Brown, senior market analyst at Caxton FX, said. ""Yesterday, though, was different, with the sell-off in the crypto arena sparking some notable risk aversion elsewhere.""

Brown added: ""This ripple effect seems to be a strong illustration of how large crypto markets have become; the correlation between these assets is, at least intraday, fairly clear to see.""

Oil prices also tumbled on Wednesday as investor confidence fell. But **Brent crude** had steadied on Thursday and rose 0.11% to $66.72 a barrel, while **WTI crude** climbed 0.32% to $63.53 a barrel.""

cybersecurity,"An end to the ""NIGHTMARISH FIRST JOB"" trilogy. (EXPLOSIVE ending).","Greetings /r/cybersecurity - I bring you a finale to the highly acclaimed ""NIGHTMARISH FIRST JOB"" saga. We left off with me posting about the gruesome conditions of the company I was working for (harassment, abuse, batshit CEO, theft etc). The original post is below for anyone who'd like to read it.

*After posting my OP, and my follow up post a couple weeks ago, things quickly took a turn for the worst.*

With me on the verge of quitting the heat got turned up to 11 when one of our biggest clients said they wanted to leave us. The SOC had missed an alert 13 times for a breach at their company because it popped during the night when nobody was in. This was a $70000 client so CEO was NOT happy, and took it out on the analysts.

The client arranged a meeting to ask WTF the SOC was doing, and accused us of being understaffed and not having any tuning done. He was right on the money, but our CEO completely lied to his face and said we had SEVEN analysts and that we covered 24/7 - when in reality we had only FOUR analysts and only covered 8-6pm. Everyone in the SOC felt ashamed for what the CEO did but we were powerless. 

I started getting more and more passive aggressive DMs from the CEO.
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/420016757043101696/844826240452001792/aaaaa1.png

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/420016757043101696/843884918924640296/ss1.png

THEN, after I volunteered to run the ENTIRE SOC on the weekends (only one in entire building) it was revealed that the CEO was watching me through the cameras 24/7 while I was alone. This was done through an experiment I conducted. I would do odd things, like limp-walk through the halls in front of cameras and wait for the CEO to comment on it later on. It turned out he did this to EVERYONE, even on Sundays at 9pm! We checked our entire SOC for bugs because we were legit scared he was spying on us.

Finally, after the passive aggressive DMs, and one of my co-workers having a legitimate mental breakdown in the SOC because of what the CEO said to her (supervisor had to HUG HER to get her to calm down), I said ENOUGH and placed my two-week notice on CEO's desk (he was already gone) and went home.

The next morning, I knew I was going to be sent home that day so I said my goodbyes to everyone, got people's numbers to stay in touch ETC. I got a DM from my boss that said ""Come into my office."" I stood up, gave a salute to the SOC and bowed. 

As I walked towards the CEO's office, people were solemn. They knew what was about to happen.

As I walked into the CEO's office, his wife and him were both standing there. 

The CEO looked me in the eyes and said ""I've NEVER seen an employee RUIN a company as much as you have. NEVER."" (This company has grown OVER 200% since I started here.) He held up my resignation letter and said ""See this? I don't give a F-K about this - you're FIRED! Give me your badge and get the hell out NOW."" I didn't even get to grab my few personal items from the SOC as he walked me out. 

*As I was walking out, his wife the HR MANAGER looked at me and said ""F-Tard!"" I replied ""That wasn't very nice."" So she yelled ""I'LL CALL THE COPS ON YOU, DON'T THINK I WON'T!""*

The CEO met back up with me in the exterior and said ""Do not put [company] on your resume. You're fired."" and slammed the door.

You might think I'm full of shit, but luckily I *recorded it* :) https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/420016757043101696/845039646702043146/GettingFired.wav

I feel mixed emotions. I'm glad I'm out of that environment but at the same time I'm disappointed that my first real job turned out this way. I still have yet to find a replacement job as all the leads (including ones kind redditors sent my way) ended up with me being ghosted.",technology

I saw the chart had a 2016 date stamp and wondered if anything or any theory in the personal finance world has evolved in that time that might be a trigger for a flowchart update.

Interest rates (like High/Med interest rate cutoffs, or types of accounts to use for saving)? New vehicles?

It still looks solid in general, just wanted to make sure I'm not missing anything. Thanks!",finance
CryptoCurrency,Explanation of recent crypto crash from institutional POV,"Hi all, hope you doing well after the recent bloodbath and bought the dip. I consider myself well educated in stock market and starting to get comfortable with the crypto, I focus my investment strategies on macrotrends and tracking where money goes, how much in terms of volume, how do the options market plays, etc, so hear me out on this and do you own DD. 

TLDR: crypto markets are heavily manipulated by big money. Crypto crash was a result of coordinated selling from the institutional ""investors"" who week ago flipped their bets into bearish positions (bought plenty of puts). This is likely to expand into stocks market and create more volatility in both crypto and equities markets. 

I have this paranoia that all the markets we play in are heavily manipulated by big money. They do have resources to pump the price, they have the volume. They can start buying doge @ 0,05$, create momentum, and next thing you see are the bots spamming buy doge on every corner of social media we live in today. They can mass sell the doge @ 0,7$ with a huge volume, making not enough buyers (or bidders) to buy it, so the market price crashes until the next and next bid. This is EASY to do with crypto - there are no regulations, no one have to disclose their holdings in their 13F, market caps are generally lower, therefore the medium for manipulation is perfect.

Another thing is that institutional ""investors"" have access to the financial derivatives (futures, options, etc) to which regular me and you dont. About a week ago, as BTC was bouncing 50-60K range there was a huge increase in bearish option activity in crypto markets in a matter of days (they just bought tons of puts, flipping their bets to bearish action). What happens? Hedgies start to sell crypto assets in a bursts of high volume at the top, causing sudden downside. Additionally there is no buying pressure anymore from institutional side as well. In fact this is all done by machines and computers. This creates some volatility, and the selling volumes just kept increasing throughout the days, bringing the price down. Any sudden increases in selling volume just exacerbates that and boom, you have a downfall mainly created by hedgies selling all their cryptoassets, crashing the price (not enough bidders because everyone are like ok I am gonna wait till it drops more), and they do have their puts printing tendies for them. All of this thing is automated, can be done in split seconds with billions of $$$'s. 

About 500B of crypto market cap was wiped in a matter of hours. Obviously, overleveraged crypto system added on top of this, my best guess mass iquidations caused this dump 38k --&gt; 30k, but it was not without the catalyst of hedgies coordinated selling. Some of you paper handers contributed as well, but most likely less impactfully than you might think. 

At the time of this writing institutional funds are sitting on 3,5T in cash on hand, a 0,5T increase over the last week. This is highest it has been since the pandemic started. I do think that this will move to equities markets, as there the open interest of puts on indices (QQQ, SPY) are at its highest as well. Volatility is kept artifically low by the machines (look at vix, there were no dips &lt;20 in VIX from the start of pandemic to the february 2021, and now we get regularly 17-18 in VIX) - this is best moment to buy puts because they are cheap at that moment, hedgies exploit that, retail in general tend to not short markets). 

I do expect a wider market pullback in the equities market, especially after the yesterdays Fed minutes release (which were covered by mainstream media as yeah everything is good, nothing to worry about - what a bs, the system is so rigged). This will be done by hedgies coordinating their selling (it was the same scenario in February, a highest coordinated selling in years in terms of volume &amp; amount of shares sold, out of blue). Given the open interest of puts on indices, recent cash out from crypto markets to raise the cash (I bet they opened a new positions again on crypto tho), and all the FUD regarding inflation spread around expect  higher volatility downwards in both crypto markets and equities markets. What to do? Buy the dip and hold, this is best opportunity longer term to establish profitable trades as there is a fixed amount of coins/crypto available. The less there are available to trade the more price goes up when hedgies go on next pump and dump. And holders will benefit from this the most because the holding creates the price action upwards and stability with support levels. Another scenario what happens to crypto during equities sell off is that it in fact pushes upwards. This would happen if hedgies suddenly start to plow money into crypto again as stocks are selling off, pumping the price and creating a ""doubt"" of what to do - buy the crypto that is going up by selling stocks, or just buy the stocks at the dips instead of more speculative crypto? Both scenarios ensure that institutions will buy the dip with all that cash and after this fud with inflation evaporates we will have a more sustained bullrun.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,"Dogecoin: Who Buys It, Why It Will Fail, and Why It Bothers Me","Woof. Okay. I’ve had enough. So I’ve decided to finally put this down into an original post. 

**I’m going to tell you (A) The people who buy Dogecoin, (B) Why it will fail, and (C) Why it bothers me.**

**(A) The people who buy Dogecoin**

  **A1) The crypto n00b/amateur.** These people were not involved in the last bull market, have no idea how many Dogecoins there are, don’t know how the Dogecoin network is “secured”, think BTC is too expensive, want to get rich quick and think they are getting in early. Most heard about it from a friend who put $100 in and made a few thousand. Some actually believe Doge is the new BTC (lol, ouch). They will ride Dogecoin down in the bear market and get REKT as fuck.

   **A2) The day trader.** These people think they can consistently beat the base rate of simply HODLing BTC and paying capital gains taxes on each trade. Many probably cheat on taxes. Most don’t make much $. They don’t care about any of the technology although some may understand peripherally. They will attempt to buy low and 3-5x their profits and then GTFO. They will never ride their coins down all the way in a crash.

   **A3) The OG doge people.** Many of these people probably have large stashes of non-joke coins like BTC, ETH, etc. A few of them have massive %s of all the Dogecoins in existence. They will slowly dump their bags on the above classes and put it into USD or BTC so they won’t lose their paper millions/billions in the inevitable crash.


**(B) Why Dogecoin will “fail” and crash**

   **B1) The network is incredibly vulnerable to attack and nowhere near a stable store of value because of it.** The hash rate backing it is pathetically small and there is little to no development supporting it…
        **See EDIT2 at end 😇. Apparently it’s not so vulnerable because it’s tied to Litecoin mining which is secure**

   **B2) There is no development on this network.** Fact. Conversely, there is immense amounts of development happening in other projects; development which solves real problems, enhances decentralization, secures billions of real dollars of value, etc
    **edit: apparently there is a small amount of dev now happening. After several years dormant...**

   **B3) It has gone up so fast, people have such huge paper gains that sooner or later they will cash them out**

   **B4) There are 120 BILLION coins, and 14 million new ones per day.** That’s about 4% inflation guaranteed for a decade or two. This type of inflation may be fine for fed coins and government fiat but why the fuck would anyone want it for a future store of value or currency? LOL much no thank you.
    **edit: 4% and slightly decreasing over time**

   **B5) Institutions will never buy this for reasons B1-4 above (and many more).** You cannot sustain market caps in the hundreds of billions of dollars without institutions.


**(C) Why it bothers me**

   **C1) People who don’t know better will get rekt and turned off cRyPto.** Then maybe they’d support fed coin when it comes out and might even support a ban on Bitcoin (should that ever become politically feasible). They’ll miss the true opportunity that is here and allow rich people and institutions to have more of the pie.

   **C2) Nobody crypto-competent would buy and hold Doge, yet people like the Winklevoss twins and other big exchanges are shilling doge coin listings to grab a slice of the trading fees.** They are peddling trash they would never hold themselves to make a quick buck. Sound familiar? Just like today’s big banking system most everyone on here detests.

   **C3) It’s so lazy. It’s obviously not the next Bitcoin.** Do a little research and you’ll know it’s a joke. *It is a fork of a fork OF A FORK of Bitcoin*. The real deal is sitting there in plain sight, but…

   **C4) Unit bias is so real, WOW.** Bitcoin is perceived as too expensive. It’s really sad how human brains fall victim to this extremely well known and obviously-occurring-right-now bias.

   **C5) This may cause a regulatory backlash on legitimate projects.** Puke. The last thing we need is excessive gov regulation around this market. But when misinformed lazy people lose significant amounts in a joke meme project like Dogecoin, you better believe there will be calls to step in.

   **C6) Elon is a narcissistic deuchebag.** Do you really want a narcissistic billionaire in charge of the future of money? No. I want nobody in charge. I want a leaderless, headless, consensus driven decentralized network instead. 

If you have Dogecoin and read this far, bravo, I’m impressed.

**If you are a supporter of real blockchain projects (perhaps aligning with beautiful philosophical goals) and want to help ensure they succeed and aren’t stopped by the dark forces that be, then it’s incumbent on you too to help this revolution succeed. That means stopping scammers and combatting false narratives.**

Rant over. I wish everyone a great bull market part two after this intermission. Have fun staying rich/poor. 

Cheers y’all! 🍻 🖤 


PS: In anticipation of the incoming brain-dead-level attack comments... **I’m not mad about your paper gains bro.** 👹

WOW


**EDIT1: this direct message is why I post this:
“Heya wanted to say thanks for that enlightening post
 I'm new into crypto and love when I see honest and informative posts. You don't know who and what to believe anymore.”**

**EDIT2: apparently litecoin mining (which doge is piggybacked on) is called Scrypt and it is much harder to 51% attack than I thought. I’ll look into it more.**

**EDIT3: I want all of crypto to succeed and I want everyone to win. If doge helps people get into crypto then great. Then maybe they’ll learn more about other projects that are actually doing things.**

**I wish everyone the best just be responsible and stop thinking me pointing out obvious flaws with your pet project are me being toxic lol... it’s sharing pretty much undeniable information; sorry.**",cryptocurrency

algorand,ALGO will increase in value regardless of Bitcoin,"Yesterday’s crypto dip was scary to some, but even now we’re starting to see a bit of a bounce. I came across a post from r/CryptoCurrency that highlights the possibility of BTC hitting $100k. Link below:

https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ngz0ji/more_than_1_million_addresses_bought_bitcoin/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf

It mentioned that around 1mil different addresses bought BTC yesterday, outnumbering the number of addresses that fully liquidated. This screams good news for BTC. 

At the same time, many people don’t know that most if not all altcoins are valued and traded on exchanges using BTC satoshi, explaining why whenever BTC drops, the market drops (which is troubling to me, but that’s my honest opinion). So as BTC makes its recovery and hopeful road to 100k, altcoins can only rise with it. 

On the other side of that, there is speculation that Algorand may be a candidate for CBDC use. Most of us know this because of the CBDC research the Boston Federal Reserve Bank has been tasking to MIT. ALGO, being an energy efficient non-profit crypto and blockchain, makes it a suitable candidate to allow for construction of a CBDC system. Don’t forget the friendship between Silvio Micali and the chairman of the SEC. ALGO integration into a CBDC would also substantially increase value.

(This is my first “DD” post and wasn’t able to get any of the important links to support, but I do recommend doing your own DD so that you can see for yourself. If anything, I will try to update the post with links)

altcoin,Holders did not falter during crypto dump. Here to stay. Certik on the way. RavenX - This will be huge,"I have a disclaimer: This is not financial advice. Always DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH before investing in ANY project.  I am a moderator for $RX's subreddit. However, this does not change my opinion on $RX. As I said before - this is not financial advice.  

Secondly - I am sorry to those who lost in OrcaX (RavenX fork) these past few days. I have also been in projects that got abandoned, it does not feel good. Rest assured, RavenX is here to stay, if you are still interested in a similar project. 


RavenX is the first automatic donation token. Automatic as in NO HUMAN INTERVENTION IS NEEDED to move donation funds around - there is no trust needed. It automatically donates 2% of each transaction to the Binance Charity Wallet. 

Over 1630 BNB in a month have been donated! 50% is going to Binance Lunch for Children and 50% to Crypto vs Covid. You can track progress on their website. 

This is literally a printer for charity! Sitting at a 2.5 million market cap, it has accomplished more than tokens with 50x the mcap. 

RavenX will donate forever, as long as trading volume exists. 

$RX is just over a month old, and has had organic, steady growth. 19k holders. ATH market cap was around $20 million. Sitting at $2.5 million. 

Taxes - 6% taxes are taken off each transaction - 2% is burned, 2% is redistributed to the holders, and 2% is donated to the Binance Charity Wallet. These charity donations have been verified by Binance Charities. You can see for yourself on the blockchain. 

Around 420 million $RX tokens are left in supply (around 80 million burned).

As volume continues to rise, donations and burning go up too!!!!! We may see a point where $RX donates $1 million every day!!!!

This can literally change the world. 

To buy - use either the RavenDex on their website (recommended) or Pancake v1.  Also $RX is listed on the Whitebit exchange. 

Buy and sell NFT's on their marketplace! (Also on website)

As the title says. This will be huge. 

RavenX will stand above all the Safe/Dogecopies as a world changing token!

This is the best buy in crypto right now. 

A personal thank you from Binance Charities!: https://mobile.twitter.com/BinanceBCF/status/1395187107467993092

CryptoCurrency,How do I know people aren’t panic selling to get out of crypto permanently? Stablecoins,"I’ll genuinely start to worry that crypto is dead or dying if during the big dips volume doesn’t go into stablecoins. 

Why? Well, if people are panicking and getting out of crypto for good, why are they cashing out into stablecoins instead of fiat? I don’t know about you, but I don’t use USDC or USDT for bills and I know if I was 100% out of crypto the money would be going into my bank account again.

For example: USDT’s volume more than doubled last week from roughly $137 billion at it’s lowest volume in the last 7 days and the volume peaked yesterday at $296 billion

If you’re new, you may be asking why they’re doing this. The reason is simple: interest.

People sell their crypto into a stablecoin because it’s stable and never is going to fluctuate wildly. They’ll then buy back into their crypto when they think the bottom is. If they believe in crypto they’ll want back in and why would you cash out into fiat with a bank where you’re getting crappy interest rates? You can get 6% interest by having your money in USDT, for example. So they simply cash out into a stablecoin and let it accrue interest before they get back in at a lower price. It’s also a pain to cash out into your bank and then back into the exchange and such. 

My point is, if people are jumping out of crypto for good, why are they putting the money in stablecoins instead of putting it all back into fiat and never touching any crypto again? Because they aren’t planning on jumping out",cryptocurrency
investing,"Guggenheim: Inflation Is Spiking, But You Only Reopen the Economy Once","https://www.guggenheimpartners.com/perspectives/macroeconomic-research/inflation-spiking-but-you-only-reopen-economy-once

&gt;Core CPI jumped to 3.0 percent year-over-year in April, the fastest pace since 1996. While the base effect from low readings in April 2020 was widely expected by markets, the monthly pace of inflation also rose notably. Core CPI increased 0.92 percent from March to April, the largest monthly gain since 1981.

&gt;The market seems to think this may be the start of an enduring trend of higher inflation, given record fiscal stimulus, ultra-easy Federal Reserve (Fed) accommodation, and ongoing supply bottlenecks. But a closer look at the data suggests that this spike in prices is a one-time adjustment as the economy reopens.

&gt;Spooked bond investors pulled forward Fed rate hike expectations after the CPI release, despite the Fed repeatedly emphasizing that they view this reopening-induced rise in prices as transitory. Investors should believe the Fed when they say they will look through this temporary inflation noise and fade the bond selloff.

&gt;The month-to-month gains in the core CPI were largely driven by a few small categories related to economic reopening and temporary pandemic-induced shortages. 54 of the 92 basis point increase came from used cars, rental cars, airfares, and hotels, despite these categories having a weight of just 5 percent in the core CPI basket. The contribution was so large because the monthly price increases were so huge (e.g. 10 percent gain in used car prices). These increases are unlikely to be sustained beyond the next few months, especially once prices in depressed categories recover back to the pre-COVID trend.

&gt;To the Fed, what matters is the trend in the larger, more durable inflation categories that influence the longer-term inflation outlook. In those categories, sequential inflation was much more muted: rents (including owners’ equivalent rent) and healthcare services contributed just 8 basis points to the monthly gain, despite making up 49 percent of the core CPI index. The Fed is more focused on the chart below than the chart above—and the bond market should be too.

Bitcoin,Newbies. How longtimers store their stuff.,"Newbies. How longtimers store their stuff.

this has worked since the first days of bitcoin.

print lots of paperwallets for free.

https://www.bitaddress.org/

spread coins among them. put them in separate safe places. make copies.

All the wallets you want are free. you can subdivide your stuff so the amount son each one are reasonable and you don’t cash one in that has a ton on it at once. you can sell your paper wallet to someone else with no record of the exchange on th eblockchain (not necessarily legal where you may be so dont break the law)  not dependent on anyone or anything. cant forget passwords. no hardware wallet vendor has your address in a database that will get leaked to every criminal in the world.  If you die your relatives can actually access your bitcoins. If you become brain damaged you can access your bitcoins. If you just forget you bought some and 10 years later find that piece of paper you will be able to access your bitcoins. you can engrave them in steel. mark them on stone. bury one in the back yard so even a raging forest fire cant get them. put the number on a dog collar (not recommended) .take a polaroid photo of it so the camera is not electronic or connected to the internet in anyway. stick one up your ZAS in a plastic container. hide one under your tuopee. hide one under the lining of an old shoe.  none of that is true with ""safer"" methods of storage where people lose all their coins all the time because they forget some pass word or something happens to their expensive electronic gadget that because of the expense has all their coins on one device.

if that doesn’t prove the long term respectability and usefulness of that website and the paperwallets to the bitcoin community I dont know what would. It was the place people were recommended to go by r/bitcoin until hardware wallet salespeople started to dominate the subreddit and spread FUD about paper wallets.
more proof it has been around forever

https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/search/?q=bitaddress&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=top

excerpt from one post from seven years ago on this very subreddit  in that last search

https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1pxy4w/basic_bitcoin_security_guide/

""Cold storage

Sometimes you want to store your bitcoins for a long time in a safe place. This is called “cold storage”. There are a few ways one can do this.

First of all, paper wallets. They are nice for giving people small bitcoin gifts, but also for long-term storage if properly used. What you want to do is generate and print them offline. You can save the linked page https://www.bitaddress.org/ for example and run that offline. If you are really paranoid, you can put it on read-only media and access that from a different computer. For really long term storage, use archival-grade paper.

Another approach to take is using a separate computer for storing your money that is offline 99+% of the time. You could set one up easily by buying an old laptop, reformatting it, installing Linux and a Bitcoin client. Generate an address on that machine and send money to it from your main wallet. Depending on how paranoid you are you can connect that computer to the Internet afterwards to synchronize data with the Bitcoin Network and then turn it off and put it away somewhere safe until it’s needed.""

I will say one thing though.

if you send coins to a paper wallet never ever let any phone or camera with any bitcoin app see that wallet. donit even let any camera get close. most new apps take all bitcoins from any paper wallet without telling you thinking they are doing you a favor and suddenly you only have the password for the phone app and the paper wallet key is useless. I personally think that is terrible practice but that is what many big android and ios bitcoin apps do now. so if you then deleted the app on your phone or lost it then all your backup copies of that particular wallet would be empty and useless.

like I said spread out your stuff in small amounts on different paper wallets and store them in different places so you cant ever lose everything at once.

before doing any transfer always practice with a tiny amount and make sure it goes through and appears where you want it to. never do any transfer in panic or haste. that is how millions and millions of coins have been sent to the bitcoin blackhole with no chance of recovery.
----------------------------------------------------
edit: this is the part where the people who want to sell you expensive hardware wallets tell you the founders who invented this paper wallet system along with Bitcoin itself were wrong.

stories of how people lose all their bitcoins..never one who had multiple paper wallets in different place with a portion of all their coins in each but plenty of people losing coins with hardware wallets.

personalfinance,Help creating an asset allocation plan with 90k/year salary.,"Hi all.  I would like some advice on how to invest my cash. With my main job and a side gig, I make about 90,000 a year. I don't have any kids or a mortgage, so after my monthly expenses of 2,500-3,000 (which includes 15% of salary for retirement), I have \~2,500 leftover each month. I already have 8k saved up in my emergency fund, and I would like to know where to invest the remaining amount. I've researched different types of investments/read all the articles, but I still feel quite lost, and could use some help. I know it's about time in the market and not timing the market, but I'm wanting to create a diversified asset allocation plan that is more conservative right now, especially with the potential inflation that is looming.

The only debt I have is my car loan, which is about $6,000. The interest rate is 2.5%, and the payment is already included in my monthly expenses. I plan to drive the car for the next 3-5 years.

I have no big purchases coming up anytime soon.

Note: I would love to buy a house, but the housing prices are currently insane for my specific area. Most (crappy) starter homes are selling for 400-500k. I'm planning on saving up for a hypothetical down payment, but I don't see myself buying anything for the next couple of years.

The problem is, is that if I decide to pay the tax on the stocks now, I'd (assumably) have to pay that 37% (\~$17k) in federal taxes come next tax season, which I don't currently have, and re-budgeting doesn't allow for me to come close to paying that off by that time. My worry, however, is that if I don't file the 83(b) now (within 30 days of the purchase date), I will be hit with six-figures worth of federal tax, which would be unfavorable in the long-term.

For context, I'm making $115k/yr at the company, but I have \~3k in debt/rent/utilities/etc. to pay off each month.

The Federal Reserve, together with the IRS, can try and hinder further development and market participation by ordinary people but they know this is pretty much mission impossible. 

So what do they do? Create a centralized Digital Dollar, backed by the U.S. Government, to try and compete with cryptocurrencies. Everyone here knows that a centralized  government-backed digital currency could never compete with the core idea of cryptocurrencies but that's not the main point here. 

The fact that cryptocurrency now has such a large ecosystem with tens of millions of civilians backing it, and with institutional money heavily involved, means that the U.S. Government has to resort to **competing against crypto** rather than **banning crypto.**

By creating a Digital Dollar, they are forced to legitimize the world of cryptocurrency, even when they don't want to. Creating a Digital Dollar will also force civilians not interested in crypto to take a greater look at crypto in the near future. 

The next five years are going to be wild but one thing is certain: **you cannot ever ban cryptocurrencies. The only thing you can do as a government is to create a centralized version yourself and hope that citizens don't look at alternatives.**",cryptocurrency

Accordingly to google, this will be the first webpage where 32.1.1.2.2 and orthodontia appear together. https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ALeKk03PMewPAsM9NcvW0xBFvi7uGoqAqQ:1621620775833&amp;q=32.1.1.2.2+%22orthodontia%22&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj-0raSsNvwAhXV-J4KHWSJBcwQ5t4CMAB6BAgiEAs&amp;biw=1080&amp;bih=1790 Funny how no one has mentioned how the IRS can rely on proposed rules for braces.  

Anyway, following this logic of using proposed rules, I intend to argue that proposed 26 CFR § 1.125-6(a)(2)(ii) (which appears in 72 FR 43938 two pages after 26 C.F.R. § 1.125-5(k)(3)) also applies. That subparagraph states:  ""When medical expenses are incurred. For purposes of this rule, medical expenses are incurred when the employee (or the employee’s spouse or dependents) is provided with the medical care that gives rise to the medical expenses, and not when the employee is formally billed, charged for, or pays for the medical care."" https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2007-08-06/pdf/E7-14827.pdf#page=25 

Additionally, proposed 26 C.F.R. § 1.125-5(k)(3) does not actually prevent or address reimbursement over multiple plan years for prepaid orthodontia. Rather, it just allows for the reimbursement of prepaid orthodontia before the services are provided--that's it.  Since that's not my situation, I'm going to argue that the language of proposed 26 CFR § 1.125-6(a)(2)(ii) (incurred means when treatment happens) applies and the treatment is 18 months (as stated in my contract).

Edit 2: I got approved: https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/nhak8h/what_is_the_exact_irs_authority_for_why_flexible/gzax8co/?context=3

Original post:

My flexible spending account (also known as a cafeteria plan) administrator treats reimbursement for braces (also known as orthodontia) differently than regular medical care and I can't figure out why. I would like to know what is the precise United States Code section, Code of Federal Regulation, IRS Publication, IRS Notice, or other official document that gives the administrator authority to treat reimbursement for braces differently.

Background:

I prepaid for my braces in full with a lump sum during a previous flex spending account year (this is the genesis of my problem). My braces contract says treatment time of 18 months, so I want to consider that my medical expenses are incurred over the 18 months, so I can spread the reimbursement over multiple flexible spending account years. My administrator said that I could get reimbursed over the course of the 18 months IF I was paying monthly payments. Here's a link to their website saying the same thing. [https://www.nbsbenefits.com/orthodontia-and-the-fsa/](https://www.nbsbenefits.com/orthodontia-and-the-fsa/)

I think that the administrator is wrong.

Over the past week, I've done a lot of research on this issue. I don’t think an IRS authority exists that supports my administrator's legal position. The only thing I could find that remotely supports my administrator's legal position is PROPOSED 26 C.F.R. § 1.125-5(k)(3) [https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2007-08-06/pdf/E7-14827.pdf#page=23](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2007-08-06/pdf/E7-14827.pdf#page=23) (page 43959, top left) which, if finalized, says that an administrator can reimburse braces/orthodontia paid in full during the year in which the braces/orthodontia are paid, regardless of when the treatment occurs. HOWEVER this rule was never finalized AND it does not prevent people from using the standard process of claiming medical expenses when the treatment occurs.

On the Electronic Code of Federal Regulations website, 26 C.F.R. § 1.125-5 is not among the regulations listed.  [https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=f902d46bfcae767daa4ec1446dd4733e&amp;mc=true&amp;tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title26/26cfr1b\_main\_02.tpl](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=f902d46bfcae767daa4ec1446dd4733e&amp;mc=true&amp;tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title26/26cfr1b_main_02.tpl)  This makes me pretty certain that 26 C.F.R. § 1.125-5(k)(3) is not currently in effect.

I think my administrator is incorrectly relying on a proposed rule.

However, before I accuse my administrator of relying on a proposed rule, I want to be sure there isn’t something else that exists.

Some other relevant authority I reviewed: 26 USC 105(e), 26 USC 125, 26 USC 213, 26 CFR 1.125-3, 26 CFR 1.125-4, IRS Publication 502, IRS Publication 969, and IRS Notice 2020-29.

personalfinance,Are we crazy for trying to buy a house?,"My husband and I are trying to buy a house. We have a 3-month-old baby. We currently rent an apartment and want more space and a yard, so we are looking to buy a house in the suburbs.  The median home price for the area is $375,000. We have never purchased a house before and are unsure if doing so would stretch us too thin.  We are pre-approved. We got estimated monthly payments for a $400,000 house from 2 mortgage companies.   We do not have any debt. Our car is fully paid off. We do not currently have to pay for daycare- I work M-F office hours and my husband works nights Thurs-Sat so we are able to keep our child at home for now.  

Combined gross annual income: $135,000   

We have $40,000 for a down payment, which still leaves us with $39,000 in cash. One mortgage company would charge us PMI for having less than 20% down payment and our credit union would not make us do PMI but had a higher interest rate. The monthly payments worked out to about the same amount and include taxes, insurance, etc.  Closing costs are estimated at $14,000.        

Budget with a mortgage for a $400k house:   

Monthly take-home pay: $7,168   

House payment: $2,800   

Utilities: $300 (this is an estimate)   

Groceries: $650   

Gas: $50 (I work from home full-time so only 1 of us drives to/from work)   

Cell phone bills: $115   

Eating out: $80   

Miscellaneous: $150 (don't always spend all of this)   

Baby costs: $150    

Total expenses: $4,295    

Income - expenses= $2,873 for IRA contributions, 529 contributions, vacations, etc.    

&amp;#x200B;

Does this seem reasonable? Should we wait and save a bigger down payment? Getting a cheaper house is possible but only if we move even further away than we are currently looking or buy a fixer-upper. I'm not sure we want to go for something that needs a lot of work and upgrades.",finance

personalfinance,Need advice for dealing with student loans - left school after a sexual assault,"I’m posting this on behalf of the person involved.

In 2011, she went on medical leave during her senior year at college after being sexually assaulted. She was hospitalized, and institutionalized for being a suicide risk. During this time, her parents told her they would handle her student loans and she wouldn’t have to worry about them.

Fast forward, and she’s now discovering that they didn’t in fact handle anything. She’s still picking up the pieces and unraveling everything, now that she’s been through a lot of therapy and is on her long road of recovery, but she does know that she has over $100k of federal student loan debt. She had multiple partial scholarships, but it looks like they are expecting repayment since she didn’t finish school.

To me, it seems crazy for them to expect repayment considering her reason for leaving school, but I guess that’s America. While she’s figuring out her options, I thought I’d come here to see if anyone has advice. Are there any programs or other options that we just aren’t aware of? What are the steps that should be taken here?",finance

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, May 20, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, May 20, 2021**

Stocks snapped their modest three-day losing streak and jumped higher today, with market participants encouraged by the Weekly Unemployment Report and inflationary fears tempering. As I said yesterday, I was encouraged to see volatility decreasing this week after the wild swing the market experienced recently and am even more encouraged by today’s movement that the sharp sell-off was overdone. 

The Department of Labor released their Weekly Unemployment Report, which showed 444,000 new jobless claims filed, a fresh pandemic low and marginally better than the 450,000 expected by economists. To put this into context, in April of last year, more than 6 million individuals filed jobless claims in one week. While the improvement in the labor market has been extremely encouraging, in the Federal Reserve’s April meeting minutes (basically notes about what was discussed in the meeting) noted “participants generally noted that the economy remained far from the Committee’s maximum-employment and price-stability goals”.  

However, it is important to note, the minutes covered the meeting before the release of the April Jobs Report, which came in much weaker than expected (which bolsters the Fed’s argument that employment remains far from their goal) and the Consumer Price Index, which showed a greater-than-expected increase in consumer prices. That said, the recent reports are extremely unlikely to change the Fed’s view given Powell and other monetary officials have said they expect any inflation to be “transitory” and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports before adjustments to the current policy are considered.

On a slightly sour note, the meeting minutes also noted “a number of participants suggested” that as the economy continues to quickly, “it might be appropriate at some point in upcoming meetings to begin discussing a plan for adjusting the pace of asset purchase”, which have currently been going at a rate of $120 billion per month. However, this is not a surprising statement and one Powell himself has said before. Back in an April 14 meeting, Powell said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.” As a reminder, quantitative easing is a process in which the Fed buys government bonds in order to inject money into the economy. It is only natural that as the economy recovers, less money needs to be injected into the economy in this manner. The Federal Reserve gave absolutely no signal it was even considering beginning discussion on raising interest rates, which is what market participants are really concerned about.

CryptoCurrency,3 most common reasons for loosing ur crypto to a hacker,"Hacked is such a vague term nowadays, but if u want to avoid the 3 most common ways people lose their crypto avoid doing these:
.


1) You use the same username and password for a crypto platform that you use for a bunch of other sites and somewhere it gets compromised, meaning they can easily login to your account. Always use a unique password for any financial site (bank/credit card/Coinbase/and email)

.

2) You respond to a spoofed email (looks like it is from a legit platform but it is not from them) and you provide your credentials to a fake site. You can avoid this by always manually typing in the URL (for whatever financial website you are trying to log into) in order to know 100% you are going to the legit website. There is also a way to check the address the email came from, very easy to tell if its legitimate just from that.
.

3) Two-factor Authentication should always be active. A new IP logging into your account would trigger a 2FA request. If you have 2FA set to your email and they were able to access your account, then you probably use the same password for your email. Never use the same password for critical websites.",cryptocurrency

I filed 2020 taxes in January, and they were accepted. Got the state return but not federal.

I then called the IRS, to see if they could take this requirement off and unfreeze my taxes, but IRS says it was out of their jurisdiction, but they did let me know that the marketplace insurance I had was filed in a different state then I live, presumably by my parents.  My parents claim they did not purchase health insurance for me thru Marketplace, and their accountant has no record of it either. Long long story longer I cannot access the 1045A or 8962, I need it to unfreeze my taxes, and my parents have no knowledge of this form or how to access it either.

personalfinance,Federal tax question,"Hoping I can pick some of your brains here:

I started a new job and my taxes are wildly different than my previous job, though my pay increase wasn't that substantial.

I started a new job last month and with it came a $6500 raise. I went from making $48,500 to $55,000. I live in MN if this matters.

At my previous job and now my new job on my W2 I filed for exemptions 3 - myself, my daughter and my fiance as she's a stay at home mom not working and I'm head of household. 

At my previous job my federal taxes were only $10-20 per paycheck, I couldn't believe it but it was true and to my surprise I didn't owe anything come tax time. 

At my new job my federal taxes are $210 per paycheck though my income has not changed much and i can't imagine i moved into a different tax bracket that would make that large of a difference. When i check my company website for pay it states:

State exemptions : 3

Federal exemptions: N/A

I spoke to my HR, which isn't a real HR as the company is smaller and he wasn't sure why it would state that but said it says that for the other newer employees as well.

Anyone have any ideas why this would be happening and how I could fix? I'd much rather have the money monthly than get a sum back at tax time since i'm the only one in the household working.

solar,Self Consumption figure much too high,"I recently installed a SolarEdge based system with the SolarEdge consumption meter.  With the mild weather we have had recently we have not had the HVAC turned on nor are we running many appliances or anything else.  Despite this the consumption meter is showing us burning through many kWh during the day.  

I have a theory and I want to know if it makes sense.  I think the consumption meter is measuring the current flowing out to the grid and subtracting that from what the inverter is currently reporting.  However, if the local power grid is oversaturated and power can't be fed back it shows up as self consumption instead.  I'm assuming the ""production"" shown on the inverter is calculated by multiplying the currently measured voltage at the optimizer by the size of the panel, so it can show as producing 330w, but in reality nothing is available to consume the power so it's not actually moving the electrons.  

If this theory is true then the upshot is that I'm losing out on kW credits simply because there isn't enough demand on the grid to use the power I'm producing.  This affects my payoff horizon since I had tried to zero out production over a year timeframe, but this means I'm not building up sufficient credits in the spring and fall to offset the summer and winter demand.

I had originally thought a hybrid system didn't make much sense because my local grid is very stable (1 outage a year typically, and only for a few hours), but if this is true it may serve a purpose in actually making use of that excess capacity, especially since my panels are oriented to get the most sun in the morning.

For an example of what I'm talking about here is a typical full sun day with little running in my house:

[Monitoring Graph](http://jubei.ceyah.org/~jandrese/solar_self_consumption.png)

Note how the ""self consumption"" blue color rises with the sun, even though nobody in the house would be doing more than playing on their phones for an hour.  The heat pump is off, there was minimal host water use, no appliances were activated, and yet it shows us consuming 6 kW of power.  You can even see the lonely cloud that passed over the house around 10:00 being reflected not only in the total production, but our self consumption figure.

Is this expected?  I've not been able to find comments about this phenomenon on the Internet, but I'm not exactly sure what to search for.  My installer certainly never mentioned anything about this being a possibility.  I had naively thought that grid demand would be more or less unlimited at my scale, but it seems that may not be the case.",energy

personalfinance,Help Me Out of Debt,"Hi everyone, just as the post says, I'm looking for the best strategy to get out of debt. I'm 26 years old currently \~$124,000 in debt and make \~65k (income will be closer to 85k as I just accepted a new job which starts next month. I work full time at a school so this will increase yearly). Here's the breakdown:

Take-home pay: full-time job ($3,100) + side-gig ($1,000-1,700/month)

**Expenses:**

Rent + Utilities \~$925

Student Loans (balance as of today):

* &amp;#x200B;

1. $5,226 with 8% interest, min payment $136

* 2) $29,000 with 6% interest, min payment $333
* 3) $66,000 with 6% interest (currently in deferment, hoping for teacher loan forgiveness in next \~3 years which eliminates $17,500), min payment $ 350 (extended graduate repayment plan) \*\*\*not due until September.

Credit Card:

* $4,000 with 12.99% APY. This happened recently due to my move. I've currently paid down $600 from the initial balance (min payment is $100)

Car:

* $20,000 with 8% APY (I know!), min payment $381 (I opted for the longest repayment plan aka 84 months!)

High Yield Savings: I just moved so I'm at $300 and hope to build this back up!

Please tell me there's hope! I would love to purchase property marry the love of my life and have a family within the next 5-10 years.

**Debt+Living Expenses: $1875**

Update: Full budget as requested

*Additional Expenses:*

*Netflix: $17.99 (family uses my account)*

Range: $1,544-$2,094

**Update: Range of money leftover at the end of the month: $131-$1081 (depends on if it's a hair month, lighter going out month, good/bad side gig month etc.). In April I took home $4,500, didn't have to get my hair done or pay my Fed student loan which is why I managed the $600 towards my loan. Typing it all out though, I'm realizing how much money is ""slipping and falling"" into the fun money category and need to gain a grip on that. I appreciate all of the comments!**

personalfinance,First Time Home Buyer in Need of Advice,"Hi there – my boyfriend (27) and I (26) are looking for a place to live in the North Dallas area. For reference, decent two-bedroom apartments in our area cost about $1300-$1700 monthly (all bills paid), but honestly, we’re more than a bit averse to apartment-living. We’d really like to take a shot at purchasing our first home, if possible. I just got a job straight out of grad school, and my boyfriend—though currently looking for work—was able to earn us a good chunk of cash through investing. Here’s a brief overview of our financial situation and expectations:

· $32,500 annual salary (TX state employee, Master’s degree holder); $2,225 minimum monthly after taxes (without counting overtime)—hoping this will double when we’re both working. 

· I expect my income to increase to $ 42,000 within 3 years and $50,000 within 5. 

· I am also hopeful that I may find a higher paying job in that time, though this position has great job security and benefits.

· No debt, excellent credit score

· $12,500 in savings, $100,000 in investments.

· Shooting for 20% down payment; we have $50,000 we’re willing to part with

· Shooting for $200,000 loan max

· House budget ≤$250,000 (most comfortable with $180,000-230,000 range)

· The max monthly mortgage payment for our budget would be about $1200 before utilities with a 30 year note, though we’re shooting for $800-$1000 

So…is this a good idea? Are we being unrealistic? Since we’ve got a down-payment already saved up, leasing an apartment or looking for rentals just doesn’t seem worth it. Would taking out a mortgage at (what feels like) a high point in the cost of housing currently be better than keeping our money invested and continuing to live with my parents? We are worried interest rates could change and cause our ability to afford these homes to rapidly leave us along with the current trend of increasing home prices. 

Thank you all for your time!",finance

personalfinance,Quick Questions about Refinancing a Home Loan,"Hello r/personalfinance!

I was just wondering if I could run my situation by you to make sure I'm doing the right thing. I'm starting to get  some letters in the mail from companies about refinancing my home loan. I really do want to refinance to take advantage of a lower interest rate, but I've never done this before and I'm not sure what is normal. I called my bank to see if they could help explain this stuff to me, but the mortgage guy they have isn't getting back to me very quickly.  

We bought our home on a 30 year fixed mortgage in 2019 and our interest rate is 4.3%. I'm starting to get letters in the mail that say I can get a 2.5% interest rate for a 30 year fixed mortgage and can cut my payment nearly in half. I don't really need the lower payment, but my biggest financial goal right now is paying off my house as quickly as possible so I mainly want to do this to get a lower interest rate.

I've gotten 3 letters from 3 different companies about refinancing in the last month. All of them were unsolicited/ I wasn't looking into refinancing at all before I got the letters and I've never gotten letters like this before. Is this normal? I'm just scared that this is a scam. One letter came from the company that I pay my mortgage to, one came from InterContinental Capital Group, and the third came from Nutter Home loans. They all have numbers to call them by xyz date to get my interest rate locked in.

I mostly just want to run this by someone to make sure I'm thinking about this correctly. Are there any red flags I need to watch out for?",finance
personalfinance,"My sister is buried in student loan debt, just received an inheritance from our father, and we want to protect it from creditors.","My sister has had it rough. She took on an enormous amount of student loan debt, was unable to find good paying work afterwards, and her loans have skyrocketed. I believe she graduated with $160k in loans at 6% interest, which are now well over $300k. She is on an income-based repayment plan, which is indefinitely deferred due to financial hardship, but the interest just keeps accruing.

Our father just passed away last month. She quit her retail job in New York to move in with him in Florida and was his full time caretaker until he passed. She then came out to stay with me in California until she can get back on her feet.

The estate is small, under $500k split 50/50. She wants to use the proceeds to buy a property in cash so she has a safe place to call home. We are afraid that the creditors will come after her, and don't really understand whether inheritance is fair game with student loan debt. I read that the law in CA just recently changed so that the homestead exemption will cover her property, but she's not technically a resident of CA since she just landed here and doesn't have a permanent residence.

Then there is the consideration of student loan forgiveness/consolidation/default/whatever. She wants to see if she can do something to reduce her debt burden, and especially take advantage of lower interest rates. If she has a property paid off, even if it's under the homestead exemption, they may look at her and say she doesn't have financial hardship and won't help her.

I'm trying to figure out what kind of lawyer to even speak with about this. When I look up ""student loan lawyer"" I get a whole bunch of shady characters. I don't even know what jurisdiction this technically falls under. What kind of lawyer deals with student loan debt and inheritance? Please help!",finance

We are aware of the 5 year look back rule for Medicaid, so we're planning to transfer a good portion of the assets in the Traditional IRA to an investment account set up under the Trust to get the clock started.

The advisor recommends transferring about half of the assets this year and the other half next year. The advisor believes the tax rate will be around 25% federal &amp; 9% state for this years cash out. Is the higher tax rate worth getting the 5 year clock started?

Powur pays 70% of the profits to you and takes 30% to pay you down the road when you have a team of people working with you and they make sales. You ask how the company makes money. Well it is set up as a zero emissions public benefits company which means they do a lot more good than bad. They put the sales man first and the way they keep their doors open is but collecting $99 to start and $49 a month to use their amazing software which makes selling solar a breeze. Now Powur plants trees all over the world and is involved in many other co2 reduction initiatives that compensate for 100% of the co2 released in the making of the solar panels the use to install solar systems. All this and Powur has a 30 year warranty that covers labor, travel, roof penetration, and parts and this warranty is held by an actual insurance company, solar insure. Pretty much any other solar company out there has only a 25 year manufacturers warranty that covers only parts. Now this is 100% original.

So let’s try and keep this planet in working order. Now this will include some links to educate you on solar and an option to either become an ambassador “which means you only would be responsible for uploading other people’s electric bills. Then if they get installed you would receive a check from Powur for $1,000. It will include a link to join which means you would pay your $99 and your $49 for the use of the software for the first month which makes selling solar a breeze. It will also have a link for you to go solar. If you are content with the life you have created but you want to help out this cause feel free to up load your electric bill there and i will speak with you about your options.

But the best opportunity you will ever get to go solar and make this world a better place while saving 10’s of thousands of dollars, building equity in your house “so the system pays for it’s self and then prints money on your roof for the next 30-35+ years, you will get the first 12 months for free and you will also get a 26% federal government tax credit back for 26% of the total cost of your system which you can do what ever you want to with. Some people use it to pay down their solar payment. Others use it to go on a much needed vacation and others that just lost their asses can use it to pay off credit card debt that they rack up during these hard times. Instead of paying 18-25%, for the use of that money you will only pay 1.99%. Pretty sweet deal. Now again look up the definition of spamming.

CryptoCurrency,My little take on this situation. Biden's move gives me confidence.,"Long time lurker first time poster! I think my story is a bit of one that can be related to by many on this board. I make 30k a year at my job. I only invest 50 to 100 dollars at a time. My aim isn't to be this wolf of wallbets or whatever. My goal is simple. Long-term freedom. I finally bought my first crypto after the announcement that it would be available on Paypal. I held it all until recently when an emergency forced me into selling. But since January I had gained over 50% gain. This was not only a good feeling but it shown me how this market works in a way. The reason why it wasn't a big deal, I started mining on my 3080 and am starting to stake ETH2. but I also have sent my ETH to other coins and making small pays here and there.   


I want to be real with this situation. Biden's announcement actually gives me confidence. Think about everything we have experienced in a week alone with a certain electric vehicle company. The man can manipulate markets at the whim of a tweet. He only does this because he can't in the stock market: [https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2018-226](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2018-226)  


I have faith in the idea of crypto, a lot of people call me nuts for investing long-term in crypto, but I think it solves some major issues the fed has in the US. We are entering merky waters but this isn't the first time. Since 2015 I have been skeptical until recently. Imagine the security that would be possible with some SLIGHT regulation. I think our (the US) gov't has the right idea. That being said I really wish some of the crypto firms would organize and make their own regulating body so that gov't influence would be avoided. Like a SEC of crypto.   


What's my point? I'm not worried in the slightest. Don't invest for the short term. 1 to 2 years from now I believe (not a financial advisor this is my opinion) we may have an 8 to 10% gain. Gain is gain. It doesn't sound like much sure, but would you rather lose everything on the pursuit of glory or have a stable life in your 50's/60's while being an early adopter of a new kind of currency.  The big thing for me for long-term use is the simple economic concept of ""supply and demand"".  After the 2008 stock market crash there is very little confidence in FIAT. We need a solution to centralization our money currently doesn't yield much return. Crypto fits in this slot nicely until there is a better answer.   


I think some guidelines to prevent some of the pump n dumps would be nice and provide stability. But this comes at the risk of pushing low wage people like me out. But then again I don't think I will ever break a 10k trade let alone a 1k trade. Plus, I am not a business.   


My last point why I still have a shit ton of confidence is just looking at graphs. Look at all the graphs. There is always a dip and then a period of low value and then a pump and then the floor raises. Don't look to losing your money in the short term but riding that inflation wave to retirment.   


I would also like to say that there is a ton I could be wrong about everything, as I am a newb at this whole thing. But I think there is a good thing going on and I am looking to 2025 value 2030 value. Yeah it would be nice to wake up and realize I have gained millions but if I just move a bit by bit at a time I oculd have a nest egg and some security.   


I hope you guys have the best of luck trading. Just have a good wank, look at the 1 year graph, relax, make a drink and watch a movie play a video game. To me (again opinion) the future is bright.

CryptoCurrency,Dutch Bank ABN Amro is now fining you for withdrawing your own money.,"In The Netherlands, one of the biggest banks, 'ABN Amro', is now limiting its customers to a maximum yearly cash withdrawal of **10.000** euros. Every transaction you withdraw after that, you pay a 5 euro fine, as well as another 0,5% fine over the total withdrawn amount. Economists are using straw man arguments like 'cash is too easy to use for crime'. Ironically, this was announced 1 week after they were fined 480 million euro for breaking money laundering laws. 

In similar news, last year dutch banks started charging **negative interest rates** over any accounts that saved over 1.000.000 euros. This year, they lowered it to apply to any account over 100.000 euros. In Denmark, they already lowered it to 100.000 kroner (which is only 14.000 euros). This is how the breakdown of the financial system happens - not in 1 day, but rather in small but increasingly drastic steps. It'll be just a matter of time before every single saver account will be charged negative interest. 

Up until last month I thought it was over-exaggerated news but I just got the 'official' letter to inform me about these changes this week. The recent volatility in crypto had me scared I have to admit, but this just completely reassured me - crypto is here to stay. Whatever price it has right now, is not relevant. The people need to take back control over their own money and we need to do it quick.. Banks shouldn't have the power to decide wether you get to use cash or not. Banks shouldn't be able to fine you for taking out your own money. Banks should not keep being bailed out by taxpayer money.  People are waking up to the fact that banks are failing, and mass adoption of crypto will come, because they're forcing our hand. Why would anyone willingly give all their money to an institution that is being increasingly irresponsible with their investments, fining you for taking out your own cash, heavily involved in all kinds of shady business, and **PAY** this institution interest for the 'privilege'?? Banks made sense in the 20th century. They don't anymore in the 21st.

financialindependence,One more 1M+ $ guy from Europe :),"Hi redditors,

Most of the people in this subreddit are form US: CA or NY, so i think it would be of interest to see how it can be done on another side of the ocean and in less paying places.

I'm 32, single, and just broke 1M$ level, so here is my story how i did it.

I graduated in Russia as a scientist (nuclear physicist) ten years ago in 2011 and after that went  for PhD in Germany.

After the mortgage crisis in 2008, the prices of the real estate in Germany were also quite dumped as in US, so I sold my apartment in Russia and bought one in Germany. Prices and currency in Russia were quite high at that time, due to oil-driven EM bubble.  The apartment was the initial bootstrap from my parents (love you, mam) and it was 4000k rubles(100k $).

In following years, the ECB's QE interest rate policy has driven the real estate prices 3-4x times up in Europe, so my apartment is now worth 260k euros (317k $)

During my PhD studies I had a scholarship 20k euros (24k $) annually post tax, living in own flat i.e. not paying any rent and saving aggressively. In my PhD years I realized that I want to achieve FIRE, so I could do my cosmic particles research and not be bothered by expenses of this ""mortal world"". Young scientists are usually stuck for ages in the short term ""postdoc"" contracts that pay almost nothing. Obviously one can not break into FI with such a shitty cashflow.

That's why I pivoted myself into quantitative finance and in 2015 got a job in IB as a quant. Started at 55k euros (66k $) and grew into 80k (97k $).  Also in 2016 I have opened brokerage account and poured into it all my cash savings at that time (70k$). Bought an index ETF and some tech stocks like NVIDIA, cuz I knew that GPUs gonna rock, since in a science we used them for a long time for massive scientific calculations.

In the end of 2019 I decided to re-enter russian RE market since after the huge collapse in 2014 it started to recover from dirt cheap prices. My idea was that eventually the russian central bank will do the similar thing like QE as the bigger brothers did a decade ago. And it did so - interest rates have fallen from 15% in 2014 to mere 4.25% in 2021. So in 2019 I got lucky, a few month before Coronacrisis, I exited stocks and rotated into russian RE. I know I missed the ""V"" rebound in stocks, but RE also showed a massive 70% uptick.

Also bought two BTCs in 2017 at 5k and sold a month ago at 57k.

So now German apartment (317k$), a house (215k$) and other apartments (378k + 75k + 75k)  are together 1M+

So i guess the lesson from this story is - QEs are your friends, try to get them as much possible in different places, they are some times not quite synced so there is an arbitrage :)",finance

Unless you are looking for a relationship between time and your variable, graphing in time is useless.

CryptoCurrency,Is there any way that we can protect ourselves from our governments that do not have our best interests at heart?,"Whether you're from the UK, US, Scandinavian, Indian, or African, we can all agree that our governments do not want what is best for us. My question is how we can best protect ourselves and reduce their power are much as possible. 

My first goal is to hold all of my wealth in assets that my government cannot debase. Here in the UK, interest rates have been sub 0.5% for as long as I can remember, yet house price and equity inflation has averaged around 4% each year. Since I was born, the pound sterling has had its purchasing power reduced by 70% through quantitative easing, government subsidies for large companies, and explicit inflation (which is still pretty opaque). Hell, even this year our government printed money, gave it to large companies and those companies then paid out dividends with that money. If that's not stealing then I don't know what is. 

Anyway... my point is what more can we do than just protect our assets from devaluation? There is no way we can use cryptocurrencies as payment methods as governments will never allow it. Wages will always be based in fiat, businesses ecosystems denominated in fiat, and taxes required to be paid on every single cryptocurrency transaction. I dream of the day to be able to never use fiat and the traditional banking system ever again.

There may be a small transfer of wealth but I do not believe there will be any transfer of power or proper level of sovereignty in our lifetime unless governments fail. I miss the days when a government that couldn't raise enough money from its empire/nation couldn't spend money it didn't have.

Change my view. I really hope I'm wrong.

Bitcoin,Bitcoin wallets technical q&amp;a,"I spent about a week so far learning everything I can about crypto. For some basic things it can be quite a rabbit hole of digging through documentation, reddit, youtube videos, etc.

Here's a list of the questions I dug up answers for to help myself understand. Hope it helps someone else. And please let me know if I made any mistakes.

&amp;#x200B;

**What is a cold storage wallet:**

A wallet that is never connected to the internet. For long term storage of large amounts.

Security precautions (adjust for your personal comfort level):

* Store mnemonic seed in 2-3 physical locations (1 in steel disaster-proof capsule)
* Store pass phrase/PIN in 2-3 physical locations
* Store hardware wallet in 1 physical location
* Never type your seeds or passwords on a keyboard or into a computer or phone. Watch out for phishing attacks.
* Never store your seed on a device like a PC or phone. Do not store in a password manager.

**What is a hot wallet:**

A wallet for frequent use. Buying, selling, trading, etc. Smaller amounts. Think of it like cash in your pocket.

Security precautions (adjust for your personal comfort level):

* Can be a software wallet or even a centralized exchange
* Password manager is fine for storing the password

**Difference between a hardware wallet and paper wallet?**

* Hardware wallet can generate infinite receiving addresses
* Hardware wallets spread funds out across multiple addresses for pseudo-privacy
* Paper wallet is considered obsolete, insecure, and bad for privacy

**Does a wallet have a “primary” private key to generate all the private keys for each address? Does the seed for the wallet generate multiple private keys?**

* Yes, the “master root node” or “master key” is produced from the mnemonic seed.
* Infinite deterministic private key/public key pairs with addresses are then generated in sequence from the master key

**What's the difference between a public key and an address?**

* Private key produces a public key
* Public key produces an address
* You cannot derive public keys from addresses. And cannot derive private keys from public keys.

**What's the public key used for?**

The public key is used to “sign” the transaction when you send money. The address is used for receiving money and keeps the public key private.

**How do I check if a transaction was successful?**

* Look up the sender’s Transaction id (TxID) on [https://www.blockchain.com/explorer](https://www.blockchain.com/explorer)
* Wait for confirmations on the blockchain, the number depending on the size of the transaction and your comfort level. For example:
* Under $100, no confirmations
* Wait for 1 confirmation if over $100
* Wait for 3 confirmations if over $1000
* Etc.

**How do I check if a deposit was successfully deposited into my cold storage hardware wallet?**

Use a “watch-only” wallet. export a xpub that allows you to monitor all your receiving addresses

[https://bitcoinelectrum.com/creating-a-watch-only-wallet/](https://bitcoinelectrum.com/creating-a-watch-only-wallet/)

**Are watch-only wallets secure? Is it safe to use an app to view the cold storage balance as “read only” i.e. import the master public key?**

Watch only wallets are secure but may have an effect on privacy.

**Are there any security concerns withdrawing from a cold storage hardware wallet? Won’t my private key be exposed? Doesn’t withdrawing effectively make it a hot wallet? How do I withdraw securely?**

Hardware wallets don’t share any private information when plugged into the PC, even if it is connected to the internet. But make sure you are never typing in your seed anywhere. And no taking photos. It should be written down and protected in a physical location.

**What to do if hardware wallet is stolen**

Immediately transfer the funds to a new wallet. To do this, you can recover the funds with a software wallet and your recovery seed, and immediately send the funds to an exchange if you don't have a replacement hardware wallet yet, or send them directly to a new hardware wallet with a new seed.

**What to do if seed is stolen**

Send all the funds to a software wallet or exchange, wipe your hardware wallet, set up a new wallet on the device with a new seed and move the funds there.

**How is the lightning network secure? If the blockchain relies on the majority of CPUs to be ""honest"". Can't a private payment channel on the lightning network be spoofed by an attacker?**

* Technically yes, but If a bad actor gets caught fudging the transactions, they are penalized by losing all of the funds in the payment channel: [https://river.com/learn/terms/l/lightning-network-penalty/](https://river.com/learn/terms/l/lightning-network-penalty/)
* Eltoo is a proposed update to make the penalty not necessary  [https://river.com/learn/terms/l/lightning-network-penalty/](https://river.com/learn/terms/l/lightning-network-penalty/)",cryptocurrency

spread coins among them. put them in separate safe places. make copies.

https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/search/?q=bitaddress&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=top

excerpt from one post from seven years ago on this very subreddit  in that last search

https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1pxy4w/basic_bitcoin_security_guide/

""Cold storage

Sometimes you want to store your bitcoins for a long time in a safe place. This is called “cold storage”. There are a few ways one can do this.

First of all, paper wallets. They are nice for giving people small bitcoin gifts, but also for long-term storage if properly used. What you want to do is generate and print them offline. You can save the linked page https://www.bitaddress.org/ for example and run that offline. If you are really paranoid, you can put it on read-only media and access that from a different computer. For really long term storage, use archival-grade paper.

Another approach to take is using a separate computer for storing your money that is offline 99+% of the time. You could set one up easily by buying an old laptop, reformatting it, installing Linux and a Bitcoin client. Generate an address on that machine and send money to it from your main wallet. Depending on how paranoid you are you can connect that computer to the Internet afterwards to synchronize data with the Bitcoin Network and then turn it off and put it away somewhere safe until it’s needed.""

I will say one thing though.

if you send coins to a paper wallet never ever let any phone or camera with any bitcoin app see that wallet. donit even let any camera get close. most new apps take all bitcoins from any paper wallet without telling you thinking they are doing you a favor and suddenly you only have the password for the phone app and the paper wallet key is useless. I personally think that is terrible practice but that is what many big android and ios bitcoin apps do now. so if you then deleted the app on your phone or lost it then all your backup copies of that particular wallet would be empty and useless.

like I said spread out your stuff in small amounts on different paper wallets and store them in different places so you cant ever lose everything at once.

before doing any transfer always practice with a tiny amount and make sure it goes through and appears where you want it to. never do any transfer in panic or haste. that is how millions and millions of coins have been sent to the bitcoin blackhole with no chance of recovery.
----------------------------------------------------
edit: this is the part where the people who want to sell you expensive hardware wallets tell you the founders who invented this paper wallet system along with Bitcoin itself were wrong.

stories of how people lose all their bitcoins..never one who had multiple paper wallets in different place with a portion of all their coins in each but plenty of people losing coins with hardware wallets.

Let's go....

Newly covered today:

1. The Cardano Foundation has released the full video of the Fireside Chat with Eva and Fred. Lots of questions answered on a variety of fronts. Very interesting remarks including that in discussions with financial institutions, Fred has found they are interested in exposure to the alpha provided by the asset class in general, tokenization of assets, and the yield provided by staking rewards. Fred counters that they SHOULD be far more interested in the Cardano standard including the concepts of reference accounts, programmability of money, and transaction metadata. [https://youtu.be/JW6s9Jkyazg](https://youtu.be/JW6s9Jkyazg)
2. In a video press release yesterday, the Fed finally admitted that it’s moving toward a central bank digital currency (just like every other central bank). This will eventually be impactful on Cardano and every other crypto ecosystem. [https://youtu.be/WOAQxpG79Ag](https://youtu.be/WOAQxpG79Ag)
3. The Treasury is trying to figure out how to get cryptocurrency regulation in a headlock. This will probably go hand-in-hand with the Fed’s March toward a CBDC. Afterall, what good is all the tracking and monitoring afforded by a CBDC if it’s easier for everyone to just use a non-central bank digital currency? Tax evasion in crypto is also obviously a target problem since we know only about 800 people a year paid taxes on crypto in 2013-2015.

12. There is really good information about Cardano’s deals in Africa and its developer adoption strategy in this Cardano Chats interview that kind of flew under the radar. Probably worth a listen if you haven’t heard it. [https://youtu.be/m6TeNLvMTXI](https://youtu.be/m6TeNLvMTXI)

14. We just experienced a big flash crash in price. A prime suspect is the drop in hash rate in BTC due to the Blackouts in China. Is the crypto space ready to accept that Nakamoto style consensus on PoW leads directly to unacceptable levels of centralization? This has been the dirty secret of PoW crypto and its decentralization loving enthusiasts for years. [https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-mining-hash-rate-drops-as-blackouts-instituted-in-china](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-mining-hash-rate-drops-as-blackouts-instituted-in-china)
15. Charles posted a somewhat cryptic tweet that read “Omega + Hydra + Mithral = GG”. The Ourobors Omega, Ouroboros Hydra, &amp; Mithral parts we’ve covered before. Omega is a capstone rollup of Praos (2017), Genesis (2018), + Redux, +Chronos, +Ledger Combiners, +some other things from the rest of the space. Hydra is layer two. Mithral is trustless light wallets via zk-SNARKs. Guesses as to the “GG” ranged from “Good Game” (as in game over for competitors) to “Goguen”. See today’s video at the link above for more discussion on this. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1383792375860924424](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1383792375860924424)

21. Africa special going down April 29th, 16:30 UTC!!!!!!! That’s 9:30amPacific; 10:30am Mountain; 12:30pm Eastern, 5:30pm Dublin; 7:30pm Addis Ababa; 11:30pm Bangkok.

22. Shahaf Bar-Geffen, CEO of COTI (the first recipient of a Cardano CFund investment), says he just finished recording his segment in the Africa special which he mentioned was airing at the end of April prior to the IOHK announcement of April 29th. He also said: 1) ADA Pay may be ready in early May or maybe even late April; 2) there will be a big launch for ADA Pay and once the Africa Special airs “everything will connect”; 3) “people are probably not getting how big this is….but you will down the line”; 4) COTI integration with a major exchange is happening, progress is not as quick as they would like, but it’s progressing; 5) last week they released the possible designs for debit cards, they are even considering some designs submitted by the community; 6) and iOS and Android integration is coming along nicely and well on the way. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EorsiQfEV7o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EorsiQfEV7o)
23. For a little more background on the work going on between COTI and Cardano, check out these links.

24. It looks like Yellow Card and Payway are listed on the Africa Special website. Given their business models, it is easy to guess that they could be valuable in the Pan Africa Strategy. [https://payway.et/](https://payway.et/) [https://yellowcard.io/](https://yellowcard.io/)
25. Partnership with World Mobile in Tanzania. Credit to Reddit user [/u/ricklepicklemydickle](https://www.reddit.com/u/ricklepicklemydickle/) for originally finding this one.

26. Recap from yesterday: the Africa Special Announcements revealed some additional puzzle pieces 1) COTI’s AdaPay is possibly the larger payments infrastructure puzzle piece, 2) [payway.et](https://payway.et/) is possibly the local payments puzzle piece, 3) [yellowcard.io](https://yellowcard.io/) is possibly the local coin exchange puzzle piece, and 4) World Mobile (not mentioned at [africa.cardano.org](https://africa.cardano.org/) AFAIK) may be the network connectivity puzzle piece. I think they are going to connect a lot of disparate pieces for us on the 29th.
27. Once again we are the champions! Not just of github commits this time, but also of total staked asset value. [https://www.stakingrewards.com/](https://www.stakingrewards.com/)
28. Rick interviewed CardStarter which is a Cardano accelerator. The interesting items are 1) it appears they are purporting to somehow insure their community backers against certain financial losses with caveats, 2) they plan to fund projects prior to token launch through token vouchers, and 3) it sounds like they are building a DEX called Card Swap. Notice that the “insurance” comes with caveats. They were very transparent on that point and people should take notice. Is CardStarter good? Is it bad? I have no idea. Watch the interview and form your own opinion. [https://youtu.be/nIklWKtr\_aY](https://youtu.be/nIklWKtr_aY) [https://cardstarter.io/](https://cardstarter.io/)
29. The Cardano Foundation has adjusted its delegation strategy. This brings up a question: where does the balance lie between allowing Adam Smith’s hidden hand to work its free market magic and trying to help small pools? [https://forum.cardano.org/t/the-cardano-foundation-s-delegation-methodology-is-changing/58465](https://forum.cardano.org/t/the-cardano-foundation-s-delegation-methodology-is-changing/58465)
30. More details on what the COTI/Cardano partnership will actually look like. Also COTI’s Trust Chain runs on a DAG. It’s probably high time we all understand WTF a DAG is.

31. We’ve had really good reporting from the community on World Mobile developments with Cardano. I just want to take a second to thank you guys. Reddit user [/u/ricklepicklemydickle](https://www.reddit.com/user/ricklepicklemydickle/) first alerted us to the World Mobile developments and then youtube user [Whiskey 1234](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyBeEq-paultoA127TYcDjQ) (love both usernames btw) let us know that he attended a conference where he encountered World Mobile and “asked them if they knew about Cardano blockchain and the reply was they were announcing partners at the end of this month.” Thank you very much for this intel guys.This is what Army of Spies is all about. Many thanks for your contributions, gentlemen.
32. Alko Sumatra Kopi is going to export 100 tonnes of coffee from Sumatra to China and track it all farm to cup using Emurgo Trace! We reported previously on the engagement of Emurgo Trace here and now it’s being put into action.

33. In Charles’s recent AMA, he mentioned that the Africa Special will be a Pan African event and they WILL talk about various deals they have in multiple countries. So, this tells us they do have multiple deals in multiple countries. That was a little unclear previously. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mP0JSgf9CU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mP0JSgf9CU)

35. The number of defi projects that have announced plans to be on Cardano just keeps climbing with [Yayswap.io](https://yayswap.io/) joining the list of Liqwid, Occam, and CardSwap/CardStarter.
36. Kraken publishes a “What is Cardano?” article. Says “...Cardano may not promise new ground-breaking features..” Oh yeah? What about native tokens that don’t require smart contracts? What about the EUTXO model allowing predictable and accurate local calculation of transaction fees in your wallet before you execute? What about a consensus algorithm that’s so good, another top 10 coin made their system derivative of it? That’s all standard these days?

40. In today’s video, we’re also going to go much deeper on how the COTI DAG works. But, don’t worry at all you’ll totally understand it when we’re done.
41. Binance Smart Chain has already laid out a very compelling argument that we’re going to CRUSH Ethereum. [https://twitter.com/TheADAApe/status/1386583952668958720](https://twitter.com/TheADAApe/status/1386583952668958720)
42. Charles does a big interview with Forbes and points out the huge differences between a bonded staking system (ETH) and a liquid staking system (Cardano). This is highly overlooked. [https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenehrlich/2021/04/26/cardano-and-ethereum-founder-analyzes-the-newest-evolutions-in-crypto-and--blockchain-technology/?sh=6acb258e3e52](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenehrlich/2021/04/26/cardano-and-ethereum-founder-analyzes-the-newest-evolutions-in-crypto-and--blockchain-technology/?sh=6acb258e3e52)
43. Charles also covers his projections about interoperability and the future converging on a “wifi moment” when an interoperable “internet of blockchains” emerges. In this future, it will be a race to the bottom and the systems that are too expensive to operate will simply be priced out of the game.
44. New Africa Special Trailer dropped. The narrator: “We are partnering with African governments…” That was PLURAL governments, guys! This is getting exciting. [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1386772333902319618](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1386772333902319618)
45. The Africa Bird lands a few days early!!!!!!!! It’s a deal with the Ethiopian Ministry of Education to provide a Cardano ID solution and unified records system for 5 million Ethiopian students. Charles says there will be more news tomorrow at the Africa Special.[ https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/27/business/dealbook/tesla-earnings-bitcoin.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/27/business/dealbook/tesla-earnings-bitcoin.html).[ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOTRp3PQKVk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOTRp3PQKVk).[ https://twitter.com/IOHKMedia/status/1387051830442553351](https://twitter.com/IOHKMedia/status/1387051830442553351)[ https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/27/blockchain-finally-comes-of-age-with-worlds-biggest-blockchain-deployment/](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/27/blockchain-finally-comes-of-age-with-worlds-biggest-blockchain-deployment/)[ https://www.cityam.com/ethiopia-overhauls-its-education-system-with-iohk-blockchain-partnership/](https://www.cityam.com/ethiopia-overhauls-its-education-system-with-iohk-blockchain-partnership/)
46. We’re getting reports from Army of Spies member /u/[ ricklepicklemydickle](https://www.reddit.com/user/ricklepicklemydickle) that World Mobile is reporting in its telegram group that it will be dropping some news tomorrow!
47. A new Cardano metrics platform has launched [https://cardanowaves.com/](https://cardanowaves.com/)
48. Today is the Cardano Africa Special. It’ll be at 9:30am Pacific, 10:30am Mountain, 12:30pm Eastern, 5:30pm Dublin, 7:30pm Addis Ababa, 11:30pm Bangkok. 1:30amTokyo. Go enjoy! We’ll recap it after.
49. In today’s video we also cover questions about the relationship between Atala Prism and ADA and who will actually benefit from the Cardano Projects with African governments.
50. The Africa Special made it clear that Cardano has a brilliant grand strategy for the developing world. As framed by John O’Connor this would be: 1) provide digital identity; 2) provide digital transfer of value; and 3) provide programmability of that digital value.
51. Mickey Watkins (CEO of World Mobile) added a step zero to the formula above with: 0) provide access to the digital world.
52. As has previously been mentioned, it was officially announced that Cardano is partnered with World Mobile to provide digital connectivity to people in the developing world starting in Tanzania. They plan to have 100k subscribers in Zanzibar by the end of the year.
53. This is just the beginning in Africa. John O’Connor had a nice tweet that very succinctly laid out some future plans. [https://twitter.com/jjtoconnor/status/1387919060197855234](https://twitter.com/jjtoconnor/status/1387919060197855234)
54. Coindesk editor refuses to acknowledge that Cardano has a deal with a national government, gets relentlessly trolled, then finally capitulates and decides to cover the Ethiopian Ministry of Education project. [https://twitter.com/zackseward/status/1387744629693599744 ](https://twitter.com/zackseward/status/1387744629693599744)[https://twitter.com/HukAleksandra/status/1387788814022844421](https://twitter.com/HukAleksandra/status/1387788814022844421) [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1387937546978545667](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1387937546978545667) [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1387939251275198466](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1387939251275198466) [https://twitter.com/Cshuggin/status/1387986678741151745](https://twitter.com/Cshuggin/status/1387986678741151745) [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1388113533435482115](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1388113533435482115) [https://twitter.com/CoinDesk/status/1388192121006534657](https://twitter.com/CoinDesk/status/1388192121006534657)
55. The Cardano Africa Mini addition gives us more details on the actual rollout of the Ethiopia Ministry of Education deal: 1) all 700k teachers and a subset of the students who will get tablets will be registered in the first year; 2) all secondary school students will be registered in the second year which will bring us to 5MM students; and 3) the data will be used to analyze both students and teachers.

56. If you don’t believe that Atala runs on Cardano please watch this video which lays out definitely and exactly how Atala runs on Cardano. Please feel free to wantonly debunk anyone on the interwebs who says otherwise. Thank you to IOHK technical architect Alexis Hernandez for this video! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AbgzvOeb6w&amp;t=31s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AbgzvOeb6w&amp;t=31s)
57. I don’t know if everyone watched the last few minutes of the Africa Special. But, I think a lot of people missed the section where John O’Connor said the goal of Cardano in Africa is to issue 100 MILLION digital identities in the next two years. To give you some idea of scale here, adapools.org shows a highest ever daily number of new wallets at around 71k. If we onboard 100 Million people via digital identity over two years that would be 136,986 people per day. ETH only has 150MM unique wallets to date. [https://youtu.be/yRjj662kJsk?t=8615](https://youtu.be/yRjj662kJsk?t=8615) [https://adapools.org/analysis-query/wallets](https://adapools.org/analysis-query/wallets) [https://etherscan.io/chart/address](https://etherscan.io/chart/address)
58. John also mentioned that all of the 100k subscribers to World Mobile in Zanzibar this year will have digital identities on Atala Prism. They will also be offering so-called “RealFi” loans by Q1 of next year that will be made via Cardano liquidity and will act as a bridge to real world value. [https://youtu.be/yRjj662kJsk?t=8628](https://youtu.be/yRjj662kJsk?t=8628)
59. Charlie Munger thinks crypto is “disgusting”. That’s a wonderful thing because it tells you how early you are. This is especially true in Cardano which is a project that leads with empathy for the developing world. Will he still call that disgusting if we’ve brought financial inclusiveness to an entire continent in five or ten years. Probably he won’t say anything because he won’t have lived that long. But, you get the point.

60. The state authorities in Wyoming are so far ahead of the curve it’s scary. Now they’re putting aside $4 million for staking. On the private side, Caitlin Long should be declared a state treasure for making a lot of this happen. [https://twitter.com/Cardanians\_io/status/1388756653311414272](https://twitter.com/Cardanians_io/status/1388756653311414272) [https://decrypt.co/69390/university-wyoming-generate-revenue-crypto-staking](https://decrypt.co/69390/university-wyoming-generate-revenue-crypto-staking)
61. I will be in a tent in a beautiful place where there will be very limited internet access. So, no text format Cardano Rumor Rundown until Saturday. The youtube version has been pre-recorded and is scheduled to come out on the normal daily schedule: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWnSP49DJf-G9E0VfqDdBCA](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWnSP49DJf-G9E0VfqDdBCA).
62. There is supposed to be some kind of mid-month update on Plutus. Charles hinted in a recent update that everything is going really well on that front. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=786mOp2Xq7s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=786mOp2Xq7s)
63. There will be an update on Mithril at the end of the month. You will remember from previous coverage that Mithril is a means to create trustless light wallets via recursive snarks similar to Mina. ZK-SNARK = zero knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=786mOp2Xq7s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=786mOp2Xq7s)
64. Charles is setting aside $9MM to be shared by two research labs to be set up: one at University of Edinburgh and one at an undisclosed institution. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=786mOp2Xq7s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=786mOp2Xq7s)
65. Doge Mania might be hitting a new peak (as a cultural artifact at least) tonight with Elon’s appearance on SNL. There are many different perspectives you can take on how this might impact ADA. I find the following two the most interesting: 1) if the Doge pump is followed by an inevitable crash it could sour a giant group of new adopters on crypto; or 2) it might be a gateway drug that will turn a large group of new adopters on to better projects. [https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1390774840135766019](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1390774840135766019)

70. ADA is the most crypto of all cryptos. George of CryptosRUs pointed out in a recent video that he couldn’t find any trace of a VC firm owning Cardano in its portfolio in his search of the categories section on CMC. This makes sense if you know Cardano. Would freedom and decentralization loving Satoshi not throw up a little in his mouth to find out that VC ownership of cryptos was a metric people would care about in 2021? The lack of VC stake in the very decentralized and freedom loving Cardano only adds to our already iron-clad claim on the mantle of the most crypto of all crypto projects. Our ecosystem never sought to attract VC money that would only centralize ownership in a smaller number of hands. This doesn’t even address the current extreme centralization of block validation in BTC and ETH.

72. Cardano saw a new challenger enter the scene with Internet Computer (ICP) debuting very high on the CoinMarketCap charts. However, a look into ICP makes one question whether they are really in the Gen. 3 Blockchain race at all given that available information indicates the blockchain runs via datacenters hosting standardized hardware and that those datacenters can only join the network with the permission of the “Network Nervous System”. You could say that the winner of the Gen. 3 Blockchain race needs to solve the blockchain trilemma of decentralization, security, and scalability. If that’s true, then it’s arguable that ICP is not even competing in the decentralization leg of the race. [https://youtu.be/zHl-oVPoX88?t=97](https://youtu.be/zHl-oVPoX88?t=97)

personalfinance,Investment loans,"Hey guys, 

Posting for my dad here. A little background, we have 12 properties around south FL, a mix of condos, single family homes, and townhomes. 

He saw an ad from an institution that would allow you to take out a loan and use only your properties as collateral, without having to take your 2019/2020 income into consideration. Of course, this loan would come at a higher interest rate than a regular loan. He thinks a regular loan is not possible since COVID has significantly affected his income in this past year, though he still makes a decent sum with the rent payments from the properties. 

So the question is, does anyone know of any institutions that will grant investment loans and would be more lenient given that we’re using the properties as collateral? 

Sorry if I’m not being clear, I’m just being exposed to the real estate and property industry. Please ask any questions if I have to clarify something. Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Who has an auto account with Santander Consumer and satisfied? Or are you like me❓,"In this last year I have had an awakening about how used and abused I was and still currently being abused by this company. Yes I recognize that this company's ratings are horrible. Things I wish I knew three years prior..
I am a single mother, who works like most, due to my separation my credit took a decline, building it back up to where it needed to be I went and purchased a car, because the dinosaur I had prior was on its last leg, just started a new job so I felt I could foot the bill. Needless to say Santander purchased my loan, $518 a month, thought that was a bit steep but okay, let's make these payments. 

I called to set up my account, this was new to me, my ex was a firm believer in NO CAR PAYMENTS, buy it out right. In the call I found out there was to be a 10 day grace period, I thought that was cool just in case my paycheck fell on an off week I would have plenty of time. 

Years have went past and I have paid $16,000 towards my loan, I get interest will always be a factor, but about $11,000 has went towards interest. This seems like a miss some where right, no according to Santander those 10 days, your interest won't stop, slow down nothing, looking at my payments, there were ontime payments that only $46 went to the principal balance. I may not know a lot about finance but this seemed off. So looked up Santander Consumer on a Google search, found that they have been sued a lot. I wanted to know why, as someone who is getting financially screwed by this company. 

I found that this company was being sued by 34 freaking states. So at this point I was invested, I have read every single complaint that was brought to court to understand what was going on. I was baffled. Reading these cases made me dig out my paperwork, I also called the dealership and ask that they sent me my documents they had. My eyes were opened... Holy crap! There were two forms in my documents that the dealership provided that I did not have in my records, it was a decision form that had an area called stipulations and an area for someone to write in the stipulations, the person could not spell but that's neither here nor there but the stipulations was how much they were allowed to charge me upfront and how much they were allowed to charge in the backend, these may be normal but it's not, because thats why Santander was being sued, continue to read and get your documents out. 

I'm thinking I need an attorney. 

In a typical auto-financing transaction, car dealers attempt to maximize the profits they earn on the front-end and back-end of an individual deal. The front-end of a transaction involves the negotiation of a sales price, whereas the back-end refers to the negotiation of ancillary products included as part of the financing of the purchase of the vehicle. 

Even when acting as an indirect auto lender by purchasing installment contracts from dealers, Santander has significant control over the extension of credit or financing of a transaction, including the “back-end” of a transaction, such as whether to purchase a contract that includes guaranteed-asset protection (“GAP”) insurance, a GAP waiver and/or a service contract. 

As part of my auto finance through Santander, I was told I had to have two different service contracts that included Wrap OEMO/CPO, which increased  my over all loan and amount of my interest rate and my monthly payment.
Increasing my interest rate 2% more than stated on the decision.

 Through its credit policies, Santander asserts control over the amount dealers can include in the back-end.  The generous allowances for dealers on the back-end have facilitated Santander obtaining more market share, but those same large back-end charges expose consumers to increased risk in at least two ways: 1) significant back-end charges increase the overall amount financed, which increases the loan-to-value ratio on the loan; and 2) high finance costs increase either the consumer’s monthly principal-to-interest ratio or increase the term of the loan. Santander is aware that these loan features contribute to deteriorating loan quality but continues to make these loans or purchase the underlying installment contracts.  Santander’s aggressive pursuit of market share led it to underestimate risk associated with loans with stated income and expenses.  
Although Santander has sophisticated models that forecast consumer default, Santander’s policies with respect to stated income and expenses allow it to underestimate default risk in important ways and to purchase loans from consumers who are unlikely to be able to pay for their loans. Santander also fails to meaningfully monitor dealer behavior such as receiving falsified information, including the amounts specified for consumers’ income and expenses.  One area where Santander’s lack of verification as part of its underwriting, such as proof of employment, proof of mortgage, just showing your monthly pti. Only my backend PTI was accounted for, which would be my insurance payment on the car I had prior, being only $133 per month (getting a new sedan doubled my monthly insurance) and the car note that Santander assigned to me in the amount of $518 totaling $651 per month, only putting my DTI at 24.1% which was not accurate. My DTI was over 45% percent at the time of this loan agreement, my pti did not include My payments to Santander. 
So does anyone else think I need an attorney? And are you satisfied with your loan with Santander, are they screwing you like they are me? My state was one of the ones that did not join the Multistate lawsuit and I am trying to get them to start their own. 
Professional advice please, be kind 😊",finance

Bitcoin,What you're seeing happen in China is the result of when a virus (China's evil CCP) reacts to a threat to it's existence (Bitcoin enabling people liberty and a mechanism to opt out). I will HODL stronger than ever now that I see that what we're doing is changing the world for the better.,"Greetings fellow HODLers. I'm no expert here, but anybody who has at least become somewhat familiar with Bitcoin knows that the inevitable global adoption of it means governments like China's CCP (yes, the USA, and EU as well) could lose the control that they are quite comfortable with keeping. These governments control/manipulate their own money supplies at our expense and use it to control their societies, fund wars and endless expansions of territory, kill the planet, and encouraging some of the worst human behaviors.

I HODL to bring order back to civilization. Things have gone on like this for far too long, and for once in human history, we all have the ability to put government control (through monetary policy) in check. If we all reject their currencies and make Bitcoin the people's currency of the planet, they can't build bombs like they do now, they can't use and destroy all our children's resources, and we can SHRINK the global governments down to their bare necessities of keeping basic order without demanding complete control.

I don't care if BTC went to $0 tomorrow, it is no longer about that for me. I want a future where the people are in control of our future and our planet has a fighting chance.

personalfinance,What would be the best way to go about paying off my debt? I grew up in poverty and have no one in real life who is knowledgeable about this type of thing,"Hi everyone,

Please tell me if this kind of question doesn't belong here!

My partner and I currently owe about $13,000 across two credit cards at 21% interest and 24% interest (from supporting myself through school :/), and about $8000 on two cars with 14% interest. I recently graduated, and will need to begin paying student loans in November. For those, I owe $38,000 at different interest rates from 2.75% to 5%. We also have a mortgage, but paying that off any extra than the monthly payment is not a huge interest until we pay off our other debt. The interest rate on the house is great and the payments are more manageable than when we were renting, so I am happy with the house as it is for now.

Our bills each month are about $3,500 (this is excluding the minimum payment due on the credit cards). Combined, after taxes, we make about $72,000.

What would be the best way to pay off these debts as fast as possible? I was thinking about getting a personal loan so I can consolidate the two credit cards, but I'm not sure if that's something that is a good idea or not. My goal is to have the credit cards and cars paid off within three years, and the student loans in 8-10. Is this possible? Have I completely screwed myself?",finance

CryptoCurrency,Six Crypto Categories for Your Research,"As it happens, it's a red candle day.  I like to use these days to research why I'm into crypto in the first place.  I can only handle so much doom and gloom.  Everybody approaches their journey in crypto differently, but I thought I'd share the way I organize my crypto research, in case it may be useful to anyone.  None of this is proprietary or original to me, and I don't claim it to be.  Also, everything in here is, of course, just my personal opinion.  So with that out of the way, let's dig into six crypto categories.  I've saved the most interesting stuff for the end.

# 1. Bitcoin &amp; Bitcoin-Related Projects

Bitcoin is big enough that it warrants its own category.  If you're in the crypto space and you're ignoring Bitcoin altogether, you're probably making a mistake.  Bitcoin is building the bridges and roads to hedge funds, sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies, and so forth.  ETFs!  You may not care about that, but if there's a future where any project goes the distance to a $2 trillion to $10 trillion to a market cap beyond that,  it's likely going to be traveling along those roads and bridges forged by Bitcoin.  I believe it belongs in any crypto portfolio and it's worth taking a look at layer two solutions and any projects that tie-in to Bitcoin.

# 2. The Shitcoiniverse

This is your Doge, your Shiba Inu, your Safemoon.  These are often scams or rug-pulls.  Sometimes they're not a scam, but just dumb-by-design.  I know whenever I mention these people want to tell me about their incredible gains in this area.  That's great.  Good for you.  I stay away from these, because they are basically just gambling, in my opinion.  And again, nothing wrong with gambling, it's just not why I'm here.  (For that, I prefer an actual casino for the free drinks.)

# 3.  DeFi: Crypto's First ""Killer App""

This is where things start to get more interesting.  Some background:  when I was a kid (1980s), my father got me a bank account to put in money I earned from a summer job.  He showed me that I could get 10% interest if I didn't spend it.  (Yes, 10% interest, from a bank!  80's were wild.)  The addiction to yield stuck with me, as did a growing appreciation for the power of compound interest.  But by the time I was old enough to really earn, the banks were basically no longer playing the game.  I started chasing yield back in the early 2000s (ING Direct was great once), but interest rates just kept going down and down.  Nowadays, everyone outside the crypto space is conditioned to believe high interest rates are impossible.  And along comes DeFi.  The next bear market will be different, in part, because DeFi will be there for it, encouraging hodlers.

# 4.  Decentralized Web

The projects in this category are ""not ready for primetime"" yet, but they are the future.  The idea here is that all the functionality we get out of centralized services on the web will be moved to decentralized versions.  Social networks, cloud storage, messaging, you name it.  You don't have to hate the centralized versions that exist today (\*cough\* Facebook) to see why there's utility in decentralized versions.  Let's use decentralized cloud storage as an example:  What happens to old drives we're not using anymore these days?  (Most likely answer is the trash.)  That's a wasted resource.  Better would be to throw it into file storage ""mining"" (aka, proof of space-time) and earn a piece of the decentralized ""Dropbox"" for your trouble.  Maybe you'll use those tokens later when you want more cloud storage, or maybe you'll swap them for something else.

# 5.  Privacy Coins

In some sense, ""privacy coins"" is a conceptual overlap with all the other categories, but in practice, these days, it's mostly its own category.  Crypto has a growing privacy problem.   And privacy matters.    Maybe you disagree.  Maybe you're in the ""if you're not doing anything wrong, you should have nothing to hide,"" but surely you don't believe when someone closes the stall door in a public restroom, it means they're committing a crime.   Personal opinion,  privacy is one of the most important human rights of the modern age, and most crypto puts it at risk.  If we're going to shift to a digital-asset economy, we need protections against the public knowing every transaction you make and your worth down to the sat.  Anyway, there's a lot of work in this area, a lot of interesting projects that sit on-top non-private crypto, and crypto that is inherently private (e.g., Monero, ZCash).

# 6.  The Metaverse

This is, frankly, my favorite category.  We had our DeFi Summer of 2020 leading us into a bull market.  I believe the next bear market will end, and the following bull market begin, with the Metaverse driving the market.  So what's the metaverse?  If you still think of NFTs as being limited to overpriced gifs, you're missing the big picture of where this is going.  To give you an idea, I'm going to use the example of Gods Unchained, a crypto game that I've been enjoying lately.  Gods Unchained is basically a knock-off of Hearthstone or Magic the Gathering.  It plays very similarly.  You collect cards and you play matches against people.  The twist with Gods Unchained is that your cards are NFTs--they exist on the blockchain--so they can be traded, bought, and sold outside the game.  The idea isn't limited to collectible cards in games.  It can be in-game guns, skins, powers, achievements, there's just a huge number of ways to use the idea, and they're coming.   We're looking at a future where the rare skin you earned in Fortnight can be traded on-chain for a rare skin in pubg.  

I mentioned that I believe metaverse will take us out of the bear into the next bull market (circa 2024).  Integrating these kinds of concepts into games takes time, but it's in the works now.  Even in the darkest scenario bear market, a scenario where people hate on crypto as a failed and dead experiment, games are going to be introducing these features.  Not because they're trying to make a speculative run on their in-game assets, but because it's a cool feature for gamers.  ""Hey that cool sword I unlocked in Diablo IV is actually mine!  Not just in the game, but I can trade it with my phone.  I don't even have to log into the game.  I can even trade it with a stranger for a car in GTA, even though they're separate companies.""  That dynamic will sneak up on us and it will mean revenue to the underlying protocols.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,W4 Questions on how to reduce withholdings,"Help! So the wife and I are getting ready to purchase a home, and and as I understand we can essentially reduce my federal tax withholdings by updating my W4 with my employer to free up some extra funds to help pay mortgage since we always get a pretty hefty federal refund at the end of each year of about $7k-$9k just taking the standard deduction (we rent now and don't have much to itemize). I just essentially want to get an extra $500 a month coming back to me which is $6k a year. Was hoping it would be as easy as putting that amount in a W4, but I'm looking at the form and all the calculation entries and just thinking, what is the easiest way to do this?  I am guestimating itemized decuction entries for mortgage interest, property taxes, and moving expenses and since we would be making this change mid-year, that amount isn't adding up to be more than the standard deduction. It appears that if you take the standard then you can't request to have your withholdings reduced??? Or am I missing something. If so, could I essentially fill up and pad my estimated itemized deductions higher so they exceed the standard? I just wish I could enter an amount and be done with it, but appears whatever you turn in on your W4 then has some payroll/IRS calculation factored into it and they generate the amount to reduce their withholdings.  Sorry...I hope that all makes sense.",finance
CryptoCurrency,Is there a way we can ban/limit posts about price action or speculation on this sub?,"Kind of how we used to limit memes to only weekends. I try to avoid crypto specific subs because most seem to be echo chambers that shill the coin and focus too much on price action and speculation. I used to come to this sub because even though there was still shilling and speculation, you’d still get a fairly decent amount of news/development posts for most projects in one place and have somewhat of a discourse about each one. But the last few weeks I feel like 95% of posts are about the crash/non crash, hodl, sell, diamond hands, paper hands and anything else related to price volatility. 

And I don’t mean to come off as a dick and probably will get downvoted, but I couldn’t  give 2 shits about how long you’ve been in the game or how much money you’ve made or lost, whether your buying or holding or what you think is going to happen next. I just want a place where I can come to and get news and updates on the space as a whole. I understand people have a lot a skin in the game and are emotional with their crypto but man, I have been avoiding this sub the last few weeks because It has gotten ridiculous. 

I don’t even really mind people talking about price action and all that but it’s been post after post after post of the same shit written in different ways. I’m sure some of that has to do with people just karma whoring for moons but still. I may be in the minority here, but I feel like this sub could benefit a lot if we limit the times people can post stuff like that, if not ban it all together. 

Sorry for the rant. I try to not post here unless I have something to contribute but I just got fed up and felt like I need to get this off my chest. I feel that considering how much this sub has grown over the recent months, we can all benefit from increasing the quality of the content that’s posted.

dogecoin,Ponzi Scheme (definition),"A Ponzi scheme (/ˈpɒnzi/, Italian: [ˈpontsi]; also a Ponzi game)[1] is a form of fraud that lures investors and pays profits to earlier investors with funds from more recent investors.[2] The scheme leads victims to believe that profits are coming from legitimate business activity (e.g., product sales or successful investments), and they remain unaware that other investors are the source of funds. A Ponzi scheme can maintain the illusion of a sustainable business as long as new investors contribute new funds, and as long as most of the investors do not demand full repayment and still believe in the non-existent assets they are purported to own.

Some of the first recorded incidents to meet the modern definition of Ponzi scheme were carried out from 1869 to 1872 by Adele Spitzeder in Germany and by Sarah Howe in the United States in the 1880s through the ""Ladies' Deposit"". Howe offered a solely female clientele an 8% monthly interest rate, and then stole the money that the women had invested. She was eventually discovered and served three years in prison.[3] The Ponzi scheme was also previously described in novels; Charles Dickens' 1844 novel Martin Chuzzlewit and his 1857 novel Little Dorrit both feature such a scheme.[4]

In the 1920s, Charles Ponzi carried out this scheme and became well-known throughout the United States because of the huge amount of money that he took in.[5] His original scheme was based on the legitimate arbitrage of international reply coupons for postage stamps, but he soon began diverting new investors' money to make payments to earlier investors and to himself.[6] Unlike earlier, similar schemes, Ponzi's gained considerable press coverage both within the United States and internationally both while it was being perpetrated and after it collapsed – this notoriety eventually led to the type of scheme being named after him.[7]",cryptocurrency

investing,Invest like the Norwegian Oil Fund,"(Scroll down for tl;dr)

Have you ever heard of the Norwegian State Fund?  No?  Not only is it the largest fund in the world, but it is also considered one of the most cleverly managed.  He has built a huge fortune from virtually nothing through constant, low-risk investing.  His strategy has proven itself over various market cycles and can certainly be a blueprint for private investors.  But how exactly did this come about and what has the fund done right in the past?

The story began in the 1960s when oil was first found off the coast of Norway.  From the beginning, Norwegian politicians made it important that the inhabitants benefit from the wealth of raw materials: not only through sovereignty over mineral resources, but also through jobs.  The oil industry paid really well and pulled the wages of other industries with it.  In the medium term, this meant that inflation rose.

With the first oil price shock, the demand for Norwegian crude oil also fell.  Economic growth collapsed.  At the same time, the amount of foreign currency debt rose.

Norwegian politicians stuck to their long-term perspective.  They no longer wanted to make the Norwegian economy so dependent on oil and they also wanted to avoid the high export surpluses that had been common up until then, because that affected exchange rates and inflation.  That is why they came up with the idea of ​​completely investing the excess payments from oil exports abroad.  Quasi: Oil leaves the country, but the money received for it does not enter the Norwegian economic cycle.

The so-called oil fund came into being in the mid-1990s.  In this state-managed investment fund, the income from Norway's crude oil and natural gas sales is invested, all of the income, not just part of it.  The oil fund invests worldwide, long-term and according to ethical principles.  His goal is to provide for the financial future of all Norwegian residents if the income from oil and gas no longer flows at some point.

While private investors often act from the gut, the oil fund has clear rules and guidelines.  His goal is to invest the money optimally in the long term from a risk-return perspective.  Because the fund is responsible for the financial future of many generations to come.  Anyone can view the investments and results of the oil fund on the Internet at any time.  So there is great transparency.

The Norwegian Oil Fund is a low-risk, profitable investment in the future and can therefore serve as a role model for private investors.

Since 1998 the oil fund has grown to the equivalent of over one trillion euros.  This corresponds to a value of around 190,000 euros per inhabitant.

It's all about the right mix:

Since 1998, the oil fund has achieved an average gross return of a good six percent per year before costs, inflation and taxes.  The income fluctuates depending on the stock market situation: In some years there is even a minus, in others double-digit returns are recorded.  The fund invests very successfully in the long term.  But how exactly does it work?

The steady returns are possible because the oil fund diversifies its investments across different asset classes and across different industries and regions.

The three asset classes in which the oil fund invests are stocks, bonds and real estate.  Stocks fluctuate more than bonds, so they are riskier.  In return, they generate better returns.  Since the oil fund thinks long-term, it overweight equities, currently at around 70 percent.  Real estate is only a small addition.  The rest goes into bonds.  According to modern portfolio theory, those responsible expect the best risk-return ratio from this.  The proportion of stocks in relation to bonds and real estate is regularly checked and adjusted to the target - also known as rebalancing.

For equity investments, the oil fund is based on the FTSE Global All Cap.  This is a stock index that contains around 8,000 stocks from large, medium and small companies around the world.  However, the oil fund deviates somewhat: European stocks, for example, are overweight and US stocks are underweight.  In addition to individual regions, individual industries can also be overweighted or underweighted.  There is also a black list of companies that are not invested in for ethical reasons.  These include, for example, energy suppliers such as Tata Power, companies that partially or exclusively manufacture armaments such as Lockheed Martin, Honeywell International, Airbus, Boeing, or tobacco companies.

When it comes to bond investments, the oil fund has so far invested seventy percent in government bonds and thirty percent in corporate bonds.  However, since a company's stocks and bonds are often closely linked, it was recently decided to only invest in government bonds.

The Norwegian oil fund is therefore based on an optimized mix of asset classes: around two thirds of it consists of stocks, one third of bonds, and some real estate is also mixed in.

The compound interest effect increases the fund's return.  The longer the investment horizon, the more it exploits its advantages.  In the case of the oil fund, income from interest and dividends is now higher than the new deposits.

A look at the oil fund's portfolio:

You've just heard that the oil fund invests in stocks, bonds and real estate.

Let's start with the equity investments.  At the end of 2019, around 71 percent of the fund's assets were invested in stocks.  The focus is on North America, followed by Europe.  Africa brings up the rear with less than one percent.

The focus of equity investments is therefore on large, developed economies.  But stocks from less developed emerging countries, the so-called emerging markets, are also included.  The equity quota here is 11 percent, because the emerging markets promise higher returns in the long term than the established countries, but the risk is also higher.  Smaller companies are also overweighted because, similar to emerging market stocks, they generate more returns on average.

At the end of 2019, around 26 percent of the fund's assets were invested in bonds.  A little more than half of them were government bonds.  Similar to stocks, bonds focus on North America and Europe.  But other countries and currencies are also mixed in, for example bonds in Japanese yen, Mexican peso or Brazilian real have been taken out.  The share of emerging markets is nine percent.

The remaining 43 percent are currently corporate bonds and covered bonds such as Pfandbriefe or similarly secured bonds.  However, as I said, the portfolio of corporate bonds is to be reduced in the future in favor of government bonds.

The creditworthiness, i.e. the creditworthiness of the bond debtors, is consistently high: only two percent of the bonds fall into the speculative area.

The third asset class that the oil fund invests in is real estate.  At the end of 2019, the volume invested in real estate was just under three percent.  Here the fund concentrates on office, logistics and retail properties in top cities such as New York, London, Paris and Munich.

The five principles of the Norwegian investment strategy:

The fund managers of the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund have not come up with a magic formula, but instead follow a series of investment guidelines, guidelines and rules.  We have put together for you the five most important principles of the Norwegian investment strategy.

First, there is the principle of passivity: invest passively and close to the index, which saves time and money.  The less fees you pay, the more income is left for you.

Second, there is diversification: the more you spread your wealth across different asset classes, the lower your risk of loss.  So take some time at the beginning to plan your strategy.  With the right mix of stocks, bonds and possibly real estate, choose an investment mix that suits your available assets and risk appetite.  Diversify within these asset classes according to geographic aspects.  Invest in both developed and developing countries, and by company size.  Overweight both emerging market stocks and smaller company stocks.  This way you can take advantage of opportunities and at the same time distribute your risk better.  About once a year you should restore your target quotas, i.e. rebalance.

Thirdly, we have the long-term investment horizon: Those who invest long-term can take more risks and thus generate a higher return.  Even if you are already retired, you should keep an equity stake.  Buy and hold, that is, buy and leave it alone, is more effective than trying to constantly chase after new trends.

Fourth, you should pay attention to consistency: what oil is to Norway, is your labor to you.  Invest a fixed amount every month, depending on your income, not the market situation.  If you earn more, increase your standing order.  This is also a better way of offsetting inflation.

And fifth, ethics also count: Pay attention to ethically correct, sustainable investments.  Violations of human rights, heavy pollution, arms manufacture, tobacco products or serious corruption are taboo for the oil fund.  For your private consumption, you can go a step further and only buy from companies that manufacture their goods ethically.

In short: invest long-term, regularly, sustainably, also diversified and index-based, and overweight shares of small companies and emerging markets as a return boost.

Build your personal future fund: The three levers for building private wealth

Now that we have taken a close look at the Norwegian oil fund, let's take a very practical look at how you as a private investor can implement the Norwegian strategy.  We take care of the three sub-areas stocks, bonds and real estate in turn.  But first, a few basic ideas about investing.

As already mentioned, there will be around 190,000 euros in the fund for every Norwegian in 2021.  If you want to save such a sum, there are various adjusting screws.

First of all, there is your investment horizon.  Following the Norwegian model, it should be an investment period of at least ten to fifteen years.  Even if you are about to retire, that doesn't mean that you need your money in one fell swoop.  You can pay out a monthly amount from your future fund instead of saving it further, a kind of private supplementary pension.

The second adjustment screw is your monthly savings rate.  How Much Money Can You Save?  Can you reduce fixed costs, do without what is superfluous or consume more consciously in order to invest this money in your future fund?  Do you already have securities or reserves in a call money or savings account?  You can also invest this money in your future fund.  If you earn more, you should increase the savings rate, at least by the rate of inflation.  Conversely, if you become unemployed, for example, you can lower your savings rate.

The third adjustment screw, the return, can only be influenced indirectly, namely through your asset class mix.  In addition to your personal perception of risk, it also depends on your investment horizon.  As a rule of thumb, subtract your age from 100, the sum corresponds to the share quota.  While as a thirty-year-old you invest seventy percent of your money in stocks, as a seventy-year-old you lower your risk with an equity ratio of thirty percent.  Of course, this also reduces the return.

The result, your saved wealth, results from the interaction of these three levers: investment horizon, monthly savings rate and return.

If you want to reach a certain amount, then it is important to start as early as possible.  This is also due to the compound interest effect.  The higher your return and the longer your investment horizon, the less you have to invest monthly.


Build your personal future fund: bonds

Now let's get into the construction kit of your personal future fund.  Our first pillar is bonds.  What can we learn from the Norwegians here?

Although the oil fund also invests worldwide in bonds, we limit ourselves to the most important currencies.  Because of their lower yield, currency fluctuations have a greater impact on bonds.  However, this is not a problem insofar as countries outside the eurozone also issue bonds in euros.

The prices of bonds also fluctuate, depending on the creditworthiness of the issuer, the remaining term and the interest rate level.  The oil fund tries to minimize this risk by only investing in government bonds with a maximum term of ten years.

An ETF savings plan is particularly useful if you are not yet very familiar with the capital market or if you cannot invest a lot of money.  ETFs, short for Exchange Traded Funds, are so-called index funds.  They replicate an index one to one;  this passive structure lowers costs, which in turn increases your return on investment.  You will remember: The oil fund also invests in line with the index.

For a bond quota similar to the Norwegian model, you should have a single ETF with a remaining term of no more than ten years that invests in government bonds that are denominated in euros.  You can find corresponding products on the website justetf.com.  For example the SPDR Bloomberg Barclays 7-10 Year Euro Government Bond ETF (ISIN IE00BYSZ5Z42).  Of course, you can also take ETFs with other maturities or other country focuses outside the euro zone.  Take a close look at the countries and maturities in which the ETF invests.  You can find this information, for example, on finance portals or on the websites of the providers.  The names alone do not always allow conclusions to be drawn about the content.

When it comes to sustainability, bond ETFs don't have much to offer at the moment.  So far there are only a few so-called green bonds.  You could, for example, buy a German government bond directly or a single green bond.  Rebalancing, i.e. aligning with your originally planned mix of assets, is usually easier with ETFs.

For your first fund pillar, the following applies: Government bonds that are denominated in euros and can be spread around the world contribute to stability.

So if you like it simple, you can tick off the bond issue with a single ETF.  It's more complicated with stocks.  For this, the topic of sustainability comes into play more strongly.

Build your personal future fund: stocks

So what can we learn from the Norwegians about stocks?  ETFs are also recommended here, with a maximum of twelve different ones.  The amounts per ETF should not be too small, otherwise this can increase the transaction costs.

The Norwegian Oil Fund invests worldwide, and that is what you should aim for for your equity exposure.  The following breakdown is recommended: 80 percent of industrialized market shares, 80 percent of which in large caps and 20 percent in small caps.  The 80 percent share of industrialized countries is distributed geographically as follows: 44 percent in North America, 44 percent in Europe and 12 percent in Asia and Oceania.  The remaining 20 percent of the equity stake is invested in emerging markets.  However, no further distinction is made here according to company size or region, as the diversification would otherwise be too confusing.

Are you still looking through  With a 70 percent equity component, this means, for example: 28 percent shares large caps North America, 28 percent shares large caps Europe, 8 percent shares large caps Asia and Oceania, 7 percent shares small caps North America, 7 percent shares small caps Europe, 2 percent shares  Small caps Asia and Oceania, 20 percent equities in emerging markets.  With a different share of shares, you can calculate the odds yourself using the above specifications.

For equity ETFs, you should prefer replicating over synthetic ones.  Replicating ETFs actually buy the share packages that are available in the fund, weighted according to the index, while synthetic ETFs artificially replicate the index via swap transactions.

On justetf.com you can filter funds by country, company size and all sorts of other criteria in order to replicate your future fund based on the Norwegian model.  You are of course flexible with the number of ETFs, but with seven you can map the Norwegian portfolio quite well.  If you are still at the very beginning of your future fund, you can first approach the optimal composition with fewer ETFs.  For industrialized countries, for example, you could use the UBS MSCI World SRI (ISIN LU0629459743) and for emerging markets the iShares MSCI EM SRI (ISIN IE00BYVJRP78).

In the two ETFs mentioned, ethical and moral aspects are taken into account, as you can usually see from the abbreviations SRI for socially responsible investment or ESG for environmental social governance.  Sometimes the providers work with negative lists, sometimes they pursue a best-in-class approach.  The latter means that they only invest in the most exemplary companies in an industry, such as the oil giant Total.  The approaches are not yet perfect, but they are still an important step towards sustainable investing.

Globally diversified stocks should make up the main part of your future fund; their higher returns mean that currency fluctuations are less significant in the long term.

We have now ticked off the two most important asset classes, stocks and bonds.  The question of adding real estate remains.

Build your personal future fund: real estate

The third pillar makes it a little more difficult for us.  That is why we do not start with the question of how, but start much more fundamentally with the question: real estate, yes or no?

Why?  Well, the oil fund invests a maximum of seven percent of its assets in directly held commercial real estate in prime locations.  As a private investor, you can forget that.  Even if you want to implement the real estate quota in the form of owner-occupied residential property, you would have to be a multiple millionaire to catch up with the oil fund.

Basically, you should clarify for yourself whether you want to have a property you use yourself or not.  If your answer is yes, forget about the strategic real estate quota.  Just be aware that the money you put into a property cannot be invested in your future fund at the same time.  Think not only of possible increases in the value of your property, but also of ancillary purchase costs, maintenance costs and mortgage interest.  You will only know afterwards what you will use to generate a better return, the property or your future fund.

Alternatively, you can invest smaller amounts in real estate using real estate ETFs or REITs.  The latter is short for Real Estate Investment Trust, which are public companies that earn their money with real estate.  The specialty of REITs is that they distribute a large part of their profits.  As with other investments, you should reinvest this income in order to use the compound interest effect for you.  An example of a real estate ETF with a focus on “industrialized countries” is the iShares Developed Markets Property Yield ETF (ISIN IE00B1FZS350).

To put it in a nutshell: real estate is immobile.  Therefore, think carefully about whether and in what form real estate should be part of your future fund.

Okay, did you understand?  Then get started: Open an online account, set up a savings plan that corresponds to your desired risk-return mix, and make sure to rebalance at least once a year.  Then you too can get rich like Norway.


Too long, didn’t read:

Let's sum it up again: The Norwegian Oil Fund is investing its money in the future.  It only uses stocks, bonds and, to a small extent, real estate.  Its success is based on an optimal risk-return mix, low costs, a long-term perspective and the consideration of sustainability.  The fund is completely transparent: both its strategy and its individual investments can be viewed on the Internet.

This is exactly what you can take advantage of as a private investor.  In order to put together your personal future fund based on the Norwegian model, first decide on the mix of assets that is right for you.  Then find suitable ETFs and set up a monthly savings plan.  With a long-term investment horizon and annual rebalancing, your returns should ultimately be as successful as Norway’s oil.",finance
stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, May 21, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, May 21, 2021**

Stocks traded mixed today, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) declining modestly after yesterday’s rally. It’s encouraging to see the market holding on to yesterday’s gains following the volatility experienced in recent weeks. It seems overall market sentiment is improving following a surge in inflationary fears after the release of the April Consumer Price Index. The SPY closed 0.08% down, the QQQ closed 0.56% down, and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.36% up.

Markets have recently been shaken by the prospect that a rise in inflation may prompt the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. However, as has been reiterated in the recap before, there are several reasons why a change in monetary policy seems very unlikely. In the Federal Reserve’s April meeting minutes, “participants generally noted that the economy remained far from the Committee’s maximum-employment and price-stability goals”.  Jerome Powell and other monetary officials have reiterated several times that they want to see a “string” of strong labor reports before major adjustments to policy are considered. The April Job Reports showed only 266,000 jobs added back to the economy, widely missing analyst expectations and marking a sharp deceleration in job growth from March, bolsters that argument.

As the US economy reopens, we are seeing a surge in consumer spending (we saw a 10.8% increase in spending in March), supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand, which of course, causes a rise in prices. As the economic reopening continues and supply in various consumer industries is able to catch up, inflation is expected to slow down. In a nutshell, this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures “transitory”.

On a slightly sour note, the meeting minutes also noted “a number of participants suggested” that as the economy continues to quickly, “it might be appropriate at some point in upcoming meetings to begin discussing a plan for adjusting the pace of asset purchase”, which have currently been going at a rate of $120 billion per month. However, this is not a surprising statement and one Powell himself has said before. Back in an April 14 meeting, Powell said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.” As a reminder, quantitative easing is a process in which the Fed buys government bonds in order to inject money into the economy. It is only natural that as the economy recovers, less money needs to be injected into the economy in this manner. The Federal Reserve gave absolutely no signal it was even considering beginning discussion on raising interest rates, which is what market participants are really concerned about.

&gt;Don’t be afraid to get creative. Lots of platforms support lots of formats — NFTs can be much more than things that collect digital dust. Try experimenting with minting code, PDFs, 3D models, even interactive games. Those who push boundaries are often rewarded. Our example is the RMRK2.0 standards — without pushing the boundaries on what NFTs can and should be able to do, we would still be stuck in Ethereum-land with simple collectibles that do nothing. But because we dared to move fast and break things to reach a point of extreme innovation, we succeeded.

**Thank you so much for doing this with us! Before we dig in, our readers would like to get to know you a bit. Can you tell us a bit about your backstory and how you grew up?**

Igrew up in Croatia, a small odd-shaped country in the Mediterranean. I used to be into animation and games as a child, so I became a Flash developer in my adolescence. Best development experience of my life, still. I then moved into web development and later on, as Ethereum came about, into web3 development. The rest is history, I got hooked on blockchain and never left. In whatever free time I find I like to be in VR, or go bouldering, running, or otherwise relax in some way with my wife, daughter, and beagle.

**Is there a particular book, film, or podcast that made a significant impact on you? Can you share a story or explain why it resonated with you so much?**

I only remember Fight Club as the first “high IQ” movie I saw. I was unfamiliar with crazy twists until then. This made me pursue all non-action movies since, and so I’ve built quite a portfolio in my head. Interestingly, while none of this resonated too much with me in terms of impacts, it did drive me into piracy — I collected so many movies people wanted to buy them off me, so I bought a CD burner and started dealing movies no one else had yet in a little country such as Croatia. It was a fun part of my life for sure, one that luckily ended well (with me quitting the venture, and not jail, haha).

**Is there a particular story that inspired you to pursue a career in this new industry? We’d love to hear it.**

Well, even just one single generation ago all the information my parents got was coming from state-sanctioned media: newspapers, TV, radio. With internet, that all changed, but now it’s changing again into censorship and political ideology, not to mention the financial imprisonment where a few institutions get to decide what YOU get to do with YOUR money.

So decentralization, censorship resistance, and the permission-less nature of public blockchains like Ethereum is what drew me to this space. I want to build technology that offers people a choice between total freedom and the safety of institutions.

If someone wants bank insurance but negative interest rates, that’s fine. But if someone wants 50% yearly interest in highly risky ventures, or wants to invest in tokenized real estate across the ocean, they should be able to do that too without having to ask anyone for permission.

**Can you share the most interesting story that happened to you since you began this fascinating career?**

I sold a crypto cat in 2017 for more money than my parents earn together in a year.

This was the craze of CryptoKitties back in 2017 as the first NFT wave hit the blockchain world. The game was so popular it crashed Ethereum at the time — well, not crashed, but increased fees so much it became too expensive to use Ethereum. Fun fact — that wave wasn’t even 10% of what we’re experiencing right now on Ethereum with DeFi, and yet no one seems to mind because there’s so much more we can do on the blockchain than we could back then.

**Can you share a story about the funniest mistake you made when you were first starting? Can you tell us what lesson you learned from that?**

I learned not to day trade against the house by losing a whole bitcoin on Bitmex :) I have no idea when exactly that was, I think around 2017.

I learned about this concept of betting on bitcoin price by betting with bitcoin. I decided to try it out and, of course, I used 100x leverage right off the bat. A few bad calls later I learned my lesson — up until then I had never traded, only invested in ICOs and developed. So this first trading experience made me learn what’s going on here actually, and since then I grew as a trader as well, I think.

It’s a type of expensive mistake everyone has to make before succeeding in this space, there’s just no other way to learn — other people’s mistakes simply do not teach. Not sure why that is, but once you burn yourself you kind of “level up”.

**None of us are able to achieve success without some help along the way. Is there a particular person who you are grateful towards who helped get you to where you are? Can you share a story about that?**

Sure, Ophelie Lechat from [SitePoint.com](http://sitepoint.com/) was my boss when I was editor of the PHP tutorial channel there. I’ve learned a ton from her, and this prepared me for a very fruitful writing and editing career in education — this was the base on which all my work since then rests.

This was a job I had for some 5 years before blockchain, and I was in charge of \~100 authors producing community-sourced tutorial content on this extremely popular technical education website. It took a lot of effort of wrangle all those people, verify their code, and fix their writing, and through guidance from Ophelie I believe I matured from “just a guy a bit higher up the ladder” to “competent lead” at the very least. With her help I also introduced some new concepts like Peer Review into technical writing of community sourced material, something I’ve since taken into two other jobs to form two similar community in a similarly successful way.

**Are you working on any exciting new projects now? How do you think that will help people?**

We have just launched an NFT minting and trading UI on the Kusama blockchain. It’s called Singular, can be found at [singular.rmrk.app](http://singular.rmrk.app/), and it lets anyone mint clean (eco) NFTs for as little as 3 cents, and sell them to others. This is part of a big NFT drive on the Kusama network, and a huge ecosystem expansion plan — our focus is UX optimization so we want to make it all easy to use as possible.

Additionally, the standard will spread out between all the chains that connect to Kusama. Kusama is the chain that’s focused on connecting different blockchains together — like connecting Bitcoin to Ethereum and to Monero. In many ways it’s a tide that rises all boats — and our NFT standards are standards that will go to all those connected chains just through that connection. It’s all very exciting!

**Ok super. Thank you for all that. Let’s now shift to the main focus of our interview. I’m sure you get this question all the time. But for the benefit of our readers, can you explain in your own words what an NFT is, and why people are spending so much money on them?**

An NFT is anything that can be presented in a way that is unique to the observer. So a concert ticket, even if one of many, is special to the concert goer because it’s Theirs, same with art and similar. In layman’s terms, an NFT is quite simply just a database records of you having \*something\* that is not interchangeable with other \*somethings\* of the same type.

It’s important to note that fungibility (interchangeability) is a spectrum. Something that’s fungible to you may not be fungible to me. For example, my cat and your cat are non fungible — we don’t consider them identical. But two same-looking purple swords in a video game might be fungible to me and non fungible to you — you may value looks, in which case it doesn’t matter which one you have, but I may value the sword’s attributes and in that case they are absolutely non fungible to me.

**The NFT industry seems so exciting right now. What are the 3 things in particular that most excite you about the industry? If you can, please share a story or example for each.**

Composeable NFTs are very exciting to me — NFTs owning NFTs to alter visual and functional experiences. NFTs as DAOs also make sense — people democratically governing NFT functionality. And of course, multi-resource NFTs so NFTs can be multiple things at once. We call these Art Legos, and we built them as part of RMRK2.0, so this enables a very exciting use case. Imagine: a big digital billboard in some metaverse VR space, and then this billboard can have its shareholders (DAO) and big brands like Coca Cola and Pepsi can send it the ad they want to display on the billboard. So now the tokenholders of this NFT can decide which ad to show, and the corporations have to pay the tokenholders to vote a certain way. The billboard is an NFT, the land it is placed on is an NFT, and the texture of the ad to display is an NFT. You suddenly have community-governed metaverse real estate!

**What are the 3 things that concern you about the industry? Can you explain? What can be done to address those concerns?**

Lots of people are minting just for the sake of minting and making money, and it’s all kind of losing its appeal due to lack of quality.

I’m also worried about the fees — people are paying too much unnecesarily, when they could be using almost free minting on something like the Kusama blockchain.

Lastly, I don’t think the approach taken by many NFT platforms is long-term healthy — too many rely on centralized servers to host the NFT assets, and so if those companies go bust, the NFTs do too. Missing the point of blockchain, no?

Instead, NFT assets should be hosted on something like IPFS so they can be fetched by any client at any time even if the project stops existing. You wouldn’t like your mona lisa to render a “404 image not found” 5 years after you buy it, right?

**What are the “myths” that you would like to dispel about NFTs? Can you explain what you mean?**

There’s a myth that an NFT is forever because it’s “on the blockchain”. But because many projects and companies rely on third party centralized hosting solutions to keep those assets around, if those central points of failures fail, then the NFTs disappear. Owners of the NFTs are left with an empty husk of what they once purchased. People should instead always check how an NFT is built, and how much of a longevity potential it has.

Another myth is that NFTs are bad for the environment. That’s a very silly gotcha attempted by the anti-NFT crowd, but in fact, those blocks would be mined regardless, and there’s plenty of Proof-of-Stake alternatives which don’t mine at all and thus don’t pollute at all — our platform [singular.rmrk.app](http://singular.rmrk.app/) is built on one such chain so minting a thousand NFTs costs about as much energy as it would take nature to dissolve a breadcrumb.

**What are the most common mistakes you have seen people make when they enter the NFT industry. What can be done to avoid that?**

Minting on Ethereum while gas prices are high, and paying thousands of dollars in fees :) They should wait for low gas prices (hard to do!) or just move to a cheaper platform.

The other mistake is not estimating their value properly — too many people undersell themselves, while others oversell themselves — both base their prices on outliers when they should be following averages and the wisdom of the crowd. In particular, Crypto Twitter is a good measure of current popularity.

**How do you think NFTs have the potential to help society in the future?**

NFTs as irrevocable passes and reputation-cards for access to platforms and protocols or even to track COVID vaccinated people are not far off. But here’s a more interesting case I am passionate about: in 5 years, we’ll all be wearing augmented reality glasses or lenses that have the ability to DELETE advertisements we see around us in the real world. What if you could sell that ad-space as NFTs to corporations and ad agencies you actually agree with, so you only see what you’re interested in?

**Ok, fantastic. Here is the main question of our interview. What are your “5 Things You Need To Know To Create a Highly Successful Career In The NFT Industry?” (Please share a story or example for each.)**

1. As an artist, it’s usually better to be good than plentiful (quality over quantity) but when there’s a crazy bull market, there’s no shame in taking advantage of it. Publish \*everything\*, feel shame later when you’re rich.
2. As a developer, the market has never been more ripe for disruption because it’s all disrupted all the time anyway. Go forth and hack! Build stuff that interacts with existing NFTs and maybe extends their functionality, and fame and fortune are yours. See what we did with RMRK — the Billboard example is a great one: [https://url.rmrk.app/deck](https://url.rmrk.app/deck)
3. If you have an idea about an excellent and highly complex NFT system, get in touch with us at [hello@rmrk.app](mailto:hello@rmrk.app) — our Art Lego system lets you build anything, and if it doesn’t, we’ll change it so it does. Anything is possible, and you’re just one daring and brave idea experiment away from success.
4. Using Ethereum is smart because it has the biggest audience, but don’t be shy about publishing your work on all the available platforms — Tezos is great with Hic et nunc, and Singular on Kusama is amazing (humblebrag). Diversify your portfolio of art platforms just like you do your portfolio of coins!
5. Don’t be afraid to get creative. Lots of platforms support lots of formats — NFTs can be much more than things that collect digital dust. Try experimenting with minting code, PDFs, 3D models, even interactive games. Those who push boundaries are often rewarded. Our example is the RMRK2.0 standards — without pushing the boundaries on what NFTs can and should be able to do, we would still be stuck in Ethereum-land with simple collectibles that do nothing. But because we dared to move fast and break things to reach a point of extreme innovation, we succeeded.

**You are a person of great influence. If you could inspire a movement that would bring the most amount of good to the most amount of people, what would that be? You never know what your idea can trigger. :-)**

Start educating your friends and family about basic financial hygiene — no banks, no loans, no credit, no mortgage. Go cash only, and then crypto. No savings account, save in DeFi. Try to interact with the blockchain world as much as possible, join the parallel economy and exit the tax-infested world of fiat. Unlock the potential of YOUR money without asking anyone for permissions, and you’ll encounter incredible amounts of freedom.

**We are very blessed that very prominent leaders read this column. Is there a person in the world, or in the US with whom you would like to have a private breakfast or lunch, and why? He or she might just see this if we tag them :-)**

I would like to have breakfast with Joe Rogan, just to see what a high-octane steak-breakfast looks like.

CryptoCurrency,"Stay calm, good news is just around the corner","The current bearish news cycle about China and Elon is temporary, like any news cycle. But this is not the end of the bull run. There is too much good news right around the corner. Here’s a snapshot of what’s to come and why it’s worth waiting for:

• This month - Bitcoin network implements the Taproot upgrade, laying the foundation for Bitcoin-native smart contracts and DApps. Expect to be reading about new progress in Bitcoin DeFi in the months and years ahead.

• July 2021 - Ethereum network implements the EIP 1559 upgrade, lowering transaction fees and drastically reducing supply issuance. This very likely creates a supply shock that drives Ethereum price up. Expect massive FOMO before and after this upgrade.

• Latter half of 2021 - ZKRollups and Optimistic Rollups being productized in major Ethereum DApps to drastically reduce transaction fees. Uniswap is already publicly beta testing use of Optimistic. 

• Late 2021 - Institutional adoption news will continue to break and might include Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, updates on Visa’s Ethereum based crypto platform (announced last March), and much more.

• On-going all year - Inflation across the planet driven by pandemic monetary policy that is compelling trillions of dollars of global wealth to clamor for safe haven assets.

There’s a bright future just beyond this minor bump. China’s crackdown on crypto in advance of their launch of Digital Yuan was always expected, and their restriction on mining is great news for Bitcoin, reducing the mining concentration in Sichuan that has long been a concern among Bitcoin critics. As for the Elon sideshow, I’ve always thought the cars that Tesla employees engineer are better than the tweets their boss manufactures. The Bitcoin bull run started before Tesla bought and will continue after.

dogecoin,I Just Recovered 10K+ DOGE From Multidoge and Still HODL'ing!!!,"Long time shibe here. Doge was the reason I made a Reddit account (look at the username). I have always HODL'd Doge, but definitely had more on an old Macbook, but the only thing was Multidoge was outdated af. The blockchain couldn't sync up even back in 2017, when I had last checked, so I ignored it, and didn't think about it until the recent Moon shots. I was able to recover my old wallet from Multidoge, by looking up the wallet.key files, and all without syncing to Blockchain, uploaded my old wallet private keys to [my.blockchain.info](https://my.blockchain.info/).

I couldn't believe my GAWDDAMN eyes, and the old DOGE I bought with LTC was still sitting there. I exported the private keys and in minutes got the DOGE tf outta of Multidoge, and got it up and running on a new wallet. BLESSED SHIBES.

Still, I couldn't have done it without the DOGE community as there were plenty of resources/ SHIBES on this sub that provided detailed step by step instructions, even for my very specific situation of an outdated Macbook PRO (circa 2012), an outdated wallet, and software. The coins were still on the blockchain and was faster to retrieve than my old LTC from Electrum. It was seamless.

Am I going to sell? HELL NO. Of course, I should have looked for my DOGE coin sooner, I but found the laptop on a whim during a move, and just wanted to try to find the dusty DOGE for the hell of it. And well the one thing about DOGE is that there has always been a community of HODLR's who have supported and helped new SHIBES to DOGE coin. You can't say that about a lot of coins, and I have invested in a lot of alt coins in my time. DOGE coin was the single ""ALT"" coin that has provided massive ROI ( I mean I invested into TRX during the 2017 run).

For any new HODLRs, you should understand this community is only growing, and it's definitely becoming more of what BTC could have been before whales started to buy in during every dip. There was always the sense of egalitarianism and giving away coins for the LULZ, but also for charities. I mean, I bought DOGE for [r/dogetipbot](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogetipbot/), which wiped out my initial bag (the developer stole everything), but still I was able to tip my fellow SHIBES on Reddit. It was the first time I actually *used* crypto without transferring to a gift card (how I was using BTC irl). An actual P2P payment that I could never utilize with BTC/LTC during the early days of crypto. I sold some LTC for DOGE for this specific reason, and you may think it's a ""MEME"" coin, but the community, this sub, behind the coin is as solid as any other major coin.

You may have bought in for the hype, and this may be your first dip, but understand if we all HODL we can shelter ourselves from this crypto fallout. I sat on this DOGE wallet for 5 years, and didn't think about it, and still returned 1,000%+ profit. Of course, the future profit margins aren't going to be as substantial, but you can still HODL, and forget about the bag until, like every dip over the past 7 years , there's going to be another spike, and you'll be ready to sell (only some, of course), and not live with the guilt of what if.

I've been in crypto long enough, and witnessed these dips for years. If anything, the worst regrets have been selling off my BTC after the MTGOX collapse, or the time I lost all my LTC after BTC-e was seized by the feds. This is new territory SHIBES and no one - hedge fund managers, crypto Youtubers,  Elon Musk- knows where crypto is heading and it scares them more than anything else. But the one thing you know for sure is you can HODL. Do this for your future self and fellow SHIBES. Even when this MEME coin was a hundredth of a penny, shibes still HODL'd. The spirit, if you can call it that, is still strong with this coin than any other ALT coins. It's not a MEME. It's a new way of what money can provide when massive banks, corporations, hedge funds aren't hoarding capital from the general public. We can all MOON together. It's only a matter of time. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

tl;dr: Found my old DOGE coin wallet, and still HODLing. Think about your future self before panic selling, and didn't reap massive gains.",cryptocurrency

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see from the posted links - the interest that is provided from these savings accounts are a joke, a slap in the face.  Even if a person were to deposit $100K in one of these accounts there is virtually nothing to collect per annum.  

Here is another example of why Defi is favourable over traditional financing.  Bond yields as posted by the Bank of Canada:

&amp;#x200B;

Bank of Canada: [https://www.bankofcanada.ca/rates/interest-rates/canadian-bonds/#graph](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/rates/interest-rates/canadian-bonds/#graph)

&amp;#x200B;

Now we have Defi protocols with the introduction of platforms such as Compound, Celsius, and Aave - that pool our money for borrowers to use (so long as they have collateral), and earn interest at varying rates.

For those who are unaware of the mentioned platforms here are the links, and the interest they provide for your coins, and tokens:

Compound: [https://compound.finance/markets](https://compound.finance/markets)

Aave: [https://aave.com/](https://aave.com/)

Celsius: [https://celsius.network/earn-rewards-on-your-crypto/](https://celsius.network/earn-rewards-on-your-crypto/)

It is without question that Defi is the best thing since sliced bread.  The interest rates are far superior than what you will ever find at a traditional bank.  

I believe in the coming years banks will have a real challenge offering saving accounts with their abysmal interest rates. 

Furthermore, bond yields over the past few years have been atrocious; but on top of that you have to make a minimum deposit of $5,000 CAD to even purchase a bond!  This already locks out many of the younger generations who wish to invest from their late teens to adults in their mid twenties.

Bitcoin,“Bitcoin has 0 value!” Why this is a valid and an invalid argument.,"If you have been in this space for some time, you have heard the phrases “Bitcoin has 0 value” or “Bitcoin has 0 intrinsic value” time and time again.

Let me give a quick example: I love and play golf all the time. To me, a nice set of irons is quite valuable, and I would be willing to exchange some of my purchasing power to acquire a nice set of irons. But to someone who does not play golf, a set of irons is essentially worthless, and there is no reason why they would ever spend considerable money to purchase a set. 

So how does this relate to Bitcoin? Well, to an individual who finds a decentralized monetary network, money with a finite supply, owning a piece of the first truly scare internet asset, and the ability to ensure that no entity can ever touch their money all very valuable aspects of money, then Bitcoin is extremely valuable. 

But to an individual who does no care about the fed altering interest rates, quantitative easing of their currency, or their funds being confiscated, Bitcoin has 0 value. There is no reason for this person to find any value in Bitcoin, because they don’t see Bitcoin as a solution to any of their problems. 

Therefore, Bitcoin can have 0 value and Bitcoin can also be the most valuable technology in history. 

Value is subjective on a case by case basis.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,My experiences as a property investor compared to a crypto investor - and why hands-down I prefer crypto,"Here is a slightly different post for once.

With all the recent turbulence, I've been thinking about different asset classes, their performance and pros and cons.

At least for me, over my life time I have only had two major investments - crypto and property (residential rental). I've been in and out of crypto since 2013, and property since 2006.

So how do I feel about property vs crypto right now?  Especially given that (at least in New Zealand) property is on an incredible upsurge (+25% in a year!) there are no taxes to pay on long term capital gains, while crypto has had a very hard time and the FUD seems relentless.

Well, right now my investing is still 100% in crypto and I would never consider buying another rental property ever again.  When the time comes I'll sell that rental and reconsider my options - perhaps stocks or crypto, depending on market cycles.

But here's the thing, while it may seem like heresy - in my view for the average person, property is FAR riskier than crypto.  Here's why.

The first point is that unless you are a multi-millionaire you are not going to have the cash to buy a full rental.  In my city, average prices are around the $1.2 Million (that is in NZD - so for all figures in this post, the USD is around 70% or so - $840k USD for that property for example, but note that our wages are low - around NZD $50k a year less around 30% taxes if I include sales taxes and council rates).  That gets you a three bedroom house on a tiny section in an average suburb - probably with a long commute to work.

So you are going to need to borrow.  It varies, but over time generally you can have a 20% deposit.  So let's compare a $240,000 investment into crypto vs a $1.2 Million investment into property with 80% debt.

So first of all we have entry costs.  Crypto has a tiny cost of entry aside from researching wallets and keys etc.  With property, to purchase can take months, with thousands of dollars lost to inspections, building reports, legal fees etc.

And of course you are borrowing - $960,000 in this example.  That has a cost which for most properties (again in my city) will put you into a negative cash flow position.  Non-property investors don't realise the sheer amount of costs involved in having to have a property retrofitted properly, have it upgraded for rental standards and maintained.  And trust me, in rental properties things break and decay like you wouldn't believe (especially with kids or pets).

I think my record for debt was at one point $1.4 MILLION.  That is a giant sword hovering over your head, which if things you wrong will ruin you and your family for life and put you into bankruptcy.  Even if I somehow lose all the keys to my multiple wallets, I lose my crypto but ironically the government here will effectively reimburse me 39% or so of the lost crypto as at tax refund (I'm not kidding).

So your rental is going to cost you money out of your pocket probably for years to come - and of course with a heavy risk of interest rates increasing.  Now if you happen to lose your job or have unexpected costs come up, you'll be forced out of the market perhaps with a lost.

Crypto has no holding cost and as you will know, can be parked or put into cefi or defi to earn you passive income.  My farms are currently earning an average of around 269% per annum (non-compounded).  That pays for itself pretty damn fast.

Now crypto can be diversified (if you want).  It could be a spectrum of crypto assets, or it even be a mix of stable coins and bitcoin.  And you can adjust your position to up or downgrade your risk based on the market.  And if the market has extreme turbulence or fear, you can instantly move your position to cash at the touch of a button with a tiny fee.

With your $1.2M property you are effectively going ""all in"" into a single asset with massive leverage.  You are facing multiple black swan events which can happen - a building defect, a title problem, gang moves in next door or even an earthquake (in NZ our second largest city literally had this and it wiped out a huge portion of housing).  And as you are leveraged x5, a 20% hit will wipe out all your equity.  Now compare the chances of that (or even just a property bear market) to the black swans for crypto - i.e. Satoshi wakes up and market sells his coins, blockchain collapses etc.

Critically with crypto you can dollar cost average, a little bit at a time, with no risk that you are entering the market at the wrong time.

And try exiting the market when your tenant has a 1 year fixed lease and the market is turning bearish.

I've never lost sleep with crypto but I have lost sleep with property.  Not only did I come close to losing my entire equity in the GFC, but the roof developed an issue which would essentially flood the house during storms - now that is fixed but only after tens of thousands of dollars.

Then there is the people problem.  With tenants you are rolling a dice every time as to how things go.  With crypto, nobody is calling you ten times a day screaming at you to fix the washing machine.  And just wait until they stop paying the rent.  I once had a new tenant insist on upgrades worth thousands of dollars - he would literally leave 5-6 voice mails every day with his requirements.  Once completed, he then said he had maxed out his credit cards and preferred not to pay any rent for three months (my neighbour then noticed two very nice new European cars parked in the driveway).

Now I am pretty lucky (and picky) with my tenants.  But getting a bad tenant is x100 worse than a rug pull or a shitcoin collapse.  For example, we have a meth problem in our country - if you get a meth addict or lab in your rental (not uncommon) even if they don't burn the house down your property will be effectively ruined and might require a complete reconstruction.  Get a nightmare tenant and you will not be able to evict them for months, meanwhile they will literally destroy the property.  And we have new laws now that mean you can't evict them without ""cause"" but the land lord has to prove the cause.  Good luck finding witnesses to bring to Court when your tenant turns out to have gang connections and is threatening all the neighbours.

And when your tenant finally leaves expect to find a huge host of problems (plus weeks of no rent).  Let's just say that last time for me, the toilet was left in such a terrible state that the only way it could cleaned was literally with a screw driver (use your imagine here).  And the tenant didn't even understand it was a problem!!!

Unless your tenant is absolutely flawless (there are ALWAYS risks), picking your tenant is liked being forced to pick the latest dog coin on pancake swap, and to go all in with 500% leverage, locked in for 3-4 years, with a funding cost of 1-2% per year.  

And did you hate the 1 year crypto ""bear market"" - well property can (and has) bear markets that can last a decade - or in the case of Japan, literally decades.

And finally crypto may be encountering regulatory headwinds, but it is no different with property - whether its new tax rules, tenancy issues, rent controls or banking requirements (and yes over here rent controls are now being threatened).  At least in New Zealand, property investors are the new punching bag, with every property in the market blamed on investors (previously it was literally blamed on Chinese investors - but since they were blocked from buying, strangely it has done nothing to stop prices surging).  And for property the rules are only going worse - look at Germany for example, where they introduced rent controls RETROSPECTIVELY and literally let tenants sue landlords for the difference.

So I think for non-investors, there is an myth that property investments are ""Safe as houses"" while crypto is an insane gamble.  From my perspective this is far from the truth.

The only good thing that both have in common is they are both scarce (to an extent) and both benefit from insane QE and money printing.

There only thing the federal reserve can do about this is a contractive monetary policy, which is either reducing the money supply (burning those dollars) or raising the interest rate, the problem is both those options would be very harmful to the US government due to it's high debt.

That leaves us with 2 options:

Option 1: The federal reserve actually acts in favour of US dollar holders (as it should) and uses the right monetary policy to control inflation, that would financially harm the US government, they would have to apply heavy austerity measures to reduce costs, and rely on tax reduction to stimulate the economy instead of printing money, this would be good for the country but we know how the government loves to spend our money so they will likely pressure the federal reserve to not do that.

Option 2: The federal reserve does not apply the right monetary policy to favour the government, that wold mean the federal reserve is no longer an independent organism and is now subject to the government's will, which basically means welcome to Venezuela.

If option 2 happens you will be happy you bought crypto, if you are too scared to buy crypto because of the drop and/or the volatility I would recommend you to buy gold.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Mortgage Pre-Approval Letter - lack of interest rate?,"First time home buyer. I asked my lender to run scenarios for me on how much i can get on a conventional loan vs FHA loan. Via email, lender told me I can be approved for on conventional, and told me there's a $380K limit on FHA loan (I want to buy a 3 unit property). My pre-approval letter (sent to my realtor but not to me) didn't have an interest rate on there. Is that usual? Seems fishy to me. 

She said once I narrow my purchase, she can provide an interest rate. ""Rates change every day and the differences can be significant."" I guess i'm asking, is it usual for a pre-approval to be generated without it saying what interest rate i'm getting?

Edit: thanks everyone who replied! Looks like this is pretty normal. Then at what point do I compare rates across lenders? I thought it was at this stage. Any help is much appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,Mid-20s - Portfolio Help,"Hi,

I will be leaving my job within the next few months and will need to rollover my traditional 401(k). Additionally, I was saving a significant amount of cash for grad school, but I recently decided not to pursue it yet. I'm pretty inexperienced with trading (mostly buy-and-hold ETFs/mutual funds), but I've been very fortunate to be able to invest heavily and max out my contributions over the past few years. Here's a breakdown of what I'm working with:

* Traditional 401(k): \~80k in employer plan
* HSA: \~12k (10k in VTI and 2k in cash)
* Traditional IRA: \~8k (all in VIGAX)
* Roth IRA: \~13.5k (6k in VIGAX, 3.7k in VSGAX, 3.8k in VTSAX) \[Already contributed the max for 2021\]
* Cash: \~50k \[I expect this amount to be a lot higher by the time I leave my job as I have maxed out my 401(k) contribution for 2021\]

I am in my mid 20s with minimal debt (\~16k in low interest federal student loans with 0% interest at the moment). I live in a high CoL area, but with minimal expenses/rent for now. What do you suggest I do with my holdings? Thank you!",finance
personalfinance,"High balance, but low fixed interest rate student loan. Should I invest instead of paying off the loan?","I sold a share of stock options that my company in a secondary offering, to put ~14000 towards my student loan, and refinanced my loan at 61,000 at 3.1% fixed for 10 years. I wanted to refi now to take advantage of the extremely low interest rates (my previous loan was at 4.5% fixed). 

I likely will never see rates this low again in the lifetime of my loan. I have ~2 months of emergency savings saved up, which I'm trying to increase. Once I do however, would it be wise to pay the minimum on the loan and invest the difference? I figure that even earning at a conservative 5%, I would be profiting.",finance

US CBDC Stablecoin! This will be the push to collapse decentralized crypto.

Dai (or DAI) is a stablecoin cryptocurrency which aims to keep its value as close to one United States dollar (USD) as possible through an automated system of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. In 2017 Dai successfully kept close to one US dollar during its first year of existence.

Here’s the kicker!
Dai is maintained and regulated by MakerDAO (https://makerdao.com/en).

14. We just experienced a big flash crash in price. A prime suspect is the drop in hash rate in BTC due to the Blackouts in China.

26.

I think they are going to connect a lot of disparate pieces for us on the 29th.

28. Rick interviewed CardStarter which is a Cardano accelerator. The interesting items are 1) it appears they are purporting to somehow insure their community backers against certain financial losses with caveats, 2) they plan to fund projects prior to token launch through token vouchers, and 3) it sounds like they are building a DEX called Card Swap. Notice that the “insurance” comes with caveats. They were very transparent on that point and people should take notice. Is CardStarter good? Is it bad? I have no idea.

[https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenehrlich/2021/04/26/cardano-and-ethereum-founder-analyzes-the-newest-evolutions-in-crypto-and--blockchain-technology/?sh=6acb258e3e52](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenehrlich/2021/04/26/cardano-and-ethereum-founder-analyzes-the-newest-evolutions-in-crypto-and--blockchain-technology/?sh=6acb258e3e52)
43. Charles also covers his projections about interoperability and the future converging on a “wifi moment” when an interoperable “internet of blockchains” emerges. In this future, it will be a race to the bottom and the systems that are too expensive to operate will simply be priced out of the game.
44. New Africa Special Trailer dropped. The narrator: “We are partnering with African governments…” That was PLURAL governments, guys! This is getting exciting. [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1386772333902319618](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1386772333902319618)
45. The Africa Bird lands a few days early!!!!!!!! It’s a deal with the Ethiopian Ministry of Education to provide a Cardano ID solution and unified records system for 5 million Ethiopian students. Charles says there will be more news tomorrow at the Africa Special.[ https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/27/business/dealbook/tesla-earnings-bitcoin.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/27/business/dealbook/tesla-earnings-bitcoin.html).[ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOTRp3PQKVk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOTRp3PQKVk).[ https://twitter.com/IOHKMedia/status/1387051830442553351](https://twitter.com/IOHKMedia/status/1387051830442553351)[ https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/27/blockchain-finally-comes-of-age-with-worlds-biggest-blockchain-deployment/](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/27/blockchain-finally-comes-of-age-with-worlds-biggest-blockchain-deployment/)[ https://www.cityam.com/ethiopia-overhauls-its-education-system-with-iohk-blockchain-partnership/](https://www.cityam.com/ethiopia-overhauls-its-education-system-with-iohk-blockchain-partnership/)
46. We’re getting reports from Army of Spies member /u/[ ricklepicklemydickle](https://www.reddit.com/user/ricklepicklemydickle) that World Mobile is reporting in its telegram group that it will be dropping some news tomorrow!
47. A new Cardano metrics platform has launched [https://cardanowaves.com/](https://cardanowaves.com/)
48. Today is the Cardano Africa Special. It’ll be at 9:30am Pacific, 10:30am Mountain, 12:30pm Eastern, 5:30pm Dublin, 7:30pm Addis Ababa, 11:30pm Bangkok. 1:30amTokyo. Go enjoy! We’ll recap it after.
49. In today’s video we also cover questions about the relationship between Atala Prism and ADA and who will actually benefit from the Cardano Projects with African governments.
50. The Africa Special made it clear that Cardano has a brilliant grand strategy for the developing world. As framed by John O’Connor this would be: 1) provide digital identity; 2) provide digital transfer of value; and 3) provide programmability of that digital value.
51. Mickey Watkins (CEO of World Mobile) added a step zero to the formula above with: 0) provide access to the digital world.
52. As has previously been mentioned, it was officially announced that Cardano is partnered with World Mobile to provide digital connectivity to people in the developing world starting in Tanzania. They plan to have 100k subscribers in Zanzibar by the end of the year.
53. This is just the beginning in Africa. John O’Connor had a nice tweet that very succinctly laid out some future plans. [https://twitter.com/jjtoconnor/status/1387919060197855234](https://twitter.com/jjtoconnor/status/1387919060197855234)
54. Coindesk editor refuses to acknowledge that Cardano has a deal with a national government, gets relentlessly trolled, then finally capitulates and decides to cover the Ethiopian Ministry of Education project. [https://twitter.com/zackseward/status/1387744629693599744 ](https://twitter.com/zackseward/status/1387744629693599744)[https://twitter.com/HukAleksandra/status/1387788814022844421](https://twitter.com/HukAleksandra/status/1387788814022844421) [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1387937546978545667](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1387937546978545667) [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1387939251275198466](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1387939251275198466) [https://twitter.com/Cshuggin/status/1387986678741151745](https://twitter.com/Cshuggin/status/1387986678741151745) [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1388113533435482115](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1388113533435482115) [https://twitter.com/CoinDesk/status/1388192121006534657](https://twitter.com/CoinDesk/status/1388192121006534657)
55. The Cardano Africa Mini addition gives us more details on the actual rollout of the Ethiopia Ministry of Education deal: 1) all 700k teachers and a subset of the students who will get tablets will be registered in the first year; 2) all secondary school students will be registered in the second year which will bring us to 5MM students; and 3) the data will be used to analyze both students and teachers.

56. If you don’t believe that Atala runs on Cardano please watch this video which lays out definitely and exactly how Atala runs on Cardano. Please feel free to wantonly debunk anyone on the interwebs who says otherwise. Thank you to IOHK technical architect Alexis Hernandez for this video! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AbgzvOeb6w&amp;t=31s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AbgzvOeb6w&amp;t=31s)
57. I don’t know if everyone watched the last few minutes of the Africa Special. But, I think a lot of people missed the section where John O’Connor said the goal of Cardano in Africa is to issue 100 MILLION digital identities in the next two years. To give you some idea of scale here, adapools.org shows a highest ever daily number of new wallets at around 71k. If we onboard 100 Million people via digital identity over two years that would be 136,986 people per day. ETH only has 150MM unique wallets to date. [https://youtu.be/yRjj662kJsk?t=8615](https://youtu.be/yRjj662kJsk?t=8615) [https://adapools.org/analysis-query/wallets](https://adapools.org/analysis-query/wallets) [https://etherscan.io/chart/address](https://etherscan.io/chart/address)
58. John also mentioned that all of the 100k subscribers to World Mobile in Zanzibar this year will have digital identities on Atala Prism. They will also be offering so-called “RealFi” loans by Q1 of next year that will be made via Cardano liquidity and will act as a bridge to real world value. [https://youtu.be/yRjj662kJsk?t=8628](https://youtu.be/yRjj662kJsk?t=8628)
59. Charlie Munger thinks crypto is “disgusting”. That’s a wonderful thing because it tells you how early you are. This is especially true in Cardano which is a project that leads with empathy for the developing world. Will he still call that disgusting if we’ve brought financial inclusiveness to an entire continent in five or ten years. Probably he won’t say anything because he won’t have lived that long. But, you get the point.

60. The state authorities in Wyoming are so far ahead of the curve it’s scary. Now they’re putting aside $4 million for staking. On the private side, Caitlin Long should be declared a state treasure for making a lot of this happen. [https://twitter.com/Cardanians\_io/status/1388756653311414272](https://twitter.com/Cardanians_io/status/1388756653311414272) [https://decrypt.co/69390/university-wyoming-generate-revenue-crypto-staking](https://decrypt.co/69390/university-wyoming-generate-revenue-crypto-staking)
61. I will be in a tent in a beautiful place where there will be very limited internet access. So, no text format Cardano Rumor Rundown until Saturday. The youtube version has been pre-recorded and is scheduled to come out on the normal daily schedule: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWnSP49DJf-G9E0VfqDdBCA](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWnSP49DJf-G9E0VfqDdBCA).
62. There is supposed to be some kind of mid-month update on Plutus. Charles hinted in a recent update that everything is going really well on that front. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=786mOp2Xq7s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=786mOp2Xq7s)
63. There will be an update on Mithril at the end of the month. You will remember from previous coverage that Mithril is a means to create trustless light wallets via recursive snarks similar to Mina. ZK-SNARK = zero knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=786mOp2Xq7s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=786mOp2Xq7s)
64. Charles is setting aside $9MM to be shared by two research labs to be set up: one at University of Edinburgh and one at an undisclosed institution. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=786mOp2Xq7s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=786mOp2Xq7s)
65. Doge Mania might be hitting a new peak (as a cultural artifact at least) tonight with Elon’s appearance on SNL. There are many different perspectives you can take on how this might impact ADA. I find the following two the most interesting: 1) if the Doge pump is followed by an inevitable crash it could sour a giant group of new adopters on crypto; or 2) it might be a gateway drug that will turn a large group of new adopters on to better projects. [https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1390774840135766019](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1390774840135766019)
66. The Essential Cardano List is published by IOHK. (credit to [/u/cascading\_disruption](https://www.reddit.com/u/cascading_disruption/) for pointing this out) [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1390728385945550848](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1390728385945550848)
67. Cryptodoggies.org NFTs are now available. The website says 50% will go to a community voted animal charity. [https://www.cryptodoggies.org/](https://www.cryptodoggies.org/)
68. For those learning Haskell, Check out this new video on Type Theory. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7blCeETJo8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7blCeETJo8)
69. Also, Lars puts out a new Plutus Pioneers video on Native tokens. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VbhY162GQA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VbhY162GQA)
70. ADA is the most crypto of all cryptos. George of CryptosRUs pointed out in a recent video that he couldn’t find any trace of a VC firm owning Cardano in its portfolio in his search of the categories section on CMC. This makes sense if you know Cardano. Would freedom and decentralization loving Satoshi not throw up a little in his mouth to find out that VC ownership of cryptos was a metric people would care about in 2021? The lack of VC stake in the very decentralized and freedom loving Cardano only adds to our already iron-clad claim on the mantle of the most crypto of all crypto projects. Our ecosystem never sought to attract VC money that would only centralize ownership in a smaller number of hands. This doesn’t even address the current extreme centralization of block validation in BTC and ETH.

71. IOHK has dropped a new article on the status of KEVM and IELE. Grigori Rosu of Runtime Verification says a proof-of-concept of IELE should be ready in six months. This is a key component in how we get to the ocean of all developers as we grow beyond the pond. [https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/05/10/runtime-verification-iele-from-interoperability-to-universality/](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/05/10/runtime-verification-iele-from-interoperability-to-universality/)
72. Cardano saw a new challenger enter the scene with Internet Computer (ICP) debuting very high on the CoinMarketCap charts. However, a look into ICP makes one question whether they are really in the Gen. 3 Blockchain race at all given that available information indicates the blockchain runs via datacenters hosting standardized hardware and that those datacenters can only join the network with the permission of the “Network Nervous System”. You could say that the winner of the Gen. 3 Blockchain race needs to solve the blockchain trilemma of decentralization, security, and scalability. If that’s true, then it’s arguable that ICP is not even competing in the decentralization leg of the race. [https://youtu.be/zHl-oVPoX88?t=97](https://youtu.be/zHl-oVPoX88?t=97)
73. The new venture of Sebastien, Nico, and Robert Kornacki is announced: [https://twitter.com/dcspark\_io](https://twitter.com/dcspark_io). That’s a hell of a team!!!!

77. Does Elon’s move away from BTC (ostensibly for environmental reasons) hold promise for ADA? [https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1392602041025843203](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1392602041025843203)

84. John O’Connor on CNBCAfrica! He gave a really good explanation of how Africa with it’s already very high adoption of mobile payment wallets can leapfrog the legacy payment systems currently in use in more developed countries. He also reiterated that Cardano will expand to five countries this year and 20 next year! [https://youtu.be/RET8hIQQLUA](https://youtu.be/RET8hIQQLUA)

88. The saga of BTC maximalists being angry at Elon continues with Elon implying that Tesla could sell its BTC while Cardano continues just doing its thing like normal. [https://twitter.com/elonmusk/with\_replies](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/with_replies)
89. Likewise, Marc Cuban tried to FUD real world use of Cardano only to be confronted with a giant infographic of use cases and partnerships along with an explanatory video just for him.

90. Initial Stakepool Offerings (“ISOs”) are here. Crypto is no stranger to novel means of capital formation and now the Cardano ecosystem is getting in on the action. Here is SundaeSwap’s explanation of how ISOs will work.

91. ICYMI, Manuel Chakravarty reminds us all that his Cardano Summit 2020 talk is publicly available for questions on native assets. Really interesting discussion of the asset identifier just being a hash of the policy script and how that helps create a super lightweight easy to use system.

95. The Cardano Foundation is out to do something incredible with supply chains as described in the fireside chat! In his previous Cardano Live appearance, Frederik Gregaard, CF CEO, also expressed a very healthy and sustainable perspective on what DeFi should become. He compared the current state of DeFi to just moving funds from your left pocket to your right pocket and taking profit. [https://youtu.be/d8uPMZplfeM](https://youtu.be/d8uPMZplfeM) [https://youtu.be/xbMSQUA1lss](https://youtu.be/xbMSQUA1lss)
96. The ISO model entering the capital formation toolbox in Cardano is going to make the stake pool game extremely interesting with SPOs scrambling to find the right balance between rewarding ADA and giving their delegators other things like tokens. Some stake pools could even become like portfolio funds with relationships with many different projects the tokens of which are given to delegators. Babel Fees could also play a role here for smart SPOs as they may allow access to a wide variety of tokens in the ecosystem that could be used to reward delegators with a sort of index fund exposure to a wide variety of Cardano projects.
97. May Cardano 360 coming one week from today (always the last Thursday of the month). [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1395117067960045569](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1395117067960045569)

99. The Cardano Foundation has released the full video of the Fireside Chat with Eva and Fred. Lots of questions answered on a variety of fronts.  Very interesting remarks including that in discussions with financial institutions, Fred has found they are interested in exposure to the alpha provided by the asset class in general, tokenization of assets, and the yield provided by staking rewards. Fred counters that they SHOULD be far more interested in the Cardano standard including the concepts of reference accounts, programmability of money, and transaction metadata. [https://youtu.be/JW6s9Jkyazg](https://youtu.be/JW6s9Jkyazg)
100. In a video press release yesterday, the Fed finally admitted that it’s moving toward a central bank digital currency (just like every other central bank). This will eventually be impactful on Cardano and every other crypto ecosystem. [https://youtu.be/WOAQxpG79Ag](https://youtu.be/WOAQxpG79Ag)
101. The Treasury is trying to figure out how to get cryptocurrency regulation in a headlock. This will probably go hand-in-hand with the Fed’s March toward a CBDC. Afterall, what good is all the tracking and monitoring afforded by a CBDC if it’s easier for everyone to just use a non-central bank digital currency? Tax evasion in crypto is also obviously a target problem since we know only about 800 people a year paid taxes on crypto in 2013-2015.

Bitcoin,Bitcoin - To big to fail!!!,"How easy it is to forget what it is all about. How we so easily forgot how it all started. 

People go back, and read Satoshi's White Paper well again! 

What's the point of Bitcoin? 

How and why Satoshi made it, one fantastic idea, which was realized by all the people of this world eager for freedom and putting an end to this madness produced by the Central Bankers.

Do you remember that Satoshi stated that ""The Second Bailout has just been released"" stating the reason why the world and people need Bitcoin, if you forgot or don't remember, at that moment before our eyes the Fed rewarded bankers who knowingly caused the global economic crisis , with several trillions of dollars, which diligent bankers distributed among themselves through trillions of bonuses ...

We are in a desperate need for Bitcoin to succeed, because if we miss this opportunity as humanity, we will hardly have another one.

Let me remind you of the narrative launched by central bankers in fear that Bitcoin would deprive them of the opportunity to manipulate and enslave humanity that has been going on for hundreds of generations. So hardworking non-creative bankers warned us ""that Bitcoin is dangerous because of money laundering and financing terrorism and wars ....""

This is the most blatant distortion of the truth, have people really become so stupid, that they can't see the irony and hypocrisy in these claims, people wars and terrorism and money laundering existed and still exists today, precisely thanks to these same bankers and their uncontrolled printing of fiat currencies, and the ability to secretly finance and enforce all these things. Now the bankers are really afraid for the first time, all their statements speak in favor of the fact that their dominance has been shaken at its root for the first time. That is why they are trying to desperately lower the price of Bitcoin, so that they can take control of people again and continue with manipulations. So this is my appeal to the bitcoin community and to all people in general, don't let narcissistic charlatans like Elon Musk manipulate you and the price of bitcoin for that matter, Bitcoin has already imposed itself as a world accepted currency, and it's time to replace the failed dollar in that sense. You will see that when this officially happens, there will be no more wars and terrorism or various false diseases, and crime will be drastically reduced, because it will no longer be possible to secretly finance wars or quasi-revolutions, because everyone will be able to see who has initially invested money and benefited in the end.

CryptoCurrency,Case: This summer a digital dollar prototype will be revealed that runs on HBAR,"We all saw the news that US is coming out with a paper on CBDC. Before this there was the news that the FED along with MIT were coming out with two prototypes for the digital dollar as early as this summer. Algo obviously has strong ties to MIT, so I think that would be the other candidate. Notice that in all the news and videos the subject of technology is being discussed, it is always referred with the term DLT or distributed ledger technology. What other DLTs are there besides blockchain? Well there is hashgraph for one. I will make a simple case for why this the technology I speculate cbdc will run on in the US.

**Is there a connection between Hedera and the FED?**

Yes, they tweeted the Emtech whitepaper earlier this week:

""This paper introduces the 'Digital Cash Infrastructure Framework' to Congress and The FED""

Emtech on their website has long declared that they are working on a PoC with the FED, and this is still there. This PoC I strongly speculate would be one of the two prototypes I mentiond earlier. Emtech is behind the first CBDC in the world in the Bahamas.

And...the tiny amount of people that watch Hederas monthly townhalls know that Mance Harmon the CEO of Hedera has implied or even stated that Hedera is actually working on multiple CBDCs. In the latest townhall Leemon Baird mentions that there are multiple countries that are experimenting different ways of using the Hedera network. Newest Hedera town hall on youtube at  (7:00) and (26:51).

**Technology requirements:** 

**Speed**, Ive watched the Boston FEDS videos on what the requirements are for speed, there is talk of a minimum 50k to 100k TPS, Hedera can do this, not many others can.

**Security**, Hedera, this is mathematically the highest level of security that can be provided in a POS system. If this can be achieved without compromising speed it will be done for matters that concern national security, duh.

**Finality**, Hedera offers actual finality, raher than probabilistic finality like other projects. Should be obvious why this is important in a regulatory and legal context.


Hedera is also *confirmed* to be working on CBDCs with several african countries, most notably South Africa.



In two months this hypothesis will either be confirmed or denied.

CryptoCurrency,Make your bets now - Either FED raises rates and all markets plummet or they keep QE and BTC goes to 100k+,"I don't blame people who are selling or holding. Mixed messages from FED and vague statements are making markets very nervous. Most professional traders are preparing themselves for economic crash, since logical thing for FED would be to rise interest rates to fight inflation which is way above 2% now. 

FED is in a pickle - raise rates and see defaults everywhere, houses market that people were taking advantage of and buying way above asking price thanks to cheap mortgages and infinite QE outlook would collapse, either leaving people with lifetime long debts or foreclosures and defaults.

FED can also keep printing and keep markets inflated until foreseeable future, although if they do it, imminent crash that will come at some point, will be that much more damaging. If that happened most markets would rally up again, probably crypto would gain the most since it's most speculative, giving BTC new highs.

Whatever comes will be a wild ride, strap on and if there's another rally, better cash out before it goes down, otherwise see you in 3+ years in next bull market. There's also a chance that FED and other governments will start investing in BTC to leave themselves with options, but my guess would be it would happen during next bull market. Anyway good luck to everyone.",cryptocurrency
stocks,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning May 24th, 2021","Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 24th, 2021.

# **Stocks could be volatile in week ahead amid turbulence from cryptocurrency - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/21/stocks-could-be-volatile-in-week-ahead-amid-turbulence-from-cryptocurrency.html)**
*****
&gt; The trading pattern of the past two weeks – particularly alongside cryptocurrency’s movements – suggests stocks could continue to be volatile in the week ahead.
*****
&gt; Investors are watching the wild swings in b/itcoin and trying to gauge whether technology shares can gain traction after a rally attempt in the past week.
*****
&gt; The Dow and S&amp;P 500 were lower in the past week, but Nasdaq was slightly higher, helped by a positive move in tech, as well as buying in biotech and big cap growth names like FANG members Alphabet, Facebook and Netflix.
*****
&gt; A steep plunge in b/itcoin after China announced new regulations soured the mood for risk assets during the past week. The U.S. also called for stricter compliance with the IRS. Further, on Friday, China said it would crack down on b/itcoin mining and trading.
*****
&gt; “What’s interesting is the market is being bullied around by where b/itcoin goes,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer with Bleakley Advisory Group. B/itcoin plunged by as much as 30% on Wednesday, to about $30,000. Though it recovered to above $42,000, it slid again on Friday.
*****
&gt; The cryptocurrency was down about 9% late Friday, hovering around $36,000, according to Coin Metrics.
*****
&gt; “B/itcoin is a poster child for risk appetite,” said Boockvar. “It tells you the stock market is more on uneven ground, if we’re getting dragged along by b/itcoin.”
*****
&gt; There is some key data in the week ahead. Consumer confidence, home price data and new home sales are out on Tuesday. Durable goods will be released Thursday, and the consumer sentiment report is issued Friday.
*****
&gt; But the most important data will be the personal income and spending data, which includes the personal consumption expenditure price deflator, the Fed’s preferred inflation measure.
*****
&gt; “The key to next week is going to be the inflation numbers. The inflation numbers are now becoming the new payroll numbers in terms of market performance,” said Boockvar. “What will also be interesting is inside the consumer confidence numbers, is where the inflation expectations go.”
*****
&gt; The consumer price index was surprisingly hot when released last week, showing core inflation at a year over year pace of 3% in April. The core PCE price index was up 1.8% year over year in March.
*****
&gt; In the week ahead, earnings season is winding down but there continue to be reports from retailers, like Best Buy, Costco and Nordstrom. NVIDIA and Dell also report.
*****
&gt; # No correction yet
&gt; As the market has chopped around this month, dip buyers have stepped into the declines and snapped up perceived bargains.
*****
&gt; Some strategists do not see a correction just yet, though pullbacks could continue.
*****
&gt; “For me, my framework is we can only get a 10% correction when we have a liquidity set back, when we have a policy tightening,” said Barry Knapp, managing partner of Ironsides Macroeconomics. “In any of the little disturbances, we are getting about a 4% to 6% pullback.
*****
&gt; Knapp said investors are fretting too much about higher interest rates being a problem for technology companies. “You should be in the cyclical parts of tech,” he said. Knapp noted that subsectors like semiconductors and software should do well with the economic reopening and global manufacturing rebound.
*****
&gt; Tech squeaked out a slight gain in the past week, gaining 0.1%, but semiconductors popped nearly 3%. Software was up 0.2%.
*****
&gt; The Nasdaq was 0.3% higher on the week to 13,470, while the Dow was off a half percent at 34,207. The S&amp;P 500 was down 0.4% to 4,155.
*****
&gt; The best performing sector was real estate investment trusts, up 0.9%, followed by health care, up 0.7%. Biotech was higher on the week with the IBB iShares Nasdaq Biotech ETF, up 1.1%.
*****
&gt; “It wouldn’t shock me if we went straight back to new highs,” Knapp said. “Part of the reason I thought we would trade in a range, was earnings season was done but net revisions is surging.”
*****
&gt; He said earnings for the S&amp;P 500 are now expected to be up 7% more for the year than when the first quarter reporting season began.
*****
&gt; Knapp expects the Fed may discuss tapering its bond buying at its Jackson Hole meeting in late summer, and that is the likely trigger for a correction. Back to World War II, he said the first correction after a recession was triggered by the Fed normalizing policy.
*****
&gt; “Last cycle, we had eight of those,” he said. “Every attempt they made to normalize policy caused one of these risk off events.”
*****
&gt; Knapp said it’s natural for investors to be focused on the Fed now. “It’s an uncertainty shock,” he said. “It will cause a correction and everyone is focused on it. The Fed has not really changed its policy since the depths of the pandemic.”
*****
&gt; Knapp said Treasury yields have drifted lower during efforts in Washington to reach a bipartisan plan on infrastructure spending. But he expects the market to react differently in the next two weeks, since he expects those efforts will clearly fail and Democrats will focus on a big spending program that will increase the deficit.
*****
&gt; The b/itcoin crypto mania was lifted by the idea of big spending from Washington, and the infrastructure spending could be positive. “The thing that was the surprise in 2021 that really drove the mania was the blue wave and then the spending blowout,” he said, noting b/itcoin gained on the potential for inflation and big deficit spending.

&gt; # Economic Surprise Index Tips Negative For The First Time In A Year

&gt; While the overall trend of economic data has been for further improvement, things have slowed recently relative to expectations. In the charts below, we show the charts of the Citi Economic Surprise indices for the US, Emerging Markets, the Eurozone, and the entire world. Broadly speaking, positive readings indicate that economic data is coming in better than forecasts while negative readings indicate the opposite. Every region of the globe has pulled back over the past couple of months but for the most part, current readings remain at the high end of their historical ranges. In fact, the indices for Emerging Markets, Eurozone, and the whole globe all sit in the top 3% of all readings in their histories. The one place that is not the case is the US. Since last summer, the surprise index has been trending lower off of record levels, and just yesterday, it hit it tipped negative for the first time since June 2nd of last year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/CESI.png))**

&gt; Lasting 248 trading days, this was the longest streak of consecutive positive readings in the index's history dating back to 2003. The only other streak that lasted nearly as long was a 189 day long one which came to an end in June 2018.

&gt; # Post-Election-Year June: Third Worst S&amp;P 500 Month

&gt; June has shone brighter on NASDAQ stocks over the last 50 years as a rule ranking sixth with a 0.9% average gain, up 28 of 50 years. This contributes to NASDAQ’s “Best Eight Months” which ends in June. June ranks near the bottom on the Dow Jones Industrials just above September since 1950 with an average loss of 0.2%. S&amp;P 500 performs similarly poorly, ranking ninth, but essentially flat (0.1% average gain). Small caps also tend to fare well in June. Russell 2000 has averaged 0.8% in the month since 1979.

&gt; In post-election years since 1953, June still ranks poorly and its average loss for DJIA increases to –1.1% while S&amp;P 500′s modestly positive performance becomes a 0.6% loss. DJIA struggles the most, advancing in just four post-election year Junes (1977, 1985, 1997 and 2017). Russell 2000 fares best, up seven times in ten years with an average gain of 1.2%. NASDAQ lands in the middle, advancing 50% of the time with an average gain of 0.4%

&gt; # May Manufacturing Starting Off Strong

&gt; The first manufacturing data for May came out this morning with the release of the New York Fed's Empire State Manufacturing Survey. General business conditions remain at historically strong levels although there was some slowing in May as was expected. After hitting the highest level since October 2017 last month, it was expected to fall to 23.9 in May. The index did in fact decline, but only to 24.3. While lower, that is still around some of the strongest levels (excluding last month) in three years as more businesses continue to report improvements in business conditions than weakness.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-Empire-1.png))**

&gt; Breadth in this month's report was pretty mixed; namely with regards to current conditions versus expectations. Every index is still showing an expansionary reading with particular strength out of the indices for the present situation. In fact, most of those indices still sit in the top decile of their historical range with a few like those for unfilled orders, delivery times, and prices even at or just off of record highs. But there were a handful that moved lower: delivery times, inventories, and number of employees.

&gt; Regarding expectations, it was much harder to find an increase. Delivery times and technology spending were the only two of these indices to rise month over month. While many indices for expectations still sit at historically strong levels, there are more that are middling within their respective historical ranges. Overall, the report showed that New York area firms have seen a peak in optimism even as they continue to report strong conditions.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-Empire-Table.png))**

&gt; Demand certainly appears to be one area without much in the way of weakness. New orders rose 2 points month over month to 28.9. That is the highest level in just over 15 years and the only other readings as high occurred throughout late 2003 to mid-2004. Those orders are making their way out the door at an increased rate too as shipments climbed to 29.7. That index has been making a vertical climb since the winter as it reached its highest level since August 2007.

&gt; Despite this, NY area firms are not fulfilling orders fast enough. Last month saw the Unfilled Orders index rise by one of the largest amounts in a single month on record, and it continued to climb albeit by a much smaller 0.2 points in May. The only month on record with a higher reading in unfilled orders was September 2001. Inventories were one of the few current condition indices to fall in May, although the reading still indicated growth. In other words, those unfilled orders are not necessarily drawing down on inventory levels.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-Empire-2.png))**

&gt; Supply chains are one of the main areas that are likely holding things back. Higher readings in the delivery times index mean that businesses are reporting that it takes longer for products to reach their destination. Even after falling 4.5 points in May off of the April record, the current level sits well above the prior record high of 16.2 from March 2018.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-Empire-3.png))**

&gt; In addition to taking longer for products to get to where they are going, the price point is on the rise. Both indices for prices paid and received rose to record highs in May. In fact, over the past two months, there has not been a single respondent to have reported a decrease in prices paid. That is the first time that has occurred since February and March 2012.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-Empire-4.png))**

&gt; Last week saw a blockbuster job openings report and the Empire Fed survey is showing a similar willingness to take on more workers. The current conditions index for the number of employees continues to show that businesses are on net increasing their workforce, though at a slowed pace from April. Additionally, the index is at a much less elevated part of its range (the 81st percentile) relative to other indices within the report, but the much more elevated reading in expectations (98th percentile) would indicate the businesses would like to take on far more workers. That is, there appears to be a bit of a disconnect between the actual number of new hires and businesses' expectations to take on more workers. Potentially as a result of an inability to hire enough workers, the average workweek has continued to climb. At 18.7, the index is at its highest level in a decade.

&gt; # Homebuilder Sentiment Holds Steady

&gt; Our new Constitution is now established, everything seems to promise it will be durable; but, in this world, nothing is certain except death and taxes,” Benjamin Franklin

&gt; The national average on a 30 year fixed rate mortgage currently sits around 3.06%, little changed over the past month. Homebuilder sentiment as measured by the NAHB Housing Market Index similarly went unchanged in May staying at 83. Although it has been six months since the record high of 90 without much of a push back up to those record levels, homebuilder sentiment continues to come in well above anything observed prior to the pandemic. Commentary from the NAHB noted that the strong reading on homebuilder confidence is thanks to the low housing inventories, low rates, and strong demand, despite the headwinds of rising costs. While that could have played into the small decline in traffic, future sales did tick higher.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-NAHB-HL.png))**
&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-NAHB-Table.png))**

&gt; Whereas the headline number was flat on the month, readings based on each region saw much more variety. By far the largest move was for the Northeast. Since running back up to the record high back in February, homebuilder sentiment in the Northeast has fallen for three straight months and is now at the lowest level since January. The decline in sentiment in the Northeast is relatively recent. Whereas the region tied its record high earlier this year, the other regions all peaked out in the fall. For the Midwest, the declines have kept coming with 3 point declines in each of the past three months alone. The West and South, on the other hand, have found some respite. The South has ticked higher by 2 points in back-to-back months as it reached the highest level since December. Meanwhile, the West was unchanged at 91 in May.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-NAHB-Region.png))**

&gt; As for homebuilder stocks, the iShares US Home Construction ETF (ITB) had been trading in overbought territory throughout most of the spring but in the past couple of weeks, it has come back down to Earth. Last Wednesday, ITB successfully tested its 50-DMA with a small bounce at the tail end of the week. So far today, it has turned lower alongside the broader market with a 1.35% decline. While that means Friday's close marks a lower high, for the time being, the uptrend is still intact.

&gt; # Increased Caution Across Sentiment Indicators

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has been holding up at its 50-DMA in the past week while more speculative areas of the market (i.e. crypto) have experienced wild swings. As a result, sentiment on the part of individual investors has not seen much of a move. The American Association of Individual Investors' weekly reading on bullish sentiment was little changed this week climbing half of one percentage point to 37%. Although that was not a large move in the past week, sentiment has taken a big hit over the past month having fallen from well above 50%. In spite of that big drop and even though sentiment is around the lowest levels of the past half-year, the current sentiment level is within one percentage point of the historical average. In other words, optimism is low versus recent history but is very much middling from a longer term perspective.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052021-AAII-Bull.png))**

&gt; Meanwhile, bearish sentiment fell 0.7 percentage points to 26.3%. Unlike bullish sentiment, that is a bit lower than the historical average of 30.5%

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052021-AAII-Bear.png))**

&gt; Those corresponding moves meant the bull-bear spread climbed to 10.7 from 9.5 the prior week. Excluding last week, that is still one of the lowest readings since February.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052021-AAII-Bull-Bear.png))**

&gt; Neutral sentiment has been the star of the show recently. The gain this week was tiny at only 0.2 percentage points, but nonetheless, it marked the fifth consecutive week in which neutral sentiment has risen. At 36.7%, it is now at the highest level since the second week of 2020.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052021-AAII-Neutral.png))**

&gt; The Investors Intelligence survey of equity newsletter writers took a less optimistic tone this week as bullish sentiment fell 4.1 percentage points to a ten-week low of 54.5%. Bearish sentiment was unchanged at the highest level since the end of March. The survey also questions respondents on whether or not they expect a correction. That reading rose 4.1 percentage points to 28.3% in the biggest one-week uptick since the last week of April when it rose 4.7 percentage points. That leaves the reading at the highest level since the week of March 10th. Before that, you would need to go back to September 23rd to find as high of a reading.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052021-II-Correction.png))**

&gt; Another sentiment reading that has taken an even more dramatically negative tone lately has been the National Association of Active Investment Managers Exposure Index. This index measures how exposed to equities managers are where readings of 200 would mean they are leveraged long, 100 would be fully invested long, 0 would be neutral, -100 is fully short, and -200 is leveraged short. This week saw the index fall another 2.65 points after a massive 40-point decline last week. That is the lowest level since last March and April of last year. Altogether, while sentiment still favors bulls, there has been a more cautious tone that has been reflected in managers reducing exposure to equities.

CryptoCurrency,"If you think the Crypto Market is “immature” because “eVeRYtHiNg MOvEs wiTh biTCoiN,"" it's really not; most markets do the same thing.","I analyzed the price correlation of three different markets: crypto, stocks, and metals. I choose the assets based on market caps relative to sectors. For cryptocurrencies: currencies, smart contracts, centralized exchanges, privacy, and logistics. For stocks: tech services, finance, electronic tech, health tech, and retail trade. There are no sectors with precious metals so I chose the top five based on market cap. Here are my findings:

**How to read this:**

* The lighter the shade, the higher the correlation. A dark shade means inverse correlation: meaning they move against each other. 

**Takeaways**:  

* The top cryptocurrencies correlate; top stocks correlate, and top metals correlate. Copper is the only aberration.
* This sample of stocks and metals had an inverse correlation. Metals are often seen as a hedge against stocks.

This isn’t enough data to make any claims, but I’d argue it’s enough to make a point. Markets tend to move together because traders will look at something that has a foothold on the market. **Crypto traders will look at something like Bitcoin; stock traders at stock indexes; and metal traders at the Federal Reserve and inflation.** Sure, you can still diversify within a specific market; but when a market dips, most assets in that market dip as well.

CryptoCurrency,The mentality that you can buy any dip and make money is going to be the downfall of most of you.,"I understand that for what seems like forever the FED has made it so all financial assets are backstopped and it actually is profitable to just buy every dip. As much as you guys will hate to hear it their actions have played a giant role during the entire life of crypto. You can talk about adoption all you want and say that the dollar is going to collapse but there is really only one thing driving the price of high risk assets: liquidity.

When dollars are easy to borrow (which they have been for probably most of your lives) asset prices go up since everyone feels wealthy. In reality, a huge majority of the circulating money supply in developed countries is credit. Crypto is not the only asset that is affected by this it's just the newest and most volatile at the moment. 

All I'm saying is stop acting like idiots and sticking your heads in the sand every time someone says the word risk. There are legitimate bear cases and legitimate bull cases that you need to be considering if you want to call it an investment. Otherwise, you're gambling. If liquidity dries up then there's no way to predict how it will respond since the last true banking crisis was before it existed. Just look at what happened in 2020 when we got a sniff of liquidity issues and look how it responded once the FED started pumping that money around. 

Tether is another liquidity risk but I'm not even going to get into that on this sub since most people will discredit my entire post for bringing up that ""FUD"".  Do whatever you want but it needed to be said since I am assuming a ton of people here don't have much experience and are getting their info from people with not the best intentions.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Is it crazy to consider selling the car I bought new &lt; 1 year ago?,"I know the general /r/personalfinance go-to advice is to buy a beater and drive it till it dies, but let me explain my situation a bit.

I'm 27 and make \~100k a year, in a fairly HCOL.  The only debt I have is my car loan, which the payoff amount today is roughly \~17k.  The interest rate on the loan is 1.9%, monthly payment of $368.  I have no student loans, no credit card debt.  I'm by no means struggling.  I was driving a beater that was handed down to my previously for free (2004 SUV), which finally kicked the bucket last year, which is when I financed a 2020 Honda Civic new.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the thing, I really don't drive much.  In the almost year I have had it, I have accumulated \~3000 miles on it.  Granted, I have been working from home since before I bought it, but I think I can get my position to be mostly WFH by the time my company wants us back into the office.  I recently moved into a mixed-use development and drive even less than before, since I can walk to the gym/restaurants/grocery store, etc.  My car as mostly just been sitting in the garage unused.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also not a car person.  If it runs, has working AC/Heat, and preferably Bluetooth, It would be fine for me.  The civic I bought comes with all these fancy features like automatic cruise control/distancing between cars/staying in the lane automatically on a highway, that I never use and don't have any desire to.

&amp;#x200B;

Out of curiosity, since I know used car values are high due to the chip shortages, I looked up what I could get from Carmax, and the value they gave me was 24,800.  That's essentially what I paid for it if you combine by financed amount, down payment, and trade-in for my nearly-dead SUV.  I figure I could trade it in, and go without a car for a bit, see how the work from home thing pans out after the summer, and if I need to buy a car to commute into work, by then I could probably purchase one outright.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know, in my head the logic seems sound, but I guess I wanted some outside opinions on it.",finance

Ive wrapped up paying off most of the stupid debt (car and credit cards) accumulated during early 20s and want to get serious about saving and investing. Now that for the first time my income is outpacing monthly expenses/paying down high interest debt agressivley I want to start taking advantage of my extra income. 

 Looking for some advice on the best way to strategize. 

**Current debts**

Mortgage ~ $61,xxx remaining

Student loans ~$26,xxx remaining (all federal) 

Total monthly minimum debt payments = $1,2xx


**Current Savings Strategy**

Emergency Fund - have $4,500 saved
401k - Saving 7% of income (4% employer match) 

Employer stock purchase - $600/month, sell stock immediatley after purchase and into savings account. 

**Questions**

1) would it be wise for me to reduce my 401k to 4% for the employer match and then start putting 5-6% in a Roth? Or perhaps make other investments? 

2) should I contribute more to employer Stock Purchase to capitalize on easy return from the discount and possibly invest some of those funds into other investments? 

3) or would it be best for me to agressivley attack mortgage and student loans and wait another few years to really start saving? 

I have no problem living like a pauper while my money works for me. But want to make sure I have a plan.

economy,CHLORINE IS THE NEW GOLD TENDIE MAKER. HERE'S WHY $OLN,"While we have all heard of the chlorine shortage, I am convinced we have incorrectly concluded the cause for the shortage. It is my belief that as a result of COVID overwhelming the entire healthcare industry (especially hospitals), the product that healthcare relies on most (chlorine and chlor alkali) became overwhelmed as a result. The true cause of this shortage is simply the effect of the overwhelming strain this pandemic placed on the entire healthcare industry. Information below helps provide clarity on how vital chlor alkali is to the healthcare industry.   

#### [Chlorine: On the ""Front Line"" in Hospitals® (americanchemistry.com)](https://chlorine.americanchemistry.com/Chlorine/Front-Line/)  

#### Chlorine and Life-Saving Drugs 

From the computers used in admissions to the sutures used in surgeries, chlorine is a vital part of hospital operations and patient treatments. In fact, probably no other institution relies as much on chlorine as hospitals. Hospital pharmacies are full of medications that rely on chlorine chemistry. Today, about 85 percent of all pharmaceuticals contain or are made using chlorine, including medications that treat heart disease, hypertension, cancer, AIDS, arthritis, pneumonia, depression, diabetes, allergies, meningitis, glaucoma, osteoporosis and ulcers.

Acetaminophen, the most widely used pain reliever in hospitals, is made with chlorine. Sodium chloride is also used in every COVID vaccine.

Chlorine and Medical Equipment

Chlorine is essential to a wide variety of hospital equipment. An estimated 25 percent of all medical devices in hospitals are made using chlorine, including some of the most widely used equipment:

· IV and blood bags. Chlorine-based plastics are used to make the millions of blood and IV bags used by hospitals and blood banks each year. 

 

* Sterile tubing       and packaging. Chlorine-based plastics are also used to make these       essential devices.  

Premier Infection-Fighter

Chlorine compounds are used widely to maintain hospital cleanliness and prevent thousands of life-threatening infections. As a bleach and medicinal aid, chlorine compounds:

· Prevent bacterial contamination of patients' burns and wounds

· Disinfect kidney dialysis machines

· Clean and disinfect work surfaces and equipment in medical laboratories

· Kill deadly bacteria, such as Legionnaire's Disease, that can live in hospital water and air conditioning systems.

Chlorine in the Operating Room

Chlorine plays a number of critical roles in the operating room:

· *Anesthesia.* Anesthetics, such as Anactine Flopak, are made with chlorine.  
 General cleaning and disinfection. Infections are a significant threat in hospitals. Chlorine-based cleansers disinfect work surfaces and equipment.

· *Sutures and other surgical equipment.* Chlorine helps make nylon, an essential material in surgical sutures, artificial blood vessels and osmotic membranes. And vinyl, a chlorine-based plastic, is used in heart catheters.

 

* *Electronic       instruments.* Computers       and electronic devices play an increasingly important role in the       operating room and hospital patient care, and chlorine provides one of       the crucial building blocks in the manufacture of semiconductors used in       these life-saving electronic instruments.”

It’s obvious that chlorine plays an irreplaceable role in healthcare and the safety of our healthcare workers, and safety has never been more crucial than during COVID. It is my belief that to ensure safety for healthcare workers and availability of chlorine dependent products used in healthcare, Biden used the Defense Production Act to require companies that produce critical chlor alkali raw materials to prioritize production for the healthcare industry and combatting COVID.

[The Defense Production Act and the Biden Administration – Publications | Morgan Lewis](https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2021/02/insight-the-defense-production-act-and-the-biden-administration-first100) 

### BIDEN ADMINISTRATION’S EXPECTED USE OF THE DPA

&amp;#x200B;

* The      Biden administration has publicly stated that it intends to use the DPA to      combat the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, the administration is likely      to use the DPA to accelerate COVID-19-related supply chains.
* The      administration has identified 12 categories of critical supplies that will      accelerate the manufacture, delivery, and administration of COVID-19      vaccines.
* The      six vaccine candidates being developed as part of Operation Warp Speed, as      well as companies manufacturing COVID-19 therapeutics, have priority DPA      ratings.
* On      January 21, 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order that      directs federal agencies to use all available legal authorities, including      the DPA, to fill supply shortfalls that are critical to the COVID-19      pandemic response.

With chlor alkali producers being forced to prioritize chlorine based raw material production for the healthcare industry and COVID pandemic, all other industries dependent on chlor alkali have been left behind to experience a complete lack of the same raw materials. The impacts are detailed below.

The computer chip shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how: [Trichlorosilane: Cornerstone Chemical for Electronics and High-Tech Toys (americanchemistry.com)](https://chlorine.americanchemistry.com/Science-Center/Chlorine-Compound-of-the-Month-Library/Trichlorosilane-Cornerstone-Chemical-for-Electronics-and-High-Tech-Toys/)

Silicon chlorides are some of the cornerstone chemicals of the Information Age. Trichlorosilane (HSiCl3) is an intermediate compound used to produce extremely pure silicon, from which computer chips, the ""brains"" of electronic devices and high-tech toys, are manufactured. The famous high-tech industrial area of California, Silicon Valley, was named for the chemical element that has revolutionized the way we communicate and play. And chlorine has played an essential role in the high-tech revolution.

The aluminum shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how:  [Aluminum Chloride | Aluminum Sulfate | Aluminum Manufacturers](https://www.aluminummanufacturers.org/aluminum-sulfate/aluminum-chloride/) – Chlorine based chemical used primarily in the production of aluminum metal. Chlorine is also used in the recycling of aluminum. 

The plastic shortage, especially PVC (polyvinyl chloride) is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how: [Polymer Raw Material Shortage for 90% of Converters (plasticsconverters.eu)](https://www.plasticsconverters.eu/post/polymer-raw-material-shortage-for-90-of-converters) 

According to **EuPC Managing Director Alexandre Dangis***, “Manufacturers of plastic products all over Europe are experiencing serious bottlenecks in the supply of raw materials since the beginning of this year. Delivery problems have become increasingly widespread, affecting raw materials for example (not limited) such as Polypropylene, Polyvinyl Chloride, and Polyethylene, as well as special additives that are crucial for the manufacture of compounds and plastic products. The serious market disruptions currently taking place all over Europe are a symptom of the structural imbalance in Europe between the local production of and demand for raw materials and additives. Without restoration of that balance, periodic recurrence of gross disruption of the production chain is highly likely.*

*All of the 3 raw materials mentioned above are chlorine based.* 

The cat food shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how:   [Functions and Requirements of Chlorine in Cats | Pet Care Advisors](https://petcareadvisors.com/cats/functions-and-requirements-of-chlorine-in-cats/) – Chlorine is used in cat food as they are highly attracted to it. 

The chicken shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how:    [Chlorinated chicken explained: why do the Americans treat their poultry with chlorine? | Analysis &amp; Features | The Grocer](https://www.thegrocer.co.uk/food-safety/chlorinated-chicken-explained-why-do-the-americans-treat-their-poultry-with-chlorine/555618.article) – The US Poultry Industry chlorinates chicken as a part of the disinfection process.

With this information, it is my belief that chlor alkali manufacturers will continue to experience overwhelming demand nearly impossible to satisfy for the next 2 years plus. This demand will of course create record breaking revenues and profit margins for the industry. As the largest chlor alkali producer in the world, Olin Corporation (ticker symbol $OLN) is in perfect position to reap the most reward. I am highly confident that gross revenue / net profits will significantly exceed expectations for all of 2021, 2022 and likely 2023.

We have some pretty specific criteria. We’re pretty “nomadic” and not sure if we’ll be hear or even in the US more than a couple years. 

We’re into overlanding/light trail driving/camping...ideally looking for a midsized suv like a RAV4 AWD.

I have pretty good credit and make 6 figures, but I’m already paying off a lot of debt. We’re not trying to spend more than $500/mo between the 2 of us (w/ insurance)

Our original plan was to buy something a few years old....but used cars right now are barely cheaper.  Even with low interest rates were having a hard time finding a car we like in our price range. I don’t really know what the best financial decision is right now.

Since prices are close enough to new maybe it makes sense to go for that option...but my fear buying new is that if the market cools off in a year or so, the value of the car will decrease way faster than it would normally.

Typically everyone here says it makes no financial sense to do short term leases. But seems we’d be paying an extra $4k-$8k right now to purchase. And we don’t plan on having this car for a decade.

I also have no idea if we should just hold out a few months more and hope the prices fall soon.

Thank you everyone for any/all thoughts.",finance

Bitcoin,Money Is Power,"Money is power. People with power want to be where the money is. Cryptocurrencies spread the power horizontally instead of vertically like the current system. “Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell warned about potential risks cryptocurrencies pose to the financial system”- I don’t think anyone besides the super-rich and the people at the top of financial institutions think the current financial system is working. Unless you are one of these people, which is like 0.000001%, you should be on the side of cryptocurrency. I know that change is scary and a change that is as big as the opportunity cryptocurrency is offering to the human race is uncertain but this could be the biggest advance in the history of technology that gives power to the masses of not just one country but the entire world. These huge governments (China, United States, Russia) that are currently trying to scare people with news of regulations and crackdowns on cryptocurrency are not doing this for the good of people, they are doing this because they know, like we know, that cryptocurrency is the biggest threat to their power and money than anything ever before. The whole blockchain movement is so young and is growing faster than ever, the more people learn about it and get involved is beneficial to everyone. I truly see this technology changing the world for the better (in a way the internet did) and the people who have the most money and the true power in this world do not want this. I know it’s cliché but HODL, shill the entire crypto market, and do not listen to these governments and super rich old people(literally fud).",cryptocurrency

Let's go....

Newly covered today: 

1. Even the Pope is condemning Proof-of-Work? At least, that’s how the crypto community took a recent tweet.  [https://twitter.com/Pontifex/status/1394993742226939905](https://twitter.com/Pontifex/status/1394993742226939905)

4. Ethiopia awards new Telecom license as promised. The winner, a consortium including Vodafone, Safaricom, and Sumitomo; will invest $8 billion in their network in Ethiopia in the next 10 years and will cover the country in 4G.

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. There are even Ouroboros Omega tattoos now! [https://twitter.com/Coinfera1/status/1383560914](https://twitter.com/Coinfera1/status/1383560914914316290)
2. We just experienced a big flash crash in price. A prime suspect is the drop in hash rate in BTC due to the Blackouts in China. Is the crypto space ready to accept that Nakamoto style consensus on PoW leads directly to unacceptable levels of centralization? This has been the dirty secret of PoW crypto and its decentralization loving enthusiasts for years. [https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-mining-hash-rate-drops-as-blackouts-instituted-in-china](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-mining-hash-rate-drops-as-blackouts-instituted-in-china)
3. Charles posted a somewhat cryptic tweet that read “Omega + Hydra + Mithral = GG”. The Ourobors Omega, Ouroboros Hydra, &amp; Mithral parts we’ve covered before. Omega is a capstone rollup of Praos (2017), Genesis (2018), + Redux, +Chronos, +Ledger Combiners, +some other things from the rest of the space. Hydra is layer two. Mithral is trustless light wallets via zk-SNARKs. Guesses as to the “GG” ranged from “Good Game” (as in game over for competitors) to “Goguen”. See today’s video at the link above for more discussion on this. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1383792375860924424](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1383792375860924424)

9. Africa special going down April 29th, 16:30 UTC!!!!!!! That’s 9:30amPacific; 10:30am Mountain; 12:30pm Eastern, 5:30pm Dublin; 7:30pm Addis Ababa; 11:30pm Bangkok.

10. Shahaf Bar-Geffen, CEO of COTI (the first recipient of a Cardano CFund investment), says he just finished recording his segment in the Africa special which he mentioned was airing at the end of April prior to the IOHK announcement of April 29th. He also said: 1) ADA Pay may be ready in early May or maybe even late April; 2) there will be a big launch for ADA Pay and once the Africa Special airs “everything will connect”; 3) “people are probably not getting how big this is….but you will down the line”; 4) COTI integration with a major exchange is happening, progress is not as quick as they would like, but it’s progressing; 5) last week they released the possible designs for debit cards, they are even considering some designs submitted by the community; 6) and iOS and Android integration is coming along nicely and well on the way. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EorsiQfEV7o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EorsiQfEV7o)
11. For a little more background on the work going on between COTI and Cardano, check out these links.

12. It looks like Yellow Card and Payway are listed on the Africa Special website. Given their business models, it is easy to guess that they could be valuable in the Pan Africa Strategy. [https://payway.et/](https://payway.et/) [https://yellowcard.io/](https://yellowcard.io/)
13. Partnership with World Mobile in Tanzania. Credit to Reddit user [/u/ricklepicklemydickle](https://www.reddit.com/u/ricklepicklemydickle/) for originally finding this one. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6TeNLvMTXI&amp;t=2242s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6TeNLvMTXI&amp;t=2242s) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX3Fnb\_l4zA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX3Fnb_l4zA) [https://worldmobile.io/](https://worldmobile.io/) [https://newslogical.com/cardano-partners-with-global-telecom-company-world-mobile/](https://newslogical.com/cardano-partners-with-global-telecom-company-world-mobile/)
14. Recap from yesterday: the Africa Special Announcements revealed some additional puzzle pieces 1) COTI’s AdaPay is possibly the larger payments infrastructure puzzle piece, 2) [payway.et](https://payway.et/) is possibly the local payments puzzle piece, 3) [yellowcard.io](https://yellowcard.io/) is possibly the local coin exchange puzzle piece, and 4) World Mobile (not mentioned at [africa.cardano.org](https://africa.cardano.org/) AFAIK) may be the network connectivity puzzle piece. I think they are going to connect a lot of disparate pieces for us on the 29th.
15. Once again we are the champions! Not just of github commits this time, but also of total staked asset value. [https://www.stakingrewards.com/](https://www.stakingrewards.com/)
16. Rick interviewed CardStarter which is a Cardano accelerator. The interesting items are 1) it appears they are purporting to somehow insure their community backers against certain financial losses with caveats, 2) they plan to fund projects prior to token launch through token vouchers, and 3) it sounds like they are building a DEX called Card Swap. Notice that the “insurance” comes with caveats. They were very transparent on that point and people should take notice. Is CardStarter good? Is it bad? I have no idea. Watch the interview and form your own opinion. [https://youtu.be/nIklWKtr\_aY](https://youtu.be/nIklWKtr_aY) [https://cardstarter.io/](https://cardstarter.io/)
17. The Cardano Foundation has adjusted its delegation strategy. This brings up a question: where does the balance lie between allowing Adam Smith’s hidden hand to work its free market magic and trying to help small pools? [https://forum.cardano.org/t/the-cardano-foundation-s-delegation-methodology-is-changing/58465](https://forum.cardano.org/t/the-cardano-foundation-s-delegation-methodology-is-changing/58465)
18. More details on what the COTI/Cardano partnership will actually look like. Also COTI’s Trust Chain runs on a DAG. It’s probably high time we all understand WTF a DAG is.

19. We’ve had really good reporting from the community on World Mobile developments with Cardano. I just want to take a second to thank you guys. Reddit user [/u/ricklepicklemydickle](https://www.reddit.com/user/ricklepicklemydickle/) first alerted us to the World Mobile developments and then youtube user [Whiskey 1234](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyBeEq-paultoA127TYcDjQ) (love both usernames btw) let us know that he attended a conference where he encountered World Mobile and “asked them if they knew about Cardano blockchain and the reply was they were announcing partners at the end of this month.” Thank you very much for this intel guys.This is what Army of Spies is all about. Many thanks for your contributions, gentlemen.
20. Alko Sumatra Kopi is going to export 100 tonnes of coffee from Sumatra to China and track it all farm to cup using Emurgo Trace! We reported previously on the engagement of Emurgo Trace here and now it’s being put into action.

21. In Charles’s recent AMA, he mentioned that the Africa Special will be a Pan African event and they WILL talk about various deals they have in multiple countries. So, this tells us they do have multiple deals in multiple countries. That was a little unclear previously. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mP0JSgf9CU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mP0JSgf9CU)
22. IOHK’s Development Update for this week includes news that end-to-end tests of the ERC-20 Converter are commencing along with a mention of some oracle work under the Goguen update section. [https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/status-updates/update/2021-04-23/](https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/status-updates/update/2021-04-23/)
23. The number of defi projects that have announced plans to be on Cardano just keeps climbing with [Yayswap.io](https://yayswap.io/) joining the list of Liqwid, Occam, and CardSwap/CardStarter.
24. Kraken publishes a “What is Cardano?” article. Says “...Cardano may not promise new ground-breaking features..” Oh yeah? What about native tokens that don’t require smart contracts? What about the EUTXO model allowing predictable and accurate local calculation of transaction fees in your wallet before you execute? What about a consensus algorithm that’s so good, another top 10 coin made their system derivative of it? That’s all standard these days? [https://twitter.com/krakenfx/status/1386038990864793607](https://twitter.com/krakenfx/status/1386038990864793607)

28. In today’s video, we’re also going to go much deeper on how the COTI DAG works. But, don’t worry at all you’ll totally understand it when we’re done.
29. Binance Smart Chain has already laid out a very compelling argument that we’re going to CRUSH Ethereum. [https://twitter.com/TheADAApe/status/1386583952668958720](https://twitter.com/TheADAApe/status/1386583952668958720)
30. Charles does a big interview with Forbes and points out the huge differences between a bonded staking system (ETH) and a liquid staking system (Cardano). This is highly overlooked. [https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenehrlich/2021/04/26/cardano-and-ethereum-founder-analyzes-the-newest-evolutions-in-crypto-and--blockchain-technology/?sh=6acb258e3e52](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenehrlich/2021/04/26/cardano-and-ethereum-founder-analyzes-the-newest-evolutions-in-crypto-and--blockchain-technology/?sh=6acb258e3e52)
31. Charles also covers his projections about interoperability and the future converging on a “wifi moment” when an interoperable “internet of blockchains” emerges. In this future, it will be a race to the bottom and the systems that are too expensive to operate will simply be priced out of the game.
32. New Africa Special Trailer dropped. The narrator: “We are partnering with African governments…” That was PLURAL governments, guys! This is getting exciting. [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1386772333902319618](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1386772333902319618)
33. The Africa Bird lands a few days early!!!!!!!! It’s a deal with the Ethiopian Ministry of Education to provide a Cardano ID solution and unified records system for 5 million Ethiopian students. Charles says there will be more news tomorrow at the Africa Special.[ https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/27/business/dealbook/tesla-earnings-bitcoin.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/27/business/dealbook/tesla-earnings-bitcoin.html).[ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOTRp3PQKVk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOTRp3PQKVk).[ https://twitter.com/IOHKMedia/status/1387051830442553351](https://twitter.com/IOHKMedia/status/1387051830442553351)[ https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/27/blockchain-finally-comes-of-age-with-worlds-biggest-blockchain-deployment/](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/27/blockchain-finally-comes-of-age-with-worlds-biggest-blockchain-deployment/)[ https://www.cityam.com/ethiopia-overhauls-its-education-system-with-iohk-blockchain-partnership/](https://www.cityam.com/ethiopia-overhauls-its-education-system-with-iohk-blockchain-partnership/)
34. We’re getting reports from Army of Spies member /u/[ ricklepicklemydickle](https://www.reddit.com/user/ricklepicklemydickle) that World Mobile is reporting in its telegram group that it will be dropping some news tomorrow!
35. A new Cardano metrics platform has launched [https://cardanowaves.com/](https://cardanowaves.com/)
36. Today is the Cardano Africa Special. It’ll be at 9:30am Pacific, 10:30am Mountain, 12:30pm Eastern, 5:30pm Dublin, 7:30pm Addis Ababa, 11:30pm Bangkok. 1:30amTokyo. Go enjoy! We’ll recap it after.
37. In today’s video we also cover questions about the relationship between Atala Prism and ADA and who will actually benefit from the Cardano Projects with African governments.
38. The Africa Special made it clear that Cardano has a brilliant grand strategy for the developing world. As framed by John O’Connor this would be: 1) provide digital identity; 2) provide digital transfer of value; and 3) provide programmability of that digital value.
39. Mickey Watkins (CEO of World Mobile) added a step zero to the formula above with: 0) provide access to the digital world.
40. As has previously been mentioned, it was officially announced that Cardano is partnered with World Mobile to provide digital connectivity to people in the developing world starting in Tanzania. They plan to have 100k subscribers in Zanzibar by the end of the year.
41. This is just the beginning in Africa. John O’Connor had a nice tweet that very succinctly laid out some future plans. [https://twitter.com/jjtoconnor/status/1387919060197855234](https://twitter.com/jjtoconnor/status/1387919060197855234)
42. Coindesk editor refuses to acknowledge that Cardano has a deal with a national government, gets relentlessly trolled, then finally capitulates and decides to cover the Ethiopian Ministry of Education project. [https://twitter.com/zackseward/status/1387744629693599744 ](https://twitter.com/zackseward/status/1387744629693599744)[https://twitter.com/HukAleksandra/status/1387788814022844421](https://twitter.com/HukAleksandra/status/1387788814022844421) [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1387937546978545667](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1387937546978545667) [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1387939251275198466](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1387939251275198466) [https://twitter.com/Cshuggin/status/1387986678741151745](https://twitter.com/Cshuggin/status/1387986678741151745) [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1388113533435482115](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1388113533435482115) [https://twitter.com/CoinDesk/status/1388192121006534657](https://twitter.com/CoinDesk/status/1388192121006534657)
43. The Cardano Africa Mini addition gives us more details on the actual rollout of the Ethiopia Ministry of Education deal: 1) all 700k teachers and a subset of the students who will get tablets will be registered in the first year; 2) all secondary school students will be registered in the second year which will bring us to 5MM students; and 3) the data will be used to analyze both students and teachers. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKT\_3clxeqw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKT_3clxeqw)
44. If you don’t believe that Atala runs on Cardano please watch this video which lays out definitely and exactly how Atala runs on Cardano. Please feel free to wantonly debunk anyone on the interwebs who says otherwise. Thank you to IOHK technical architect Alexis Hernandez for this video! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AbgzvOeb6w&amp;t=31s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AbgzvOeb6w&amp;t=31s)
45. I don’t know if everyone watched the last few minutes of the Africa Special. But, I think a lot of people missed the section where John O’Connor said the goal of Cardano in Africa is to issue 100 MILLION digital identities in the next two years. To give you some idea of scale here, adapools.org shows a highest ever daily number of new wallets at around 71k. If we onboard 100 Million people via digital identity over two years that would be 136,986 people per day. ETH only has 150MM unique wallets to date. [https://youtu.be/yRjj662kJsk?t=8615](https://youtu.be/yRjj662kJsk?t=8615) [https://adapools.org/analysis-query/wallets](https://adapools.org/analysis-query/wallets) [https://etherscan.io/chart/address](https://etherscan.io/chart/address)
46. John also mentioned that all of the 100k subscribers to World Mobile in Zanzibar this year will have digital identities on Atala Prism. They will also be offering so-called “RealFi” loans by Q1 of next year that will be made via Cardano liquidity and will act as a bridge to real world value. [https://youtu.be/yRjj662kJsk?t=8628](https://youtu.be/yRjj662kJsk?t=8628)
47. Charlie Munger thinks crypto is “disgusting”. That’s a wonderful thing because it tells you how early you are. This is especially true in Cardano which is a project that leads with empathy for the developing world. Will he still call that disgusting if we’ve brought financial inclusiveness to an entire continent in five or ten years. Probably he won’t say anything because he won’t have lived that long. But, you get the point. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/01/charlie-munger-calls-bitcoin-disgusting-and-contrary-to-the-interests-of-civilization.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/01/charlie-munger-calls-bitcoin-disgusting-and-contrary-to-the-interests-of-civilization.html)
48. The state authorities in Wyoming are so far ahead of the curve it’s scary. Now they’re putting aside $4 million for staking. On the private side, Caitlin Long should be declared a state treasure for making a lot of this happen. [https://twitter.com/Cardanians\_io/status/1388756653311414272](https://twitter.com/Cardanians_io/status/1388756653311414272) [https://decrypt.co/69390/university-wyoming-generate-revenue-crypto-staking](https://decrypt.co/69390/university-wyoming-generate-revenue-crypto-staking)
49. I will be in a tent in a beautiful place where there will be very limited internet access. So, no text format Cardano Rumor Rundown until Saturday. The youtube version has been pre-recorded and is scheduled to come out on the normal daily schedule: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWnSP49DJf-G9E0VfqDdBCA](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWnSP49DJf-G9E0VfqDdBCA).
50. There is supposed to be some kind of mid-month update on Plutus. Charles hinted in a recent update that everything is going really well on that front. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=786mOp2Xq7s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=786mOp2Xq7s)
51. There will be an update on Mithril at the end of the month.

53. Doge Mania might be hitting a new peak (as a cultural artifact at least) tonight with Elon’s appearance on SNL. There are many different perspectives you can take on how this might impact ADA. I find the following two the most interesting: 1) if the Doge pump is followed by an inevitable crash it could sour a giant group of new adopters on crypto; or 2) it might be a gateway drug that will turn a large group of new adopters on to better projects.

58. ADA is the most crypto of all cryptos. George of CryptosRUs pointed out in a recent video that he couldn’t find any trace of a VC firm owning Cardano in its portfolio in his search of the categories section on CMC. This makes sense if you know Cardano. Would freedom and decentralization loving Satoshi not throw up a little in his mouth to find out that VC ownership of cryptos was a metric people would care about in 2021? The lack of VC stake in the very decentralized and freedom loving Cardano only adds to our already iron-clad claim on the mantle of the most crypto of all crypto projects. Our ecosystem never sought to attract VC money that would only centralize ownership in a smaller number of hands. This doesn’t even address the current extreme centralization of block validation in BTC and ETH.

60. Cardano saw a new challenger enter the scene with Internet Computer (ICP) debuting very high on the CoinMarketCap charts. However, a look into ICP makes one question whether they are really in the Gen. 3 Blockchain race at all given that available information indicates the blockchain runs via datacenters hosting standardized hardware and that those datacenters can only join the network with the permission of the “Network Nervous System”. You could say that the winner of the Gen. 3 Blockchain race needs to solve the blockchain trilemma of decentralization, security, and scalability. If that’s true, then it’s arguable that ICP is not even competing in the decentralization leg of the race. [https://youtu.be/zHl-oVPoX88?t=97](https://youtu.be/zHl-oVPoX88?t=97)

84. The ISO model entering the capital formation toolbox in Cardano is going to make the stake pool game extremely interesting with SPOs scrambling to find the right balance between rewarding ADA and giving their delegators other things like tokens. Some stake pools could even become like portfolio funds with relationships with many different projects the tokens of which are given to delegators. Babel Fees could also play a role here for smart SPOs as they may allow access to a wide variety of tokens in the ecosystem that could be used to reward delegators with a sort of index fund exposure to a wide variety of Cardano projects.

Now it is also continually mentioned in the new animated show The Bad Batch. In this week’s episode 4 the crew goes into a town to get supplies and they come up to people celebrating around a “chain code post”. At the chain code post it is being announced. “With your individual chain code every citizen can exchange your invalid currency for imperial credits at no cost thanks to the generosity of the New Galactic Empire.”

This, to me seems like clear predictive programing for what is being planned with the new central bank digital currencies. So I guess my question is.. are you going to exchange your “invalid currencies” for Imperial Credits .. I mean.. Fedcoin??

Over the next 3 years I continued to work hard and learn. This run up brought both the gains and losses to even higher levels. 
It is really hard to deal with a big wealth gain that happens quickly. I once again considered quitting my job to focus on crypto and bam once again I get humble pie force fed to me this past week. In the long run it’s the best thing for all of us.

personalfinance,New HENRY's best options for an old 401(k)?,"Hello! I recently changed jobs and I have an old Traditional 401(k) account that I'm trying to figure out what to do with.

With this new job I've become a [HENRY](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/high-earners-not-yet-rich-henrys.asp) in the 32% fed tax bracket, but I still do a backdoor Roth and I'm saving aggressively with my current employer's 401(k) using mega backdoor Roth up to the federal max (pursuing FI/RE). I know the general advice is to switch an old 401(k) to an IRA. However, a few things come to mind with that: 1) I'm paying high taxes right now, so, maybe not a good time to roll it into a Roth IRA; 2) rolling it into a Trad IRA essentially ""closes the backdoor"" for my Roth conversions. So, those leave me with a couple options, with questions:

A. Roll into new employer's 401(k)
- Fidelity with Brokeragelink, so, low fee &amp; almost unlimited equity choices
- Does that tie up the funds much though? I want to retire 20 years early if possible

B. Leave there for later &amp; do a Roth conversion ladder
- VTSAX is available with the old provider but that's the only good option judging by expense ratio. I would prefer (low cost) mid-cap in my tax-sheltered acct like VOO/VIMAX but it's not a deal-breaker
- Why/when to do a Roth conversion ladder?

C. ...or maybe a rollover to IRA (Roth or trad) still makes sense, and I'm just letting the ""tax tail wag the dog""?

I realize no situation will be objectively ""best"" but I'd love to see what each of you would choose if you were in my shoes! Or whether there are any other important factors I missed! :)

CryptoCurrency,An explanation of the Tether Limited reserves chart that got revealed this week.,"A few days ago the deadline passed for Tether to submit documents for their mandated report about their reserves to the New York Attorney General (NYAG). The documents they submitted were private so Tether/Bitfinex gave the public this chart that breaks down their reserves.

https://preview.redd.it/w6txhtbidv071.png?width=1580&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15cd76b89e4fd443c699ad060f301f8b392feea8

I'll break down the pie charts to explain what each part of their reserve consists of:

**Commercial Paper (49.60%)**: ''Commercial paper is a commonly used type of unsecured, short-term debt instrument issued by corporations, typically used for the financing of payroll, accounts payable and inventories, and meeting other short-term liabilities. Maturities on commercial paper typically last several days, and rarely range longer than 270 days.1﻿ Commercial paper is usually issued at a discount from face value and reflects prevailing market interest rates.'' - Investopedia

So basically commercial paper are corporate-backed bonds. Since Commercial Paper is not backed by collateral, only firms with excellent credit ratings from a recognized credit rating agency will be able to sell their commercial paper at a reasonable price (normally). Tether's general counsel Stuart Hoegner declined to share the names of counterparties ""in line with standard commercial practice."" Basically we don't know  which entities are backing the Commercial Paper, and in line with the common practices surrounding Commercial Paper it either has to be from a firm with excellent credit ratings. It could also be a loan from Tether to Bitfinex with a note saying ''please pay us back 1 Billion soon''.

**Fiduciary Deposits (18.36%)**:  ''A fiduciary deposit account is an account that’s owned by one or more persons but managed by another. The owner is known as the principal, while the manager is known as the fiduciary. These accounts are sometimes used to handle estate or trust assets, among other purposes.'' - Yahoo Finance. Basically it means that Tether can stall funds at banks they normally can't due to citizenship or residence restrictions.'' A fiduciary deposit is where one financial institution, the ""fiduciary"", places your money in a second financial institution on your behalf. It is held off the balance sheet of the fiduciary and at the receiving bank it is shown as deposit from the fiduciary, with no need to declare the ultimate beneficial owner.''

**Secured Loans (12.55%)**: ''Secured loans are business or personal loans that require some type of collateral as a condition of borrowing. A bank or lender can request collateral for large loans for which the money is being used to purchase a specific asset or in cases where your credit scores aren’t sufficient to qualify for an unsecured loan.'' Who the entity is and what collateral is used to secure the loans is unknown.

**Corporate Bonds, Funds &amp; Precious Metals (9.96%)**: ''A corporate bond is a type of debt security that is issued by a firm and sold to investors. The company gets the capital it needs and in return the investor is paid a pre-established number of interest payments at either a fixed or variable interest rate. When the bond expires, or ""reaches maturity,"" the payments cease and the original investment is returned.'' - Investopedia. It's similar to the description of commercial paper, corporate bonds are used for raising long-term credit whereas commercial paper is predominantly relevant for short-term funding requirements such as working capital.

**Cash (2.94%):** Holdings in fiat.

**Reverse Repo Notes (2.73%):** A reverse repurchase agreement, or ""reverse repo"", is the purchase of securities with the agreement to sell them at a higher price at a specific future date. Repos are classified as a money-market instrument, and they are usually used to raise short-term capital.

**Treasury Bills (2.23%):** A short-term debt obligation backed by the U.S. Treasury Department with a maturity of one year or less.

**Section 57f of the Settlement Agreement:**

''Publication of Tether’s Reserves: On at least a quarterly basis for a period of two (2) years following the effective date of this Settlement Agreement, Tether will publish the categories of assets backing tether (e.g., cash, loans, securities, etc.), specifying the percentages of each such category, and specifying whether any such category constituting a loan or receivable or similar is to an affiliated entity, in a form substantially similar to that previously presented to the OAG.''

This part of the agreement is an interesting one, as they have to specify whether a loan or receivable is  to an affiliated entity, in this case Bitfinex. We can see in the pie chart Secured Loans are marked as ''none to affiliated entities'' but we don't see the same with Commercial Paper and Corporate Bonds. We will have to wait for a reaction from the NYAG, but it seems like Tether/Bitfinex is backed by itself through IOU's or other similar financial constructions. As comes clear from the case Tether and Bitfinex used numerous shell companies for their practices which could be affiliated entities as well.

**Conclusion:**

We still don't know anything about the entities behind the Commercial Paper and Secured Loans so the drama surrounding Tether seems to continue. It makes sense for a company to hold only a small amount of their reserves in cash as they lose money on negative interest rates. With the large position of Commercial Paper on the balance sheet we can also say they want quick access to at least 50% (cash + Commercial Paper) of their total holdings. Without knowing the counterparties involved we simply don't know if the funds are actually backed. From section 57f of the Settlement agreement we can conclude that at least some portion of their Commercial Paper and Corporate bonds are related to affiliated entities.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,On bulls and bears,"In ‘15 I was telling all my friends about crypto bull markets

In ‘17 I was telling all my friends about crypto bear markets

In ‘21, in every thread, everyone’s telling me about bulls and bears

So if your thesis is bull/bear defined, you’re swimming in a crowded pool

I’m not tryna swim in that pool right now.. but you’re my friends, so consider this:

If your thesis is bear, because 50% drawdown, check out early ‘13 and take it from someone who lived it - sometimes the market sucks but it wont forever - “it’s never as bad as it seems, and never as good”

If your thesis is bear for most any other reason, consider the correlation of crypto vs the stock market (real economy drives both)... it’s hard to make money shorting stocks, and a good rule of thumb is waiting a few months post peak even if you have an iron clad bear case, because short run sentiment can do anything

In other words, if the stock market hits new highs like it did a few weeks ago, be really careful with your crypto shorts, because they likely fukd

On the flip side if your thesis is bull because the economy is chill and stocks are chill and super cycle, and insti coming, or whatever really... know that you can still easily lose 70% between now and when you eventually get proven right... so take that leverage the fuck off the table unless you know exactly who you’re scalping with it... especially because there’s ample reason to forecast a global recession when looking at the massive supply of expensive newly issued equity (SPACs), coupled with an almost impossible chance that global governments stimulate more over the next year than they have in the previous year, even though everyone assumes stimis are here to stay and fed go brrrr

For a bit more context, I make my money in stocks and my speciality is bull/bear.. Despite the good advice above, I’m currently short stocks in size, and although I’ve made good money doing that before (March last year) I could easily be wrong

So take all that in and decide for yourself

Look around the pool... if everyone’s bleeding and the sharks just showed up (goldman), do you really want to make bull/bear bets like everyone else?

There’s always the other option - ignore bull/bear stuff - leave it to the normies and the sharks and keep doing you

You don’t have to be a bull to hodl and you don’t have to be a hodler to own some exposure to exciting tech despite fluctuations in the economy  

If you’re here because you enjoy using these projects, you support the philosophy, you resist the oligarchy... then don’t let all the other assholes tell you what that value is to you, especially when everyone else changes their mind by &gt;50% in a week (they’re being lunatics)

If you’re new and admittedly speculating or just learning then welcome!!!! We love you!! The rest of us were just like you a short time ago.. but take a breather - enjoy some time with your family and friends and keep learning!!!! Crypto will be here when you get back whether you like it or not.. just don’t make buying/selling decisions before you can definitely say you know more then the rest of the pool

When i went to withdraw on the vanguard app it says “Because you’re under 59 1/2, this transaction is considered a early distribution and maybe be subject to an additional penalty of 10%.

CryptoCurrency,Hedging your bets and when prices are high: using stablecoins and DeFi,"*TL;DR; buy stablecoins like DAI / USDC / Tether, stick them into an interest-bearing DeFi application like Compound / Aave / Sushi / BlockFi, generate 3-15% APY (fluctuates) plus voting tokens like COMP, and have virtually no price exposure. When asset prices rise so does your interest rates, and vice versa for your interest rates.* ***See the full post for borrowing strategies, explanation of interest rates, role of voting tokens, and so on***\*.\*

**Scenario: you are holding mostly fiat, crypto market is still way up year over year but you're worried about asset deflation - i.e. prices on the crypto you buy falling significantly after you purchase, forcing you to either hodl for an unspecified period of time or sell at a loss.**

The standard advice you are given is to dollar-cost average you way into whatever assets you want to acquire and that's pretty sound strategy to minimize point-in-time price exposure, but it isn't the only strategy.

In January this year I decided it was time to dabble in crypto again and I still had assets I'd purchased going back to 2014, but I'd liquidated a lot of them and was mostly holding fiat. Prices on ETH / BAT and other crypto assets that I believe have intrinsic value (i.e. they're valuable assets because of what they can do, not solely because of what people are willing to pay for them) were, in my view, ridiculously high and I wasn't willing to DCA into them even at those prices - which are still well below today's prices.

So I decided to limit my price exposure and still make a profit in the market by doing the following:

* Buy up stablecoins: USDC, DAI, Tether;
* Deposit stablecoins into Compound / Aave / Sushi - interest-bearing DeFi (decentralized finance) lending platforms running on top of the Ethereum network that work via margin lending;
* Generate 3-15% APY plus COMP tokens; and
* When I'm ready, either borrow against my assets and go long on ETH / BAT / whatever.

This has worked out really well for me so far - I've lost zero face value in my portfolio other than the $ value of the voting tokens I receive (i.e. COMP) even with this horrendous crash, I'm generating a steady amount of interest, and I have a great long-term pool of assets I can borrow from whenever I want to actively go long or short in the crypto markets.

I wanted to write an explainer for how this works under the covers using primarily [Compound Finance](https://compound.finance) as it's the protocol I've used the most and the one I'm most familiar with, but others in the space operate similarly. You should pick whatever one works best for you and many others are offering better interest rates right now, but the market mechanics are all very similar.

## DeFi: Margin Lending &amp; Cryptocurrency

Platforms like Compound are used for trustless ""margin lending"" - similar to how a stock brokerage will allow traders to borrow money in order to perform certain types of leveraged option trades.

In a traditional margin lending scenario, they're based on trust - they know what your personal level of income is, who you are, how to pursue debt collection against you, and how to damage your credit rating (reputation) in the event that you default. In a margin loan you are allowed to borrow up to X% against the value of your assets. When your assets are appreciating, you can borrow more. When your assets are depreciating you have to repay what you previously borrowed otherwise you might get ""margin called"" - forced to liquidate some of your assets in order to cover the interest + principal.

In DeFi margin loans are implemented in a trustless fashion - they have no idea who you are and you can login simply using your crypto wallet (i.e. Coinbase Wallet, MetaMask, Ledger, etc.) and putting up collateral - such as ETH, wBTC, DAI, USDC, Tether, BAT, and more.

In order to protect against defaults, loans are over-collateralized - if you have a margin maintenance requirement (called a ""collateral factor"" in Compound) of 80%, that means that you can only borrow up to 80% of the value of your collateral assets before your account gets margin called and those assets are liquidated to pay off your outstanding loan amount to the people supplying interest on the protocol.

So if I deposit $10,000 - I can borrow up to $8,000 (principal PLUS interest) before my account gets margin called and my assets get liquidated. Borrowers work hard to avoid that because they lose *more collateral than the value of the loan itself*, so typically borrowers repay interest along the way.

## Why Borrowers Borrow

So why would someone borrow money on a protocol like Compound? What's the incentive?

* **Bull market** \- borrow stablecoins to buy rising cryptos (going long) like ETH; sell ETH once it appreciates sufficiently high to pay down interest plus principal.
* **Bear market** \- borrow ETH / BAT / wBTC or whatever, sell on an exchange, buy back at a lower price and pay off interest plus principle (going short.)

Borrowers and suppliers both generate voting tokens on these DeFi protocols (i.e. COMP on Compound) and those tokens have intrinsic value too. In many instances, some crypto types actually have *net negative interest rates* for borrowing when you factor in the value of the COMP tokens being generated. More on this in a moment.

## Supplying Liquidity &amp; Understanding Interest Rates

So what I'm recommending you do in this guide is act as a liquidity supplier - someone who supplies ETH / DAI / USDC / wBTC / BAT or whatever to the DeFi protocol but doesn't borrow against it. You're providing the assets that other users can borrow against and in exchange for doing so you are regularly paid interest (in Compound it's once every 13 seconds - but it varies for other protocols) against those assets and you are also rewarded with voting tokens such as COMP.

Let's take a look at the [DAI market on Compound](https://compound.finance/markets/DAI) to understand how interest rates function:

&amp;#x200B;

[DAI \\""Supply\\"" Interest Rate](https://preview.redd.it/tg5prh978y071.png?width=1054&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d479253f67abf007cb96ad022a300b49a353339)

Right now if you supply DAI to Compound, you will earn a net APY (annual percentage yield) of 5.07% - 3.13% from DAI and 1.93% from COMP generated by your assets that are deposited into the protocol.

On the borrow side:

&amp;#x200B;

[DAI \\""Borrow\\"" Interest Rate](https://preview.redd.it/puh1vdqm8y071.png?width=1046&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0208c597ab7c01ca18cbe0324b4296be25764498)

On the borrow side it costs you a net APY of 2.23% of *what you borrow* each year - this is because while you owe interest of 4.66% APY on your borrowed DAI, you generate 2.43% APY worth of COMP each year and the difference between the two of those nets out to 2.23%.

**You actually earn COMP by both borrowing and supplying** \- and the amount of COMP you earn when borrowing is typically higher in order to incentivize more borrowing as this generates profit for the company behind Compound.

Interest rates are variable and change regularly throughout the day - as the interest rates are determined by the amount of available liquidity (money available for borrowing) for each asset type.

&amp;#x200B;

[Top Compound Markets - Liquidity vs. Borrowing](https://preview.redd.it/2ll7ljdg9y071.png?width=1016&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d536a1a9123c60341a66c42eac6c84e4d1be1e04)

Notice that the interest rate for deposits of ETH is tiny - 0.10%. This is because there's $3.2b of total ETH supplied but only $145.67m of it borrowed. There's way more ETH being supplied than borrowed therefore the amount of ETH loan repayments being made is spread out across a much larger number of liquidity suppliers, so everyone earns a lower interest rate on their ETH.

Compare this to DAI, which has $2.75b supplied and $2.2b borrowed - that's why DAI has a much higher interest rate available: there's higher demand for borrowing DAI as more people are borrowing it, therefore there are more loan repayments being made and distributed back to the suppliers.

# The Role of COMP and Voting Tokens

So what does COMP have to do with any of these? COMP is a voting token - it gives holders the ability to cast votes on governance proposals such as whether or not to add new asset types as collateral in the protocol: [https://compound.finance/governance](https://compound.finance/governance) 

It has inherent value from the point of view that it decentralizes the governance over the entire lending protocol itself, that's why there's a market to buy it. If you sell the COMP you generate from your borrowing or supplying assets on the protocol you are effectively selling your voting rights to someone else.

The other reason behind COMP is to help incentivize borrowing in markets that are over-supplied - the company behind Compound makes money when users repay debts, but it's free for them to issue new COMP tokens (at a [fixed daily rate](https://compound.finance/governance/comp).)

# Buying Stablecoins and Supplying Them as Liquidity

So you have fiat, want to get into crypto, but don't want to get exposed to massive downward price movements which will tie up your capital for an arbitrarily long period of time or force you to realize a loss.

Buy stablecoins - DAI, USDC, Tether, and so forth. These coins all have their value pegged to the US dollar. 1 DAI == 1 USD (although there are tiny amounts of fluctuation from time to time.) *Stablecoins are the tool we can use to eliminate price exposure from our system*.

**We also have to buy a small amount of ETH in order to do this - no getting around it. All of the transfers to actually deposit any liquidity require ETH to cover the network's gas fees**. But once our stablecoins are deposited we don't need to use any more ETH until we want to borrow or withdraw assets.

Pick a stablecoin - I personally prefer DAI because it's generated out in the open via the Maker protocol and doesn't have issues like [Tether, which is supposedly backed up by real-world assets but recently got nailed by regulators for only having $0.71 on the dollar](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/23/tether-bitfinex-reach-settlement-with-new-york-attorney-general.html). That being said - Tether often has  higher interest rates than DAI because it's used heavily in Asian crypto markets. Your mileage may vary.

Next, park your stablecoin in a protocol of your choice. Compound is one, but there's also BlockFi, Aave, and Sushi. They all have their strengths. I picked Compound because it's backed by large reputable VC firms in the USA, their protocol documentation was easy to follow, I could login using only my hardware wallet, and this part is important: *I tested them out with a small amount of DAI before I made a much larger investment later*. Always make sure these platforms earn your trust. 

From there, I've been generating interest and COMP steadily - getting a regular amount of interest on my DAI and interest + appreciation on the COMP. I could double the size of my investment tomorrow with no exposure to the market forces affecting crypto right now. The only thing that changes is my interest rate, which on stablecoins typically goes up during bull markets as more and more users borrow stablecoins in order to purchase high-appreciation coins like ETH.

# Tradeoffs

So the biggest downside to this strategy - no 11000% rapid appreciation on the value of your assets, because again - they're stablecoins. When the market is surging upwards the value of your COMP (or equivalent) will go up and your interest rates will too, but you're going to be missing out on 1-3 orders of magnitude worth of potential gains. 

**That's because this is an inherently lower risk strategy for working with crypto** \- but I picked it despite having a big appetite for risk because I considered the price point of most cryptos to be unrealistically high and at risk of a major correction.

The other major tradeoff is that stablecoins don't protect you from USD inflation risk as well as other crypto asset classes should, but I feel like that's a relatively minor risk compared to price exposure risk. 

# Long Term with DeFi and Stablecoins

If you generate 7% APY a year, your money will double in roughly 10 years - and that doesn't count the appreciation against voting tokens such as COMP.

Having money in a DeFi protocol like Compound makes it very difficult for you to spend it impulsively because it takes several steps to withdraw and move assets to an exchange. But it generates interest for you, passively, and gives you the option to always borrow (or withdraw) and go long if you feel comfortable with the price and risks.

This strategy can be used alongside dollar-cost averaging and so on to give you a mixed portfolio of assets that can grow your wealth. I hope you find it helpful.",cryptocurrency

I work in southern Maryland, which is a pretty expensive area, and due to my work location, we can’t leave the area. Which should I get first: house or bigger vehicle?

Things I’m considering/have been told:
•house sticker prices are up 20% right now
•interest rates are as low as I’ll see pretty much ever again

Does anyone believe our banks or stock market could pull off a similar fear and survive a correction without extraordinary intervention?","This could be a bit hyperbolic, but I just wanted to share this writing from Eric Peters, who makes a good point about bitcoin's resilience in the face of this assault.  Bitcoin has recently been attacked by the recent world's richest man, the leadership of the second biggest economy on Earth, the pope (et tu, Francis?) and various pundits and government agencies, leading to crypto markets being viciously slammed:

But it wasn’t just the Pope. You see, Elon’s tweet that criticized bitcoin mining’s use of fossil fuel spurred every ageing Luddite who has been consistently wrong about bitcoin’s ascent to pen yet another scathing op-ed.

That’s natural, of course. Critics are always loudest in the hole. But this time they were crowded together with Fed officials, the IRS, US Treasury and the Chinese Communist Party. Beijing seemed to announce a new law to outlaw bitcoin mining every time the price staged an intra-day bounce.

In human history, no single asset has come under such coordinated assault by the very global institutions that perpetually inflate asset prices in the name of securing prosperity. And yet, through it all, digital asset trading carried on, obliterating the leveraged longs, wiping out the weak.

For the first time in decades, we saw the ferocious beauty of truly free markets operating at scale. Efficiently. Ruthlessly. These assets inhabit a world without a buyer of last resort to bail out its bankers. It was a remarkable display of antifragility.


To appreciate it fully, simply imagine how today’s equity, bond and credit markets would withstand a withdrawal of government support, let alone a full-frontal assault.

It is this independence and resiliency that underpins the longer-term attractiveness of digital assets. But like all powerful new technologies, their promise is poorly understood by most pundits.

And amongst the many benefits that such technologies will produce, one of the more ironic is that despite today’s outcry, they have already begun to spur and finance an accelerating global transition to renewable energy.

While the value of crypto may be lower this week, the values of Milk and Butter LLC remain high!

News from this week:

• On Monday, we partnered with one of the largest food relief organizations in the world, “Action Against Hunger”. 

• We released the new voting contract that includes tiered NFTs with official artwork on all!

• We partnered with another token, Snowge, in order to allow for trading on their DEX. 

• Currently in the process of forming a relationship with an independent marketing firm to assist us in the marketing of the Milk and Butter tokens.

• We received the [audit](https://dessertswap.finance/idverified.html) for the Butter token contract

• Nearly $70k donated to “Action Against Hunger” and “Food For Life Global”

Milk and Butter tokens, for those that haven’t heard, are companion tokens in the Binance Smart Chain with an emphasis on charity giving. Milk is an RFI token that can be staked to generate Butter, which is used to power community voting for their favorite charities on a weekly basis. Those that merely wish to vote may purchase Butter tokens on the open market as well, which also drives rewards for those that stake Milk! 
https://www.milktoken.net/voting.html

5% of all Butter transactions are guaranteed to go to a charity wallet. In addition, Butter can be used to suggest new charities.
https://www.milktoken.net/suggest.html

$440k has been donated to charity so far, at a very low market cap. We made crypto history when Butter became the first BEP-20 token to partner with a major food charity: Food For Life Global  https://ffl.org/20077/cryptocurrency-butter-token/

The liquidity for both the Milk and Butter tokens is locked away until 2022, at which point both will be relocked. Our Market cap is still low with a solid base, we're building our community for healthy growth, and we’ll continue to develop this project with many exciting use cases plus a full array of features to be rolled out as development completes.

Each week the Milk and Butter token team hosts AMAs with the Developer on Twitch where the community can ask any questions they may have. Occasionally, we have guests, such as when the CEO of “Food For Life Global” joined us and explained the amazing genesis of “Food for Life Global” and took viewer questions. Our AMA’s stream every Sunday at 3am UTC [here.](https://www.twitch.tv/milkbuttertoken)

Roadmap: 
• Gamification of the tokens

• Expanding our number of partnerships

• The voting and staking processes will continue to be refined to make the experience as easy and accessible as possible.

• Planned instructional content to help those new to crypto learn about the space and how to purchase and use the Milk and Butter tokens.

• Additional exchange listings


Accomplishments so far: 
• Code built from the ground up to develop both tokens.

• Unique staking and voting systems implemented.

personalfinance,SEP IRA worth it?,"I’m 30 years old, make just a bit over $100k, and have a FERS retirement plan working for the federal gov.

Right now I fully match 5% into my TSP and starting last year am contributing $6000 per year into a Vanguard Roth IRA. 

On top of this, I own a small business that just recently became profitable where i should be paying myself about $1500/month.

Does it make sense to invest my small business income into a SEP IRA given that I have a TSP, pension plan, social security, and Roth IRA? Or should I invest into a regular “freedom fund” type brokerage account. I like the idea of having control on when I can withdraw my money and not having to wait till 59 1/2 for all my investments but the tax deduction of the SEP IRA could also be worth it.

As an aside if it influences opinions, I still owe about 60k in student loan debt. Any thoughts?",finance
Banking,Santander Consumer for auto loan,"I’m not sure where else to post this question but here it goes. Back in 2015 I took out a loan for a vehicle from Santander cause that’s what the dealership said I got approved for. It had a super high interest rate (26%) but I needed a car cause I had a newborn and needed to get around and my old car had given out. Now fast forward to 2 years later I defaulted cause I had lost my job. They kept hounding me for payment, I had explained the situation to them and they wouldn’t budge. So they repo’d my car in the middle of the night from the driveway without even knocking on the door first. The repo guy knocked on my door, I opened it and I see my car already on the tow truck ready to go. 

Fast forward 2 more years and now I get a postcard in the mail saying that I might be eligible for restitution and my debt and repo could be removed. 

So here’s my question: If my debt was sold to another collector can I still get this repo removed and the debt removed from my credit report given the circumstances? 

TLDR: Santander repo’d my car in 2017, am I still able to get this repo and debt removed from my credit if it was sold to another debt collector?",finance
personalfinance,Looking for Mortgage Refinance Advice,"I need advice!

I have a FHA Loan for my first home. It is/was a fixer-upper house in a neighborhood where all houses are similar and built about 40 years ago. I bought at just the right time, before houses in my area went up in value like crazy. A little background:

Bought for $140,000
Appraisal value: $144,000
Average home value in neighborhood: $180,000
Interest rate: 4.8%
Virtually 0% down

Since then, I have completely remodeled the house, inside and out. In the process, I racked up about $25,000 in debt. Some on credit cards, some on low interest loans. My DTI ratio is now around 50%. I know this is stupid, but it was the only way I could manage throughout my remodel. 

Since then, houses in my neighborhood have sold recently in the $220-$250,000 range. All of these houses have had some cosmetic updates, but nothing as drastic as what I did with mine. All bias aside, it’s a literal 180° change. 

I absolutely think the house can appraise in the $250,000 range. But I’m worried about my DTI affecting a refinance. 

What options do I have? I pay so much in interest on my credit cards and know it doesn’t make any sense, and I don’t know what kind of effect my high DTI will have on my ability to refinance. 

Anyone with input, please help! Feel free to ask questions in the comments for clarification.",finance
personalfinance,I'm planning for graduate school in Fall 2022 but still have unpaid undergraduate loans. What's the best course of action for me to pay for it?,"I'm in my late 20s and setting up to head to a one year master's program in Fall 2022 for a career change that makes sense for me. I was accepted for this coming fall but a deferring a year to figure things out financially. The school's tuition is expensive ($60K a year), I still have $40K of undergrad Fedloans unpaid, and I'm not interested in increasing my debt if it can be avoided. My undergrad debt is luckily the only debt I have aside from credit card debt that I pay off each month, but my payment history on it is not great. It took me a while after undergrad to get a handle on financial responsibility so there are a few missed payments and my credit isn't great because of it (mid 600s). I also haven't paid anything on my undergrad loans since Covid suspended Fedloan payments because I was unemployed for five months last year.

I plan on applying for scholarships/grants to cover tuition, but I'm going to plan as if I won't be awarded any. Now at this rate with my current job, I'll have enough money in savings to pay for tuition outright. The question is, would it be a better idea to pay down my undergrad instead and take out a new graduate loan that I know I can pay on time moving forward? Or alternatively, is there a scenario where it'd be more prudent to invest my money and put both loans on a payment schedule? What factors should I consider when deciding which route to go? An unknown for me is what I would actually be approved of when applying for a graduate loan; my aid decision will be based off the earnings I report for 2021, which will be my highest earning year to date. Thanks in advance for any thoughts, y'all are the best.",finance

CryptoCurrency,The end of privacy?,"It appears some type of federal crypto regulation is all but inevitable at this point. While I’m not enthusiastic about this, neither do I think it’s necessarily bad and could long term help the market grow. But I’m wondering what people think about the future of privacy coins like XMR, ZEC, DASH in light of coming regulation? I understand they can’t be banned in a true sense but is it likely exchanges will be pressured to delist privacy coins making it extremely difficult for the average retail investor to trade and cash them out. If this is a realistic scenario can privacy coin communities do anything to petition against their banning? Privacy coins have a bad rep because of their association with illicit activity but they have so many more positive use-cases beyond this media trope.

CryptoCurrency,An alternative perspective to the drop and why the fed may have caused it.,"Recently, there was a call by the treasury to report transfers of $10000 or more to the IRS. I believe this had an implication on the crypto currency market that a lot of retail traders are overlooking.        

A lot has been said about hedge funds pump and dumping crypto. I can not say this is true or false, but I do think it has cause for speculation as both sides have a reason to persuade you of buying or selling.        

Instead, I would like to provide an alternative perspective a lot of people may be overlooking; international crime syndicates. Why are they important when determining the price of crypto? A significant portion of crimes committed in the Us are paid off by the police and government by using crypto. North Korea has also been known for stealing money, converting it into Bitcoin and moving it around. In fact, I would not be surprised if this dump is specifically related to N Korea and the international crime syndicates.           

Does my theory require a tin foil hat? Without a doubt, but if you look at the implications that could have on international criminals, the impact could be greater than we imagined. The opposite side is that once the selling stops and it is stabilized, it should gain steadily as the threat of financing crimes is eventually reduced and crypto becomes a more normal way of transacting across boarders without getting screwed on exchange fees.",cryptocurrency

We currently have a 2013 Chevy Equinox that we purchased used and still owe $7800 on. We had trouble with the car the other day and the repair shop that we always use said the transfer case is shot and needs to be replaced.  They are quoting $3,000 for the work.  (This comes after we just had to repair the muffler for about $600 last month).

We do have money to pay for the repairs but 2 issues, 1) we are loathe to put more money into the car.  2) the repair shop is saying this is a hard part to find and it could be a week or a month (they don't know) to get the part.  So we could be without a second car for a while which means we would have to get a rental.

My question is do we get the car repaired or do we try the Chevy dealership and see if they will take the car as a trade-in for a new car.  I understand they would have to take whatever negative equity there is and roll it into the new loan.  The current loan's interest rate is 7.49%.

I feel like we are stuck and not knowing how long the repair would take is making the situation harder to evaluate.

personalfinance,Are there any penalties for withdrawing my Roth IRA contributions early (Betterment)?,"Hello,

My understanding is that there are taxes must be paid when withdrawing *earnings* from a Roth IRA before retirement, except in certain circumstances.

I think/thought that there were no penalties for withdrawing money I contributed, as long as I don't withdraw earnings. I'm thinking that since there's no downside to withdrawing my contributions, my Roth would be a good place to keep a portion of my emergency fund, since it can grow, but is still accessible if worst comes to worst. 

However, when I begin a withdrawal from my Roth, Betterment is recommending that I have them withhold 10% for federal taxes, even though the amount being withdrawn is significantly less than the amount I've contributed. This makes me worry that maybe I would have to pay some type of penalty for withdrawing my own contributions. Is this the case? Or do you think this is just a suggestion that is given for *all* withdrawals, even though it does not apply in the case of contributions?

Thank you!",finance
CryptoCurrency,"Some lessons can't be taught, you have to experience them!","Ok people, story time.

I'm a small time investor, started last year during the COVID downfall and made some gains (I'm from Brazil, and I'm in the green with my learnings in markets and finance). I decided in January to put some money in crypto, specifically XRP, beucase I liked the project and I like the case its having with the SEC (buy when others are fearful) and been accompanying it since.

For arguments sake, I'll disclose the amounts here, but don't worry, I have other things I wont disclose, but this needs to be told and understood here: **THIS IS A LESSON YOU WON'T LEARN! ITS A LESSON YOU HAVE TO EXPERIENCE! I CAN'T STRESS THIS ENOUGH! The FUD is real, and it hits us all one time in this game.** Once it hits you and you see the crap you did, you can only blame yourself and become wiser in the process.

I thought I understood the panic selling and could avoid it. I failed. Because of that, I had not so good Sunday (Thanks Girlfriend for actually making me forget about this) and I was furious today (monday). Its good, it clears the mind and makes me set my goals back in the track.

**THE BEGINNING**

I bought XRP in mid-january. I ended up buying 1015 XRP for R$ 1500 (US$ 0.25/coin). I decided to hodl it, and diversified on more coins on Binance (this XRP was in a brazilian exchange, with legal ties to our SEC, so I could expect some form of legal protection). I saw this coin go from R$ 1,49 (US$ 0.25) to R$ 11 (US$ 1.90). 

I was estatic. I had put R$ 1500 (U$ 250) of my emergency fund into it. This constituted half of my Emergency fund at the time (I have stock and reits in Brasil, which can easily add a years salary, so I thought ""its fine""). I had a job (but lost 2/3 of my income in it, as a teaches, since there were no more classes for me to teach this year).

Made my sheets, checked the numbers, I could survive the rest of the years on what I had to recieve and stuff like that. Ok, its fine.

I figured I had done my DD and that would be enough to appease me. And it did. We saw some corrections from January until last week, and I held firmly in it, as I thought ""were in a bullrun, its fine"". I saw the ATH of my wallet at R$ 15.000 (US$ 2700) drop to R$ 8.000 (US$ 1.550) and I held strong. As any human being, I was worried if would all crash and burn, but I held and saw it bounce back to R$ 12.000 (US$ 2100). Not back, considering I put in less that US$ 350 in total on crypto.

**THE LAST WEEK**

We all saw it. The huge correction on this Bullrun. All coins suffered. XRP suffered a 250% correction in price (from R$ 8.96 high this week to R$ 3.64). This was bigger and deeper than the last corrections this year. Its considered normal, but people have to remember: **THIS YEAR IS DIFFERENT! Quantitive easing, FED stimulus checks, inflation increase on the horizon, inflated stock market prices. Anyone who finds fun in this knows its unsustainable.**

And even so, the dips were reasonable and expected. But not this correction as it was made. For a first timer, dips that recover the next day or two are normal (as in stock markets, a bad week is OK, since it might drop 5% of your holdings). What is new to ALMOST EVERYONE is a week long 50% BTC crash that had no time to stop. This is considered a crash in any other market, since the recovery is long and hard.

**WHAT HAPPENED?**

Remember those XRP? I saw them drop down, and down, and down, and with all the FUD, I though I was resilient (and I did buy on the drop with some extra money, so no harm done). Sunday came and more dips and no money to buy. Then I decided to stay in the echo chamber that is reddit. 

**MISTAKE #1**

We all know the world economy is fucked. QE is making money useless, fiat is being debased all around, COVID destroyed a lot of job opportunities for a lot of us. And here in Brazil, I still am high enough income to not recieve any government aid of any kind. Life is livable, but became harder than last year. Lets not even talk about ALL the FUD on crypto last week, but that was part of the problem.

There was a post talking about how the Hedge funds and banks are fucked and decided to pull out of crypto to save themselves. That in on itself isn't the problem, is the after on crypto if we went on  a 2008 crisis again (which we might, and now I get why crypto is important). I remember Michael Burry also betting against inflation (dude that predicted the 2008 crash) and inflations reports. I got FUDed, and was actually feeling bad in the stomach.

**MISTAKE #2** 

Remember that I bought in January? When I decided to cash out yesterday, I was still having 261% gains on my initial buy? Then WHY did I sell? FUD made me lock those gains. Purely out of fear of losing the rest. See XRP drop from R$ 11 to R$ 3.64 was the second FUD.

This was a mistake as I have bought coins at a price we might never see again (if we do, I'll do whatever it takes to buy in more again). Its was a mixture of feelings. Happy to withdraw cash, but sad that the market started rebound there and there, and furious because of this expensive mistake I made.

I was in the green, didn't need the money, and still was FUDed into selling.

**LESSON LEARNED**

I needed this to happen. To understand what FUD is and how it affects us. I understand and saw every one talking about FUD, but I needed it to happen to me to become more aware of it. I was so mad at me for such a mistake, that I though I was immune and wasn't. HODLing would have made my gains now be at 330%, and this mistake will haunt me for a long time.

THIS IS GOOD! THIS IS A LESSON THAT WE NEED TO LEARN IN BLOOD! We can all say we should be FUDed out of the market, but we have to have that slap in the face to really understand it.

Out of pure rage, anger and spite, I bought 505 XRP back with the earnings. I was one of the lucky ones in this FUD tale. I could recoup my initial investment and put the rest back in XRP. Is less coins? yes! But I'm still in the game and with some money on the pocket for my bills.

I would never have trully understand FUD without this stupid mistake I made. I was used to the stock market, where we don't see 40% increases in a day. Once those 70% come down, we have to wait months, maybe years to recover.

personalfinance,Student loan forgiveness vs lower mortgage interest rate?,"I am buying a home and qualify for the SmartBuy program which is a loan forgiveness program that offers to pay off up to 15% of the home cost in student loans. 

I have about 18k in student loans, all unsub or subsidized, so all would be covered.  

With this program, my mortgage rate would be locked at 3.75%. My floating rate right now with a conventional loan is 3.25% with the possibility of it going lower as closing isn't until August. 

Does it make sense to pay at a higher interest rate for 30 years in order to eliminate the rest of my loans?",finance
personalfinance,Evaluating A Cash-Out Refi Option,"Does anyone have a good framework for evaluating whether the term of a particular cash-out refinance are financially advantageous?

I own a rental property worth about $200k with a remaining loan of $81k at 4.25% with 22 years left. I am considering taking about $30k of cash out of that equity, reducing the interest rate to 3.875%, and resetting the loan term to 30 years. Closing costs are about $3.5k.

I think the most straightforward approach is to compare the present values of the two mortgage payments, one over 22 years and the other over 30, using the 10-year treasury rate as a discount rate. 

What do you think? I plan to use the cash as part of a downpayment on another property, but I don’t want to complicate the analysis with that, if it turns out that the refi alone is a good move.",finance

personalfinance,Took a lot a loan for 3000 dollars,I took out a personal loan about a2 weeks ago. For some personal reasons my mom was going through some shit. But now that’s passed. We thought we gonna able to use it but since she’s fine now I have no idea what to do with this money. Theya are asking for 107 twice a month But I was thinking about using the loan and take 500 out each month instead of 107 they are asking for 17.5 apr. is it possible to possibly return the money or can I just keep on taking out of the loan to pay off that loan? (Maybe to build credit) Obviously this was not a good idea at all. I bank with navy fed btw. Plz don’t judge ik that was super  stupid of me but I thought it and would help my mom .,finance

Of all the circulating USD right now, 20% of them were printed by the US Federal Reserve last year to pay for those stimulus package.

Basically your fiat crashed too, by at least 20%. 

With your cryptos you know it will grow over time.  US Gov will only print more and devalue your fiat.  There is a crash in fiat every few years.

personalfinance,Not sure what to do about my car loan.,"I purchased a car in January 2019. I traded in my old car that I owed around 10k and rolled that into the new loan. Looking back, I never should have done it as my old car was just fine. I had a low payment and low interest rate but I just didn’t like the car. 

Fast forward to now, the payoff on my car is around 25k and the car is worth about 11k. I owe more on the loan at this point than I did when I bought the car. Due to the pandemic and the payment on the car that I can barely afford, I have taken way too many extensions on the loan. When I talked to them last in December, they said I’ve only actually made 12 payments on the car. Every day, the balance increases by $10 and every payment I make of $520 goes right to interest. I’m currently behind on the loan as well. 

I’ve tried refinancing but the two companies who gave me the time of day laughed me off the phone once they found out how much I owe and what it’s worth. My mom is a co-signer on the car so I don’t want to just give it back and screw her over. 

I have trash credit and no money to get out of this. I’m coming here to see if anyone has any other ideas or options on what to do. Is my only option to just keep paying on it until it’s paid off? TIA for any help!",finance
personalfinance,Loan repayment to free up cash flow. Looking for some advice.,"Hey Personal Finance, hope everyone is well as it's been a minute.

I have two outstanding loans right now, I'm looking to pay off one of these here in the next month or so.  We have our second kiddo due in a month, and that means more future child care expenses. woohoo!  

&amp;#x200B;

Our goal is to free up cashflow that we're currently paying to an outstanding loan and rolling those funds into daycare payments.

&amp;#x200B;

Loan 1: car loan.

Outstanding: $19,500

Rate: 2.99%

Monthly payback: $394

Notes: 4 years, 6 months remaining. Just purchased 6 months ago.

&amp;#x200B;

Loan 2: downpayment on house loan.

Outstanding: $18,400

Rate: 1.625%

Monthly payback: $240

Notes:  This loan was borrowed from my TSP and I currently pay myself back every check. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So here is my dilemma. 

Loan 1: We have a higher interest rate loan, held by a bank, that would free up more monthly cash.  

Loan 2: Paying this off would be less cash flow, which is fine, any cash flow incoming is better then none, but the big thing is I pay this off, it goes back to reinvesting in myself and the future.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Would love to hear any thoughts on the matter Personal Finance. I'm leaning towards Loan2 right now since it's against myself, despite the lower rate and lower cash flow.

2. We just experienced a big flash crash in price. A prime suspect is the drop in hash rate in BTC due to the Blackouts in China. Is the crypto space ready to accept that Nakamoto style consensus on PoW leads directly to unacceptable levels of centralization? This has been the dirty secret of PoW crypto and its decentralization loving enthusiasts for years.

3. Charles posted a somewhat cryptic tweet that read “Omega + Hydra + Mithral = GG”. The Ourobors Omega, Ouroboros Hydra, &amp; Mithral parts we’ve covered before. Omega is a capstone rollup of Praos (2017), Genesis (2018), + Redux, +Chronos, +Ledger Combiners, +some other things from the rest of the space. Hydra is layer two. Mithral is trustless light wallets via zk-SNARKs. Guesses as to the “GG” ranged from “Good Game” (as in game over for competitors) to “Goguen”.

10. Shahaf Bar-Geffen, CEO of COTI (the first recipient of a Cardano CFund investment), says he just finished recording his segment in the Africa special which he mentioned was airing at the end of April prior to the IOHK announcement of April 29th. He also said: 1) ADA Pay may be ready in early May or maybe even late April; 2) there will be a big launch for ADA Pay and once the Africa Special airs “everything will connect”; 3) “people are probably not getting how big this is….but you will down the line”; 4) COTI integration with a major exchange is happening, progress is not as quick as they would like, but it’s progressing; 5) last week they released the possible designs for debit cards, they are even considering some designs submitted by the community; 6) and iOS and Android integration is coming along nicely and well on the way.

14. Recap from yesterday: the Africa Special Announcements revealed some additional puzzle pieces 1) COTI’s AdaPay is possibly the larger payments infrastructure puzzle piece, 2) [payway.et](https://payway.et/) is possibly the local payments puzzle piece, 3) [yellowcard.io](https://yellowcard.io/) is possibly the local coin exchange puzzle piece, and 4) World Mobile (not mentioned at [africa.cardano.org](https://africa.cardano.org/) AFAIK) may be the network connectivity puzzle piece. I think they are going to connect a lot of disparate pieces for us on the 29th.

16. Rick interviewed CardStarter which is a Cardano accelerator. The interesting items are 1) it appears they are purporting to somehow insure their community backers against certain financial losses with caveats, 2) they plan to fund projects prior to token launch through token vouchers, and 3) it sounds like they are building a DEX called Card Swap. Notice that the “insurance” comes with caveats. They were very transparent on that point and people should take notice. Is CardStarter good? Is it bad? I have no idea.

Reddit user [/u/ricklepicklemydickle](https://www.reddit.com/user/ricklepicklemydickle/) first alerted us to the World Mobile developments and then youtube user [Whiskey 1234](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyBeEq-paultoA127TYcDjQ) (love both usernames btw) let us know that he attended a conference where he encountered World Mobile and “asked them if they knew about Cardano blockchain and the reply was they were announcing partners at the end of this month.” Thank you very much for this intel guys.This is what Army of Spies is all about. Many thanks for your contributions, gentlemen.

24. Kraken publishes a “What is Cardano?” article. Says “...Cardano may not promise new ground-breaking features..” Oh yeah? What about native tokens that don’t require smart contracts? What about the EUTXO model allowing predictable and accurate local calculation of transaction fees in your wallet before you execute? What about a consensus algorithm that’s so good, another top 10 coin made their system derivative of it? That’s all standard these days?

31. Charles also covers his projections about interoperability and the future converging on a “wifi moment” when an interoperable “internet of blockchains” emerges. In this future, it will be a race to the bottom and the systems that are too expensive to operate will simply be priced out of the game.

36. Today is the Cardano Africa Special. It’ll be at 9:30am Pacific, 10:30am Mountain, 12:30pm Eastern, 5:30pm Dublin, 7:30pm Addis Ababa, 11:30pm Bangkok. 1:30amTokyo. Go enjoy! We’ll recap it after.
37. In today’s video we also cover questions about the relationship between Atala Prism and ADA and who will actually benefit from the Cardano Projects with African governments.
38. The Africa Special made it clear that Cardano has a brilliant grand strategy for the developing world. As framed by John O’Connor this would be: 1) provide digital identity; 2) provide digital transfer of value; and 3) provide programmability of that digital value.
39. Mickey Watkins (CEO of World Mobile) added a step zero to the formula above with: 0) provide access to the digital world.
40. As has previously been mentioned, it was officially announced that Cardano is partnered with World Mobile to provide digital connectivity to people in the developing world starting in Tanzania. They plan to have 100k subscribers in Zanzibar by the end of the year.
41. This is just the beginning in Africa. John O’Connor had a nice tweet that very succinctly laid out some future plans. [https://twitter.com/jjtoconnor/status/1387919060197855234](https://twitter.com/jjtoconnor/status/1387919060197855234)
42. Coindesk editor refuses to acknowledge that Cardano has a deal with a national government, gets relentlessly trolled, then finally capitulates and decides to cover the Ethiopian Ministry of Education project.

43. The Cardano Africa Mini addition gives us more details on the actual rollout of the Ethiopia Ministry of Education deal: 1) all 700k teachers and a subset of the students who will get tablets will be registered in the first year; 2) all secondary school students will be registered in the second year which will bring us to 5MM students; and 3) the data will be used to analyze both students and teachers.

44. If you don’t believe that Atala runs on Cardano please watch this video which lays out definitely and exactly how Atala runs on Cardano. Please feel free to wantonly debunk anyone on the interwebs who says otherwise. Thank you to IOHK technical architect Alexis Hernandez for this video!

45. I don’t know if everyone watched the last few minutes of the Africa Special. But, I think a lot of people missed the section where John O’Connor said the goal of Cardano in Africa is to issue 100 MILLION digital identities in the next two years. To give you some idea of scale here, adapools.org shows a highest ever daily number of new wallets at around 71k. If we onboard 100 Million people via digital identity over two years that would be 136,986 people per day. ETH only has 150MM unique wallets to date. [https://youtu.be/yRjj662kJsk?t=8615](https://youtu.be/yRjj662kJsk?t=8615) [https://adapools.org/analysis-query/wallets](https://adapools.org/analysis-query/wallets) [https://etherscan.io/chart/address](https://etherscan.io/chart/address)
46. John also mentioned that all of the 100k subscribers to World Mobile in Zanzibar this year will have digital identities on Atala Prism. They will also be offering so-called “RealFi” loans by Q1 of next year that will be made via Cardano liquidity and will act as a bridge to real world value. [https://youtu.be/yRjj662kJsk?t=8628](https://youtu.be/yRjj662kJsk?t=8628)
47. Charlie Munger thinks crypto is “disgusting”. That’s a wonderful thing because it tells you how early you are. This is especially true in Cardano which is a project that leads with empathy for the developing world. Will he still call that disgusting if we’ve brought financial inclusiveness to an entire continent in five or ten years. Probably he won’t say anything because he won’t have lived that long. But, you get the point.

53. Doge Mania might be hitting a new peak (as a cultural artifact at least) tonight with Elon’s appearance on SNL. There are many different perspectives you can take on how this might impact ADA. I find the following two the most interesting: 1) if the Doge pump is followed by an inevitable crash it could sour a giant group of new adopters on crypto; or 2) it might be a gateway drug that will turn a large group of new adopters on to better projects.

58. ADA is the most crypto of all cryptos. George of CryptosRUs pointed out in a recent video that he couldn’t find any trace of a VC firm owning Cardano in its portfolio in his search of the categories section on CMC. This makes sense if you know Cardano. Would freedom and decentralization loving Satoshi not throw up a little in his mouth to find out that VC ownership of cryptos was a metric people would care about in 2021? The lack of VC stake in the very decentralized and freedom loving Cardano only adds to our already iron-clad claim on the mantle of the most crypto of all crypto projects. Our ecosystem never sought to attract VC money that would only centralize ownership in a smaller number of hands. This doesn’t even address the current extreme centralization of block validation in BTC and ETH.

60. Cardano saw a new challenger enter the scene with Internet Computer (ICP) debuting very high on the CoinMarketCap charts. However, a look into ICP makes one question whether they are really in the Gen. 3 Blockchain race at all given that available information indicates the blockchain runs via datacenters hosting standardized hardware and that those datacenters can only join the network with the permission of the “Network Nervous System”. You could say that the winner of the Gen. 3 Blockchain race needs to solve the blockchain trilemma of decentralization, security, and scalability. If that’s true, then it’s arguable that ICP is not even competing in the decentralization leg of the race. [https://youtu.be/zHl-oVPoX88?t=97](https://youtu.be/zHl-oVPoX88?t=97)

84. The ISO model entering the capital formation toolbox in Cardano is going to make the stake pool game extremely interesting with SPOs scrambling to find the right balance between rewarding ADA and giving their delegators other things like tokens. Some stake pools could even become like portfolio funds with relationships with many different projects the tokens of which are given to delegators. Babel Fees could also play a role here for smart SPOs as they may allow access to a wide variety of tokens in the ecosystem that could be used to reward delegators with a sort of index fund exposure to a wide variety of Cardano projects.

personalfinance,"Buying a 2 family with in-laws, some questions on the logistics.","So Me (24) and my Fiancé (24) are going to be looking at purchasing a two family home in a HCOL area (northeast) in the next couple of months. We will be living in one of the units and my (soon to be) in laws will be buying the other half. This is their secondary residence and their half will be paid in cash. 

Numbers:

* House cost: 50% of $900k - $1.2Mil - we will be splitting it evenly and setting up a trust defining 
ownership split and shared expenses.

*  Mortgage amount: $450k-$600k - we are planning on putting the smallest amount down as possible, since we don't have to worry about PMI and interest rates are so low. 

* Combined Income: $181k Gross | $122k Take-home

* Combined Current Debt: ~$35k student loans | ~$35k car loans

* Combined Savings: $35k ($20k of that is Emergency) - saving an additional $3400 each month

* Upcoming expenses: $15k - wedding in Summer 2022
 
General Feedback/Advice is appreciated but I also have these specific questions:

* How to structure this for the mortgage application, we want to take advantage of the cash down on the in-laws side to enable us to not have to put anything down if possible, to allow for new house/wedding expenses. Should they be listed on the mortgage or should their downpayment be in the form of a cash ""gift""

* Can we take advantage of first time home buyer tax incentives?

* Are any of the closing costs fees that would be incurred when purchasing the house with cash? Looking to see what, if any, should be split with the in-laws
* Preliminarily seeing 30 year fixed as 2.88% (2.97% APR) with ~$15k in closing costs, my thinking was we could just up our mortgage amount by $15k (lowering the amount the in-laws have to pay), and have the in-laws pay us $15k in order to effectively eliminate out of pocket closing costs and roll them into the (very low interest) loan. Any flaws in that logic?

Thanks for the help/feedback.",finance

But now I am wondering how this will hold up in a stick market crash when institutional investment moved to bonds due to the fed raising rates to 2% to stop inflation. Do just the bad stocks go down and the stocks that are not effected by inflation go up? Or do all stocks go down?

This area is pretty expensive, so I'm trying to work out a budget that can help me plan ahead. I'd like some advice or feedback regarding my current planned budget.

I am single and have no children/pets/cars. Health insurance is provided by the school. I will also be mostly using the school transportation, biking, and the metro to move around.

According to online calculators, my federal and state taxes will be about 5.5k, which leaves me with a budget of 3k/month. 

Currently, I am looking at places where rent+utilitites is about 1.6k, and I usually spend about 400 a month on food. If I save 10% of my after-taxes income, then that leaves me with about $700 of spending money for all other expenses. Is this a reasonable amount? I don't have a lot of big expenses after that, so I'm unsure what else to take into consideration.

personalfinance,Mortgage interest rates,"We are in the process of building a house and can either lock in a rate of 3.125% now at 120 days out, or we can wait until 60 days and could potentially get a lower rate if things were to fluctuate down. Of course the risk here is that rates might only go up and then we might be stuck with a rate higher than 3.125. But then if we lock in now, we run the risk of being stuck at 3.125 even if going rates are lower when we close in 120 days. I know it’s pretty much a gamble either way, but I’d love to hear opinions if there are any experts on the current market and how things are expected to go in the coming months.",finance

personalfinance,Buying a Truck - Change My Mind,"Am I crazy for wanting to follow through with this?

I found a great deal on a 2019 Big Horn Ram 1500 Crew Cab 4WD. Truck is $35,500 with a fair market value of $40,400. It has 18K miles and 5 months left on the 3 YR / 36,000 factory warranty. They are also offering $3K for my current car (2011 Subaru Legacy) which I value at $2,750. I can put $15,000 down and do a 5 year financing of $350 / month. 

I've always wanted a truck and I've REALLY wanted one since becoming a homeowner with a decent sized yard. The thing is I don't really ""need"" one. I work from home and many days the only driving I do is 10 minutes to the gym and back. It would have some legitimate uses for me though. Currently if I need to use a truck, which does come up a decent amount for home projects, my 65 year old father drives his truck to help me out. I do have a serious GF and she has the same set up with her dad. Before we would take the step of living together for my own pride (kind of joking) it would be great to be able to facilitate project hauling myself. Below is my current financial picture.

My monthly expenses are around $3,500 - $3,750 and my gross pay is $87,000 / YR which is about $4,450 / month net.

CryptoCurrency,Is crypto 'currency' an accurate term?,"Coins seen to be often viewed as an analog for commodities, stocks, or annuities, but not necessarily currency. The number of dollars that a token is worth seems very important. As is the movement against the stock market as a selection of where to place dollars. Or the apy for staking. There are innumerable calls to action to hold. Comparisons to gold are everywhere. People seem to want coins for projects they believe in, and exchanging dollars for them increases market price. Coins seen more a way to build capital without a company (project) issuing common stock. Or as a hedge against inflation. Or as a way to earn dollars. The very idea to dca in and never exchange out seems, in a way, antithetical to the purpose of currency.

I don't see much of any major push to make direct purchases with crypto, just to buy crypto with dollars and then take profits in dollars at some point. There also doesn't seem to be much of a push to exchange labor for crypto directly. So the idea of a currency, a store of value, doesn't seem to actually be there at the moment. It seems more a way to accumulate wealth, the same way we exchange our efforts for dollars, and then exchange those dollars for what we ultimately want to hold long term. In other words, dollars remain the currency. With so many projects it doesn't seem likely that we'd settle on one of this current crop as an exchange of our time and effort, at least in lieu of dollars. Either because they are worth too much in the long run to give up to someone else, or not worth enough to receive.

Is this good or bad for cryptocurrency acceptance? And does this impact acceptance of blockchain technology as a whole, or just these individual projects using the technology in different ways? Or another question, would a digital federal US dollar on blockchain be more likely than one of these current projects to become the new version of currency?",cryptocurrency

stocks,Can someone explain the inflation worry when the banks have excess liquidity?,"If banks have an excess amount of liquidity and the fed is trying to get people to spend money, why would the fed raise interest rates and make it more beneficial for people to hold onto their money? To me it only makes sense to drop interest rates to the negatives so people are forced to spend money or lose it. People aren’t going to spend money when commodity prices are high, so deflation would also prove to be beneficial for the economy IMO.        

How does increased interest rates cause more spending when all it does is cause commodities to go up and force more people to spend significantly less? Negative interest rates are also something that will boost retail growth as retail businesses will be able to borrow money at a negative rate and pay their employees a higher wage to get their business started/back running.       

If I’m not mistaken, back when Europe was in a negative rate environment, didnt Powell say he would consider negative rates when America is trying to reopen?

vet,"13 year old lab has suspected Splenic tumour, what should I do.","Hi Everyone, I’m looking for some advice on what my next steps should be after the vet diagnosed my dog with a suspected splenic tumour. 

My 13 year old lab Rocky was fine and healthy until Saturday when he had a small seizure and fell down the stairs. I rushed him to the emergency vet and he stayed overnight. The vet told me he has fluid in his abdomen (ascites), a heart murmur, pale gums, mild anaemia and a suspected splenic tumour. To properly diagnose the tumour he has to have an echo graph and if he is diagnosed then he will have to have surgery. However these are all costly procedures and would cost me over £6k+, I am a student and took over looking after Rocky after my dad died so it won’t be possible for Rocky to have surgery as I don’t have the money. 

Since coming home from the vet I’ve noticed that Rocky is always uncomfortable and fidgety. It takes him a while to lie down comfortably, he is in pain and has become lethargic and can barely do a 10 minute walk now. Today he had an episode of fly-catching after I fed him, it’s the first one he’s had. 

I am thinking of maybe taking him to get an echo graph done to confirm whether or not it is a splenic tumour however with the fluid in his abdomen and other symptoms the vet said it is highly likely that it is a splenic tumour. 

Can anyone give me any advice as I am really stressed out and upset, I’m worried that Rocky will have a seizure again or that he’ll die any second, I’ve spent nearly £2k the last few days and Rocky and I are supposed to be moving to a new city a few hours away in a couple of months which I’m not sure will be possible.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Help Reviewing Offer from Landlord,"Hi fellow Redditors. I live in San Jose, CA in a rental house that gets UNBEARABLY hot in summer - upwards of 95 degrees in the house and due to lack of cross-ventilation it's really hard to effectively cool the house. We have a lot of existing measure in place to try and keep cool, but it is as though the house is not sufficiently insulated.

We asked if our landlord was willing to put in AC for us, and he agreed on the following terms:

1. We each pay 50% upfront ( I imagine we would pay him, and he pays the company doing the work - this would be so he can can claim the capital improvement on his taxes and depreciate the expense annually over 27.5 years)
2. We could then deduct $100 from each month's rent going forward until we are made whole. Based on the estimates, this will take \~3 years to accomplish.

The catch is, we don't plan to stay here for 3 full years; we plan to buy a house before our daughter begins school. We will likely stay somewhere in the neighborhood of \~2 years, depending on how the real estate market goes. If we continue to see double-digit YoY increases in the areas we are looking OR if interest rates shoot up significantly from where they are now, we would consider moving sooner. It would at LEAST one year from now, and we will likely push that out as long as we can given the offer the landlord has made.

So, I am asking the court of public opinion: would you consider this worthwhile to do?

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, May 24, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, May 24, 2021**

After weeks of volatility, stocks rallied today as fears over rising inflation forcing the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy tempered. As I have said for weeks, there are several reasons I thought the initial reaction to the April Consumer Price Index, which saw the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) lose 4% in three trading days, was overdone and I am glad to have taken advantage of the dip particularly in technology stocks. The SPY closed 1.01% and is only 3 points away from its all-time high. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 1.68% higher and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed .56% higher. 

As the US economy reopens, we are seeing a surge in consumer spending (we saw a 10.8% increase in spending in March), supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand, which of course, causes a rise in prices. As the economic reopening continues and supply in various consumer industries is able to catch up, inflation is expected to slow down. In a nutshell, this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures “transitory”.

Moreover, while the market was shaken by the April Consumer Index, as has been reiterated in the recap before, the Federal Reserve has consistently said they are looking towards significant progress in the labor market before any significant adjustments to monetary policy are considered. In the Federal Reserve’s April meeting minutes, “participants generally noted that the economy remained far from the Committee’s maximum-employment and price-stability goals”.  Jerome Powell and other monetary officials have reiterated several times that they want to see a “string” of strong labor reports before major adjustments to policy are considered. The April Job Reports showed only 266,000 jobs added back to the economy, widely missing analyst expectations and marking a sharp deceleration in job growth from March, bolsters that argument.

On a slightly sour note, the meeting minutes also said a number of participants suggested” that as the economy continues to quickly, “it might be appropriate at some point in upcoming meetings to begin discussing a plan for adjusting the pace of asset purchase”, which have currently been going at a rate of $120 billion per month. However, it’s important to note the meeting toke place before the release of the April Jobs report, which greatly bolsters Powell and other monetary officials' argument that the labor market remains below the Fed’s targets and roughly 8.2 million jobs short compared to pre-pandemic times. onth. However, this is not a surprising statement and one Powell himself has said before. Back in an April 14 meeting, Powell said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.” As a reminder, quantitative easing is a process in which the Fed buys government bonds in order to inject money into the economy. It is only natural that as the economy recovers, less money needs to be injected into the economy in this manner. The Federal Reserve gave absolutely no signal it was even considering beginning discussion on raising interest rates, which is what market participants are really concerned about.

**Highlights**

* The court case between Epic Games and Apple (AAPL) s expected to end this week as both sides prepare closing arguments. As a reminder, Epic Games is accusing Apple of antitrust behavior by taking a 30% commission from sales in the app store and blocking companies from using third-party payment options. Apple says it prevents third-party software to ensure consumer protection and the commission is in-line with other app-store developers, like Alphabet. The result of this case will have very wide ranging implications.
* Amazon (AMZN) is reportedly nearing a deal to buy the Hollywood studio MGM for roughly $9 billion, in a deal that would turn the movie studio into a streaming asset for AMZN. According to people familiar with the matter, a deal could close as soon as next week.
* Investors have rejected a record number of executive compensation plans in non-binding votes of U.S.-listed companies this year, objecting to pay rises and the easing of performance targets in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to an analysis by consulting firm ISS Corporate Solutions. I hope this trend continues moving forward and urge shareholders to continue voting no on potential compensation plans. A record 14 S&amp;P 500 companies had more than 50% of investors reject executive pay packages so far this year.

personalfinance,Employer being stupid about short unpaid leave.,"My wife is pregnant and wishes to take 3 additional weeks of unpaid leave after her 12 weeks of job protected leave. She's an ICU nurse with several years experience and qualifications at a tier 1 hospital system - a highly in demand role. She also receives the highest marks and is highly regarded. She also can get another job at another hospital system pretty easily, but for sake of this post lets assume she wants to continue working at this facility.

She met with HR to discuss leave and get STD setup and made her inquiry on the 3 additional weeks. They said they have no policy on short term unpaid leave, and since she will have no PTO (because its used during FMLA), they said it would be unallowed. She pressed for clarification that this means they would terminate her on a basis of principal despite being understaffed etc. They said yes.

She has yet to meet with her manager but let's assume this is fact for a moment. She wouldn't be leaving any cards on the table her 401K is fully vested and she has no PTO or any other ""unvested"" balances so to speak. If she returns to this hospital system (major provider in our area) in 60 days or less, her tenure does not reset and she retains her PTO accrual rate etc.

So what would you do in this case? Give notice two weeks before FMLA ends and then just re-apply for your same job after your 3 weeks of unpaid leave? They would most certainly hire her, nurses in the ICU post thevirus are extremely shorthanded at least in our area.

Other than this being a dumb situation where the employer is being extremely shortsighted - is there anything else about this situation that I am missing?",finance

2. The Federal Reserve


3. Central Banks


4. Inflation 


5. Fiat currency

I could probably rattle off several more great areas to study and delve into but these 7 are great starting points and its very easy to get side tracked on YouTube and Google going into a lot of other educational side topics.



Most of those who study these areas in depth will slowly begin to realize the the massive role bitcoin will play in the near future and the more you study the more convicted you will become while all the other noise in the background fades away.

I already have tenants lined up for the property and we'd get about $5,000/month in rent (there are two units in the building). House is appraised for about $875k and the current mortgage is $1080/month with about $190k remaining at 4.75% .

For the down payment we'd look to do a cash out refi for an additional $260k, making the new loan about $450k. I was surprised that the new rates I was offered weren't better - the best being 4.125%. For what it's worth, according to my lender the FICO score they're looking at is 668 (FICO 8 scores are in the 690s).

Am I crazy for being taken aback by the refinance option? I know interest rates have gone up a bit over the last week, but expected to get something below 4%.",finance

personalfinance,Looking for new auto loan advice,"I'm looking to purchase my first brand new vehicle within the next few months and have been looking around online to see what I pre-qualify for. To preface my questions: I currently make $95,000/year gross, have a 750 FICO score, and have a good DTI ratio. However it seems when I go to websites like Carvana, or see what I pre-qualify for on Credit Karma, I sometimes don't even qualify for any vehicle over about $45,000 at any interest rate or loan term. On Carvana, any vehicle in the $40,000-45,000 range that I do have offers for, the interest rate is around 6-8% even with around $7,000 down. For example, I'm looking at a $55,000 vehicle right now on Carvana and the loan terms are $7,000 down/6.26% APR/72 months...

Realistically I would like to spend no more than $50,000 out the door on a new vehicle. Whether or not purchasing a $40,000-50,000 vehicle is a good move, I feel like I could walk into a dealership and qualify for at least a lower interest rate, if not 0% when available, if they're wanting me to put $7,000 down. Am I mistaken in thinking that? Are these types of online sites reliable? I'm trying to do my research as best I can by running the numbers through these sites but I'm getting discouraged with the options presented to me at this time. I don't want to go to a dealership and have them run my credit, find that I don't qualify, and walk out with a ding on my credit and nothing to show for it. I'm trying to get myself in the best position possible to qualify for a new auto loan with the best terms as possible. I should be able to bump my score up around 10-15 points within the next couple months but I can't imagine that would make a huge difference. I understand a lot of factors play into this but any insight and recommendations would be appreciated!",finance

dogecoin,My idea and future for what is currently Doge Coin,"@dogecoin_devs so I was thinking you guys were already doing this but I will say it here just in case you arent. 

Fork Doge, call it the Musk Coin. Musk Coin is then like Doge but it’s finite not unlimited. It can’t be mined and is instead Proof of Stake so all Musk holders will be incentivized to hold and stake their money because they will earn interest on it. When they want to spend some Doge they make plans and unstake the amount they want to spend. 

I’m assuming this is already in the works and that’s why he’s been working with developers. Anyway that’s what I’d do if I was Elon. But Doge needs to be limited not unlimited. We don’t want to create a US dollar copy. The Fed literally moves assets off of banks balance sheets but doesn’t send them cash for it. They just take it like they never owned it.

The way it could work in simple terms is that you offer retail investors the ability to transfer/exchange their crypto assets into this theoretical dollar at a reduced tax rate or tax free for a set period of time. This would create a win/win situation and actually attract uptake of the digital dollar as well as international investors.

personalfinance,"If you have private student loans, now may be the best time to refinance","I dont know if people have been broadcasting this or not, but if you have private student loans, nows the time to get them refinanced. The national forbearance ends Sept 30. It may get extended a bit longer which will help keep interest rates lower. But if you have private loans, you are accruing interest and rates are likely to be as low as they will be for a long time. With economy recovering too, they are liable to increase as time goes on.

I did a lot of shopping around and found penfed, sofi, ernest and laurel road to give lowest rates. Splash will help you find a cheap lender too. I refinanced and got 3.7% on one and 4.2% on another.

personalfinance,Get a mortgage or purchase my home in cash?,"I am purchasing my first home and luckily with some family help the idea of buying it all in cash is there. The purchase price is roughly $410k. It's a new construction townhome 3 bd 2.5 bath 2 car garage, with it being completed in less than 3 months. My state has no income tax, but property tax is going to be around $6k.

I know if I do a mortgage on it I could start itemizing deductions which in theory would save me money... but should I do it?
I know that my interest and property taxes would be deducted but at the end of the day interest is interest. Cash price would make my closing costs a lot lower too.

If I were to go through 30 year financing the interest rate is around 3.13% after putting a 250k down payment, with closing costs roughly around $10k after builder/lender credits. With my income roughly around 53k-56k I feel like the itemized deduction route is just marginal, max of maybe $15k if I just look at interest and SALT alone.

My company gives a 100% match up to 2.5K each year, so I am incentivized to pay only 2.5K a year. However, in my industry, it's pretty common to hop companies every 1-3 years. If I change companies within that time frame, maybe my new company won't have this match. I have until late october each year to do this.

What would you all recommend me to? Should I wait for federal loan forgiveness? Should I pay 2.5K a year and risk accruing unnecessary interest if I leave my company and my new company doesn't have this perk? Or should I just pay it all this year (but leave money on the table via not taking advantage of the 2.5K annual match)",finance

  * Betterment's checking account is missing points 5, 6 and 8 but point 8 could be alleviated by using a [Betterment Cash Reserve](https://www.betterment.com/cash-reserve/) account along with the checking. Transfers would have to be instant which I'm not sure is supported
* [Robinhood Cash Management](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/what-is-cash-management/)
  * Robinhood is missing points 2, 3, 5, 7, 9.

31. The Africa Bird lands a few days early!!!!!!!! It’s a deal with the Ethiopian Ministry of Education to provide a Cardano ID solution and unified records system for 5 million Ethiopian students. Charles says there will be more news tomorrow at the Africa Special.[ https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/27/business/dealbook/tesla-earnings-bitcoin.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/27/business/dealbook/tesla-earnings-bitcoin.html).[ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOTRp3PQKVk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOTRp3PQKVk).[ https://twitter.com/IOHKMedia/status/1387051830442553351](https://twitter.com/IOHKMedia/status/1387051830442553351)[ https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/27/blockchain-finally-comes-of-age-with-worlds-biggest-blockchain-deployment/](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/27/blockchain-finally-comes-of-age-with-worlds-biggest-blockchain-deployment/)[ https://www.cityam.com/ethiopia-overhauls-its-education-system-with-iohk-blockchain-partnership/](https://www.cityam.com/ethiopia-overhauls-its-education-system-with-iohk-blockchain-partnership/)
32. We’re getting reports from Army of Spies member /u/[ ricklepicklemydickle](https://www.reddit.com/user/ricklepicklemydickle) that World Mobile is reporting in its telegram group that it will be dropping some news tomorrow!
33. A new Cardano metrics platform has launched [https://cardanowaves.com/](https://cardanowaves.com/)
34. Today is the Cardano Africa Special. It’ll be at 9:30am Pacific, 10:30am Mountain, 12:30pm Eastern, 5:30pm Dublin, 7:30pm Addis Ababa, 11:30pm Bangkok. 1:30amTokyo. Go enjoy! We’ll recap it after.
35. In today’s video we also cover questions about the relationship between Atala Prism and ADA and who will actually benefit from the Cardano Projects with African governments.
36. The Africa Special made it clear that Cardano has a brilliant grand strategy for the developing world. As framed by John O’Connor this would be: 1) provide digital identity; 2) provide digital transfer of value; and 3) provide programmability of that digital value.
37. Mickey Watkins (CEO of World Mobile) added a step zero to the formula above with: 0) provide access to the digital world.
38. As has previously been mentioned, it was officially announced that Cardano is partnered with World Mobile to provide digital connectivity to people in the developing world starting in Tanzania. They plan to have 100k subscribers in Zanzibar by the end of the year.
39. This is just the beginning in Africa. John O’Connor had a nice tweet that very succinctly laid out some future plans. [https://twitter.com/jjtoconnor/status/1387919060197855234](https://twitter.com/jjtoconnor/status/1387919060197855234)
40. Coindesk editor refuses to acknowledge that Cardano has a deal with a national government, gets relentlessly trolled, then finally capitulates and decides to cover the Ethiopian Ministry of Education project. [https://twitter.com/zackseward/status/1387744629693599744 ](https://twitter.com/zackseward/status/1387744629693599744)[https://twitter.com/HukAleksandra/status/1387788814022844421](https://twitter.com/HukAleksandra/status/1387788814022844421) [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1387937546978545667](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1387937546978545667) [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1387939251275198466](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1387939251275198466) [https://twitter.com/Cshuggin/status/1387986678741151745](https://twitter.com/Cshuggin/status/1387986678741151745) [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1388113533435482115](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1388113533435482115) [https://twitter.com/CoinDesk/status/1388192121006534657](https://twitter.com/CoinDesk/status/1388192121006534657)
41. The Cardano Africa Mini addition gives us more details on the actual rollout of the Ethiopia Ministry of Education deal: 1) all 700k teachers and a subset of the students who will get tablets will be registered in the first year; 2) all secondary school students will be registered in the second year which will bring us to 5MM students; and 3) the data will be used to analyze both students and teachers.

42. If you don’t believe that Atala runs on Cardano please watch this video which lays out definitely and exactly how Atala runs on Cardano. Please feel free to wantonly debunk anyone on the interwebs who says otherwise. Thank you to IOHK technical architect Alexis Hernandez for this video! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AbgzvOeb6w&amp;t=31s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AbgzvOeb6w&amp;t=31s)
43. I don’t know if everyone watched the last few minutes of the Africa Special. But, I think a lot of people missed the section where John O’Connor said the goal of Cardano in Africa is to issue 100 MILLION digital identities in the next two years. To give you some idea of scale here, adapools.org shows a highest ever daily number of new wallets at around 71k. If we onboard 100 Million people via digital identity over two years that would be 136,986 people per day. ETH only has 150MM unique wallets to date. [https://youtu.be/yRjj662kJsk?t=8615](https://youtu.be/yRjj662kJsk?t=8615) [https://adapools.org/analysis-query/wallets](https://adapools.org/analysis-query/wallets) [https://etherscan.io/chart/address](https://etherscan.io/chart/address)
44. John also mentioned that all of the 100k subscribers to World Mobile in Zanzibar this year will have digital identities on Atala Prism. They will also be offering so-called “RealFi” loans by Q1 of next year that will be made via Cardano liquidity and will act as a bridge to real world value. [https://youtu.be/yRjj662kJsk?t=8628](https://youtu.be/yRjj662kJsk?t=8628)
45. Charlie Munger thinks crypto is “disgusting”. That’s a wonderful thing because it tells you how early you are. This is especially true in Cardano which is a project that leads with empathy for the developing world. Will he still call that disgusting if we’ve brought financial inclusiveness to an entire continent in five or ten years. Probably he won’t say anything because he won’t have lived that long. But, you get the point.

46. The state authorities in Wyoming are so far ahead of the curve it’s scary. Now they’re putting aside $4 million for staking. On the private side, Caitlin Long should be declared a state treasure for making a lot of this happen. [https://twitter.com/Cardanians\_io/status/1388756653311414272](https://twitter.com/Cardanians_io/status/1388756653311414272) [https://decrypt.co/69390/university-wyoming-generate-revenue-crypto-staking](https://decrypt.co/69390/university-wyoming-generate-revenue-crypto-staking)
47. I will be in a tent in a beautiful place where there will be very limited internet access. So, no text format Cardano Rumor Rundown until Saturday. The youtube version has been pre-recorded and is scheduled to come out on the normal daily schedule: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWnSP49DJf-G9E0VfqDdBCA](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWnSP49DJf-G9E0VfqDdBCA).
48. There is supposed to be some kind of mid-month update on Plutus. Charles hinted in a recent update that everything is going really well on that front. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=786mOp2Xq7s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=786mOp2Xq7s)
49. There will be an update on Mithril at the end of the month. You will remember from previous coverage that Mithril is a means to create trustless light wallets via recursive snarks similar to Mina. ZK-SNARK = zero knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=786mOp2Xq7s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=786mOp2Xq7s)
50. Charles is setting aside $9MM to be shared by two research labs to be set up: one at University of Edinburgh and one at an undisclosed institution. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=786mOp2Xq7s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=786mOp2Xq7s)
51. Doge Mania might be hitting a new peak (as a cultural artifact at least) tonight with Elon’s appearance on SNL. There are many different perspectives you can take on how this might impact ADA. I find the following two the most interesting: 1) if the Doge pump is followed by an inevitable crash it could sour a giant group of new adopters on crypto; or 2) it might be a gateway drug that will turn a large group of new adopters on to better projects. [https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1390774840135766019](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1390774840135766019)
52. The Essential Cardano List is published by IOHK. (credit to [/u/cascading\_disruption](https://www.reddit.com/u/cascading_disruption/) for pointing this out) [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1390728385945550848](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1390728385945550848)
53. Cryptodoggies.org NFTs are now available. The website says 50% will go to a community voted animal charity. [https://www.cryptodoggies.org/](https://www.cryptodoggies.org/)
54. For those learning Haskell, Check out this new video on Type Theory. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7blCeETJo8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7blCeETJo8)
55. Also, Lars puts out a new Plutus Pioneers video on Native tokens. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VbhY162GQA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VbhY162GQA)
56. ADA is the most crypto of all cryptos. George of CryptosRUs pointed out in a recent video that he couldn’t find any trace of a VC firm owning Cardano in its portfolio in his search of the categories section on CMC. This makes sense if you know Cardano. Would freedom and decentralization loving Satoshi not throw up a little in his mouth to find out that VC ownership of cryptos was a metric people would care about in 2021? The lack of VC stake in the very decentralized and freedom loving Cardano only adds to our already iron-clad claim on the mantle of the most crypto of all crypto projects. Our ecosystem never sought to attract VC money that would only centralize ownership in a smaller number of hands. This doesn’t even address the current extreme centralization of block validation in BTC and ETH.

57. IOHK has dropped a new article on the status of KEVM and IELE. Grigori Rosu of Runtime Verification says a proof-of-concept of IELE should be ready in six months. This is a key component in how we get to the ocean of all developers as we grow beyond the pond. [https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/05/10/runtime-verification-iele-from-interoperability-to-universality/](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/05/10/runtime-verification-iele-from-interoperability-to-universality/)
58. Cardano saw a new challenger enter the scene with Internet Computer (ICP) debuting very high on the CoinMarketCap charts. However, a look into ICP makes one question whether they are really in the Gen. 3 Blockchain race at all given that available information indicates the blockchain runs via datacenters hosting standardized hardware and that those datacenters can only join the network with the permission of the “Network Nervous System”. You could say that the winner of the Gen. 3 Blockchain race needs to solve the blockchain trilemma of decentralization, security, and scalability. If that’s true, then it’s arguable that ICP is not even competing in the decentralization leg of the race. [https://youtu.be/zHl-oVPoX88?t=97](https://youtu.be/zHl-oVPoX88?t=97)

70. John O’Connor on CNBCAfrica! He gave a really good explanation of how Africa with it’s already very high adoption of mobile payment wallets can leapfrog the legacy payment systems currently in use in more developed countries. He also reiterated that Cardano will expand to five countries this year and 20 next year! [https://youtu.be/RET8hIQQLUA](https://youtu.be/RET8hIQQLUA)

77. ICYMI, Manuel Chakravarty reminds us all that his Cardano Summit 2020 talk is publicly available for questions on native assets.

81. The Cardano Foundation is out to do something incredible with supply chains as described in the fireside chat! In his previous Cardano Live appearance, Frederik Gregaard, CF CEO, also expressed a very healthy and sustainable perspective on what DeFi should become. He compared the current state of DeFi to just moving funds from your left pocket to your right pocket and taking profit. [https://youtu.be/d8uPMZplfeM](https://youtu.be/d8uPMZplfeM) [https://youtu.be/xbMSQUA1lss](https://youtu.be/xbMSQUA1lss)
82. The ISO model entering the capital formation toolbox in Cardano is going to make the stake pool game extremely interesting with SPOs scrambling to find the right balance between rewarding ADA and giving their delegators other things like tokens. Some stake pools could even become like portfolio funds with relationships with many different projects the tokens of which are given to delegators. Babel Fees could also play a role here for smart SPOs as they may allow access to a wide variety of tokens in the ecosystem that could be used to reward delegators with a sort of index fund exposure to a wide variety of Cardano projects.

85. The Cardano Foundation has released the full video of the Fireside Chat with Eva and Fred. Lots of questions answered on a variety of fronts. Very interesting remarks including that in discussions with financial institutions, Fred has found they are interested in exposure to the alpha provided by the asset class in general, tokenization of assets, and the yield provided by staking rewards. Fred counters that they SHOULD be far more interested in the Cardano standard including the concepts of reference accounts, programmability of money, and transaction metadata.

87. The Treasury is trying to figure out how to get cryptocurrency regulation in a headlock. This will probably go hand-in-hand with the Fed’s March toward a CBDC. Afterall, what good is all the tracking and monitoring afforded by a CBDC if it’s easier for everyone to just use a non-central bank digital currency? Tax evasion in crypto is also obviously a target problem since we know only about 800 people a year paid taxes on crypto in 2013-2015.

CryptoCurrency,What happens when/if btc (or any other crypto) becomes the global currency,"I am reading a lot lately on crypto and macro economics (after taking the ""bitcoin for everybody"" course at saylor acadamy, which I highly recommend), and these are some points that I am confused about at the moment.

**Would appreciate your views and also recommendations on books/articles/podcast episodes that you are aware of that address some of the concerns I raised below.**

\----------------

The year is 205x and the BTC price has risen and risen, and it has reached, say a valuation of millions of USD (if according to some predictions, btc market cap could reach 100T, which makes one BTC will be worth around 5Million USD).  

Then say the unthinkable happens and the whole world bows down and accepts it as the one and only global crypto currency. BTC is money and money is BTC.

*What happens then?* 

*what will motivate miners to continue mining (since their income will be mainly transaction fees instead of btc rewards with each halving), and if the transaction fees become too high, which will deter people from making the transactions (or will it just end up like the credit card processing fee that visa/MA charges, and either the seller or the buyer of the service/product has simply to cover for it).*

*Then, there will be no ""market cap"" to talk about, at there is no fiat to measure it with.  So does that mean the market cap of BTC will be fixed just as the total number of BTCs that are available at that time? What will happen, say, if someone, through quantum computing or some other magic, fucks up the whole btc blockchain or we suffer a 51% attack.... will the whole global economy collapse?... do we need some ""backup"" currency/asset to hedge against such a highly unlikely scenario but with a catastrophic outcome?* 

*Will there still be a role for private banks? for federal/central banks? credit cards? Or will everything ends up being defi (based on ETH as it is now, or based on a defi based also on btc) where all debt/loan is P2P? How things like mortgages and credit card loans will work (as they are based on long term trust that the person will be earning enough money in the future to pay back, while there is no such trust in the crypto space)?*   

*If money becomes deflationary, as that will happen with btc, will overall inflation disappear and year by year, the price of goods and service (in btc) will decrease?  Then how will we define ""growth"" of companies, countries, etc...  what will be the new ""GDP""?*

*What will be the impact on taxes, social security, public spending, pension, etc..?*",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,PSA: Crypto is Not a Viable Asset Class for Some US-Based Real Estate Lenders,"I am going through the home buying process – I know, *in this economy?* lmao. I am currently working with a nationwide lender in the US (will not mention by name) and was informed that none of my cryptocurrency assets would be acceptable towards the cash to close amount of the home according to their guidelines.
 
I was fed the typical *’The market is too volatile and too young to have us accept those funds as an asset’*. Even if all I did was withdrawal my initial investments, that can easily be tracked through bank account statements via the memo lines that read “COINBASE” or “BINANCE”, it still would not be accepted. Keep in mind this is not money I have stolen, this is not drug money – I am not a drug dealer – this is my money that I earned through my typical 9 – 5 job and decided to invest in Crypto. An asset is an asset once it’s in my bank account so I fail to see the issue. Large deposits would flag in their system and I would have to answer as to where they came from.
 
I asked “What if I call it a gift from a family member?” and was told that the IRS would probably get involved as I would have to provide documentation of the ‘gift’ and it would be seen in my account statements as coming from a Cryptocurrency exchange. So lying is a no go – I figured this going into it I just thought I would ask about possible loopholes in the system.
 
I will be able to cover the cash to close without accessing these funds. My plan was to use my crypto as an emergency fallback in case of unexpected costs that may come up during life. To know that I will no longer be allowed to use those funds is a little annoying, particularly not even being able to use my initial investments.

Bitcoin,Bitcoin in Britain may have issues because of sex crimes,"In bitcoin, which went live in 2009 a pariticular technical term means something a hell of alot different in Britain, which went live a little earlier. 
In bitcoin and probably modern mathematics in general. I think the definition is something like ""a number that is only used once"".
Do people not check these things? social media filters and such, will and do block the word for its british meaning. I foresee a swathe of comedic opportunities, should bitcoin ever become a real currency in Britain. 

Also its just my opinion but until I can buy cigarettes, alcohol, a tin of beans and condoms from my local shop. And until I can buy drugs and adult workers on the street in the rain without requiring a wifi connection, it wont be a real currency. 
If the net fails bitcoin is backed up and saved but it cant be spent until the net is back up. Cash will never have that problem, and terrorists target wifi and hard wire networks for the sole purpose of interrupting traffic. Its an algorithm trading thing, internet slows and your algos get a head start, u make trillions, like (in my legally protected, freeborn opinion) like china does everytime the country doesn't get it's own way.
A crypto switch turns bombs, missiles and guns into second and third strike attacks. Cool if your us, the west, dishing it out. Not so much if we r on the receiving end, what with the country not being able to move money in a crisis.

Btw if musk pulled his moves with real currency or a companies tradeable stocks, he would be on collusion, insider trading and whatever rigging stock price is called, charges. He and his company are literally dictating the stock price of bitcoin. Imagine if he shadowed Tesla and bought 1.5b btc with his OWN money first, then the companies but only publicised the company purchase. 
With the price jump that could be a very tidy profit on the conversion back to dollars for the personal private purchase.

I said imagine, not ""I will see you in court elon"".

I respect the hustle, but if it is true it says alot about how easy it is to manipulate the masses that want bitcoin to replace ACTUAL sustainable global currencies. 

Now for a personal attack, he did it to an innocent man trapped in a mine. You remember dont you? The baseless accusations which is connected to the start of my initial observation.

Musk was bullied in school and has been and will always be one of lifes victims. He's hes smart, but the stupidest man knows that brawn always wins. A man of maths and science knows hes never walking on Mars, space will kill him in a second. 
In Ridley Scott's the Martian, musk would be whatney. But whatney cant fly, shoot, kill, or do the actual work. He cant get there without the big dumb tough as nails grunt, that musk belittled in a mine shaft.
The first Martian visitors from earth will be 20% crewed star trek, and 80% star wars, before Disney removed the wars part.

Space is crewed, maintained and operated by humans that are brawn and brains, NASA pilots, engineers eva, not by musk's and federation lovers. Those who fight the wars on earth dictate space, not the pussies that run from it, even though all  their innovations are ONLY made possible by its happening.

dogecoin,Doge Supply Elasticity:,"I saw a Musk tweet about giving ideas to improve doge:

When the Fed was created it wasn’t done with bad intentions, the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 it was not a bad act, but overtime the government has pretty much rendered it worthless at this point.

The Fed was supposed to provide an elastic money supply, meaning a supply of money that mimics the economy, in good times it would expand and in bad times it would contract. 

I believe that if doge or any other currency for that matter could do that that would be a much better approach to the problem of having an stable, sound currency that would react to the economy just as it works with Supply and Demand. 

How to do this ?, not sure but I have some ideas, we can pick the major economies in the world and do a weighted average of their GDPs and some other economic indicators and do “a control loop” with that information and adjust the supply of the currency accordingly.

This is just a simple idea that I been thinking for quite some time, I believe that it would be interesting to see this developed. 

Any thoughts on that?",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,How to Give Stock as a Gift,"Hello All - First off I want to say thank you to this thread for the priceless advice that I have received from it.

**Why I am writing this post:**

I have combed the internet for the past couple of days trying to figure out how to gift stock to someone. In my case, my older sister’s birthday is on Sunday and I would like to gift her stock. At this point, I am kind of over the whole idea of pointless material items as gifts for Birthdays/Christmas. This subreddit might be a bit to blame at first, but it also just comes with my new perspective of being more financially conscious. My initial research came through super helpful sites that I always consult like Investopedia and Nerdwallet. However, these sites just tell you what stock gifting is and that it can be done. I clearly knew it was possible and was more so focused on how to do it. I then moved on and also searched various subreddits for keywords. It did not seem like anyone had done much of an in-depth post about this topic before. This is not an all-inclusive post, it is meant for me to share my experience and hopefully help someone else in the process. Eventually, I got fed up with all the searching and did the most boomer thing… Picked up my cellphone and *called* the company that my brokerage/Roth IRA is held with and talked to a live person (lol).

**What I learned:**

1. You have to buy the stock and it has to settle (two business days) before it can be transferred…(After the stock is transferred it will then settle in the new owner's account)
2. (More pertinent for those that are trying to gift it as a present without the receiver finding out) You have to have the account number of the receiver…This is important because it kind of defeats the purpose of my original intention. In my case, I had to call my sister and explain that I was gifting her a stock for her birthday. I knew she had a Roth IRA but was unsure about a brokerage. Turns out she did have a brokerage and gave me her brokerage account number… and the surprise aspect was kind of spoiled… However, we joked it still kind of existed because I did not reveal what stock she was going to be getting. So in essence, there is still some sort of surprise factor in that regard. A benefit is that now I have her account number in the event that it is something I want to do again in the future, ie. Christmas. It is also worth noting that she gets an email as soon as the transfer executes. So the cat is out of the box very quickly with regards to what stock I was gifting.
3. If you want to gift stock as a share directly to someone, the easiest way is to do it between your brokerage account (with the share in question bought ahead of time) and the brokerage account of the person with whom you would like to give it to. Then call your broker and provide the necessary info.
4. I inquired about a Roth IRA to Roth IRA transfer and was quick to find out that only post-tax dollars could be contributed to Roths aka I could get her Roth IRA account number, but would only be able to contribute a monetary amount. Obviously, this would not be automatically invested into anything unless she took care of it and it would also still count towards her annual contribution limits. So just food for thought if that’s something that you were cool with.

**How it went down:**

After I had her account number and the stock I wanted to give her was in my brokerage account and settled. I called my broker and provided them with the account number and the stock/amount of stocks that I wanted to transfer. The whole process of the transfer on the phone took less than 5 minutes.

If anyone has had any experience with stock gifting that differed then my own, please share.

(Disclaimer: This post was based on experience with Fidelity. Other brokers/firms/banks might have varying processes)

(**TLDR**: If you want to gift stock, you have to know what type of accounts the person you want to gift to has for you to trade anything into because the type of account determines what kind of gift can be made - stock/straight cash.)",finance

CryptoCurrency,Financial Analysis of BlockFi card w/no annual fee vs. 2% cashback card,"I've been a critic of the BlockFi card since the announcement, primarily because of the annual fee. With today's announcement of no more fee and a change to the bonus offers, I decided to run a comparison. My analysis is below.

Source (since I can't post images here): [https://np.reddit.com/r/blockfi/comments/nkwig4/financial\_comparison\_between\_updated\_blockfi\_card/](https://www.reddit.com/r/blockfi/comments/nkwig4/financial_comparison_between_updated_blockfi_card/)

**TL;DR: If you have a stablecoin balance of $10,000 or higher this card is better than a 2% cashback card, regardless of your spend.** Strangely, the MORE you spend, the less of a better deal it is, ultimately capping out at only being $50 more per year than using a 2% cashback card. **If you don't have that stablecoin balance, the card earns you about $150 less per year than a cashback card.** Of course this pays in BTC and stablecoin, not fiat, and that might be a consideration (but you could also just use your fiat cashback to buy crypto).

*Please note that the interest rates are cumulative, e.g. the 3.5% cashback is the base 1.5% + 2% for a total of 3.5%, and the extra .5% is only on purchases over $50,000, etc.*",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Gaining credit score for a student loan as fresh US immigrants,"Hi. I'll have to start with a little backstory. So I've recently found out that my parents were lucky enough to win the DV lottery. Unfortunately, they'll have to leave me behind because I'm already past the age limit. The current plan is for them to move to the US and file for reunion via the F2b stream. By the time I receive my approval (which is obviously not a given), I will have already obtained my dental license in my home country and gained some hands-on experience. I would then move to the US and apply to the 2-year Advanced standing program so as to then work as a licensed dentist in the US.     But the thing is, this programs cost circa 250-350k on average. That's why I'm considering to apply for both federal and private student loans. The question then becomes how do you even begin to solicit private student loans (because federal would definitely not suffice) without any credit score? I could ask my parents, who at the time I guess would accrue some sort of a decent score, to cosign for me. But would it be possible for them to go from 0 to something close to 650-ish within 5 to 7 years of time? Would they have to have solid and long history of employment in the US, given that they are planning to chiefly live off a foreign source of income with only one of them having actual low-end employment in the US?

personalfinance,Mortgage Refi vs Investing,"Can someone please double check my math? I am trying to decide if I should invest or refinance my mortgage to a 20 year term. I plan to retire in 20 years and I’d like my house to be paid off at that point (Aug 2041).

Option 1:
Current mortgage has a monthly payment of $2300 and an interest of 2.875%, 30 year term. Refi would put the payment at $2600 with a 2.5% interest rate, 20 year term. Closing costs (not including escrow) total to $3600. Based on refi calculators, I would save roughly $57k in interest by refinancing, and pay off the mortgage in 20 years.

Option 2:
Keep the mortgage the same. Open a Roth IRA and invest the extra $300/month. Online calculators tell me I should have about $153k in 20 years assuming a 6% return. My non-refinanced mortgage would have a balance of $120,215 in August 2041. I’d pay off the mortgage balance and have about $32k left over in the IRA.

So based on my situation, I believe I’m weighing saving $57k (refi) vs $52k (saving $20k in interest by paying 10 years early, and having $32k left in my Roth IRA)

Did I calculate this correctly? Because it seems as if I’d be better off refinancing, but I always hear the opposite recommended. Am I missing something?

personalfinance,Question about student loans and interest rates,"I recently graduated from a university and just got hit with the total loan that have added up from every semester. Each loan ranges from 5.9% - 7.2% with an average of 6.6% of interest. I have been told to consolidate loans to lower my interest rate and get a parent to co-sign, too. 1.) Will I lose my 6 month grace period if I consolidate now? 2.) After doing both, consolidating and cosigner, would it be wise to go from a 10 year loan to a 15-20 year loan to also reduce interest rates so monthly payments are less? I want to clarify, I already have a job and planned on paying double the monthly payments to get the loan over with in half the time by paying on principal. If I extend the loan and get an even lower rate, can I pay it off even sooner? I left out my specific numbers because I don't think it's needed to answer these questions.

Edit: the average 6.6% is private loans and I also have federal loans that I do not know the information yet as to total loan amount nor interest rates.

EDIT PART 2: I decided to crunch the numbers myself. Assuming $128,000 loan at 10 years at a 3.5% annual rate, my monthly bill would be roughly $1270. Assuming the same loan amount for 15 years at 3.75% annual rate, my monthly bill would have been $930.

Today, the Conference Board (a non-profit research organization), released their April Consumer Confidence index which showed sentiment falling steeper than expected. The report showed the consumer confidence index dipped to 117.2 in May from 117.5 in April. However, on the positive side, April's reading was the highest since February 2020, before the start of Covid-19 lockdowns. Economists expected consumer confidence to rise to 119.5. 

A separate report by Standard &amp; Poor’s said that its S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller national home price index posted an annual gain of 13.2% in March up from 12% in February and marking 10-straight months of acceleration in home prices. The results far outpaced analysts’ expectations of a 12.5% annual gain, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. According to a recent Reuters poll, U.S. house prices are forecast to outpace GDP growth and consumer inflation — rising at a blistering pace to average 10.6% this year, almost double the 5.7% predicted in February. With demand rising faster than supply, it is not surprising to see home prices surging forward, with economists expecting the growth to taper once supply rises to meet demand. Total housing inventory at the end of April was 1.16 million units, down 20.5% from one year ago — the lowest level since NAR started tracking homes for sale in 2011. Inventory, however, was up 10.5% from March, an indication that homebuilding is picking up.

Today, members of the Federal Open Markets Committee reiterated their stance that the Fed was not yet worried about rising prices forcing the Fed to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he believed increases in inflation would be “mostly temporary” and that the Fed was “not quite there yet” when it came to discussing tapering its asset purchase program. In separate comments, Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said she did not want the Fed to be “overly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judging the outlook for inflation.”

* The Washington DC’s Attorney General filed an antitrust lawsuit against Amazon.com Inc. on Tuesday, alleging the company blocks sellers on its marketplace from offering lower prices elsewhere to stymie competition
* Reddit-stocks like Gamestop (GME) and AMC are once again on the move higher.
* The court case between Epic Games and Apple (AAPL) s expected to end this week as both sides prepare closing arguments. As a reminder, Epic Games is accusing Apple of antitrust behavior by taking a 30% commission from sales in the app store and blocking companies from using third-party payment options. Apple says it prevents third-party software to ensure consumer protection and the commission is in-line with other app-store developers, like Alphabet. The result of this case will have very wide ranging implications.
* Amazon (AMZN) is reportedly nearing a deal to buy the Hollywood studio MGM for roughly $9 billion, in a deal that would turn the movie studio into a streaming asset for AMZN. According to people familiar with the matter, a deal could close as soon as next week.

altcoin,Looking for something to invest in that will see a higher return than BNB on this dip? Look at RavenX,"First off, I am seeing a lot of misleading posts about all these tokens ""GAINING HUGE TRACTION AFTER THE DIP!!!"" or ""HUGE REBOUND"" blah blah blah on some of these dead projects who have had their hype run up and offer nothing to the blockchain. 
To those wondering - these BSC shitcoins are paired with BNB. So when BNB rises, so does said shitcoin. The shitcoin itself is probably not outpacing BNB.  You can tell when queue'ing up an order on pancakeswap how 1 BNB equals roughly the same amount of said shitcoin when BNB was over $500, versus now. 

Anyhow: now to share a real gem here:

I have a disclaimer: This is not financial advice. Always DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH before investing in ANY project.  I am a moderator for $RX's subreddit. However, this does not change my opinion on $RX. As I said before - this is not financial advice.  

Secondly - I am sorry to those who lost in OrcaX (RavenX fork) this past week.  I have also been in projects that got abandoned, it does not feel good. Rest assured, RavenX is here to stay, if you are still interested in a similar project, check it out. 

NEWS!!!! CERTIK AUDIT PUBLISHED ON http://certik.org/projects/ravenx 
WITH ONLY A FEW MINOR FINDINGS!!!! RAVENX IS SAFU

RavenX is the first automatic donation token. Automatic as in NO HUMAN INTERVENTION IS NEEDED to move donation funds around - there is no trust needed. It automatically donates 2% of each transaction to the Binance Charity Wallet. 

Over 1670 BNB in 1.5 months have been donated! 50% to Binance Lunch for Children and 50% to Crypto vs Covid. You can track progress on their website. 

This is literally a printer for charity! Sitting at just a 2 million market cap, it has accomplished more than tokens with 50x the mcap. 

RavenX will donate forever, as long as trading volume exists. 

$RX is 1.5 months old, and has had organic, steady growth. 19k holders. ATH market cap was around $20 million. Sitting at $2. million. Before the market wide dip, it would sit between 5 and 8 million in consolidation after its first large run up to 20 million. 

So why is RavenX a better investment than all these hype coins gaining 100 million market caps and crashing down to earth?  The future potential with BCF. RavenX is literally linked with them - things are set in motion to make something really special here. 

Currently sitting at half of a penny, it is not hard to fathom a $1 price tag in the future. 

Taxes - 6% taxes are taken off each transaction - 2% is burned, 2% is redistributed to the holders, and 2% is donated to the Binance Charity Wallet. These charity donations have been verified by Binance Charities. You can see for yourself on the blockchain. 

Around 420 million $RX tokens are left in supply (around 80 million burned).

As volume continues to rise, donations and burning go up too!!!!! We may see a point where $RX donates $1 million every day!!!!

This can literally change the world. 

To buy - use either the RavenDex on their website (recommended) or Pancake v1.  Also $RX is listed on the Whitebit exchange. 

Buy and sell NFT's on their marketplace! (Also on website)

As the title says. This will be huge. 

In the near future, staking/farming will be released on the DEX and the NFT marketplace will be revamped. 

RavenX will stand above all the Safe/Dogecopies as a world changing token!

This is the best buy in crypto right now.

personalfinance,What to do about immediately closed savings account?,"One recent Sunday I decided to go online and open a savings account, and came across the [TMobile Money](https://www.t-mobilemoney.com/en/home.html) account. They have a sweet deal that even non TMobile customers can get a 1% savings account rate. I believe this is operated by BankMobile.

After opening the account, I started the linking process to my existing checking account so I transfer money in and start getting that fat 1% interest. Everything looked good.

Monday morning I wake up with an email titled ""Closure of account relationship"" in which they go on to say ""BankMobile has exercised the right per our Account Agreement in the Account Disclosures/Terms and Conditions document to close your T-Mobile MONEY account(s) without prior notice to you.""

I called the 800 number in the email, and the only thing they could tell me was ""The account was closed for activity that went against the terms and conditions."" Later in the week I received my debt card in the mail and other documents.

I don't really know what could have happened seeing as I hadn't even finished opening the account. I checked my credit reports and ChexSystems to see if there was something bad that BankMobile might have gotten cold feet about, but I couldn't see anything. I pay credit cards in full each month, have good income, good credit, and generally good standing.

I get that I won't see the 1% interest rates, but should I be worried about a black mark on my credit report or ChexSystems? Something else?",finance

bonds,Reverse Repo Operations,"Hi I have been very interested in what has been going on in the reverse repo operations at the NY Fed. Since March the Reverse Repos have went from being relatively quiet to $432B. QE eases conditions by filling up bank reserves, but isn't RRP supposed to accomplish the exact opposite? Is this essentially just straight debt monetization or the beginning of the end? I am very confused as to what this means for bonds. I feel as if it could lead to 1 or 2 scenarios: 1. Negative interest rates (real rates already negative), but then people start to take their money out of the banking system. This would then cause an increase in M2 velocity because the money is being let out into the REAL ECONOMY. Hyperinflation.  2. Fed is forced to stop QE, and loses control of the curve leading to a deleveraging of the financial system. Interested in what you guys have to say.

personalfinance,"15 vs 30 year mortgage, which is better?","My situtation:

* Currently in the second year of paying a10-ARM at 3.125%.
* Looking into getting a 15 fixed at around 2.3%. The reasons: lower interest rate, interest payment saving (about $400/moth lower), and higher principal payment for faster equity build.
* No outstanding debt other than the mortgage. (No CC debt, no child/child support, no car loan although that may change next year)
* No issues making payments for 15 fixed.
* No change in employment as far as I can tell :)

I thought it would be an easy win for 15 but I guess not. I've been reading conflicting information about ""30 is better than 15"", and the argument for 30 being better is that the cash can be put to use for better returns (I assume investments like stocks, etf, mutual funds, etc., but with involved risks). And, I'm not tied to a high monthly with 30 as you can optionally pay down the principal per month if you want to. This last argument doesn't counter the fact that I will still be paying less interest per month with 15. But, I do like the fact that I can adjust my monthly payment amount depending on my financial situation. Is this a purely personal decision and I'm beating a dead horse?",finance
CryptoCurrency,What stops any public company from going public via crypto instead?,"Please tell me what's wrong with this plan. I assume there are already thoughts on this and companies wanting to do some similar, however I assume there are legal/technical reasons we can't yet:  

Company ABC Insurance decides they don't like the Fed, DTCC, HFs, Banks, etc.  

They get funding to go private for 50m shares @ $10.  

They develop ABC Coin with a cap of 50m coins.  

They ICO @ $10  

They now know 100% when their coin is bought and sold (shorted) due to blockchain.  

Rehypothecation, synthetic longs are no longer a thing (or if they are, its auditable)  

They can control liquidity and collateral of their own coin. E.g. they need cash? print more coins/ they feeling diluted? Increase supply and lower supply.  

I'm not a finance guy at all, but there seems to be so many good reasons to do this and have more transparency of their asset backed securities and how they are traded.

Bitcoin,Bitcoin/ Crypto IRA,"I keep hearing whispers about Bitcoin and Crypto IRA’s but everything I search seems spammy and scammy. 

Does anyone here use a service or platform they recommend? 

Is it better to just use whatever trading platform and figure out my own? 

Would love to trust professional crypto nerds to ‘diversify’... otherwise I’ll just keep stacking sats as my only move. 

Forbes makes it sounds like I have to start one myself-

‘To hold cryptocurrency in a retirement account, the account owner must make the investments through an LLC (limited liability company). The steps to take are as follows:
1. Establish and fund a self-directed IRA with a custodian of such retirement plans.

2. Form and register an LLC, which will be 100% owned by the IRA and, therefore, carry the same tax-advantaged status as the IRA. The income and expenses related to the assets will flow through the IRA LLC as required by the Internal Revenue Service. Cryptocurrency is considered property for federal tax purposes by the IRS, but because the assets are owned by a retirement account, gains are tax advantaged.
3. Using funds from the IRA, the LLC opens a business checking account (an IRA LLC is also referred to as a “checkbook IRA”). The checkbook puts the account owner in full control of the transaction (checkbook control), which is made simply by writing a check or wiring funds. The funds in the IRA LLC’s business checking account are for the sole purpose of investing in the digital assets (or any other alternative assets allowed through self-direction).
4. Open an account on a cryptocurrency exchange in the name (and tax number) of the IRA LLC. In addition to being purchased or traded on exchange platforms, digital assets may also be purchased through brokers or by investing in a fund that holds various digital currencies through private placement. In effect, the IRA purchases shares or directly invests as a limited partner.’

personalfinance,Continue university even with this much debt?,I have $27K in federal debt and $18K in provincial debt totalling in $45k. I still have 2 more years to go and would likely need to receive loan for tuition(probably end with $60k) as the money I earn working a part-time job right now mostly goes to rent. I am currently majoring in Economics at a decent university in Canada but I'm not sure if it would be worth it at the end having piled up this much debt or if I would even be able to land a job with a B.A in Economics especially when unemployment is high due to the crisis. Should it be considered a bit risking to continue studies if I am in this financial situation(22years old)?,finance
personalfinance,VA Cash Out Refinance or not?,"I have roughly $20,000 in combined credit card and personal loan debt. This has accrued over the years due to various unforeseen hardships I’ve had. $10,000 of that is a personal loan at 12% fixed and the rest is sitting at 4% fixed on the credit cards due to SCRA benefits. 

I recently purchased my first home last year and currently pay $922 at 2.5% fixed. Due to once again circumstances not of my choosing, I have a financial crisis and will incurre a large monthly expense for the next 18 years (unwanted child and court ordered child support). My credit score will likely tank as I am currently already paycheck to paycheck and when bills eventually start going unpaid I will stay in an endless cycle of debt. I just purchased the house but it has already increased in value so getting a new 30 year is fine since I’ve only paid about a year’s worth of the original loan. This may be the only chance I have to do any credit requiring things if things go as I foresee and my credit falls in the future.

I would like to eliminate as much debt as possible now so that I can afford this expense without sacrificing my own ability to survive. I got a quote for a cash out refinance that will eliminate the $20,000 and free up hundreds of dollars monthly. Problem is it would raise my monthly mortgage payment to $1202 and increase my rate to 3.5% fixed. Is this a wise option since I desperately need the money now? The savings in the short terms will help me get through this but long term I’m not sure if it’s the best decision.

TLDR: 

Current mortgage payment: $922
Current interest rate: 2.5% fixed
Have $20,000 of debt

Refinance mortgage payment: $1202
Reflate rate: 3.5% fixed

personalfinance,Want to make a change in financial direction. Wanting to focus on paying off student loans and finding a cheaper car.,"Apologies for the long post. Got my first post college job 2 years ago making about $65k and started looking for a new car. Worked there for a year then got laid off because of COVID. Found a new job making $65k and $600 net in quarterly bonuses and started resuming my car search after a built up a solid down payment. I'm a car person with a new income so I wanted something fast for me to drive around. I kept my college car as a daily so I could have the new car for fun and not rack up miles on it while keeping it nice. I ended up settling on something at a dealership for $36k but put a good down payment on it. My minimum is 472 a month but I've been paying $600 because I want to.

Over these last 6 months I've been taking an interest in personal financing and investing. Looking toward the long term but know I have some obstacles in my way before I can build wealth. I also don't really drive the car much and I'm wondering why I'm paying $600 a month along with gas insurance and taxes when I could be putting my money to better use. One of the reasons I chose the car was I knew it would hold it's value well. It's actually done even better and appreciated over the 6 months. I owe about $27k and private value for the car is now at $38k. I already have a purchase offer for $36.6k from Vroom.

My big kicker is I still have student loans to pay off and know that I should be tackling those more aggressively. I've currently got 3 different loans that total $50k with 6.5% interest. My minimum is $550 but I'm paying $650 for the same reason as the car.

My plan is to get rid of the expensive car which is eating up a ton of my money I should be putting towards loan payoffs but I need to replace my college daily. It's got 160k miles and I don't really feel comfortable driving it long distances anymore. The cost to make repairs on it now likely isn't worth it compared to it's private value of about $3-4k. It also makes sense to get rid of it because it's still classified sports car so the insurance is probably higher than something more traditional.

I want a car that's going to last me a while and I'm not going to need to worry much about in the future as far as reliability but is still comfortable since I do a lot of long distance driving.

I've been looking at a 2013 Lexus GS 350 with 76k miles and they want $21k. It's in great shape, probably even better than my current nice car. I've also been looking at a 2010 Lexus ES 350 with 95k miles and they want $14k. More rough on the outside but it's older and cheaper so it's expected. Ones newer, with less miles and a more modern interior and equipment. Ones older and less impressive but it's cheaper. Both are Lexus so should be reliable for the next few years. I can put down another $2k towards the final price. The newer one will probably end up needing a small loan but I should be able to payoff the older Lexus in full with everything I've mentioned. My credit is around 720 so interest rates shouldn't be an issue. Would probably get a 36-60 month loan.

With proper budgeting I could payoff my loans in a similar time frame with either car. The older one would probably just let me do it a bit faster.

After all living expenses, including things like eating out and Netflix subscriptions but leaving out loan payments, I have been comfortably and easily budgeting myself to $1800/month. Leaving about $1900/month in net income and that's not including the bonuses.

With my known assets in my cars, my income, and my loans. What direction should I go with these things? How should I use the money from my cars? What car option should I go with? The no car debt option seems like the smartest play but is it necessary? I could get that small loan and quickly pay off the newer one within a year. What about my loans? How should I divide my excess income into savings, car, etc.?",finance
personalfinance,How bad will the consequences be if I just cancel my paypal credit account without paying it off first?,"Long story short, ive been having really bad problems with  Synchrony Bank, specifically Paypal credit &amp; I want to cancel my account. Currently they say I owe  $2,712.60 (several hundred of this is actually inaccurate late fees). What happens if I close my account before paying it off? I know it will probably be sent to collections, but will they actually send me to court &amp; try to get the money from me, or will they most likely just let the debt go?

Here is the full explanation &amp; details:

Ever since the beginning of Covid-19. I didn't have much money during 2020 due to no work cuz of everything &amp; so I took advantage of PayPal Credit pushing off my payments for like 6 months so that i could still have what little money I did have for food every week. Recently I have become more stable and since the beginning of 2021 I have paid my bill every month! 

BUT, almost every month I've been having to get into a long 30min chat with an agent just to get the late fee removed. I have been getting charged a ""late"" fee every month even though I always pay on time. Every month when I pay, my bank takes several days to process the bill &amp; this month for some reason the payment was declined even though I have kept a balance of over $200 in it this whole month so technically the payment should have gone through. I don't really understand why this keeps happening &amp; I am honestly fed up with PayPal's CS agents as most of them tend to be rude &amp; not actually care or believe that I've been paying on time, cuz on their end it shows the payment going through several days later than the due date.

Just tonight I got a call from Synchrony Bank saying that they were calling to tell me that my payment this month is late. I was super confused though because even though This month (May 2021) is the first time I have actually paid a day late, &amp; I had already  contacted PP through chat (May 20th) to let them know why I paid ($80 on May 20th), 3 days late. The agent I was talking to accepted the reason, waived the fee, &amp; took the $40 fee off the account(it shows it was refunded). Tonight it shows the payment on the 20th, was rejected (again) by my bank for no reason of my understanding because there is still over $80 in my checking account. &amp; on top of that PP re-added the $40 late fee on the 21st of May (1 day after I paid &amp; got the late fee removed).

Anyways, sorry if this is confusing, but tonight I tried chatting again with an agent, explained the situation. But instead of even listening to me ""Jennifer Collins"" the agent just kept repeating that ""the fee was waived for month of April 2021 &amp; that they can't remove any more late fees because they already have removed one in the past 12 months"" 

She repeated the same message about 4 times &amp; then just closed the chat on me &amp; it went straight to the PayPal credit review screen.

All I did was tell her I was trying to talk about May 2021 NOT April 2021 &amp; she just never responded to my questions, just kept repeating the same copy/paste.

Soooo ya, I am honestly just super tired of this shit with PayPal and just want to cancel my credit account with them, specifically with Synchrony Bank, because their CS is a joke.

I have had a Discover Card for years now &amp; have never had a problem with them &amp; their agents are always SUPER nice!

TLDR: I'm done with PayPal Credit, what happens if I close my account with a balance still on it?

Generally, the types of commercial bank money that tend to be valued at lower amounts are classified in the narrow category of M1, while the types of commercial bank money that tend to exist in larger amounts are categorized as M2 and M3.

In general, M1 and M2 money have a much lower return of investment (ROI) in banks than that of M3 and M4.

M1: The total of all physical currency including coinage. Consists of money commonly used for payment. It essentially consists of currency in circulation and checking account balances.

M2: M1 + most savings accounts, money market accounts, retail money market mutual funds, and small deposits (certificates of deposit of under $100,000).

M3: M2 + all other CDs (large deposits, institutional money market mutual fund balances).

M4-: M3 + Commercial Paper

M4: M4- + T-Bills (or M3 + Commercial Paper + T-Bills)

L &amp; Money Multiplier

The United States Federal Reserve published data on three monetary aggregates until 2006, when it ceased publication of M3 data and began to  publish only data on M1 and M2.

Here are three charts that show the changes of money in circulation in the US.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1V

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V

The cause of the changes in money allocation shown is the charts is very simple. M3, M4 and higher components provide a much higher return of investment (ROI) than M1 and M2 components. Banks seek higher ROI, so they diverge money to M3, M4 and higher components, instead of M1 and M2. 

There are some policy changes in 2019 and 2020, causing a landslide drop in M1 &amp; M2. It is now lower than the numbers in 1960s.

As a result, although there are increasing amount of money in the circulation, the physical currency (M1 money) that people use to buy food and pay rent has dropped substantially, and the money in people’s saving accounts (M2 money) has also dropped sharply.

The solution is quite simple. People are at the core of US economy, and money was created to be a medium of exchange among people.

1. Injecting money directly into the real economy is important. The COVID-1 stimulus package did something good for the US economy.

2. Publication of M3, M4 and higher components data is needed. What people do not see is hurting the economy.

3. Require banks to circulate money through M1 and M2 components. People’s deposits and federal money should serve the people first. Let people do investment using money out of their own pockets.

When people have abundant money to use, the US economy is strong; when people are suffering, the economy is weak. People are at the core of the economy. If we serve the people first, then other things will naturally fall into place.",finance

CryptoCurrency,I believe we’ll see significant movement between Friday and June 15th.,"Arguably the biggest reason for bitcoins recent crash was the US inflation report which reported way over estimates. The timeline of the crash corresponds with the report. This affected everything from stocks to bonds to crypto as people sold volatile assets for fear of rising interest rates and a slowing economy. Basically rising inflation = rising prices = less spending = less profits = rising interest rates from feds to compensate = potential economic recession = markets crashing. This is really concerning to investors and most people haven’t paid attention. The market is uncertain because we are uncertain how feds will respond to this report. Will they raise interest rates? Will they curb federal Covid support to stop printing money? Will they let overinflation happen? Who knows. This pandemic is new to navigate for so many of us. 

The next report comes out this Friday and the next fed meeting is June 15th according to Reuters. They have assured the public that they will be able to reign it back in softly without crashing the economy but that’s tough and we’ll see what happens. Either way, in the long term Bitcoin has a bright future as people flee from the dollar and run to rising store of value assets either way this goes. 

Whatever they say and decide between Friday and mid-June will start to move the crypto market again. Those are my thoughts.

personalfinance,Cashing out 401k (hear me out),"I wanted to hear opinions on if I were to liquidate my 401K today and invest it into a taxable brokerage account instead. 

About me:

25 Male, Single, Living Alone (renting)

Taxable Brokerage Account: $50k

Roth IRA: $30k (fully fund each year already) 


401k Balance: $14,400 
- 7,997 my own contribution (100% vested)
- 6,403 employer contribution (100% vested)

If I were to liquidate it right now it would play out as the following:

Balance: 14,400

10% IRS Penalty: -1,440

30.25% Taxes owed: -4,356 (25 fed, 5.25 state)

Take Home: 8,604

Conclusion: I’ve contributed 7,997 (pretax) which would be 5,598 post tax.

I can have 8,604 (after tax +penalties)if I were to liquidate. 

This is still a ~50% return (5,598-&gt;8,604) on money I contributed and now I don’t have to wait until I’m 59 &amp; 1/2 to touch it. 

I’m well aware of compounding interest, I would still continue to invest this money. I just hate the idea of having it tied up in an account where I can’t access it until I’m 59 &amp; 1/2. 

Honestly don’t see a downside of doing this other than it being a minor inconvenience when I do taxes. 

IMO people ignore the fact that you’re going to have to pay taxes on a 401K when you withdraw— I rather foot that bill now and own the money in my account. 

As a side note I have no intention of being a lower income tax bracket in retirement either so no incentive there. 

Interested to hear thoughts.",finance

stocks,"Lithia Motors ($LAD), just killin' me in the middle of DD","I started looking at Lithia Motors ($LAD) in the past couple of weeks.  They're an automotive retailer here in the states with a Market Cap of $10.37b.  Their growth is in main accomplished through M&amp;A of other dealerships.  

* Downsides include: 
   * susceptibility to economic downturns, 
   * if interest rates climb it will make it harder for them to offer attractive financing,
   * 2020 supply chain shortages interrupting inventory,
   * High debt levels,
   * Competitive advantages, as I see them currently, are limited:
      * small pricing advantage over smaller competitors,
      * limited protection in certain markets where regulations or distributor arrangements keep their competitors out for certain vehicle brands.
* Fundamental Numbers:
   * Free Cash Flow - went positive for the last 4 years. They ended 2020 with $381m in FCF. 
      * CAGR on FCF from 2017 to 2020 equaled 86.4%.
   * From 2010 to 2020
      * Revenue grew from $2b to $13.1b (CAGR 20.5%).
      * BVPS CAGR was 24.7% (2020 BVPS of $111.83).
      * EPS CAGR was 43.7% (2020 EPS of $19.53).
      * ROE in 2020 was 25.6% (CAGR 19.2%)
   * Total Debt in 2020 was $4.175b
   * Long-term debt was $2.311b 
   * LT Debt to Earnings = 4.92

The last few numbers are very concerning to me.  That's a whole lot of debt they are carrying!  Combined with limited economic moats.... Hmmmm.  However, I did compare their 2020 numbers to Carmax, one of their biggest competitors.  Carmax had a whooping LT Debt/Earnings ratio of 20.7, revenue of roughly $19b, and EPS of $4.52.  Carmax's growth number were also much less overall.

Given their LT debt/Earnings was roughly 1/4 of a direct competitor's and their growth numbers were looking good to me, I was continuing to do some reading and research.  Then Lithia made a rather big announcement.  They're doing a new public offering of shares valued at $1b.  At the same time they announced a private offering of $800 million in senior notes (3.875%) that would be due 2029...  Nearly another billion in LT Debt?!?!?  ARRGGHHHHH!

Looking at their 2021 Q1 presentation, they do give target uses of capital, which at least shows they have a plan that they are willing to publish.  Those plans are as follows:    

* Internal Investment &amp; Modernization 25% 
   * (Actual 5-year average: 17%) 
* Share Repurchases 5%
   * (Actual 5-year average: 11%) 
* Dividends 5% 
   * (Actual 5-year average: 4%) 
* Acquisitions 65% 
   * (Actual 5-year average: 68%) 

Their stated goal in the 2021 Q1 for acquisitions is an annual addition of $3-5 billion in revenues.  They also posted good numbers for Q1 YoY and compared to the previous quarter.  However, with the debt now I feel like the research rabbit hole has gotten a little deeper for me....

I suppose the silver lining is that the 2 valuations of the company I ran and margin of safety puts them outside of my current buy range.  So I've got the time for the research.

Let me know what you think.",finance

CryptoCurrency,In Case You Wanted To Know More About NFTs (TheoryCrafting the Future),"In case you wanted to know more about NFTs

NFT stands for non fungible token. What an NFT actually is is a string of data that represents ownership of a designated entity, either physical or digital. NFTs reside on the Ethereum network. Just like how you can transfer 1 ETH to somebody on the ETH network, you can transfer those strings of data (the NFT) to other people. By transferring an NFT from myself to you, I transfer ownership of the entity that the given NFT represents. So I transfer a string of data (the NFT) to your account. Since you now hold the NFT, you posses ownership of the physical or digital item it represents. Because NFTs are non fungible, they cannot be faked or destroyed, so you can always track who owns the given item freely by checking the data on the blockchain. 

Some real world examples that you probably aren't aware of (since I assume you are asking this question due to what is happening in the art community) are the sales of NBA game tickets (so ticket sales) and also NBA Topshot, which are digital basketball trading cards. By using NFTs to administrate ticket sales, you can validate attendees virtually without anybody losing their tickets. In addition, since NFTs are programmable, they can prevent transfer of the NFT from the recipients in order to prevent ticket scalping, since they cannot be transfered from the recipients ETH wallet. For NBA Topshot, the NFTs represent ownership of the trading cards that they represent (the actual cards themselves being gifs that are linked via the NFTs). The usual negative response to NBA Topshot is that anybody can just load the link to the gif of the NFT, so who cares if you own it or not. But if it was a playing card game, just looking at the card on Google images doesn't mean you can play it in the game or have it in your inventory. The physical equivalent example would be, ""what's the point of buying Magic the Gathering cards when you can just print them out yourself?"" Just like NFTs, the secret sauce is proof of ownership. 

If we take the idea of proof of ownership over all else to the extreme, we get to what is happening in the art community, wherein people are creating NFTs for digital art that they make and selling them. The intrinsic value proposition that most art NFT investors see is the status that comes with owning one of the first ever pieces of digital art with verifiable ownership. This notion can be scoffed at, but at the same time what is so special about going to the Louvre to see the Mona Lisa when I can just look at it anytime on my phone? Authenticity. 100 years from now, owning one of the original art NFTs will potentially come with the same level of reverence that comes with the ownership of an original Picasso or Dali. This is literally the motivation behind the lucrative success of CryptoPunks. The significance of ownership of something that is clearly the progenitor of a historical shift in culture and technology, or that can no longer be obtained easily. Think Christmas hats or 10 year capes in Runescape, I can look at other people wearing them or photoshop one on my character, but that doesn't mean I own it. Some people who care more about money than the tech began minting NFTs of their art (and other people to art that they don't own the rights to) in an attempt to make a quick buck by selling the NFTs to people who agree with that notion of investing in something of historical significance. The digital art NFTs are what people are most aware of at the moment who aren't familiar with the crypto space.

If we bring it back to real applications, we can talk more about exciting applications of NFTs. For ticket sales or for digital trading cards, they can be programmed. Remember ETH is programmable money. NFTs can be programmed such that whenever they are sold or transferred, a fee or portion of the sale is automatically charged and sent to the creator. So maybe ticket scalping doesn't end up being prevented by some ticket sellers, but they get to make money twice off the ticket via what was originally paid for it, and for a percent of the aftermarket sale. For video game ownership or trading cards, Nintendo, Sony and Microsoft could actually make money off of the used game market if an NFT is validated at software launch, and the transferring of the game ownership NFT (such as in the second hand market) sends a percentage back to the company that published a game. Wizards of the coast could receive a percentage of all aftermarket digital card sales if MTGO required the transfer of the NFT for ownership of the card within the game. There is actually a huge ETH based trading card game called Gods Unchained that you can check out for an example and proof of concept. Moreover, you could have a real world equivalent marketplace of the items you see on the Steam Marketplace such as CS:GO knives or character skins without the need to use the steam marketplace for buys and sells. If you have a looter shooter like Destiny, items could be NFT based and in turn posses real world value, you could sell your second copy of an Exotic gun for $5 of ETH to somebody else. In 10 years ALL digital games will incorporate NFTs and it will be the end to surface level micro transactions. The in game items will drop for free and the players can sell them to eachother for real money via the ETH network, and the game owners will receive a cut of the sale of each item. We could also go even higher concept and consider how exciting the notion of using an item from one game in another is, since NFTs are completely digital and game engine/asset agnostic (remember they are just a string of data). So for example, you could receive an NFT for killing a raid boss in WoW that gives your character access to a sword in game, but then in another blizzard game if you have that NFT within the ETH wallet linked to your account, you could use that same sword, so the only way to get the sword in the second game is to actually have obtained it in the original game. This can lead to legacy game content or one off items, just like in Ready Player One. Since literally anything can be an NFT, you could trade your digital Black Lotus for $16,000 in ETH, the tokenized title to a car (once the DMV tokenizes vehicle titles) and a pair of concert tickets, all in a single transaction. 

NFTs represent the first time in history where there is secure digital ownership that cannot be faked, duplicated or destroyed, and can be easily verified without the need of a third party. They will be heavily incorporated in society within the next 15 years.",cryptocurrency

21. The number of defi projects that have announced plans to be on Cardano just keeps climbing with [Yayswap.io](https://yayswap.io/) joining the list of Liqwid, Occam, and CardSwap/CardStarter.
22. Kraken publishes a “What is Cardano?” article. Says “...Cardano may not promise new ground-breaking features..” Oh yeah? What about native tokens that don’t require smart contracts? What about the EUTXO model allowing predictable and accurate local calculation of transaction fees in your wallet before you execute? What about a consensus algorithm that’s so good, another top 10 coin made their system derivative of it? That’s all standard these days? [https://twitter.com/krakenfx/status/1386038990864793607](https://twitter.com/krakenfx/status/1386038990864793607)
23. There’s a new stake pool explorer on the block. Check out the geographic map and the epoch calendar. [https://poolpeek.com/epochcalendar](https://poolpeek.com/epochcalendar)
24. First reactions from the “Ocean” are looking good! [https://twitter.com/Saifadin/status/1386305951293075456](https://twitter.com/Saifadin/status/1386305951293075456)
25. I hope everyone enjoyed their sweet, savory, and delicious staking rewards yesterday! [https://adapools.org/epochs](https://adapools.org/epochs)
26. In today’s video, we’re also going to go much deeper on how the COTI DAG works. But, don’t worry at all you’ll totally understand it when we’re done.
27. Binance Smart Chain has already laid out a very compelling argument that we’re going to CRUSH Ethereum. [https://twitter.com/TheADAApe/status/1386583952668958720](https://twitter.com/TheADAApe/status/1386583952668958720)
28. Charles does a big interview with Forbes and points out the huge differences between a bonded staking system (ETH) and a liquid staking system (Cardano). This is highly overlooked. [https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenehrlich/2021/04/26/cardano-and-ethereum-founder-analyzes-the-newest-evolutions-in-crypto-and--blockchain-technology/?sh=6acb258e3e52](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenehrlich/2021/04/26/cardano-and-ethereum-founder-analyzes-the-newest-evolutions-in-crypto-and--blockchain-technology/?sh=6acb258e3e52)
29. Charles also covers his projections about interoperability and the future converging on a “wifi moment” when an interoperable “internet of blockchains” emerges. In this future, it will be a race to the bottom and the systems that are too expensive to operate will simply be priced out of the game.
30. New Africa Special Trailer dropped. The narrator: “We are partnering with African governments…” That was PLURAL governments, guys! This is getting exciting. [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1386772333902319618](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1386772333902319618)
31. The Africa Bird lands a few days early!!!!!!!! It’s a deal with the Ethiopian Ministry of Education to provide a Cardano ID solution and unified records system for 5 million Ethiopian students. Charles says there will be more news tomorrow at the Africa Special.[ https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/27/business/dealbook/tesla-earnings-bitcoin.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/27/business/dealbook/tesla-earnings-bitcoin.html).[ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOTRp3PQKVk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOTRp3PQKVk).[ https://twitter.com/IOHKMedia/status/1387051830442553351](https://twitter.com/IOHKMedia/status/1387051830442553351)[ https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/27/blockchain-finally-comes-of-age-with-worlds-biggest-blockchain-deployment/](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/27/blockchain-finally-comes-of-age-with-worlds-biggest-blockchain-deployment/)[ https://www.cityam.com/ethiopia-overhauls-its-education-system-with-iohk-blockchain-partnership/](https://www.cityam.com/ethiopia-overhauls-its-education-system-with-iohk-blockchain-partnership/)
32. We’re getting reports from Army of Spies member /u/[ ricklepicklemydickle](https://www.reddit.com/user/ricklepicklemydickle) that World Mobile is reporting in its telegram group that it will be dropping some news tomorrow!
33. A new Cardano metrics platform has launched [https://cardanowaves.com/](https://cardanowaves.com/)
34. Today is the Cardano Africa Special. It’ll be at 9:30am Pacific, 10:30am Mountain, 12:30pm Eastern, 5:30pm Dublin, 7:30pm Addis Ababa, 11:30pm Bangkok. 1:30amTokyo. Go enjoy! We’ll recap it after.
35. In today’s video we also cover questions about the relationship between Atala Prism and ADA and who will actually benefit from the Cardano Projects with African governments.
36. The Africa Special made it clear that Cardano has a brilliant grand strategy for the developing world. As framed by John O’Connor this would be: 1) provide digital identity; 2) provide digital transfer of value; and 3) provide programmability of that digital value.
37. Mickey Watkins (CEO of World Mobile) added a step zero to the formula above with: 0) provide access to the digital world.
38. As has previously been mentioned, it was officially announced that Cardano is partnered with World Mobile to provide digital connectivity to people in the developing world starting in Tanzania. They plan to have 100k subscribers in Zanzibar by the end of the year.
39. This is just the beginning in Africa. John O’Connor had a nice tweet that very succinctly laid out some future plans. [https://twitter.com/jjtoconnor/status/1387919060197855234](https://twitter.com/jjtoconnor/status/1387919060197855234)
40. Coindesk editor refuses to acknowledge that Cardano has a deal with a national government, gets relentlessly trolled, then finally capitulates and decides to cover the Ethiopian Ministry of Education project. [https://twitter.com/zackseward/status/1387744629693599744 ](https://twitter.com/zackseward/status/1387744629693599744)[https://twitter.com/HukAleksandra/status/1387788814022844421](https://twitter.com/HukAleksandra/status/1387788814022844421) [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1387937546978545667](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1387937546978545667) [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1387939251275198466](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1387939251275198466) [https://twitter.com/Cshuggin/status/1387986678741151745](https://twitter.com/Cshuggin/status/1387986678741151745) [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1388113533435482115](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1388113533435482115) [https://twitter.com/CoinDesk/status/1388192121006534657](https://twitter.com/CoinDesk/status/1388192121006534657)
41. The Cardano Africa Mini addition gives us more details on the actual rollout of the Ethiopia Ministry of Education deal: 1) all 700k teachers and a subset of the students who will get tablets will be registered in the first year; 2) all secondary school students will be registered in the second year which will bring us to 5MM students; and 3) the data will be used to analyze both students and teachers.

42. If you don’t believe that Atala runs on Cardano please watch this video which lays out definitely and exactly how Atala runs on Cardano. Please feel free to wantonly debunk anyone on the interwebs who says otherwise. Thank you to IOHK technical architect Alexis Hernandez for this video! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AbgzvOeb6w&amp;t=31s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AbgzvOeb6w&amp;t=31s)
43. I don’t know if everyone watched the last few minutes of the Africa Special. But, I think a lot of people missed the section where John O’Connor said the goal of Cardano in Africa is to issue 100 MILLION digital identities in the next two years. To give you some idea of scale here, adapools.org shows a highest ever daily number of new wallets at around 71k. If we onboard 100 Million people via digital identity over two years that would be 136,986 people per day. ETH only has 150MM unique wallets to date. [https://youtu.be/yRjj662kJsk?t=8615](https://youtu.be/yRjj662kJsk?t=8615) [https://adapools.org/analysis-query/wallets](https://adapools.org/analysis-query/wallets) [https://etherscan.io/chart/address](https://etherscan.io/chart/address)
44. John also mentioned that all of the 100k subscribers to World Mobile in Zanzibar this year will have digital identities on Atala Prism. They will also be offering so-called “RealFi” loans by Q1 of next year that will be made via Cardano liquidity and will act as a bridge to real world value. [https://youtu.be/yRjj662kJsk?t=8628](https://youtu.be/yRjj662kJsk?t=8628)
45. Charlie Munger thinks crypto is “disgusting”. That’s a wonderful thing because it tells you how early you are. This is especially true in Cardano which is a project that leads with empathy for the developing world. Will he still call that disgusting if we’ve brought financial inclusiveness to an entire continent in five or ten years. Probably he won’t say anything because he won’t have lived that long. But, you get the point. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/01/charlie-munger-calls-bitcoin-disgusting-and-contrary-to-the-interests-of-civilization.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/01/charlie-munger-calls-bitcoin-disgusting-and-contrary-to-the-interests-of-civilization.html)
46. The state authorities in Wyoming are so far ahead of the curve it’s scary. Now they’re putting aside $4 million for staking. On the private side, Caitlin Long should be declared a state treasure for making a lot of this happen. [https://twitter.com/Cardanians\_io/status/1388756653311414272](https://twitter.com/Cardanians_io/status/1388756653311414272) [https://decrypt.co/69390/university-wyoming-generate-revenue-crypto-staking](https://decrypt.co/69390/university-wyoming-generate-revenue-crypto-staking)
47. I will be in a tent in a beautiful place where there will be very limited internet access. So, no text format Cardano Rumor Rundown until Saturday. The youtube version has been pre-recorded and is scheduled to come out on the normal daily schedule: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWnSP49DJf-G9E0VfqDdBCA](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWnSP49DJf-G9E0VfqDdBCA).
48. There is supposed to be some kind of mid-month update on Plutus. Charles hinted in a recent update that everything is going really well on that front. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=786mOp2Xq7s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=786mOp2Xq7s)
49. There will be an update on Mithril at the end of the month. You will remember from previous coverage that Mithril is a means to create trustless light wallets via recursive snarks similar to Mina. ZK-SNARK = zero knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=786mOp2Xq7s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=786mOp2Xq7s)
50. Charles is setting aside $9MM to be shared by two research labs to be set up: one at University of Edinburgh and one at an undisclosed institution. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=786mOp2Xq7s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=786mOp2Xq7s)
51. Doge Mania might be hitting a new peak (as a cultural artifact at least) tonight with Elon’s appearance on SNL. There are many different perspectives you can take on how this might impact ADA. I find the following two the most interesting: 1) if the Doge pump is followed by an inevitable crash it could sour a giant group of new adopters on crypto; or 2) it might be a gateway drug that will turn a large group of new adopters on to better projects. [https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1390774840135766019](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1390774840135766019)

53. Cryptodoggies.org NFTs are now available. The website says 50% will go to a community voted animal charity. [https://www.cryptodoggies.org/](https://www.cryptodoggies.org/)
54. For those learning Haskell, Check out this new video on Type Theory. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7blCeETJo8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7blCeETJo8)
55. Also, Lars puts out a new Plutus Pioneers video on Native tokens. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VbhY162GQA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VbhY162GQA)
56. ADA is the most crypto of all cryptos. George of CryptosRUs pointed out in a recent video that he couldn’t find any trace of a VC firm owning Cardano in its portfolio in his search of the categories section on CMC. This makes sense if you know Cardano. Would freedom and decentralization loving Satoshi not throw up a little in his mouth to find out that VC ownership of cryptos was a metric people would care about in 2021? The lack of VC stake in the very decentralized and freedom loving Cardano only adds to our already iron-clad claim on the mantle of the most crypto of all crypto projects. Our ecosystem never sought to attract VC money that would only centralize ownership in a smaller number of hands. This doesn’t even address the current extreme centralization of block validation in BTC and ETH.

57. IOHK has dropped a new article on the status of KEVM and IELE. Grigori Rosu of Runtime Verification says a proof-of-concept of IELE should be ready in six months. This is a key component in how we get to the ocean of all developers as we grow beyond the pond. [https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/05/10/runtime-verification-iele-from-interoperability-to-universality/](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/05/10/runtime-verification-iele-from-interoperability-to-universality/)
58. Cardano saw a new challenger enter the scene with Internet Computer (ICP) debuting very high on the CoinMarketCap charts. However, a look into ICP makes one question whether they are really in the Gen. 3 Blockchain race at all given that available information indicates the blockchain runs via datacenters hosting standardized hardware and that those datacenters can only join the network with the permission of the “Network Nervous System”. You could say that the winner of the Gen. 3 Blockchain race needs to solve the blockchain trilemma of decentralization, security, and scalability. If that’s true, then it’s arguable that ICP is not even competing in the decentralization leg of the race. [https://youtu.be/zHl-oVPoX88?t=97](https://youtu.be/zHl-oVPoX88?t=97)
59. The new venture of Sebastien, Nico, and Robert Kornacki is announced: [https://twitter.com/dcspark\_io](https://twitter.com/dcspark_io). That’s a hell of a team!!!!

63. Does Elon’s move away from BTC (ostensibly for environmental reasons) hold promise for ADA? [https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1392602041025843203](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1392602041025843203)

70. John O’Connor on CNBCAfrica! He gave a really good explanation of how Africa with it’s already very high adoption of mobile payment wallets can leapfrog the legacy payment systems currently in use in more developed countries. He also reiterated that Cardano will expand to five countries this year and 20 next year! [https://youtu.be/RET8hIQQLUA](https://youtu.be/RET8hIQQLUA)
71. This tweet by [u/TheADAApe](https://www.reddit.com/u/TheADAApe/) pretty much sums it all up. When people ask me how I knew, I’m going to point them to this post. [https://twitter.com/ArmySpies/status/1393606491110662146](https://twitter.com/ArmySpies/status/1393606491110662146)

74. The saga of BTC maximalists being angry at Elon continues with Elon implying that Tesla could sell its BTC while Cardano continues just doing its thing like normal. [https://twitter.com/elonmusk/with\_replies](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/with_replies)
75. Likewise, Marc Cuban tried to FUD real world use of Cardano only to be confronted with a giant infographic of use cases and partnerships along with an explanatory video just for him.

76. Initial Stakepool Offerings (“ISOs”) are here. Crypto is no stranger to novel means of capital formation and now the Cardano ecosystem is getting in on the action. Here is SundaeSwap’s explanation of how ISOs will work.

77. ICYMI, Manuel Chakravarty reminds us all that his Cardano Summit 2020 talk is publicly available for questions on native assets. Really interesting discussion of the asset identifier just being a hash of the policy script and how that helps create a super lightweight easy to use system.

81. The Cardano Foundation is out to do something incredible with supply chains as described in the fireside chat! In his previous Cardano Live appearance, Frederik Gregaard, CF CEO, also expressed a very healthy and sustainable perspective on what DeFi should become. He compared the current state of DeFi to just moving funds from your left pocket to your right pocket and taking profit. [https://youtu.be/d8uPMZplfeM](https://youtu.be/d8uPMZplfeM) [https://youtu.be/xbMSQUA1lss](https://youtu.be/xbMSQUA1lss)
82. The ISO model entering the capital formation toolbox in Cardano is going to make the stake pool game extremely interesting with SPOs scrambling to find the right balance between rewarding ADA and giving their delegators other things like tokens. Some stake pools could even become like portfolio funds with relationships with many different projects the tokens of which are given to delegators. Babel Fees could also play a role here for smart SPOs as they may allow access to a wide variety of tokens in the ecosystem that could be used to reward delegators with a sort of index fund exposure to a wide variety of Cardano projects.
83. May Cardano 360 coming one week from today (always the last Thursday of the month). [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1395117067960045569](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1395117067960045569)

85. The Cardano Foundation has released the full video of the Fireside Chat with Eva and Fred. Lots of questions answered on a variety of fronts. Very interesting remarks including that in discussions with financial institutions, Fred has found they are interested in exposure to the alpha provided by the asset class in general, tokenization of assets, and the yield provided by staking rewards. Fred counters that they SHOULD be far more interested in the Cardano standard including the concepts of reference accounts, programmability of money, and transaction metadata. [https://youtu.be/JW6s9Jkyazg](https://youtu.be/JW6s9Jkyazg)
86. In a video press release yesterday, the Fed finally admitted that it’s moving toward a central bank digital currency (just like every other central bank). This will eventually be impactful on Cardano and every other crypto ecosystem. [https://youtu.be/WOAQxpG79Ag](https://youtu.be/WOAQxpG79Ag)
87. The Treasury is trying to figure out how to get cryptocurrency regulation in a headlock. This will probably go hand-in-hand with the Fed’s March toward a CBDC. Afterall, what good is all the tracking and monitoring afforded by a CBDC if it’s easier for everyone to just use a non-central bank digital currency? Tax evasion in crypto is also obviously a target problem since we know only about 800 people a year paid taxes on crypto in 2013-2015.

Fred counters that they SHOULD be far more interested in the Cardano standard including the concepts of reference accounts, programmability of money, and transaction metadata.

90. The Treasury is trying to figure out how to get cryptocurrency regulation in a headlock. This will probably go hand-in-hand with the Fed’s March toward a CBDC.

Tax evasion in crypto is also obviously a target problem since we know only about 800 people a year paid taxes on crypto in 2013-2015.

cardano,Question about staking and trading ADA,"Hi everyone, thanks in advance for taking the time to answer my question. So I have a scenario in mind, but I’m not sure if it would be possible or if I’m missing something.

Say you have 1k ADA in a wallet, and that wallet is delegated for staking. As long as there are 10 ADA left in the wallet, it remains delegated. Rewards are calculated at the end of each epoch by taking a snapshot of all wallets and the ADA delegated by them.

So far so good I think right? If I choose to send 950 ADA to an exchange, trade if for gains, convert it back to ADA and send it back to my wallet before the snapshot, can I technically have an actively traded portfolio that’s still generating 5% APY? If so I think this is a major advantage that Cardano’s flexible dPoS system has over others.

Someone please tell me if I’ve missed anything :)

Edit: thanks for all your responses! I think it’s often overlooked, when comparing staking models, that though Cardano may offer smaller APY than other staking methods, the flexibility allows you to maintain a compounded interest rate on an actively traded portfolio! That, as far as I know, is unique!",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Retirement funds and HSA contributions,"I am a 24F and I have a job with the US federal government. I have gotten comfortable contributing 15% of my annual salary to my Roth TSP and will be boosting this number to 17.5% by the end of the day. To max out my account, I need to contribute about 26% of my income, but expect this to go down to 22% when I get a grade increase next March. I also contribute a little under half the maximum contribution to a fidelity HSA. 
What do couples generally do with retirement contributions when one person has a better retirement savings plan than the other? My fiancé (25M) works for a small construction company while finishing his college degree (don’t worry, we cash flow tuition) and his 401k plan is with John Hancock. He currently contributes 10% of his income. His employer does not match. I am making the assumption that a TSP is overall a better plan due to fees and fund types. Should we forego using his retirement account and put what he would be contributing into the TSP and use his income to pay for more expenses? I don’t think I’ll be able to max out the account before we tie the knot, at which point we will be filing taxes jointly and shooting for the new $39500 limit. 
I’d also like to work towards contributing more to the HSA, but haven’t figured out the right prioritization of the accounts. It is worth noting we don’t have any outstanding debt, but we do have about $144k left on a 15 yr home mortgage. Increasing retirement at this stage of our lives seems to make a lot of sense, but I want to make sure there isn’t some weird reason why contributing to one plan would be a big issue.",finance
economy,Economic collapse soon. That is the reason for Covid fascism and war mongering.,"There are people in the Biden administration who want a major war. I am told that spiritually. Perhaps so that someone else will get the blame when the standard of living plummets. And of course its easier to push through draconian laws during war. Covid fascism did not work well enough and many can see the BS clearly. 

They did of course not shut down the economy because of a virus. They did because they know it is going to collapse. Central banks are now powerless. The difference between 2008 and now is that the bubbles are much larger. They cant stop printing but that leads to inflation and a currency crisis. So they will soon launch their own digital currencies. Instead of empowering people the currencies will be highly centralized. 100% digital + the massive surveillance that naturally follow with this type of centralized currency is obviously a great threat to a democracy. Warn others so that they will not buy the war propaganda etc. Then this can be prevented.

&amp;#x200B;

\----------------

&amp;#x200B;

From an interview with William White at bank of international settlements BIS - ""Central banks know they can’t leave interest rates as low as they are, because they are inducing still more bad debt and bad behavior. But they can’t raise rates, because then they would trigger the very crisis they are trying to avoid. There is no way out but to keep doing what you are doing, but by doing that, you are making it worse.

&amp;#x200B;

Have central banks reached the end of the road?

&amp;#x200B;

Just read what Bill Dudley, the former president of the New York Fed, wrote in Bloomberg a couple of weeks ago. He warns that central banks have run out of firepower, and he warns that the side effects are getting worse. I agree with every word. That is the most dangerous effect of the past thirty years of monetary policy: Debt levels have constantly been building up, and so have the instabilities in the financial system.""",finance
Bitcoin,The next five years,"I am an ultrabull in the long run. I feel very confident that we will see a $5 Trillion crypto market capitalization in the next 30 years, and that's a very modest estimation. But Bitcoin has the reasonable potential of hitting that in the next 5 years and will be closer to $50 Trillion in the 30 year timespan if it meets certain bench marks. Institutional investors are waiting to see two things. Bitcoin has proven that it is secure throughout this decade long stress test of the tech. Security will always be a concern but much less so than it was 5 years ago. Volatility is also not much of an issue so long as the price increase in the long term. The volatility is likey more a symptom of Bitcoin's youth rather than an inherent feature.

So what are the institutions waiting on? They want to see if Bitcoin is uncorrelated in two key respects. First is, of course, inflation. During inflationary periods assets rise in value, which Bitcoin is seen as an asset. It's the correction that is troublesome. If rates go to their market rate during an inflationary period, it pulls capital from assets and assets that are dependent on credit will contract. This last happened when the fed took its foot off the peddle under Volkher in the 80s. Bitcoin has never experienced rates above 4 or 5%, so we still don't know what will happen when it does. But it needs to hold its value during periods of high inflation and high rates to be seen as a hedge. 

Next Bitcoin needs to be uncorrelated with the stock market and an economic downturn. Since 2008 we haven't had a true blue recession. So we don't know how Bitcoin will react during a recession. Bitcoin needs to be uncorrelated with the overall economic climate, similar to how gold performs.

So why is this all important? Why are the next five years key? Well we're due for a recession. This is the longest period without one ever. Secondly we're likely to see run away inflation soon. The two could combine and we will see stagflation. The world will be watching to see how Bitcoin responds.",cryptocurrency

dogecoin,Hear me out... my prediction,"First off let me start by saying I understand doge is a worldwide phenomenon, this prediction is based off of U.S. events.

I cant help but think about all the money that was printed and handed out by the feds over the last year, something on that scale has to have consequences (some of which we are seeing in infaltion). Now think about the amount of people on the inflated unemployment system (where is that money coming from)? Now to top it off it looks like families with children will soon be getting monthly stimulus checks. 

My prediction is that the U.S. economy will take a dive much like 2008. With the civil climate we have and people now accustomed to be being bailed out by the feds. I think we will see full blown monthly stimulus checks to ""assist"". Another way to look at that is socialism, we can look to Venezuela to see how well that is working out.

Now this is where Doge comes in... I think with a year of off the charts inflation and money printing, private companies will stop taking the U.S. dollar as payment. Silver and Gold (any precious mettals) are a great way to secure some of your worth, however, in today's word it is an unrealistic/unscalable means of payment.

# The Income Statement

**What is it?**

The income statement is one of the most common and important financial  statements you’ll come across. It’s also known as the profit and loss  (P&amp;L) statement, summarizing all income and expenses over the period  of analysis, often shared as quarterly and annual reports.

**What is its purpose?**

The function of an income statement is to show a company’s financial performance over the period of analysis.

**What is inside an income statement?**

* **Revenue:** The amount of money a business takes in during a reporting period
* **Expenses:** The amount of money a business spends during a reporting period
* **Costs of goods sold (COGS):** The cost of component parts of what it takes to make whatever it is a business sells
* **Gross profit:** Total revenue less COGS
* **Operating income:** Gross profit less operating expenses
* **Income before taxes:** Operating income less non-operating expenses
* **Net income:** Income before taxes less taxes
* **Earnings per share (EPS):** Division of net income by the total number of outstanding shares
* **Depreciation:** The extent to which assets (for example, aging equipment) have lost value over time
* **EBITDA:** Earnings before interest, depreciation, taxes, and amortization

&gt;*These items often contain sub categories and separate line items depending on a company’s reporting and accounting policies.*

**Classifying Expenses**

**There are three different types of expenses**

**1.** **Operating Expenses**

&gt;**a.** Expenses associate with the operations of the business.**b.** Direct costs of producing the product/service and other expenses associated with production, including SG&amp;A expenses.

**2.** **Financing Expenses**

&gt;**a.** Expenses associated with the use on non-equity financing.**b.** Most often taking form of interest expenses on debt.

**3.** **Capital Expenses**

&gt;**a.** Expenses that provide benefits over many years.**b.** For a manufacturing company these can be plant &amp; equipment.**c.** For non-manufacturing companies they can be less conventional and tangible forms.

**Their Placement**

&gt;***No images allowed on the sub, so here's a link:*** [*https://imgur.com/WCDqBee*](https://imgur.com/WCDqBee)  
&gt;  
&gt;📌 **SUMMARY:**  Operating expenses associate with operations of the business, financing  expenses with non-equity financing and capital expenses with ones that  provide benefit over many years.

# Revenue Recognition

For  most firms, revenue recognition is a simple process, where once a  product or service is sold, it is recorded as revenues. For firms that  sell products or services over many years (eg. subscriptions) it becomes  trickier.

**Under ASC 606 (new revenue recognition standard):**

* The  new model’s core principle for revenue recognition is to “depict the  transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that  reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in  exchange for those goods or services.”
* Thus,  for a real estate developer working on a multi-year construction,  revenues should be recognized as construction progresses, and for a  software firm that enters in a contract over many years, performance  obligations will determine when revenues get recognized.

&gt;**📌  SUMMARY: For most firms, when a product or service is sold, it is  recorded as revenues. For firms that deal with long term contracts,  memberships, subscriptions etc. revenue is recorded depending on sum and  duration - eg. $120,000 for 1 year of service = $10,000/month recorded  revenue.**

# Revenue breakdowns

As companies enter **multiple businesses and different geographies**, it is useful to know **where they generate their revenues.**

**Where** are **geographic breakdowns found?**

* While the breakdown can **sometimes** by provided in **income statements**, they are more likely to be part of the **footnotes to the financial statements.**
* Companies generally break down ***revenues by geography***, though the degree of detail can vary.
* Companies also break down ***revenues by business segment***, though there is an element of **subjectivity to the segment categorization.**

&gt;**📌 SUMMARY:** Companies generally **break down revenues by geography** with a varying degree of detail and **revenues by business segments**  subjective to the segment categorization. Both can sometimes be found  in the income statement, but generally they are found in the **footnotes of the financial statements.**

# Operating expenses: Breakdown

Operating  expenses are broken down into expenses directly related to producing  the goods or services that give rise to revenues, i.e. cost of goods  sold, and expenses that are related to operations, but which are not as  directly tied to revenues.

**How** are operating expense broken down?

1. Expenses directly **related to the production** of goods / services that **increase revenues.** These are **netted out** form **revenues to get gross profits.**
2. Expenses related to operations, not directly tied to revenues. These are **netted out** from **gross profits to get operating income.**

**SG&amp;A Costs**

1. In many companies, the **largest** **non-operating expense is S, G &amp; A**, a term that can include everything but the kitchen sink.

&gt;**📌 SUMMARY:** Companies **break down revenues** by how they **relate to production** or **operations.** The **former tied to the increase of revenues,** the **latter not.**

# Depreciation

There are three forms of depreciation; **economic, accounting &amp; tax depreciation.**

1. **Economic Depreciation**

This reflects the **loss in value (earning power) in an asset, as it ages.** It requires nuance, and will vary across even the same type of assets, depending on how it is used.

2. **Accounting Depreciation**

This is more mechanical and is **driven largely by the aging of the asset**, with the differences often being in whether it happens **uniformly over the life of the asset or is more accelerated.**

3. **Tax Depreciation**

This reflects what the tax authorities will allow as **depreciation for purposes of computing taxable income.**

&gt;**📌 SUMMARY: Economic** depreciation reflects **loss in value (earning power) in an asset, as it ages.** **Accounting** depreciation is **driven by the aging of an asset,** **depending** if it occurs **over the life time of the asset or in a more accelerated period.** **Tax** depreciation reflects **what authorities allow as depreciation** for purposes of **computing taxable income.**

# Financial expenses

The most common financial expense is **interest expense on debt**, either in the form of bank loans or corporate bonds.

**Some interest expense is implicit**

As accountants classify other **commitments (such as leases) as debt, some of the interest expense is implicit**, i.e., it is calculated by accountants **based upon their assessment** of the **debt equivalent value of commitments and current interest rates.**

**If interest income exceeds interest expense, this number will measure net interest income.**

In some companies, **interest expenses are netted out against interest income earned by the company on its cash holdings** and **financial investments**, and **reported as a net interest expense**. If interest income exceeds interest expense, this number will measure net interest income.

&gt;**📌 SUMMARY:** Most **common financial expense is interest expense on debt**, either **bank loans or corporate bonds.** Accountants classify **other commitments (leases etc.) as debt,** making some **interest  expense implicit and calculated based on their assessment of debt  equivalent value of commitments and current interest rates.** Some companies net out interest expense against interest income earned on cash holdings and financial investments. If **interest income exceeds interest expense, this number will measure net interest income.**

# Income from non-operating investments

Income  earned from cash &amp; marketable securities are reported different  then income earned from cross holdings in other companies.

**Cash &amp; Marketable Securities**

**Income earned on cash holdings** (which is invested in marketable securities, like treasury bills and commercial paper in most companies) will be **reported either as a stand alone income or netted against interest expenses.**

**Cross holdings** in other companies

* Reporting can vary upon the magnitude of your holding:
* When you hold a (**small or minority**) portion of **another company,** the **income** from that holding will **usually be reported in the income statement.**
* If you hold a **majority stake of another company**, you will generally **have to consolidate your financials.** You will **count 100% of the subsidiary’s revenues,** **operating expenses and operating income as your own.**

&gt;**📌 SUMMARY: Income earned** on **cash holdings** will be reported either as a s**tand alone income or netted against interest expenses. Income** earned from **minority stake** in a company will usually be reported in the **income statement.** If you hold a **majority  stake of another company, you will consolidate 100% of it's revenues,  operating expenses and operation income as your own.**

# Extraordinary Income/Expenses

As the term implies, extraordinary income and expenses are designed to capture what a company **does not face in the ordinary course of operations.**

**Extraordinary** items include:

* **One-time expense or gain** from **sale of assets or divisions**
* **Write offs or charges** associated with **past project, lawsuits or fines**
* **Impairment of goodwill from acquisitions** in the **past**

**Truly extraordinary** items:

* If an item is **truly extraordinary**, it should show up **infrequently** and the amount associated with it **should vary**.

&gt;**📌 SUMMARY: Extraordinary** items and expenses capture what a company **does not face in the ordinary course of operations**. If an item shows up **regularly and consistently, it is not extraordinary.**

# Income Statement Analysis

There are **two** **methods** to read and analyze financial documents: **vertical and horizontal analysis.**

**Vertical Analysis**

&gt;***No images allowed on the sub, so here's a link:*** [*https://imgur.com/tsbdF73*](https://imgur.com/tsbdF73)

This  method of analysis, as the name suggests, is top – down. You look up  and down the income statement to see how each line compares to revenue  as a percentage.

This type of  analysis makes it simple to compare financial statements  across periods  and industries, and between companies, because you can  see relative  proportions. It also helps you analyze whether performance  metrics are  improving.

Vertical analysis isn’t  always as immediately useful as horizontal  analysis, but it can help  you determine what questions should be asked,  such as: *Where did costs rise or fall? What line items are contributing most to profit margins? How are they affected over time?*

**E.g** – here we have the total dollar amounts and the percentages side by side

**Horizontal Analysis**

&gt;***No images allowed on the sub, so here's a link:*** [*https://imgur.com/Zkgy21y*](https://imgur.com/Zkgy21y)

This method of analysis focuses on **year-over-year (YoY) or quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) performance.**

Horizontal  analysis makes financial data and reporting consistent per  generally  accepted accounting principles (GAAP). It improves the review  of a  company’s consistency over time, as well as its growth compared to   competitors.

Because of this,  horizontal analysis is important to investors and  analysts. By  conducting a horizontal analysis, you can tell what’s been  driving an  organization’s financial performance over the years and spot  trends and  growth patterns, line item by line item. Ultimately,  horizontal  analysis is used to identify trends over time—comparisons  from Q1 to  Q2, for example—instead of revealing how individual line  items relate  to others.

**To perform horizontal analysis you:**

1. Take the value of Period N
2. Divide it by the value of Period N-1
3. Subtract 1 from that number to obtain percentage change

&gt;**E.g –** ***Revenue in 2017 was $4,000 and in 2016 it was $3,000. The YoY change in revenue is $4000/$3000 – 1 = 33%.***",finance

My current financial situation:

Assets:

\- Apartment valued at 250K approximately

\- Stock portfolio: 30K , taxed at 1.35% of value at year end.

\- Savings account; 105K @ -0.5% interest plus taxed at 1.35% of value at year end.

Liabilities;

Mortgage; 114K remaining at 1.15% tax deductible interest rate (tax rate; 49,5%).

Student debt: 26K remaining at 0% interest.

Important future liability; as of 2028 the land lease for my house will expire, I will then be offered to buy the land from my government at approximately 60K (but I can get a mortgage for that).

Other note worthy items;

\- Single male, no kids, have a girlfriend but we aren't living together yet. 

\- I drive a company issued lease vehicle.

I am considering how best to invest my savings. I don't want to keep it in my savings account because of the negative interest rate. I also don't want to invest it in the stockmarket right now because I believe the stockmarket is currently overvalued and we can expect a correction any time now.

I would preferably invest it in real estate; buy a house to rent out. However, I will need a buy to let mortgage for that and if I apply for a mortgage, they may find out I lied about having student debt when applying for the mortgage of my current house. So if I want to invest in property, I should first pay of my student loans. But then I probably won't have enough to buy a house (minimum financing requirement is 1/3th equity... taking into account I will need to keep some money behind to make renovations to whatever property I'm considering to buy).

I am able to make an additional penalty free payment towards my mortgage of 13.500 EUR which I am considering to do.

I am also considering around 5K in renovations to my current home.

I am considering 6-7K in consumptive purchases (in full honesty; I've been dreaming of having a Breitling watch for a long time)

I am considering what the best investment strategy would be for the remainder of the money. Primarily; would it be a good idea to pay off my student loans, even though they are interest free?",finance
personalfinance,"When can I afford lifestyle creep, and how much can I afford?","The bad news: two years ago I was in a terrible financial position. I was earning less than 40k a year, had almost 30k in CC debt and 80k student loan debt (10k private, 70k federal).

The good news: I turned my life around. I worked on increasing my income and now am making 82k/year. I completely paid off my $30k CC debt. I paid off the 10k private student loan debt. I just hit 10k in my emergency fund. My remaining debt is $61k of federal student loan debt (lower interest than the rest, around \~3%). I also have 20k in retirement (I am 29, so I am behind on this). So I'm still not in a great financial position, but it's better!

My monthly INCOME:

$4800 take-home pay - this is after taxes, FICA, dental insurance, and $200 to 401k (to get employer match) come out

My monthly EXPENSES:

$675 - mortgage and homeowner's insurance

$75 - gas/electric

$25 - water

$40 - internet

$40 - cell phone

$465 - car (0% 60-month), insurance, gas

$600 - my ""spending budget"" for groceries, toiletries, entertainment (spotify/hulu), etc.

This leaves me \~$2880/month. Until now this excess was going to CC debt and emergency fund, so I am figuring out my next steps. Right now my tentative plan is:  
1. Pay off $15k of \~5% interest student loan debt (note that it's actually at 0% right now - I'm referring to what the rate will be when the COVID stuff ends) - this should take about 6 months

2. Max out an IRA and then up contributions to my 401k to hit 15% (before 4% employer match) which will be $1,000/month, then start contributing to HSA and aim to max that

3. Tackle the lower (\~3%) 46k student loan debt

I came up with this plan by following the flowchart (so let me know if I'm missing something and my plan is bad).

Now to the meat of my question: Right now other than groceries most of my ""spending budget"" is going to upkeep and necessities for my home. For example I saved $200 a month from this budget for the last number of months to replace my water heater. Other than that I'm trying to live frugally. The only time I dine out is when I take my mom out for her birthday or Mother's day, last week I patched a hole on a previous patch on my only pair of jeans..

Keeping my lifestyle low-key has enabled me pay off a lot of debt and obviously I want to keep the train rolling. However, I'd also kill to live a little better. I'd love to buy new jeans. In fact two pairs would be a dream come true. I'd love to eat at a restaurant with friends. I'd love to buy some non-necessities for my home and make some updates to it. I would die for a vacation - the closest thing I've ever had to one was when I stayed in a hotel overnight for a funeral two years ago.

So my question is: when can I afford to start allotting more to what I allow myself to spend? Should I be waiting until the lower interest student loan debt is gone? How much would be a reasonable amount to start increasing my allowance to myself?",finance

dogecoin,Lost 50% - $50k of my entire family savings in the last 15 days!,"Disclaimer: Even if you downvote it's fine. I don't want anyone else to suffer like my family. It's my greed, mistake and I responsible for all this.

Trust me the current crypto market is a big scam, pumped up by fake stable money called Tether and strategically manipulated by whales in sync with the news and tweets. 

This is going to come crashing even more brutally. 

The influencers and Hedge funds ask you to buy and hold! So they can sell for higher prices and make quick money. Until you realize the profits, we are not actually in the profit.


Please research before you invest any further.

1. Look at the trading patterns of 100 top Bitcoin Wallets in Bitinfochart for BTc and others (you can search anyone's wallet here), all other cryptocurrencies value factustes on Bitcoin. 

Example,
https://bitinfocharts.com/dash/address/XrVvHkwsJVAk6Qo2neKQUMUVx3TMh9uHGz

2. Follow the tweets of @Whale_alert it will give you an idea of when BTC and ETH are transferred, How many USDT is added to the market. it will give you an idea of when there will be a big pump or dump next time. 

3. In my opinion, going back to the barter system is like transitioning to an uncivilized stoneage. Venezuela using cryptocurrency as a hedge against inflation does not mean US and China banks will do it. This is not going to happen, now with this USDT scam, it will not happen for sure 100%. China understood the threat of USDT so-called stable currency and now protecting its banks and financial institutions from getting into it.


4. US Fed and China government are carefully researching the crypto market and all types of currencies. I think the crypto is POC for them.

5. Hint from Elon, that world currency should not have a limit on supply itself it a clue. I.e., whatever influencers say it's a hedge against inflation everything becomes untrue!

I hope this information is helpful.

vet,Cat won’t eat-vomiting,"Hello.

My cat recently turned one a few days ago. She is usually a very good eater, we feed her one 3 ounce can of wet food in the morning and another one at night with 1/4 cup of organic dry food out all day. 

I fed her a can yesterday morning and she ate the whole thing. She then almost threw up in the afternoon, just gagged but nothing came up. She also slept a lot that day. That evening I fed her another can at 8 o’clock and I came back out at midnight and she had not touched it. I decided to throw the food away and wait until morning and try again thinking she might’ve had an upset stomach from the can I gave her in the morning.

She slept under my bed all night which is very unusual for her, and in the morning I gave her another can which she would not touch. I tried to give her pieces of deli turkey meat, shredded cheese, and different types of food. She ate a few treats but nothing else.

She is not crying or howling like she is in pain, but I am concerned that she is not getting enough water considering she usually gets most of her water from her wet food. 

She has been shedding a lot recently because it’s getting hot, so I wonder if she has a hairball that is stuck. She has used the bathroom since yesterday and has thrown up a total of 4 times, 2 of those with hairballs.

I am a 22 year old grad student and she is my registered ESA, I honestly cannot afford $600 in tests or vet bills right now so any advice would be helpful.

personalfinance,Help Evaluating Two Mortgage Quotes &amp; APR,"TL;DR - Which one seems better?

Edit: Updated table with 2 revised quotes from Lender 2.  Now Lender 2 Update A seems like the better option to me.

We have a house under contract and are down to two lenders to decide between and would like some help evaluating them.  I have put summarized info below, but can probably provide more detail if needed.  These are from their initial estimated cash to close worksheets, however both of them are currently looking at revising or matching some fees compared to the other, so I may update this post with another table once I get them within a couple hours.  We are hoping to decide today.  Is Lender 1 the clear winner here?  Is there anything I should be on the lookout for?

To me Lender 1 seems better overall, but the closing costs include a loan discount of $1,350 which is related to the -0.290% ""points"".  When I asked the lender about why there are negative points (she indicated more than once that the initial worksheet would have 0 points) either I didn't understand it or she wasn't being clear, so I am not sure if that is making their quote appear better than it really is or not, or how the quote may be affected if it is taken out.

Lender 2 has been helpful and very proactive with generating our preapproval letters if we needed one (we were not actively looking but were keeping an eye out for certain places for a few months and put in 2 previous offers).

I have also tried to recalculate the APRs for each using calculators online but am coming nowhere close to what is showing on these worksheets for the APRs.  Not sure if I'm doing it wrong or there are some additional fees that don't show up on the worksheets.

A couple other things I am taking into account:  We are listing our current house after closing on the first, and will be applying the proceeds towards the new mortgage and recasting the loan.  Lender 1 does not charge a fee for recasting, Lender 2 charges up to $450.  I also have banked with Lender 1 for a couple decades now, and there are some other non-mortgage related benefits, however small, that could come from having a mortgage with them.

CryptoCurrency,The US dollar have lost 96% of its purchasing power since 1913 due to fractional reserve banking and inflation.,"[100 dollars in 1913 is worth ~4 usd today](
https://cdn.howmuch.net/articles/Rise-and-Fall-of-the-USD-64c2.jpg), we are literally at a point in history were in a few decades, the US dollar as it is today, will be bankrupt/useless or reworked.


Fractional reserve banking means that the banks accept deposits from customers and then make loans to borrowers(creating debt/credit) while only holding a fraction of that actual money in their reserves.


It usually ranges from 1-10% but as of march 2020, the minimum reserve requirement for all deposit institutions was abolished, or more technically, fixed to zero percent of eligible deposits. 



The Board previously mandated a zero reserve requirement for banks with eligible deposits up to $16 million, 3% for banks up to $122.3 million, and 10% thereafter. 



So if im a bank with 100 millions in assets, I only need to hold 3% of that as 'real' money, the rest is just ""I OWE U"" notes I created in my basement and give to people as loans(and charge interest for, lol).


But thats only if its a checking account.


&gt;The deposit liability categories currently subject to reserve requirements are mainly checking accounts. 


&gt;There is no reserve requirement on savings accounts and time deposit accounts owned by individuals.


The banks are not required to have real money. They borrow and lend credit/debt without reserve requirements and then charge interest on it, the printer truly goes brrrr.



By the end of 2020, federal debt($26.9 trillion usd) held by the public is projected to equal 98 percent of gross domestic product (GDP)—its highest level since shortly after World War II. Only 2% of ""money"" is real the rest is just on credit.



So the dollar is going to shit, debt is at an all time high, cash and old systems seems to be on their way out as we live in a further digital world as time passes.



Coincidentally, the central banks and federal reserve have been working on their own digital currency behind the scene for years now(publicly spoken about as early as 2017) and in this summer is prepared to release whitepapers.


&gt;Powell announced that the Federal Reserve plans to publish this summer a discussion paper that will explore the implications of fast-evolving technology for digital payments, with a particular focus on the possibility of issuing a U.S. central bank digital currency. The paper will complement Federal Reserve System research that is already underway.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/preconditions-for-a-general-purpose-central-bank-digital-currency-20210224.htm


EU central banks have said the same


&gt;A digital euro would be a digital symbol of progress and integration in Europe, said Executive Board member Fabio Panetta when presenting the report on a digital euro. Since the introduction of the euro, the ECB has been responsible for preserving citizens’ trust in our currency. Together with cash, a digital euro would be accessible to all and offer greater choice to ways of paying.

https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/digital_euro/html/index.en.html



So in doing a psuedo macro analysis its very clear that cryptocurrencies is the future, digital money is where its going. Whilst the banks will create their own ""crypto""/blockchain, the environment is still very digital which is why we are bullish on crypto long term.



Too bad that the banks are involved and have probably paved the way for it but hey, whaddya gonna do, atleast we gonna get some lambos.



Also this barely scratches the surface as there are alot more to monetary policy with inflation and interest rates, this was just a 'overview' with a conspiracy-esque flavor to it, but how can you not lol the banks are the biggest scammers in history.

Everyone thinks that it's the easy thing to do. That's why they fall for trading the dips. They fall for the scammy high interest rate websites. They fall for the economic fears that are put out by the major bankers to ""Sell because Crypto is only used by drug dealers. And we think that you're one"".

No...HODL'ing is the hardest move. To have the courage and conviction to just park it and to sit and to wait. 

Wait as Crypto rises against the Fiat more than a fifty foot wave and falls faster than our interest in Elon Musk. 

Wait as Institutions pull out billions of Fiat in order to prop up the existing system for just a few more months.

Crypto will be here long after I am gone. But I will HODL until it becomes the currency of choice. Slowly, a dawning realization is spreading among millions of people that not only can Crypto be bought, but it can be earned and traded and utilized far more freely than any existing Fiat-based monetary system.

HODL'ers like me have the understanding of the truth. What is the truth? That there is no Fiat. Only Crypto.

There is not an amount of Fiat that I would be willing to sell my Crypto for. On the other hand, if there was a really worthy Crypto project? Why, I might HODL that one too.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Are these 30 yr interest rates for real? And questions about refinancing,"Hi all,

Credit Karma caught my eye with a 2.250 interest rate on refinancing with 0 down. Wife and I bought our house last November at 3.125% for 259k (FHA) and owe about 249k on it. Houses are now selling within days for 300k-315k in my neighborhood (Central FL) and I'm interested in refinancing so I don't have to pay mortgage insurance or PMI when the time comes. Should I pull the trigger on a refinance since the rates are so low and we might get out of PMI soon? I didn't see anything in my home loan documents about keeping the loan for a minimum amount of time. Is there a way I can check to make sure?",finance

personalfinance,Trying to figure out if a refinance is worth the closing costs,"I paid $600K for a condo 5 years ago with a $450K (75% LTV) 30-year fixed mortgage at 3.5% (3.537% APR).

The mortgage balance is now \~$405K.

I'm trying to figure out if it's worth refinancing to the following mortgage:

* new loan amount: \~$540K (75% LTV), resulting in up to $135K cash out, less closing costs
* 30-year fixed at 3.25% interest rate (no points)
* 3.25% APR, with just over $5K of estimated refinancing costs (not including escrowed costs and prepaid interest that I'd be paying regardless) coming out of the cash-out amount

I'm reasonably financially savvy, but I have a hard time wrapping my mind around technical analysis. How do I determine if this refinance is worth the \~$5K of closing costs?

I realize that I could lower my interest rate by either not doing a cash-out and/or opting for a 15-year mortgage (it seems like going for a 25-year or even 20-year wouldn't make a huge impact in reducing the interest rate), but my impression is that the interest savings wouldn't be worth the reduction in liquidity that could be more productively invested. For reference, this same lender quoted 3.12% (3.18% APR) for a 30-year fixed with no cash out.

I plan to keep the house for at least 5 years, if not more than a decade.

As for what I plan to do with the cash out amount (estimated to be around $124K), I plan to hold it in interest-earning accounts until a market correction provides an opportunity to buy equities or real estate. In terms of risk assessment, $124K represents about 16% of my net worth (technically it's my wife and I, but just keeping things simple).

Is this refinance worth it? Or should I just save the \~$5K? Or should I restructure the refinance? Or is this lender not providing a competitive rate for someone with a high credit score?

Thanks in advance! I'd really appreciate some help.",finance

personalfinance,Varo Bank's staggering incompetence almost costt me a house and a huge earnest-money deposit. Stay far away.,"tl;dr—Varo is a deeply dysfunctional bank whose customers have to go to extraordinary lengths to get basic services, and nothing about Varo's product justifies the degree of hassle.  I almost lost a house purchase and over $100k because Varo couldn’t perform a basic function.  You should stay very far away. 

&amp;nbsp;

Varo Bank gets a lot of hype across the internet.  From [personal finance websites](https://www.nerdwallet.com/reviews/banking/varo) to more traditional publications like [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/varo-bank-review/), the internet is full of reviews and other commentary singing Varo’s praises.  As a Varo customer, I didn’t really get this.  And after my recent experience dealing with Varo as a former customer, I feel obligated to warn others against this colossally incompetent bank.  

&amp;nbsp;

A handful of months ago, my fiancé and I decided to try to purchase a house.  In the course of this process, I realized that—if we were ever successful in this crazy pandemic housing market—I would have to wire a sizable amount of my cash from my Varo account to a title company.  And because Varo doesn’t offer wire functionality at all—and very limited ACH transfer capability—I realized that I would have to move my assets to a new bank.  So I did. 

&amp;nbsp;

Fast forward a couple of months.  Our realtor finds a great house off market and we move aggressively to get it under contract before the seller lists.  We succeed.  Our lender then starts to ask for financial documentation in addition to what we’ve already supplied.  For the most part, this wasn’t a problem.  The lender primarily wanted updated versions of documents we’d already submitted.  But there was one item I didn’t have handy: my Varo account statements.  Because the cash in my new bank account was insufficiently seasoned—that is, it hadn’t been in the account for 90+ days—I had to show where the money came from (i.e., my Varo account).  But I’d already closed my Varo accounts without saving these documents, and the credentials for my online account no longer worked. 

&amp;nbsp;

So I reached out to Varo to see if they could help me obtain these documents.  After waiting multiple hours to speak to someone, I was told (on a Thursday) that I would receive the account documents by COB the following Tuesday.  No problem, I thought, as that Tuesday would be almost a full week before closing the following Monday  I told the customer service agent on the call that I was closing on a house and that the purchase, including our sizable earnest-money deposit, would be in jeopardy if I didn’t receive these documents.  No worries, she assured me: the documents would arrive by Tuesday night at the latest.  Peachy. 

&amp;nbsp;

Tuesday came and went, but the documents never arrived.  So I called Varo Wednesday morning.  After waiting over three hours to speak to someone, I was told that there had been a delay in retrieving my account documents—which seemed weird given that my account had just been closed—but that I should expect to receive them by the end of the day.  

&amp;nbsp;

At 8 p.m. Wednesday, I received an email purporting to attach two of the three statements I requested; the third statement was presumably still buried in the deep recesses of Varo’s vaults.  The email contained no attachments.  So I again called Varo.  Luckily, it took less than an hour to get someone on the phone this time.  But that’s where my luck ended.  I was told that the documents had been sent to me (they had not), that the problem was my Gmail account (it was not), and that I should get in touch with Google to resolve.  I explained to the agent that this was extremely unlikely, as I’d never had an issue sending or receiving documents over Gmail before.  She wouldn’t hear it.  I also suggested that the software she’d attempted to send the attachment through, Zendesk, might be to blame.  No, she told me: they’d never experienced this problem before. 

&amp;nbsp;

Worried that my house purchase might fall through because I couldn’t get these documents, I asked whether she could overnight them to me in hardcopy.  After a brief (for Varo) hold, I was told that this wouldn’t be possible as Varo is an “online bank.”  Incredulous, I reiterated the stakes: loss of a house purchase plus a really large earnest-money deposit.  She felt “really sorry,” but told me there was nothing she could do and that I should reach out to Google. 

&amp;nbsp;

In a bit of a panic, I considered my options.  My outreach to Varo through various media—their customer service line, Twitter, and Instagram—had gotten me only so far.  I needed to find a way to accelerate this to Varo’s leadership.  So I guessed Varo’s CEO’s email address—which was easy to confirm as his linked Google account profile picture popped up when I entered the correct address—and explained my predicament.  Worried that this email might slip through the cracks—or that he might be able to claim that it slipped through the cracks, as I was no longer willing to assume good faith on Varo’s part—I sent the identical email to a dozen or so other Varo executives.  For good measure, I also sent the email to each recipient through a second, non-Gmail email account.  And then I went to bed, knowing that I had done basically everything that I could short of booking a ticket to San Francisco.
 
&amp;nbsp;

Early the next morning, I received a phone call from someone who identified herself an assistant to Varo’s CEO, Colin Walsh.  She told me that Colin had asked her to reach out to me in response to my email.  After I recounted my many attempts to resolve this issue with Varo’s customer service, she told me (i) that she was able to access all of my statements instantly (which I had previously been told would take days to retrieve), and (ii) that they were aware of the Zendesk attachment issue and knew a workaround (contrary to what one of the agents had told me).  I was stunned.  She sent me the documents, I forwarded them to my lender, and we were able to close. 

&amp;nbsp;

While I’m thankful that I finally got these documents from Varo, I think it goes without saying that I shouldn’t have had to contact the bank’s CEO to get them.  I wasn’t asking for much—from what I understand, this is a fairly routine request that other banks are able to process quickly without issue.  And every step along the way was painful—from the multiple-hour waits on Varo’s customer service line (which, inexplicably, doesn’t have a call-back feature) to my desperate pleas to an indifferent customer service agent for help.  

&amp;nbsp;

Varo is not a good bank.  Its above-market interest rates—the only reason I moved my money to it in the first place—are no longer higher than the rates of more competent banks (e.g., Ally).  And even if its rates were double what I could get elsewhere, I don’t think it would be worth dealing with the bank’s atrocious customer service and lack of common banking services (like wires).  It’s an inferior product, and there’s really no reason anyone should choose it over any of a handful of more established internet banks that offer similar rates. 

&amp;nbsp;

This post isn’t meant to harm Varo’s business in any way.  I honestly couldn’t care less what becomes of the bank.  But given the pace at which it is growing and the breathlessly enthusiastic commentary I see about it throughout the internet, I thought I’d post my experience as a PSA.",finance

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, May 26, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, May 26, 2021**

Stocks mostly consolidated today, finishing modestly higher led by a 0.34% gain in the Nasdaq (QQQ). After the volatility experienced in the first weeks of May it is very encouraging to see market volatility calming down and holding on to recent gains. Market participants continue to closely monitor incoming inflation data, though it seems fears that the Federal Reserve will be forced to tighten monetary policy have tempered.

New economic data released yesterday shows consumer confidence dipped in April, compared to March, even as more social distancing restrictions were lifted across the US. The Conference Board (a non-profit research organization), released their April Consumer Confidence index which showed sentiment falling steeper than expected. The report showed the consumer confidence index dipped to 117.2 in May from 117.5 in April. However, on the positive side, April's reading was the highest since February 2020, before the start of Covid-19 lockdowns. Economists expected consumer confidence to rise to 119.5. 

Yesterday, members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), reiterated their stance that they were not yet concerned that new inflation data would force the Fed to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he believed increases in inflation would be “mostly temporary” and that the Fed was “not quite there yet” when it came to discussing tapering its asset purchase program. In separate comments, Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said she did not want the Fed to be “overly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judging the outlook for inflation.” 

Richard Clarida, Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve, also said “there will come a time in upcoming meetings” when the Fed would consider tapering the asset purchase program but that “it is going to depend on the flow of data”. The Fed is currently buying $120 billion a month in government-issued and government-backed securities, and has pledged to continue doing that until the economy is more fully recovered.

This reaffirms the market that the Fed is not on a set timeline when it comes to rolling back current accommodative policies and will, as they have said time and again, wait for concrete data before any considerations are made. This follows a similar statement from Jerome Powell back in April 14, which proves market participants shouldn’t worry about quantitative easing tapering, in my opinion. Powell said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.”

**Highlights** 

* Great vaccination numbers coming out in the US.

CryptoCurrency,"The Protocols Bringing Derivatives to DeFi: Synthetix, Mirror, and others explained","DeFi’s explosive growth has led to the launch of numerous protocols that bring lending, exchanges, and payments to the globe, without the need for financial intermediaries. And while lending platforms are still the most common, there’s a category with the potential to become a serious contender: derivatives.

Right now, derivatives represent approximately $3B out of a total of over $64B locked in DeFi. While this may seem like a respectable amount, consider that even the most conservative estimates put the value of the total derivatives market in traditional finance in the tens of trillions. Compound this with the fact that the total value locked (TVL) in DeFi is more than 75x what it was at the same time last year, and it seems very possible that things are just getting started.

What are Derivatives?

Derivatives are products including options, futures, collateralized loans, and prediction markets, where an arrangement or instrument has a value derived from the underlying asset. The underlying asset could be anything: a stock, bond, interest rate, commodity, or currency. Ultimately, it gives investors exposure without actually having to hold the asset, and the ability to easily transfer risk from one party to another.

Within the more recent past, derivatives have been a crucial component in modern finance. In fact, some estimates put the derivatives market at an incredible $1 quadrillion—significantly more than global real estate, global debt, or global stock markets. While this seems like an unbelievably large number, it’s based on the notional value of all available derivatives contracts—the amount of value controlled by the position or obligation. Lower estimates base the value of the derivatives market on its market value, which goes by the price of a security set by buyers and sellers via supply and demand. However, even the lowest estimates put the worth of the derivatives market at more than $15 trillion as of last year. While the actual worth of the derivatives market is debatable, the outcome is the same: derivatives absolutely dwarf any other market.

Every growing market naturally develops its own derivatives market, which is magnitudes larger than its underlying market. While derivatives are already considered to be more complex financial instruments, decentralized derivatives have the potential for even more innovation. Unlike traditional finance, derivatives in DeFi can be created and used by anyone. And, with the ability to create instruments on virtually any underlying asset, this opens the door to more unique and sophisticated products.

personalfinance,How is tax liability calculated in order to receive the full PHEV (plug in hybrid) tax credit?,"Hello everyone, I figured it would be worthwhile to post this question in PF sub from the tax sub.

Straight to the point: I don’t quite understand how the plug-in electric tax credit applies/how people qualify for the maximum amount.

I understand that this is a credit that I won’t see until I file my taxes, that the tax credit is “up to” $7500, and that in order to qualify for the maximum credit I have to have a “tax liability” of that amount.

Where I get lost is how I would get the maximum $7500 credit. From my understanding I need to owe the government at least $7500 when I file my taxes in order to get that full credit, and as someone who has never even had to pay $20 when filing that number seems so large. So I am confused about whether my tax liability is the amount of money I owe overall before my withholding (which would be ~$9,500 at 22% tax bracket as a single filer projected to earn $75k/year) or is the tax liability after withholding and standard deductions?

For context, only within the past 2 years have I started making significantly more money. For most of my adult life I was making about $35-40k/year and never owed money when it came time to filing; and now I just recently got a huge pay bump so a lot of the financial/accounting jargon is lost on me (and I have been actively trying to become much more financially literate but it’s taking time).

If it helps I also do live in Southern California, and I know CA does have some incentives as well but not as generous as the ones on a federal level so right now my focus is the federal ones. And before I get any ridicule, no I am not planning on buying a car now (this is going to be on the 3-5 year horizon when I save enough for a down payment and if I can get a substantial tax credit then it’ll help to shorten my timeline); and yes I will consider buying used, but I want to keep my options open especially if I can get amazing financing in combination with really good rebates/credits.",finance
CryptoCurrency,"Only for bulls: bears stay out, you don't want to get hurt","Hello bulls, 

Just wanted to point out a few brutal days ahead for the bears, looks like the stampede is about to start. 

Consider these points: 

1. We just saw one of the most brutal sell offs of any market in history of mankind and the market recovered incredibly fast, might be the biggest bear trap of all times.  (See point 4) .


2. FOMO is real! Everyone and his neighbor heart about crypto, but hasn't invested yet. Real interest rates are negative in the developed world. The stock market is at all time highs, bonds have no prospective returns for the next 30 to 40 years. They call it TINA --&gt; There Is No Alternative.

3. In the past they called it ""Debasement"" and it works as follow: ""A debasement of coinage is the practice of lowering the intrinsic value of coins, especially when used in connection with commodity money, such as gold or silver coins. A coin is said to be debased if the quantity of gold, silver, copper or nickel in the coin is reduced.""
[Source](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/) 

Nowadays it's called MMT (Modern Monetary Theorie), here are two main principles: 

MMT's main tenets are that a government that issues its own fiat money: 

Can pay for goods, services, and financial assets without a need to first collect money in the form of taxes or debt issuance in advance of such purchases; 

Cannot be forced to default on debt denominated in its own currency; 

[Source](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Monetary_Theory#:~:text=Modern%20Monetary%20Theory%20or%20Modern,taxes%20and%20satisfy%20savings%20desires.) 

The only problem is crypto, it provides an escape valve from MMT and can lead to serious problems for the government since it wants to spend without a need to first collect money, who doesn't, I don't blame them. 

4. Chart analysis: all major coins broke many support levels and recovered them again, today they are establishing impressive new support levels that would negate the break. Biggest bear trap of all time, even not so young and shaky bulls got thrown out. The bulls that are left have diamond balls and prefer bear sausage for breakfast. 

EDIT:

5. Timing the market is for suckers and lemmings that get milked by the other market participants: ""The key result is that the probability distribution function of market timing returns is asymmetric, that the highest probability outcome for market timing is a below median return. Put another way, simple math says market timing is more likely to lose than to win—even before accounting for costs""

For context, making 190,000K in SF is the equivalent of making 114,228 in Sacramento ([source](https://www.nerdwallet.com/cost-of-living-calculator/compare/san-francisco-ca-vs-sacramento-ca)) in terms of purchasing power. For this reason, I wonder if working for less pay in Sacramento as an officer might be a better financial option.
* **Median Home Price SF:** $1,263,813
* **Additional Risks:** If I don't pass the CA bar exam (there's at least a 10% chance that I don't), then I'd have all this debt without being a lawyer.

**Police Officer**

* **Years of School/Opportunity Cost:** 6 months
* **Debt:** None
* **Median Income:** Starting pay will be around $70,000, but the median income in Sacramento is 100,000 for a police officer.
* **COL Considerations:** Sacramento is much cheaper than SF, as stated above.
* **Median Home Price Sac:** $455,600
* **Additional Risks:** If I were seriously/fatally injured in the line of duty, then I'd be screwed.

Anyway, I'd appreciate any feedback or thoughts!

investing,When will the Fed end quantitative easing and what will happen to the market when it does?,[removed],finance
CryptoCurrency,Just a quick reminder why Bitcoin/Cryptocurrency was invented in the first place.,"* People used to pay each other in gold and silver. Difficult to transport. Difficult to divide.
* Paper money was invented. A claim to gold in a bank vault. Easier to transport and divide.
* Banks  gave out more paper money than they had gold in the vault. They ran  “fractional reserves”. A real money maker. But every now and then, banks  collapsed because of runs on the bank.
* Central  banking was invented. Central banks would be lenders of last resort.  Runs on the bank were thus mitigated by banks guaranteeing each other’s  deposits through a central bank. The risk of a bank run was not lowered.  Its frequency was diminished and its impact was increased. After all,  banks remained basically insolvent in this fractional reserve scheme.
* Banks  would still get in trouble. But now, if one bank got in sufficient  trouble, they would all be in trouble at the same time. Governments  would have to step in to save them.
* All  ties between the financial system and gold were severed in 1971 when  Nixon decided that the USD would no longer be exchangeable for a fixed  amount of gold. This exacerbated the problem, because there was now  effectively no limit anymore on the amount of paper money that banks  could create.
* From  this moment on, all money was created as credit. Money ceased to be  supported by an asset. When you take out a loan, money is created and  lent to you. Banks expect this freshly minted money to be returned to  them with interest. Sure, banks need to keep adequate reserves. But  these reserves basically consist of the same credit-based money. And  reserves are much lower than the loans they make.
* This  led to an explosion in the money supply. The Federal Reserve stopped  reporting M3 in 2006. But the ECB currently reports a yearly increase in  the supply of the euro of about 5%.
* This  leads to a yearly increase in prices. The price increase is somewhat  lower than the increase in the money supply. This is because of  increased productivity. Society gets better at producing stuff cheaper  all the time. So, in absence of money creation you would expect prices  to drop every year. That they don’t is the effect of money creation.
* What remains is an inflation rate in the 2% range.
* Banks  have discovered that they can siphon off all the productivity increase +  2% every year, without people complaining too much. They accomplish  this currently by increasing the money supply by 5% per year, getting  this money returned to them at an interest.
* Apart  from this insidious tax on society, banks take society hostage every  couple of years. In case of a financial crisis, banks need bailouts or  the system will collapse.
* Apart  from these problems, banks and governments are now striving to do away  with cash. This would mean that no two free men would be able to  exchange money without intermediation by a bank. If you believe that to  transact with others is a fundamental right, this should scare you.
* The  absence of sound money was at the root of the problem. We were  force-fed paper money because there were no good alternatives. Gold and  silver remain difficult to use.
* When it was tried to launch a private currency backed by precious metals  (Liberty dollar), this initiative was shut down because it undermined  the U.S. currency system. Apparently, a currency alternative could only  thrive if “nobody” launched it and if they was no central point of  failure.
* What  was needed was a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. This was what  Satoshi Nakamoto described in 2008. It was a response to all the  problems described above. That is why he labeled the genesis block with  the text: “03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for  banks.”. Bitcoin was meant to be an alternative to our current financial  system.

So, if you find  yourself religiously checking some cryptocurrency’s price, or bogged  down in discussions about the “one true bitcoin”, or constantly asking  what currency to buy, please at least remember that we have bigger fish to fry.

personalfinance,Car Loan: Why do they offer me 27% interest with a 600 credit score,"For the last two years I’ve been in the market for a reliable car. Visited a handful of big and small dealers.

I’m to the point where I know I’ll walk into a car dealer and get the same 27% interest rate if they even choose to finance me. I have a 600 credit score with a secured card I keep paid off (I couldn’t get any other credit card).

CryptoCurrency,How to Fuel Your Crypto Purchasing Desires,"I see a lot of people complaining that they don’t have any spare money to buy the dips, the dips’ dips, or everything in between. I decided to make a list of ways the average person can make extra money to invest in crypto. Without further ado, here we go! 

Less Risky Options

1. Donate Plasma or other bodily goods - You can make ok money donating plasma and good money donating eggs (if you’re a qualified woman). 
2. Sell old clothing, electronics, junk or anything. Download Mercari, eBay, or offer up and convert stuff you don’t use to crypto! 
3. UBER, GrubHub, Lyft, Postmates - Deliver food or people for extra crypto money whenever you have spare time. 
4. Turo-Rent our your car to other people for money. Average Turo host makes over $700 a month. 
5. Ask family or friends. It’s sketchy and you do t want to be that person, but it’s worth it. 
6. Waste your time doing stupid surveys so you can buy a couple doge coins every day. 
7. Don’t eat out as often and put those savings to crypto. 
8. Chuck a bad habit (smoking, coffee, sugar, video game subscriptions) and put that money to crypto. 

Very risky options

1. Take out a loan on a home you own. As long as you’re making more than 4% or whatever the interest rate is a year, you’re in the green. 
2. Sell your vehicle and buy a crappy one. Use cash difference for crypto. 
3. Ask family or friends. It’s sketchy and you don’t want to be that person, but it could be worth it. 
4. Never use electricity or AC and put those savings to crypto. 
5. Live in a Prius and travel the country. You now have $5k a month you can put towards crypto. 
6. Ask step parents for “short” term loan.

stocks,"CDC approves first cruise ship to resume US operations, starting June 26","https://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/tourism-cruises/article251706998.html

Federal health officials have approved the first passenger cruise from the U.S. from Fort Lauderdale in June — but Florida’s governor insists he will block company plans to require passengers be vaccinated.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wednesday gave Royal Caribbean Group approval to start seven-night cruises to the Caribbean on its Celebrity Cruises brand ship, Celebrity Edge, on June 26, according to a CDC spokesperson. The ship is the first to win CDC approval for revenue cruises since the COVID-19 pandemic began.

The approval is a welcome milestone for the cruise industry, which has been paralyzed in the U.S. since March 2020 after COVID-19 outbreaks and deaths on several ships.

“For the past 15 months our conversations with friends and loved ones about seeing the world have been accompanied by the phrase ‘someday.’ I’m beyond proud and excited to say that day has arrived,” said Celebrity Cruises CEO Lisa Lutoff-Perlo in a statement. The June 26 cruise will leave from Port Everglades and visit Mexico and The Bahamas.

The CDC recommends all cruise passengers be vaccinated, but doesn’t require it. The agency has given cruise companies two options: meet vaccination thresholds of 98% of crew and 95% of passengers on the ship and start revenue cruises immediately, or forego the thresholds and first perform test cruises to ensure COVID protocols are working. Cruise ships that meet the threshold will have more relaxed mask and social distancing rules.

Celebrity Cruises spokesperson Susan Lomax said the company has opted to comply with the CDC’s vaccination threshold and will require all crew and passengers 16 years old and older to be vaccinated. The age requirement will drop to 12 years old on Aug. 1.

The go-ahead for Celebrity Cruises follows the CDC’s approval — also the first of its kind — of test cruises with volunteer passengers aboard Royal Caribbean International’s Freedom of the Seas ship from PortMiami in late June. Freedom of the Seas will require all crew and passengers 16 years old and older to be vaccinated, but will not meet the agency’s vaccination thresholds — meaning it must first perform test cruises before revenue cruises can begin.

Royal Caribbean Group is the second largest cruise company in the world with three cruise lines: Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises and Silversea.

The restart plans clash with a law recently passed by the Republican-controlled state Legislature and promoted by Gov. Ron DeSantis that bars businesses, schools and government entities across Florida from asking anyone to provide proof of a COVID-19 vaccination. Under the new law, which takes effect on July 1, businesses can be fined up to $5,000 per violation. The only exemption in the law is for licensed healthcare providers.

“We’ve been very clear, the law is clear in Florida,” said Taryn Fenske, spokesperson for the governor. “You can’t mandate vaccine passports. We are interested to see how the CDC works with them so that they don’t get these exorbitant fines.”

Celebrity plans to restart its cruises days before the new law takes effect. Lomax said the logistics of its vaccine requirement are still being worked out.

“We are working with the Governor’s office to align on the path forward,” she said via email.

DeSantis sued the CDC last month, asking a judge to force the agency to drop its cruise safety requirements and allow cruises to begin immediately. The judge instead sent the case to mediation, which begins Thursday.

Wednesday’s approval signals long-sought relief for the cruise industry, which first began working with the CDC to restart cruises last October under a conditional sail order issued by the agency. Cruise companies had to enhance COVID-19 testing capabilities on their ships, report weekly crew test results to the agency and secure agreements with ports and local health authorities in the cities they plan to visit.

PortMiami will welcome volunteer passengers on board Royal Caribbean International’s Freedom of the Seas for a two-day test cruise on June 20. PortMiami also submitted an agreement to the CDC with Carnival Cruise Line that has not yet been approved.",finance
personalfinance,Advice for Growth &amp; Investment during Grad School &amp; Beyond,"Hi r/personalfinance,

I have been lurking for a while and learning a lot. I’m at a transition point in my life where I want to be sure I make the most of my opportunities to think ahead about growing my current wealth and saving/investing in a smart way. I am also headed to graduate school in the fall and will be taking out student loans for the first time. I am hoping that folks here would be willing to offer some advice for me based on my profile below. I am on a throwaway account because I’m not keen on disclosing detailed financial info on my main. 

I recognize that folks can only offer opinions, and will continue to do my own research. Input from you all will help inform my research and how I evaluate my options. Thank you in advance! 

**Stats:** 

28M – with a long-term serious partner who shares 50% equal split of housing &amp; life expenses with me. I completed my B.A. with no debt 6 years ago. I am headed to graduate school in the fall. My partner &amp; I have been living in my parents' auxiliary apartment where we pay rent far below the high housing prices in our area. This has enabled both of us to save significantly over time. We both have no debt.

In late 2019, my partner &amp; I took carefully planned time off work to travel. No regrets!! COVID grounded us and the last year has been a wash. The job market in summer 2020 was beyond awful. Unemployment income was a literal lifesaver. 

I am currently back at my old company in a temp management position since February. Were I staying here, I’d have been made full-time by now. But since I’m headed to grad school in the fall, they will keep me as a temp until August. After taxes, I take home $1,731 every two weeks. Because I am temp, I cannot contribute to retirement out of my paycheck. 

**403b Retirement Account: $40k**

I contributed \~5-8% of my paycheck from 2016 – 2019 and got 10% employer match during this time. I have not touched it since late 2019.

**Savings &amp; Checking: $27k**

**Vanguard: $20k**

I am invested in VSTAX admiral shares. (Principle investment is $15k). When I signed up in 2019, I thought I was choosing a 90/10 stocks/bond split. Turns out I am 100% invested in stocks. With the market the way it is, this has worked out in my favor… but I feel I ought to dial this in a little more conservatively? 

**Anticipated income this summer: $24k** in additional paychecks *and* from selling my car before we move

I will start graduate school in the fall at a top 10 school. I am hopeful that this MA degree will give me access to higher paying jobs, and of course that the school brand &amp; network may benefit me &amp; my resume. What I am choosing to study is also a passion for me… after COVID I’m leaning in a little more to living for the sake of it. It is a one year intensive program.

Starting graduate school will involve moving out to a new city, paying a higher rent than I’m used to, and taking out student loans. After scholarships and work study, I will need to take about $40K in loans. I am very loan averse. My family has agreed to loan me $10K interest-free. I have $10k readily available myself that I could also contribute. I am in this case considering using the combined 20K of myself &amp; my family to pay out of pocket, and then take $20,500 in federal loans. I could pay more out of my own pocket up front. I am leaning toward taking the $20,500 loan as a way to keep more cash on hand should I need it during school. Interest on my loans will accrue during school and will be approx. \~4.3%.

**Questions:**

·  **Student loans –** is there any reason to take out more student loans and hang onto/invest the cash I have on hand while I’m in school? My gut says no, because they will accrue interest. Is my gut right? On the flip side, is there a reason to pay more up front and take out even less in federal loans?  


·  **Retirement** – should I explore rolling my 403b into another account? Since I cannot currently contribute from my paycheck, I would at least like to contribute my post-tax dollars to a retirement account. Would my best option for this be to open a Roth IRA? And if so, can these accounts be combined/rolled together? Or is there an advantage to keeping them separate?  


·  I’ve done a rough calculation of what I think my living expenses will be for the next year. Estimating liberally, I think I’ll spend $22k. I’ve also calculated that I think I can graduate with about $10 – 14k in savings (not touching investments at all). This means I basically consider \~$10k my emergency fund for the year. It will also be the cushion that gets me through if my job search stalls after graduation. **Is there anything I should do with this \~$10k** besides park it in a high-yield savings account?

Things that are on the horizon for me:

\-  Marriage (2022) 

\-  Kids (probably sometime in the next 5 years)

\-  We’d like to, hopefully, purchase property in the next 3 – 5 years… assuming the market ever comes back down.

I am open to any feedback or suggestions both for my current situation heading into grad school and for things to keep in mind in the bigger picture. I really appreciate all the folks who take time to read all this and help me out. HUGE thank you in advance. This sub has already taught me a lot and the patience and insight of commenters been a big piece of that. I’m still learning.",finance

12. We’ve had really good reporting from the community on World Mobile developments with Cardano. I just want to take a second to thank you guys. Reddit user [/u/ricklepicklemydickle](https://www.reddit.com/user/ricklepicklemydickle/) first alerted us to the World Mobile developments and then youtube user [Whiskey 1234](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyBeEq-paultoA127TYcDjQ) (love both usernames btw) let us know that he attended a conference where he encountered World Mobile and “asked them if they knew about Cardano blockchain and the reply was they were announcing partners at the end of this month.” Thank you very much for this intel guys.This is what Army of Spies is all about. Many thanks for your contributions, gentlemen.
13. Alko Sumatra Kopi is going to export 100 tonnes of coffee from Sumatra to China and track it all farm to cup using Emurgo Trace! We reported previously on the engagement of Emurgo Trace here and now it’s being put into action.

14. In Charles’s recent AMA, he mentioned that the Africa Special will be a Pan African event and they WILL talk about various deals they have in multiple countries. So, this tells us they do have multiple deals in multiple countries. That was a little unclear previously. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mP0JSgf9CU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mP0JSgf9CU)
15. IOHK’s Development Update for this week includes news that end-to-end tests of the ERC-20 Converter are commencing along with a mention of some oracle work under the Goguen update section.

16. The number of defi projects that have announced plans to be on Cardano just keeps climbing with [Yayswap.io](https://yayswap.io/) joining the list of Liqwid, Occam, and CardSwap/CardStarter.
17. Kraken publishes a “What is Cardano?” article. Says “...Cardano may not promise new ground-breaking features..” Oh yeah? What about native tokens that don’t require smart contracts? What about the EUTXO model allowing predictable and accurate local calculation of transaction fees in your wallet before you execute? What about a consensus algorithm that’s so good, another top 10 coin made their system derivative of it? That’s all standard these days? [https://twitter.com/krakenfx/status/1386038990864793607](https://twitter.com/krakenfx/status/1386038990864793607)
18. There’s a new stake pool explorer on the block. Check out the geographic map and the epoch calendar. [https://poolpeek.com/epochcalendar](https://poolpeek.com/epochcalendar)

21. In today’s video, we’re also going to go much deeper on how the COTI DAG works. But, don’t worry at all you’ll totally understand it when we’re done.
22. Binance Smart Chain has already laid out a very compelling argument that we’re going to CRUSH Ethereum. [https://twitter.com/TheADAApe/status/1386583952668958720](https://twitter.com/TheADAApe/status/1386583952668958720)
23. Charles does a big interview with Forbes and points out the huge differences between a bonded staking system (ETH) and a liquid staking system (Cardano). This is highly overlooked. [https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenehrlich/2021/04/26/cardano-and-ethereum-founder-analyzes-the-newest-evolutions-in-crypto-and--blockchain-technology/?sh=6acb258e3e52](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenehrlich/2021/04/26/cardano-and-ethereum-founder-analyzes-the-newest-evolutions-in-crypto-and--blockchain-technology/?sh=6acb258e3e52)
24. Charles also covers his projections about interoperability and the future converging on a “wifi moment” when an interoperable “internet of blockchains” emerges. In this future, it will be a race to the bottom and the systems that are too expensive to operate will simply be priced out of the game.
25. New Africa Special Trailer dropped. The narrator: “We are partnering with African governments…” That was PLURAL governments, guys! This is getting exciting. [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1386772333902319618](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1386772333902319618)
26. The Africa Bird lands a few days early!!!!!!!! It’s a deal with the Ethiopian Ministry of Education to provide a Cardano ID solution and unified records system for 5 million Ethiopian students. Charles says there will be more news tomorrow at the Africa Special.[ https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/27/business/dealbook/tesla-earnings-bitcoin.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/27/business/dealbook/tesla-earnings-bitcoin.html).[ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOTRp3PQKVk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOTRp3PQKVk).[ https://twitter.com/IOHKMedia/status/1387051830442553351](https://twitter.com/IOHKMedia/status/1387051830442553351)[ https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/27/blockchain-finally-comes-of-age-with-worlds-biggest-blockchain-deployment/](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/27/blockchain-finally-comes-of-age-with-worlds-biggest-blockchain-deployment/)[ https://www.cityam.com/ethiopia-overhauls-its-education-system-with-iohk-blockchain-partnership/](https://www.cityam.com/ethiopia-overhauls-its-education-system-with-iohk-blockchain-partnership/)
27. We’re getting reports from Army of Spies member /u/[ ricklepicklemydickle](https://www.reddit.com/user/ricklepicklemydickle) that World Mobile is reporting in its telegram group that it will be dropping some news tomorrow!
28. A new Cardano metrics platform has launched [https://cardanowaves.com/](https://cardanowaves.com/)
29. Today is the Cardano Africa Special. It’ll be at 9:30am Pacific, 10:30am Mountain, 12:30pm Eastern, 5:30pm Dublin, 7:30pm Addis Ababa, 11:30pm Bangkok. 1:30amTokyo. Go enjoy! We’ll recap it after.
30. In today’s video we also cover questions about the relationship between Atala Prism and ADA and who will actually benefit from the Cardano Projects with African governments.
31. The Africa Special made it clear that Cardano has a brilliant grand strategy for the developing world. As framed by John O’Connor this would be: 1) provide digital identity; 2) provide digital transfer of value; and 3) provide programmability of that digital value.
32. Mickey Watkins (CEO of World Mobile) added a step zero to the formula above with: 0) provide access to the digital world.
33. As has previously been mentioned, it was officially announced that Cardano is partnered with World Mobile to provide digital connectivity to people in the developing world starting in Tanzania. They plan to have 100k subscribers in Zanzibar by the end of the year.
34. This is just the beginning in Africa. John O’Connor had a nice tweet that very succinctly laid out some future plans. [https://twitter.com/jjtoconnor/status/1387919060197855234](https://twitter.com/jjtoconnor/status/1387919060197855234)
35. Coindesk editor refuses to acknowledge that Cardano has a deal with a national government, gets relentlessly trolled, then finally capitulates and decides to cover the Ethiopian Ministry of Education project. [https://twitter.com/zackseward/status/1387744629693599744 ](https://twitter.com/zackseward/status/1387744629693599744)[https://twitter.com/HukAleksandra/status/1387788814022844421](https://twitter.com/HukAleksandra/status/1387788814022844421) [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1387937546978545667](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1387937546978545667) [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1387939251275198466](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1387939251275198466) [https://twitter.com/Cshuggin/status/1387986678741151745](https://twitter.com/Cshuggin/status/1387986678741151745) [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1388113533435482115](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1388113533435482115) [https://twitter.com/CoinDesk/status/1388192121006534657](https://twitter.com/CoinDesk/status/1388192121006534657)
36. The Cardano Africa Mini addition gives us more details on the actual rollout of the Ethiopia Ministry of Education deal: 1) all 700k teachers and a subset of the students who will get tablets will be registered in the first year; 2) all secondary school students will be registered in the second year which will bring us to 5MM students; and 3) the data will be used to analyze both students and teachers.

37. If you don’t believe that Atala runs on Cardano please watch this video which lays out definitely and exactly how Atala runs on Cardano. Please feel free to wantonly debunk anyone on the interwebs who says otherwise. Thank you to IOHK technical architect Alexis Hernandez for this video! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AbgzvOeb6w&amp;t=31s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AbgzvOeb6w&amp;t=31s)
38. I don’t know if everyone watched the last few minutes of the Africa Special. But, I think a lot of people missed the section where John O’Connor said the goal of Cardano in Africa is to issue 100 MILLION digital identities in the next two years. To give you some idea of scale here, adapools.org shows a highest ever daily number of new wallets at around 71k. If we onboard 100 Million people via digital identity over two years that would be 136,986 people per day. ETH only has 150MM unique wallets to date. [https://youtu.be/yRjj662kJsk?t=8615](https://youtu.be/yRjj662kJsk?t=8615) [https://adapools.org/analysis-query/wallets](https://adapools.org/analysis-query/wallets) [https://etherscan.io/chart/address](https://etherscan.io/chart/address)
39. John also mentioned that all of the 100k subscribers to World Mobile in Zanzibar this year will have digital identities on Atala Prism. They will also be offering so-called “RealFi” loans by Q1 of next year that will be made via Cardano liquidity and will act as a bridge to real world value. [https://youtu.be/yRjj662kJsk?t=8628](https://youtu.be/yRjj662kJsk?t=8628)
40. Charlie Munger thinks crypto is “disgusting”. That’s a wonderful thing because it tells you how early you are. This is especially true in Cardano which is a project that leads with empathy for the developing world. Will he still call that disgusting if we’ve brought financial inclusiveness to an entire continent in five or ten years. Probably he won’t say anything because he won’t have lived that long. But, you get the point.

41. The state authorities in Wyoming are so far ahead of the curve it’s scary. Now they’re putting aside $4 million for staking. On the private side, Caitlin Long should be declared a state treasure for making a lot of this happen. [https://twitter.com/Cardanians\_io/status/1388756653311414272](https://twitter.com/Cardanians_io/status/1388756653311414272) [https://decrypt.co/69390/university-wyoming-generate-revenue-crypto-staking](https://decrypt.co/69390/university-wyoming-generate-revenue-crypto-staking)
42. I will be in a tent in a beautiful place where there will be very limited internet access. So, no text format Cardano Rumor Rundown until Saturday. The youtube version has been pre-recorded and is scheduled to come out on the normal daily schedule: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWnSP49DJf-G9E0VfqDdBCA](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWnSP49DJf-G9E0VfqDdBCA).
43. There is supposed to be some kind of mid-month update on Plutus. Charles hinted in a recent update that everything is going really well on that front. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=786mOp2Xq7s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=786mOp2Xq7s)
44. There will be an update on Mithril at the end of the month. You will remember from previous coverage that Mithril is a means to create trustless light wallets via recursive snarks similar to Mina. ZK-SNARK = zero knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=786mOp2Xq7s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=786mOp2Xq7s)
45. Charles is setting aside $9MM to be shared by two research labs to be set up: one at University of Edinburgh and one at an undisclosed institution. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=786mOp2Xq7s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=786mOp2Xq7s)
46. Doge Mania might be hitting a new peak (as a cultural artifact at least) tonight with Elon’s appearance on SNL. There are many different perspectives you can take on how this might impact ADA. I find the following two the most interesting: 1) if the Doge pump is followed by an inevitable crash it could sour a giant group of new adopters on crypto; or 2) it might be a gateway drug that will turn a large group of new adopters on to better projects. [https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1390774840135766019](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1390774840135766019)

48. Cryptodoggies.org NFTs are now available. The website says 50% will go to a community voted animal charity. [https://www.cryptodoggies.org/](https://www.cryptodoggies.org/)
49. For those learning Haskell, Check out this new video on Type Theory. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7blCeETJo8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7blCeETJo8)
50. Also, Lars puts out a new Plutus Pioneers video on Native tokens. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VbhY162GQA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VbhY162GQA)
51. ADA is the most crypto of all cryptos. George of CryptosRUs pointed out in a recent video that he couldn’t find any trace of a VC firm owning Cardano in its portfolio in his search of the categories section on CMC. This makes sense if you know Cardano. Would freedom and decentralization loving Satoshi not throw up a little in his mouth to find out that VC ownership of cryptos was a metric people would care about in 2021? The lack of VC stake in the very decentralized and freedom loving Cardano only adds to our already iron-clad claim on the mantle of the most crypto of all crypto projects. Our ecosystem never sought to attract VC money that would only centralize ownership in a smaller number of hands. This doesn’t even address the current extreme centralization of block validation in BTC and ETH.

52. IOHK has dropped a new article on the status of KEVM and IELE. Grigori Rosu of Runtime Verification says a proof-of-concept of IELE should be ready in six months. This is a key component in how we get to the ocean of all developers as we grow beyond the pond. [https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/05/10/runtime-verification-iele-from-interoperability-to-universality/](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/05/10/runtime-verification-iele-from-interoperability-to-universality/)
53. Cardano saw a new challenger enter the scene with Internet Computer (ICP) debuting very high on the CoinMarketCap charts. However, a look into ICP makes one question whether they are really in the Gen. 3 Blockchain race at all given that available information indicates the blockchain runs via datacenters hosting standardized hardware and that those datacenters can only join the network with the permission of the “Network Nervous System”. You could say that the winner of the Gen. 3 Blockchain race needs to solve the blockchain trilemma of decentralization, security, and scalability. If that’s true, then it’s arguable that ICP is not even competing in the decentralization leg of the race. [https://youtu.be/zHl-oVPoX88?t=97](https://youtu.be/zHl-oVPoX88?t=97)

65. John O’Connor on CNBCAfrica! He gave a really good explanation of how Africa with it’s already very high adoption of mobile payment wallets can leapfrog the legacy payment systems currently in use in more developed countries. He also reiterated that Cardano will expand to five countries this year and 20 next year! [https://youtu.be/RET8hIQQLUA](https://youtu.be/RET8hIQQLUA)

71. Initial Stakepool Offerings (“ISOs”) are here. Crypto is no stranger to novel means of capital formation and now the Cardano ecosystem is getting in on the action. Here is SundaeSwap’s explanation of how ISOs will work.

72. ICYMI, Manuel Chakravarty reminds us all that his Cardano Summit 2020 talk is publicly available for questions on native assets. Really interesting discussion of the asset identifier just being a hash of the policy script and how that helps create a super lightweight easy to use system.

76. The Cardano Foundation is out to do something incredible with supply chains as described in the fireside chat! In his previous Cardano Live appearance, Frederik Gregaard, CF CEO, also expressed a very healthy and sustainable perspective on what DeFi should become. He compared the current state of DeFi to just moving funds from your left pocket to your right pocket and taking profit. [https://youtu.be/d8uPMZplfeM](https://youtu.be/d8uPMZplfeM) [https://youtu.be/xbMSQUA1lss](https://youtu.be/xbMSQUA1lss)
77. The ISO model entering the capital formation toolbox in Cardano is going to make the stake pool game extremely interesting with SPOs scrambling to find the right balance between rewarding ADA and giving their delegators other things like tokens.

personalfinance,Somewhat sophisticated scam,"At around 6pm local time, I got a call on my cellphone.  A number with a local area code popped up, followed by a ""possible spam"" warning, then also a caller ID label for ""[XYZ] Bank"".  I do in fact bank with [XYZ] Bank.  I wasn't sure what to make of the warning which conflicted with the Caller ID, so I answered.  

The lady on the phone spoke fluent English and said ""This is Jennifer from [XYZ] Bank in [neighborhood where I grew up, about 20 mins away, not my current branch], calling for Udntmakfrenzwthsalad.""

""Uh, this is he.""

""We're calling to tell you about some new member services we offer.  We have [blah blah] and [such and such], which allow you to check your credit score for free and get live fraud alerts.  We can walk you through how to set these up on your [XYZ] Banking mobile app.  Can I help you get that going?""

""I'm not interested, thank you.""

------

It wasn't until after I hung up that I realized what was likely going on.   

It was after business hours for that branch office.  I googled the branch and confirmed that.  

I googled the phone number that came up.  It was registered to some individual who lived in my parents' city.  

-----

I suspect that there are records that indicate that I had banked at that branch sometime in the past.  Someone probably then spoofed a phone number to appear that they are calling from that general neighborhood.  I imagine that had I stayed on the line, they would have ask for mobile app login credentials, or other personal information.  

I'm a young and fairly savvy person, and it wasn't initially obvious to me that I was being probed for information.  

This is a reminder to be watchful, and remind your trusting and naive family and friends about sensitive information safety!

Update:  I just got an email from [XYZ] Bank asking to take a survey about the recent call on the date in question.  The email appears to be genuine.  So despite all these red flags, I guess the telephone call was not malicious in intent, at least not in the way I suspected.",finance

# The Balance Sheet

&gt;A  balance sheet shows how much a company is worth, also known as the  ""book"" value. It lists the value of a company's assets, liabilities and  shareholders equity.Like the Income Statement, it is often shared on a quarterly or annual basis.

&gt;  
&gt;An **asset** is defined as anything owned by a company that holds inherent, quantifiable value.

**Current assets** include anything a company expects it will convert into cash within a year, such as:

* Cash and cash equivalents
* Prepaid expenses
* Inventory
* Marketable securities
* Accounts receivable

**Noncurrent assets** include long-term investments that aren’t expected to be converted into cash in the short term, such as:

* Land
* Patents
* Trademarks
* Brands
* Goodwill
* Intellectual property
* Equipment used to produce goods or perform services

A **liability** is the opposite of an asset, it's something a company ***owes***.

**Current liabilities** refer to any liability due to the debtor within one year, which may include:

* Payroll expenses
* Rent payments
* Utility payments
* Debt financing
* Accounts payable
* Other accrued expenses

**Noncurrent liabilities** refer to any long-term obligations or debts which will not be due within one year, which might include:

* Leases
* Loans
* Bonds payable
* Provisions for pensions
* Deferred tax liabilities

Liabilities may also include an obligation to provide goods or services in the future.

# Shareholders Equity

**Shareholders' equity** refers to anything that belongs to the owners of a business after any liabilities are accounted for.

* Common stock
* Preferred stock
* Treasury stock
* Retained earnings

If  you were to add up all of the resources a business owns (the  assets)  and subtract all of the claims from third parties (the  liabilities),  the residual leftover is the owners’ equity.

# Dueling Views:

**Record of capital invested:**  There are some who believe that the main function of a balance sheet is  to record how much a business has invested in its assets-in-place,  i.e., the assets that allow for its current operations to occur.

**Measure of current value:**  There is a large and perhaps dominant school of thought among  accountants, or at least accounting rule writers, that a balance sheet  should reflect the value of the business today.

**Liquidation value:**  There is a third school, with lenders to the firm among its primary  members, who feel that a balance should reflect what you would get for  the assets of the firm, if you liquidated them today.

# Fixed and Current Assets

**The Old Way:** Two or three decades ago, the way you were taught to value fixed and current assets was to show them at **original cost, net of accounting depreciation.**

**The New Way:** As accounting has increasingly adopted the **fair value standard**, there has been a move to mark assets to current market value.

**Divergent Effects:** The difference in values that you get for assets, using the two approaches, varies. It is:

* **Greater on older assets than on newer ones**
* **Greater on fixed assets than current assets**

# Financial Assets

* Financial assets can be holdings of securities or part ownership of other companies, private or public.
* With  holdings of publicly traded securities, the movement to using current  market prices to mark up their values is almost complete.
* With equity ownership in other companies, the rules can vary depending on:
   * Whether  the stake is viewed as a majority stake (&gt;50%) or a minority stake.  The former will lead to full consolidation (where 100% of the  subsidiaries revenues and operating income will be included in the  parent company’s financials, with the portion that is not owned shown as  minority or non-controlling interest on the liability side) and with  the latter, the actual stake will be shown as an asset.
   * With  a minority stake, whether it is held for trading or as a long-term  investment. With the former, the holding will be marked to market. With  the latter, it will be shown at book value terms.

# Intangible Assets

**Big game:**  Accountants talk a big game when it comes to intangible assets, and  from that talk, you would think that they have figured out how to value  the big intangibles (brand name, management quality etc.).

**But different reality:**  In reality, accountants are much better at valuing small-bore  intangibles like licenses and customer lists, where the earnings and  cash flows from the intangible are observable and forecastable than they  are at valuing the big intangibles.

# Goodwill

* After  all the talk of intangibles in accounting, it is telling that the bulk  of intangible assets on accounting balance sheets across the world take  the form of one item: **goodwill.**
* Goodwill is a plug variable that signifies little.
   * For goodwill to manifest itself on a balance sheet, a company has to do an **acquisition**.
   * When that **acquisition occurs**, goodwill is measured as the **difference between the price paid on the acquisition and the target company’s asset value (dressed up book value).**
   * It shows up as an asset because **without it in place, balance sheets would not balance.**

# Goodwill Impairment:

**Old rules:**  For much of the last century, goodwill once created in an acquisition,  was written off on autopilot, often amortized over long periods in equal  installments.

**New Rules:** In the late 1990s, both **GAAP** and **IFRS**  rewrote the rules, requiring accountants to revisit goodwill estimates  each year, and make judgments on whether the goodwill had been impaired  or not. To make that judgment, accountants would have to revisit the  target company valuations and decide whether the value had increased (in  which case goodwill would be left unchanged) or decreased (and goodwill  would be impaired).

**Is it informational?**  The rationale for this rule change was to provide information to  markets, but since goodwill impairments are often based upon market  pricing movements (in the sector) and lag them by months and sometimes  years, the effect of goodwill impairments on stock prices has been  negligible.

# Current Liabilities

**Current liabilities can be broadly broken into three groups:**

* **Non-interest-bearing** liabilities, such as accounts payable and supplier credit, which represent part of normal operations.
* **Interest-bearing** short-term borrowings such as commercial paper, short term debt and the short term portion (&lt;1 year) of long term debt.
* **Deferred** salaries, taxes and other amounts due in the short term.

When  computing non-cash working capital, we do not include interest-bearing  short term debt in the calculation, moving it instead into the debt  column.

# Debt Due

When companies borrow money, it can take three forms:

1. **Corporate bonds**, represent debt raised from public markets
2. **Bank loans**, debt raised from banks and other lending institutions
3. **Lease debt**,  arising out of lease contracts requiring lease payments in future  years. Until 2019, only leases classified as capital leases qualified,  but since 2019, operating lease commitments are also debt.

The **mark-to-market movement** on the **asset** side of the balance sheet has been muted on the **liability**  side of the balance sheet. Bank debt, for the most part, is recorded as  originally borrowed, and corporate bonds due, are for the most part not  marked to market.

# Debt details

While  balance sheets are the repositories for total debt due, broken down  into current and long term, there is additional information on debt in  the footnotes, for most companies.

**This additional information can be on three fronts:**

1. Individual debt due, with stated interest rates and maturities.
2. Additional features on the debt, including floating/fixed and straight/convertible provisions.
3. A consolidated table of when debt repayments come due, by year.

# Shareholder’s Equity

**Old ways:**  The shareholders’ equity in a business was a reflection of its entire  history, since it started with the equity brought in to start the  business, adds on equity augmentations over time as well as the  cumulation of retained earnings.

**New ways:** The shareholders’ equity in a business reflects the jumbled mess of mark-to-market accounting, with all of its contradictions.",finance

&gt;Market-based inflation expectations also look calmer than they have done. The Fed’s favored 5-year, 5-year breakeven, which effectively measures expected inflation from 2026 to 2031, spiked to 2.4% earlier this month. Since then, it has fallen back closer to 2.2%, the kind of level that the Fed now says (truthfully) it would be happy to tolerate: \[image\]

&gt;This isn’t unalloyed good news. If markets don’t expect so much inflation, it implies that they also don’t expect so much growth. But after the stock market rushed in short order to historically extreme valuations, this kind of not-too-hot-not-too cold “Goldilocks” outlook is just what investors needed. It’s also just what the Fed wants to see.

CryptoCurrency,"Liquidity staking as a hedge against a short-term bear market, pros and cons","Wanted to share something I started doing a while back (when ETH was at 2-3k during the run-up to 4k, to give a sense of the timing). I moved a fairly substantial chunk of my holdings into liquidity staking pools (on either Uniswap or Balancer). 

Whether or not this is a good idea depends on your opinion of the likely price trajectory over the next 3-12 months. If, like me, you think this market is overstretched but have long-term faith in crypto as a technology, it's a good idea. If you think the bull run isn't winding down, it's not-so-good of an idea (though still better than cashing out). 

Why? Well, liquidity pool staking - as opposed to normal staking of a single coin - is a more complex instrument. More specifically, when you stake to a pool, it will automatically adjust your holdings so that you retain a fixed % fiat value on either side of the pool. This is easiest to understand with a stablecoin pool. For example, if you join a pool that is 50% USDT and 50% ETH, with $10000 of holdings, your holdings will remain at a fiat value of $10k, plus a portion of total trading fees from the pool. If ETH rises in value, this means you will hold *less* ETH when you stop staking liquidity. This is known as ""impermanent loss"" and is why, ironically, liquidity staking during a bull run is a bad idea for most people.

If you are a visual learner, here's a nice piece on how impermanent loss works with useful diagrams: https://blog.bancor.network/beginners-guide-to-getting-rekt-by-impermanent-loss-7c9510cb2f22

Here's the trick, though. What explanations don't tell you is that you can also make an ""impermanent gain"" during a bear market. Why? For the exact same reason - if the price of ETH goes *down*, you will actually accumulate ETH when you cash out of the pool. Consider the same scenario - $5k in USDT and $5k in ETH, but this time ETH crashes 50% in value. When you cash out after the crash, your 5k in ETH will be twice as many ETH tokens, actually increasing your holdings (and you still make the trading fees as well). 

The TLDR is that, while it costs to be part of automated market making during a bull run, you make out like a bandit during a bear run, assuming you continue to hold after cashing out. 

Some caveats: 

1. There is a fairly high up-front gas cost to participate in liquidity staking, because you need to pay gas to set up the smart contract, and then also pay gas when you stake to the pool, and again when you withdraw from the pool. Fortunately, you only need to pay the smart contract fee once per pool. That means it can cost up to a couple hundred dollars to get started with liquidity staking. So, it's only worth it if you are planning on staking a couple grand or more. Don't touch this if you have less than $1k in holdings, because you will need a disproportionately bigger price change to make up the fees.

2. That said, one potential additional benefit comes if you stake for a newer ERC-20 token that you think has long-term value. Some of these tokens have airdrops/token distribution associated with participating. I'm participating in a RLY (rally.io) staking pool, and they are distributing RLY tokens continuously to people who liquidity stake over a 36 month period (I think there are still 24-30 months left). It amounts to a fairly high % gain, depending on the value of the token. (Rally is a creator economy token, basically allows twitch streamers to get paid without worrying about people back charging donations, think of it as fungible gift cards for twitch streamers that you can convert to fiat later if you don't use then).

Anyway - TL;DR is that liquidity staking is a good way to hedge against losing value and automatically increase your crypto holdings in a bear run, while still making an ""interest rate"" in the form of trading fees from the pool.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,Yellen Calls for More Aggressive Spending,"Despite trillions in relief spending added to the deficit already, Congress is still not spending enough money according to Janet Yellen. 

Article below:

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen urged congressional leaders on Thursday to step up spending, saying that the government is operating on a budget that is more than a decade behind the times.

In remarks to a House panel that will have large sway over spending, Yellen said that inflation-adjusted spending has remained stagnant for 11 years.

Noting the aggressive programs Treasury already has implemented to carry the economy through the Covid-19 pandemic, she asked for still more expansive fiscal policy across a variety of areas.

“Our team has done valiant work implementing these programs with the resources at our disposal,” Yellen said in prepared remarks to the subcommittee on financial services and general government committee on appropriations. “But we cannot continue to be good stewards of this recovery – and tackle the new bodies of work that Congress assigns to us in the years beyond – with a budget that was designed for 2010.”

Her comments come a day before President Joe Biden releases his first budget, an expected $6 trillion spending plan to be financed by tax increases and heavy deficit spending to the tune of $1.3 trillion annually.

Among the administration’s priorities is a sweeping infrastructure plan likely to total more than $1 trillion.

Along with that, Yellen said stronger spending is needed for her department, particularly in tracking financial crimes, community development projects and in cracking down on tax cheats. Yellen asked for $13.2 billion to fund IRS discretionary spending and $417 million to guide the American Families Plan.

She noted that areas including domestic finance, economic policy and tax policy have seen their budgets cut by up to 20% since 2016.

“The speed and strength of our recovery – and our economy, long-term – depend on a fully funded Treasury,” Yellen said.

The government ran a $3.1 trillion deficit in fiscal 2020 and already has accumulated more than $1.9 trillion in red ink through the first seven months of fiscal 2021. The deficit as a portion of GDP soared to nearly 15% in 2020, the highest level since 1945.

Dating back to her days as Federal Reserve chair, Yellen has long called the nation’s fiscal path “unsustainable,” but has advocated more spending at a time when interest rates are low and the economic recovery remains incomplete.

solar,Suggestions/Help for small inexpensive solar set up for garden pump?,"TL; DR at bottom

Hi all. I am very new to solar energy. As in, i have never set anything solar up before. I have a small garden that is next to a garage that has no power. I collect rain water in three 55 gallon, and two 30 gallon barrels off of my house, and use this to water my garden via a drip irrigation system.

Right now, it is just gravity fed from a 30 gallon barrel that is 36 inches off the ground. This works ok at first, but once i drop from 30 gallons down to around 15 or so, the pressure greatly drops. I have a small water pump that i previously used to transfer water from my barrels to the one that feeds the drip line, but have since gotten a larger one for that. I would like to now set up a solar panel in order to provide power to my extra pump to feed the drip system, but dont want to spend a ton of money on this. This is the pump that i have and want to use to feed the irrigation system

https://www.harborfreight.com/110-hp-transfer-pump-320-gph-63317.html

Being that this is a 110 AC unit, would i be able to use this? Or would i have to get an inverter of some sort? They do make a 12v DC unit that can hook to a battery that i could pick up, i just want this to be as easy and frustration free as possible.

Got any tips on products i should get or setups i should consider?

TL;DR - Want to use solar to power a water pump for garden irrigation. I want it to be cheap, affective, and as simple as possible. Pump i have is 110v AC, but can get DC pump if neccessary.",energy

CryptoCurrency,Interest earning platforms | Comparing them,"Hello everyone!

I'm trying to get a good understanding of the pros and cons of the various interest earning platforms for Crypto. I've checked out BlockFi, Gemini Earn and Voyager. 

&amp;#x200B;

Voyager has the best interest rates on BTC by far, but the fact that it's just a phone app with no web interface gives me pause. I know they're publicly traded and FDIC insured up to $250k per account, but something about JUST a phone app...

&amp;#x200B;

BlockFi looks and feels great, just not a fan of the interest tiering structure. They're private, and not FDIC insured. This also gives me pause.

personalfinance,Trying to Get Out Of Debt Advice,"I was not smart when I was making great money for somebody my age (M19-22) I was in this role, spending what I made and then some just being a stupid going kid. Then, another company bought the company I work for, and completely changed the pay structure to where I was making less than half of what I was. After 2 years of living out of my means with that low paying, debt increasing job to stay afloat, I have recently started a new job that is paying me very close to what I was making before.



Now that I am back on top of bills, I want to aggressively pay down my debt. I started just 6 months ago with $22,500 in debt to my truck, $11,400 on a credit cards (3), and about $7,750 owed to 2 family members who helped when I couldn’t afford certain bills.



The last year has been tough, but I’m working hard to pay everything down, not only did I get a much better paying job, close to what I was before, I also picked up a part time job at a local fast food place to boost some income. 



Right now, I have sold my truck, enough to pay off the entire loan, and gave me enough left over to buy a very old, used car that runs well enough to use as a daily driver. I currently have $8,000 in credit card debt (1 Card only now) and I owe just under $6,000 to family members ($2k to one, $4k to other). My family has told me that I can pay them back whenever, but I’m trying to decide what my best course of action is now.



My credit card has a very low interest rate (%4) and my family isn’t adding any interest on to what I owe them. In the past 6 months, I haven’t been actually saving any money, just budgeting for bills and all that is left over goes strait to family because I don’t feel right about owing them, and I’m just paying the minimum on my card. 



What advice would you give for me to expedite the debt being paid off, while still making sure that I’m covered in case another rough patch comes? My credit is also suffering right now, so any advice on how to build credit along the way is much appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,Executive Compensation Salary Negotiation - Signing Bonus / Downpayment Assistance?,"Hi I am in the process of negotiating salary for a new job, and expect to receive an offer within days. I did the dance and waited for the prospective employer to start throwing out numbers, and they are right in my desired range (although at the lower end).

I would also like to purchase a home ASAP after being hired, and I am wondering about downpayment assistance as part of an offer. Any experience in negotiating downpayment assistance as part of an offer or as an advance of a bonus? In todays extremely difficult housing market that cash could help our offer substantially (and get us a lower interest rate).

When I suggested a signing bonus there wasn't an outright no, but they didn't say what the signing bonus may be. If they do offer a signing bonus, would countering with an ask of downpayment assistance be a valuable counter? My limited understanding is that downpayment assistance actually comes with tax benefits for the employer. I am not entirely sure if downpayment assistance is taxed on the employee side so it could have an additional effect of potentially 'doubling' the value of the signing bonus.

What do you think? Any advice/articles/write ups anything anyone can point me to?

CryptoCurrency,A middleman is not always something bad,"I've seen a lot of discussion about middlemen and the crypto's fight against them. In the overall economy, a middle man can be quite helpful, especially because it potentially allows people to buy things in a small quantity, at a fair price, with a good customer service and a quick delivery time. One could claim, that this is not the case in the world of finance and that it is completely unnecessary, but it is not necessarily true for every case. Banks are a burden when all you want is to save your money, get paid in it and use it to transfer money in your daily life. But in our modern world, banks do more than just that and crypto faces challenges when it tries to subsitute the banking system in the same way. For example, it difficulties the government to operate financially in the most part, they cannot bail out companies, finance foreign governments, respond quickly and centralized in a crisis or act against terrorism. In addition, it makes the Federal Reserve's Bonds purchases much less efficient, as they don't have anyone who pays interest on this newly cretead money. Those who feel comfortable investing with regulated exchanges and assets won't like a change. The social democrats that believe the government and the Central Bank have to be responsible for a stable currency and the economic cycles won't like a change. Those companies that need cheap money to afford staying in business won't like a change. For Libertarians, Crypto is a wet dream, but as we've countlessly times experienced, we are a minority and most refuse to take responsibility and prefer the government to do most things. A middleman in finance is for many a preferable option than an unregulated option, even though Banks have been proven many times to be immoral, inefficient, costly and against the interest of the people. I don't expect this to chage, I except people to keep adoring the middlemen for all their apparent benefits, so I don't except for Crypto to even be allowed to change the world of finance",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,"The recent weeks, one-two punch, has changed crypto forever.","1 Elon brought attention to the unavoidable fundamental problem with minable crypto. 

Economists have for several years, been pointing out that the reckoning was coming.   So its not surprising that it happened once the worlds most popular tech titan flipped - the whole world followed suit. Elon didnt cause it - he was just the loudest kid who said  ""The Emperor has no clothes."" 

That was pretty brutal. You would expect a brutal effect on minable currency and temporary negative effect on the whole market. This doesnt mean that minable currency has no use or potential - but it will NEVER be accepted broadly by public companies. 

&amp;#x200B;

2 China and the US Fed announced they were building(or trying to build) e-currency controlled by central banks. Which brought into focus 2 related issues.  

First if central banks have e-currency, that eliminates the greatest long term value of crypto. The idea that crypto will making ""banking"" more accessible and affordable to people who dont have access. If you can get that e-dollars theres no pragmatic reason for ordinary people to mess with crypto for everyday transactions.

And second.  Theres an obvious concern that with a Central Bank based crypto that governments cant be trusted really. But it has served as a wake up call that any crypto that can be ""changed"" at a code level - well that also requires trusting individuals to be good faith actors.  Which sort of defeats the the other values of cryto - freedom and privacy.  ""curated"" vs ""wild"" crypto.  As functional currency any ""curated"" type will ultimately loose out e-currencies run by central banks. 

&amp;#x200B;

Together these issues manage to taint the majority popular crypto.  Minable crypto can never broad commercial acceptance. It will retain significant value as a means of private transaction though but not with the grossly inflated market cap it had, which was based on future projections. And ""curated"" crypto will eventually be replaced State run e-currency.

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, May 27, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, May 27, 2021**

Stocks traded mixed today, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) rising while the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) fell modestly as market participants looked toward the new weekly jobless report. Market participants continue to closely monitor incoming inflation data, though it seems fears that the Federal Reserve will be forced to tighten monetary policy have tempered in recent weeks, with the SPY roughly 3 points away from its record level. 

This week, the indexes have largely consolidated, an encouraging sign following the volatility experienced in the first weeks of May. Market participants continue to look towards incoming economic data to further judge whether inflation will lead to a sustained jump in prices, causing the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, or be a transitory side-effect as the US economy roars back following the coronavirus-induced recession. Personally, I am in the latter camp and am not concerned about sustained inflation. 

Todd Jablonski, chief investment officer at Principal Global Asset Allocation said, “Inflation has gone from being on no one’s radar screen maybe five years as a lead concern, to now being at the absolute forefront as you see the economy rebound off of COVID lows. There has been a tremendous acceleration in earnings, coupled with massive monetary and fiscal stimulus.”

members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), reiterated their stance that they were not yet concerned that new inflation data would force the Fed to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he believed increases in inflation would be “mostly temporary” and that the Fed was “not quite there yet” when it came to discussing tapering its asset purchase program. In separate comments, Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said she did not want the Fed to be “overly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judging the outlook for inflation.” 

Richard Clarida, Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve, also said “there will come a time in upcoming meetings” when the Fed would consider tapering the asset purchase program but that “it is going to depend on the flow of data”. The Fed is currently buying $120 billion a month in government-issued and government-backed securities, and has pledged to continue doing that until the economy is more fully recovered.

This reaffirms the market that the Fed is not on a set timeline when it comes to rolling back current accommodative policies and will, as they have said time and again, wait for concrete data before any considerations are made. This follows a similar statement from Jerome Powell back in April 14, which proves market participants shouldn’t worry about quantitative easing tapering, in my opinion. Powell said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.”

The Department of Labor’s Weekly Unemployment Report showed jobless claims fell for the fourth straight week to yet another pandemic-era low, an encouraging sign that the labor market is improving following the extremely disappointing April Jobs report, which showed 266,000 new jobs added in the month, far below estimated of more than 1 million and a sharp deceleration in job growth compared to March. 

* **Initial jobless claims, week ended May 22:** 406,000 vs. 425,000 expected and 444,000 the week prior
* **Continuing claims, week ended May 15:** 3.642 million vs. 3.680 million expected and a revised 3.738 the week prior

$6000 in personal savings (mostly emergency fund in a savings account, don't even know if you could consider it High-Yield)
$2k In joint savings (we'll be tapping this for moving expenses I am sure - that's part of why we have it). 
$4000 in a 403(b) with American Fidelity
$0 in a Roth IRA with Vanguard - I opened the account but was not in a position to contribute to it - opted for the 403b instead which may have been a mistake?

My current employment does not contribute to retirement. New employer will after six months.  

Expenses: briefly,
Current rent is $1300, this will stay roughly the same at our new place with family (so $650 for me, she and I split joint costs equally), still below market. 2021 has been the year of budgeting for me. Definitely spend too much on food, but that's come down a bit since I started tracking in January. 

Other than rent and food, largest expenses are Automobile related (gas and insurance) and Pets. Minimal subscriptions, bought my cell phone in full 2 years ago. Recently in need of screen replacement. I'm not concerned about managing monthly expenses/budget with this post (maybe another day) so no values posted. 


My questions mostly relate to Moving, and to managing my Savings and Retirement accounts once there. 

What are some hidden expenses of moving that we should consider and budget for? What are suggested ways that we can save money during the move? How can we set ourselves up for success financially knowing that we are likely to move again in the next year? 

I am going to have to tow my car behind a U-haul if we move ourselves - which is the current plan - could it be cheaper or make more sense to hire a company for all of our stuff (I'll probably have to do more of my own research for this one)? Thoughts on this?

What can/should I do with the 403(b) retirement funds? My new employer is a non-profit, 501(c)(3) - am I able to keep this account and continue to contribute, or is there a need to 'rollover' the account? Is that even an option or do I need to pay a surrender fee / taxes to put it in a different account? Consider my age (25). Does it make more sense to try and max a Roth IRA instead of contributions to this account? How might this change after 6 months when the employee pays into retirement? I intend to keep this money allocated towards long-term/retirement savings. 

I know I may need to purchase a different vehicle in the not so distant future, and student loans payments will resume - I have been setting aside some savings for those (HYSA with a credit union) but all that's lumped in with my emergency fund. I will need to utilize some of my savings for the move, and my focus will be on replenishing the emergency fund to 3-6 months. 

Thanks in advance for your ideas and advice.",finance

personalfinance,I have a mid-700s credit score but my credit union could only approve me for a car loan with 12% interest rate. What can I do to lower that rate?,"Hi everyone.  I was never really taught the ins and outs of credit during my 20s, as those who taught me finances always said credit is bad and never spend money you don't have.  Thanks to this, I've been mainly a debit card spender, so please excuse my novice understanding on all this.

I have had a secured credit card since I was 19 with a $250 limit.  I have used this card mainly for gas and have always paid off the balance monthly and on-time.  I finally tried getting a real credit card last year, but thanks to COVID and being unemployed, I was rejected despite having money in the bank.  Now that I am recently employed, I tried again and was approved for a credit card with a $2k limit.  I also inquired about a car loan, as my current car is definitely showing its age and I have put off some recommended repairs in hopes of just putting that money to a newer car.  I was approved for a $10k loan but with a 12% interest rate.

It's come to my attention that having a good credit score (\~750) does not equal a good interest rate.  As far as I know, I may have been quoted a better interest rate if I had a bigger line of credit all these years and I feel dumb for not realizing this sooner.  I was also told by a credit union employee that since I'm technically a first-time borrower, there's nothing really that I can do to get a lower interest rate other than take the 12% and refinance in a year or so, having a more potent credit history to show for it.

My main question is, if I can stretch the life of my car and use the new $2k card and pay off the balance each month, would that be enough to get a lower car loan interest rate in 6-12 months?  Or am I stuck with taking the 12% and refinancing?  I was planning on getting a store credit card to have another line of credit for things I will purchase regularly, but I wasn't sure if that would help my situation or not.

Thank you, any kind advice is appreciated!",finance
personalfinance,Rolling over 401K to Vanguard Roth IRA. Pls help,"I’ve seen a couple other posts similar to this but I’m still a little lost. I have a 401k from an old job and was taking advantage of the employer match they had going on while I worked there. My contributions were taxed before going in and I’m trying to transfer it to a vanguard Roth IRA, but the company my 401k is with says they will only mail the check directly to me and that I have to send it on/mobile deposit it with vanguard. No big deal but as I was reading through the fine print I see that for “non-direct” rollovers, which is what I think I’m gonna have to do, they hold 20% for federal tax purposes. I may be reading that wrong, but that’s what I’m getting from the form. Also, I don’t think I’m able to transfer the full balance of the 401k to my Roth IRA since the employer match wasn’t taxed. Any advice on best/safest way to proceed as well as if the 20% being withheld sounds accurate? Thanks in advance!!",finance
personalfinance,Denied for 'Discover It Secured Card' with no credit,"I recently applied and was denied a Discover It Secured Credit Card. I am 20 years old, and I'm trying to get a credit card to help build my credit, since I currently have no credit. I am a bit confused why I was denied since it's a secured card. 

I'm a college student graduating next year, and I currently make about $18k a year from a combination of internships, family, and side work (Ebay sales, consulting, metal fabrication, etc). My main expenses are rent $480/month, and $200/month for groceries. 

From what I've read the proper action after getting denied a card is to improve your credit. Don't carry high balances, having a short credit history, existing debt, missed bills, all that good stuff. But since I cant really solve any of that since I don't even HAVE credit, what am I supposed to do?

To answer some obvious questions, I've been asking my parents to put me as on authorized user on one of their credit cards since I was 18. And even asked to open a secured card in their name and allow me to use it until I have enough credit to get my own. But they won't help, I'm on my own.

I do have a federal student load, but they don't start reporting until after I graduate and start making payments. I have also applied for the Discover It Student Chrome, and the pedal 2 previously and been denied.

How should I go about building credit if I can't get a secured card? The only real option is to raise my income but I'm still a full time student, and I'm pretty sure I make a good amount as a full time student. Is there anything else I can try to build credit? How do the credit gods expect someone in my position to build credit?? Am I just gonna be screwed? 

Any advice is welcomed, thank you in advance.",finance
vet,Cat poop problems ?,"Hi there! I have a 5-6 month old kitten I’ve had for 2 months now and I love her to death! I got her from a lady who rescued her, she is already spayed, and she had some sort of respiratory isssue in the past but it was resolved before I met her. She has also already received all her vaccines and is an indoor cat for now. 

For the past couple weeks though I noticed she’s been leaving less solid poops in her litter box but her litter is completely soaked as it’s non-clumping. I don’t see her drink water hardly at all but I had been transitioning her from tikicat after-dark pate to regular tikicat after-dark wet food and she eats two 5.5 ounce cans a day. The lady that rescued her fed her Friskies pate which I transitioned her to tikicat from too because it seemed low quality. It also seems like she is eating a lot but I’ve been free feeding her since that’s what I’ve seen recommended for kittens. This week though there were only a 2-3 small poops in her box and the clay was almost completely soaked through. She did leave a couple lovely soft poop smears on the floor and rug directly outside her box today presumably before she had the chance to clean herself? She doesn’t feel bloated, her anal glands look fine, and she hasn’t been acting any differently.

Is this possibly something serious or probably just because of the food change? Is there anything I should do about this? Any input would be appreciated. Thank you!",cryptocurrency
investing,Wouldn't the rise of electric cars be a boon to natural gas? Natural gas plays?,"I don't think renewables would be sufficient power to charge up all those electric cars if it gets mass adopted. I think there will be more of a need for enhanced electrical infrastructure. I think natural gas would do very well actually, probably underpriced right now.

It also has the optionality of taking market share of coal.

I think the fracking lead to oversupply in the natural gas market but most of those companies rely on cheap debt. If interest rates rise, then frackers wouldn't pump too much oil and gas. Leading to further increases in price. 

Right now, I have positions in EPD (pipelines), Southwestern, and Range Resources. I wonder what others think? Disagree? Positions?",finance
CryptoCurrency,How do you manage all your crypto holdings?,"So I'm fairly new to crypto, and am looking for the best combination of practices in order to obtain the following 3 goals;

* Security
* Efficiency (minimal transactions)
* Return (via staking rewards/savings accounts)

There's so much information in the cryptospace, so I'll just put out what I'm planning on doing (as much of it isn't set up yet), and will be hoping to learn ways to improve my above 3 goals.

**Hardware wallet (either Ledger or Trezor)** - used for bulk storage of majority of holdings

**Exodus desktop wallet** - used for 'batching' smaller transactions, before sending the larger transactions to a hardware wallet [as suggested here](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005165209-Receive-mining-proceeds)

**BlockFi** - used for 'investing' smaller amounts of BTC/ETH for the 5%/4.5% APY respectively.

**Crypto.com** - used for staking CRO, in order to get a higher interest rate on staking USDC (my stablecoin of choice)

Now where I get confused is when I'm learning about things like Uniswap for long-term decentralized liquidity, where you still hold the keys. I've also heard about paperwallets but don't quite understand them yet.

I'm also looking into a hardware authenticator like yubikey in order to move away from my current software authenticator (google auth) for improved security.

Any advice or suggestions on how to efficiently manage things would be greatly appreciated.",cryptocurrency
cardano,Cardano Rumor Rundown MAY 28 2021,"Hey Everyone!

Let's go...

Newly covered today: 

1. The May Cardano 360 was yesterday and we had lots of updates including the Color Coding for the different stages of the testnet! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS33gRj9JYE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS33gRj9JYE)
2. Alonzo “Blue” Era Testnet (through mid June; &lt;50 user cohort) will include the basic functionality of the system for testing basic contracts . Initially the SPOs will be included, then some of the Plutus Pioneers will be allowed in, then a few of the outside development firms (Plutus Partners).  The Plutus Partners will be working on specific areas including oracles, DEXs, stablecoins, NFTs, and DeFi.  This will produce code and documentation that will be publicly available.  
3. Alonzo “White” Era Testnet (mid June to mid July; &lt;500 user cohort) will add more Plutus Pioneers and more functionality. They will develop various dApps and there will be interaction on the user side of these dApps.  They will do some benchmarking at this stage.
4. The Alonzo Hard Fork Combinator Event requires a lot of different pieces come together at the same time.  But, this is not their first rodeo and they have a lot of experience with this from the ITN, Shelley, and etc.
5. Alonzo “Purple” Era Tesnet (mid July to mid August; fully public) will involve a full public network with all of the Plutus pioneers, the Rosetta Api to the exchanges, Daedalus, hardware wallets, graphQL, and full functionality.  The purpose of this phase will be optimization.
6. Alonzo “Red” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will involve a new network where they can test scalability and stability. 
7. Alonzo “Black” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will be the final public testnet where they will ensure they have their candidate mainnet releases ready to launch on the mainnet.
8. They are committed to making sure there is a very large group of people who are familiar with using the Alonzo testnet by the time the mainnet launches.
9. Alonzo Mainnet (August-September). It’s looking like Alonzo mainnet launch was positioned in very late August  through September in the infographics. That makes me assume there is a chance of August, much better chance of September, and also some chance of October or later. This is blockchain development after all.  Also, we’ve waited years.  Why care about a few weeks?
10. There will be another Plutus Pioneers Cohort later this summer.
11. Marlowe Run will be a browser product that can run on mobile or desktop. It can be linked to your wallet and be used to run Cardano smart contracts simultaneously on a distributed basis across multiple user browsers. The user interface is light years ahead of anything we saw in Marlowe Meadow or the Marlowe Playground simulations. It will include a library of off-the-shelf contracts.
12. There will be a Marlowe Webinar on June 3.  Register here: [https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/](https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/)
13. The ERC-20 converter was looking very intuitive and seamless in the new demo. It should be on the testnet in June.
14. Manuel Chakravarty gave a big update on Hydra (layer 2 scaling). Hydra will not require that the base layer be modified since it will be implemented via Plutus smart contracts. Hydra is actually a collection of protocols including Hydra Head and Hydra Tail. Hydra Head is a symmetric protocol where multiple participants will be online simultaneously for the whole period of the head exchanging messages. Hydra Tail is an asymmetric protocol involving a high performance server and many clients that may be mobile and could be offline for large portions of the tail’s existence. There will also be “inter head &amp; tail networking” which will allow for a network of heads and tails. They have a published research paper on Hydra Head. They are currently writing the Hydra Tail paper. 
15. Hydra is distinguished from other layer 2 protocols by its isomorphic properties.  This means you will be able to run any smart contract that works on the base layer in a Hydra Head! This is very special.  We won’t need special purpose contracts built out just for layer 2.  There are some big implications to this. Since a Hydra Head is essentially just a Plutus smart contract, this means you can run a Hydra Head inside another Hydra Head.  It’s turtles all the way down, guys.  It sounds like they can do this iteratively as much as they want.  
16. Aggelos also gave a good presentation on the importance of “skin in the game” in resource based consensus protocols (both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake) and its effect on promotion or discouragement of centralization. He explained how Ouroboros has built-in safeguards to prevent centralization including the K parameter (currently at 500) which caps total rewards per pool and the alpha parameter (currently at 0.3) which splits rewards into a 77% piece and a 23% piece.  A pool can take its share of the 77% piece based on the pool’s total stake and its share of the 23% piece based on the pledge of the SPO.  A higher alpha parameter makes it less attractive for individual SPOs to proliferate multiple pools since they can’t be as leveraged on their available pledge and still get as big a share of the 23% piece. This also discourages Sybil Attacks.  As Cardano on-chain governance progresses, these parameters will be controlled by the community.  
17. There will be a Cardano Goguen Summit in September. It will be hybrid digital/in-person.

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. Kraken publishes a “What is Cardano?” article. Says “...Cardano may not promise new ground-breaking features..” Oh yeah? What about native tokens that don’t require smart contracts? What about the EUTXO model allowing predictable and accurate local calculation of transaction fees in your wallet before you execute? What about a consensus algorithm that’s so good, another top 10 coin made their system derivative of it? That’s all standard these days? [https://twitter.com/krakenfx/status/1386038990864793607](https://twitter.com/krakenfx/status/1386038990864793607)

5. In today’s video, we’re also going to go much deeper on how the COTI DAG works. But, don’t worry at all you’ll totally understand it when we’re done.
6. Binance Smart Chain has already laid out a very compelling argument that we’re going to CRUSH Ethereum. [https://twitter.com/TheADAApe/status/1386583952668958720](https://twitter.com/TheADAApe/status/1386583952668958720)
7. Charles does a big interview with Forbes and points out the huge differences between a bonded staking system (ETH) and a liquid staking system (Cardano). This is highly overlooked. [https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenehrlich/2021/04/26/cardano-and-ethereum-founder-analyzes-the-newest-evolutions-in-crypto-and--blockchain-technology/?sh=6acb258e3e52](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenehrlich/2021/04/26/cardano-and-ethereum-founder-analyzes-the-newest-evolutions-in-crypto-and--blockchain-technology/?sh=6acb258e3e52)
8. Charles also covers his projections about interoperability and the future converging on a “wifi moment” when an interoperable “internet of blockchains” emerges. In this future, it will be a race to the bottom and the systems that are too expensive to operate will simply be priced out of the game.
9. New Africa Special Trailer dropped. The narrator: “We are partnering with African governments…” That was PLURAL governments, guys! This is getting exciting. [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1386772333902319618](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1386772333902319618)
10. The Africa Bird lands a few days early!!!!!!!! It’s a deal with the Ethiopian Ministry of Education to provide a Cardano ID solution and unified records system for 5 million Ethiopian students. Charles says there will be more news tomorrow at the Africa Special.[ https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/27/business/dealbook/tesla-earnings-bitcoin.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/27/business/dealbook/tesla-earnings-bitcoin.html).[ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOTRp3PQKVk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOTRp3PQKVk).[ https://twitter.com/IOHKMedia/status/1387051830442553351](https://twitter.com/IOHKMedia/status/1387051830442553351)[ https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/27/blockchain-finally-comes-of-age-with-worlds-biggest-blockchain-deployment/](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/27/blockchain-finally-comes-of-age-with-worlds-biggest-blockchain-deployment/)[ https://www.cityam.com/ethiopia-overhauls-its-education-system-with-iohk-blockchain-partnership/](https://www.cityam.com/ethiopia-overhauls-its-education-system-with-iohk-blockchain-partnership/)
11. We’re getting reports from Army of Spies member /u/[ ricklepicklemydickle](https://www.reddit.com/user/ricklepicklemydickle) that World Mobile is reporting in its telegram group that it will be dropping some news tomorrow!
12. A new Cardano metrics platform has launched [https://cardanowaves.com/](https://cardanowaves.com/)
13. Today is the Cardano Africa Special. It’ll be at 9:30am Pacific, 10:30am Mountain, 12:30pm Eastern, 5:30pm Dublin, 7:30pm Addis Ababa, 11:30pm Bangkok. 1:30amTokyo. Go enjoy! We’ll recap it after.
14. In today’s video we also cover questions about the relationship between Atala Prism and ADA and who will actually benefit from the Cardano Projects with African governments.
15. The Africa Special made it clear that Cardano has a brilliant grand strategy for the developing world. As framed by John O’Connor this would be: 1) provide digital identity; 2) provide digital transfer of value; and 3) provide programmability of that digital value.
16. Mickey Watkins (CEO of World Mobile) added a step zero to the formula above with: 0) provide access to the digital world.
17. As has previously been mentioned, it was officially announced that Cardano is partnered with World Mobile to provide digital connectivity to people in the developing world starting in Tanzania. They plan to have 100k subscribers in Zanzibar by the end of the year.
18. This is just the beginning in Africa. John O’Connor had a nice tweet that very succinctly laid out some future plans. [https://twitter.com/jjtoconnor/status/1387919060197855234](https://twitter.com/jjtoconnor/status/1387919060197855234)
19. Coindesk editor refuses to acknowledge that Cardano has a deal with a national government, gets relentlessly trolled, then finally capitulates and decides to cover the Ethiopian Ministry of Education project. [https://twitter.com/zackseward/status/1387744629693599744 ](https://twitter.com/zackseward/status/1387744629693599744)[https://twitter.com/HukAleksandra/status/1387788814022844421](https://twitter.com/HukAleksandra/status/1387788814022844421) [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1387937546978545667](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1387937546978545667) [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1387939251275198466](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1387939251275198466) [https://twitter.com/Cshuggin/status/1387986678741151745](https://twitter.com/Cshuggin/status/1387986678741151745) [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1388113533435482115](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1388113533435482115) [https://twitter.com/CoinDesk/status/1388192121006534657](https://twitter.com/CoinDesk/status/1388192121006534657)
20. The Cardano Africa Mini addition gives us more details on the actual rollout of the Ethiopia Ministry of Education deal: 1) all 700k teachers and a subset of the students who will get tablets will be registered in the first year; 2) all secondary school students will be registered in the second year which will bring us to 5MM students; and 3) the data will be used to analyze both students and teachers.

21. If you don’t believe that Atala runs on Cardano please watch this video which lays out definitely and exactly how Atala runs on Cardano. Please feel free to wantonly debunk anyone on the interwebs who says otherwise. Thank you to IOHK technical architect Alexis Hernandez for this video!

22. I don’t know if everyone watched the last few minutes of the Africa Special. But, I think a lot of people missed the section where John O’Connor said the goal of Cardano in Africa is to issue 100 MILLION digital identities in the next two years. To give you some idea of scale here, adapools.org shows a highest ever daily number of new wallets at around 71k. If we onboard 100 Million people via digital identity over two years that would be 136,986 people per day. ETH only has 150MM unique wallets to date. [https://youtu.be/yRjj662kJsk?t=8615](https://youtu.be/yRjj662kJsk?t=8615) [https://adapools.org/analysis-query/wallets](https://adapools.org/analysis-query/wallets) [https://etherscan.io/chart/address](https://etherscan.io/chart/address)
23. John also mentioned that all of the 100k subscribers to World Mobile in Zanzibar this year will have digital identities on Atala Prism. They will also be offering so-called “RealFi” loans by Q1 of next year that will be made via Cardano liquidity and will act as a bridge to real world value.

24. Charlie Munger thinks crypto is “disgusting”. That’s a wonderful thing because it tells you how early you are. This is especially true in Cardano which is a project that leads with empathy for the developing world. Will he still call that disgusting if we’ve brought financial inclusiveness to an entire continent in five or ten years. Probably he won’t say anything because he won’t have lived that long. But, you get the point.

25. The state authorities in Wyoming are so far ahead of the curve it’s scary. Now they’re putting aside $4 million for staking. On the private side, Caitlin Long should be declared a state treasure for making a lot of this happen. [https://twitter.com/Cardanians\_io/status/1388756653311414272](https://twitter.com/Cardanians_io/status/1388756653311414272) [https://decrypt.co/69390/university-wyoming-generate-revenue-crypto-staking](https://decrypt.co/69390/university-wyoming-generate-revenue-crypto-staking)
26. I will be in a tent in a beautiful place where there will be very limited internet access. So, no text format Cardano Rumor Rundown until Saturday. The youtube version has been pre-recorded and is scheduled to come out on the normal daily schedule: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWnSP49DJf-G9E0VfqDdBCA](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWnSP49DJf-G9E0VfqDdBCA).
27. There is supposed to be some kind of mid-month update on Plutus. Charles hinted in a recent update that everything is going really well on that front. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=786mOp2Xq7s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=786mOp2Xq7s)
28. There will be an update on Mithril at the end of the month. You will remember from previous coverage that Mithril is a means to create trustless light wallets via recursive snarks similar to Mina. ZK-SNARK = zero knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=786mOp2Xq7s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=786mOp2Xq7s)
29. Charles is setting aside $9MM to be shared by two research labs to be set up: one at University of Edinburgh and one at an undisclosed institution. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=786mOp2Xq7s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=786mOp2Xq7s)
30. Doge Mania might be hitting a new peak (as a cultural artifact at least) tonight with Elon’s appearance on SNL. There are many different perspectives you can take on how this might impact ADA. I find the following two the most interesting: 1) if the Doge pump is followed by an inevitable crash it could sour a giant group of new adopters on crypto; or 2) it might be a gateway drug that will turn a large group of new adopters on to better projects.

35. ADA is the most crypto of all cryptos. George of CryptosRUs pointed out in a recent video that he couldn’t find any trace of a VC firm owning Cardano in its portfolio in his search of the categories section on CMC. This makes sense if you know Cardano. Would freedom and decentralization loving Satoshi not throw up a little in his mouth to find out that VC ownership of cryptos was a metric people would care about in 2021? The lack of VC stake in the very decentralized and freedom loving Cardano only adds to our already iron-clad claim on the mantle of the most crypto of all crypto projects. Our ecosystem never sought to attract VC money that would only centralize ownership in a smaller number of hands. This doesn’t even address the current extreme centralization of block validation in BTC and ETH.

37. Cardano saw a new challenger enter the scene with Internet Computer (ICP) debuting very high on the CoinMarketCap charts. However, a look into ICP makes one question whether they are really in the Gen. 3 Blockchain race at all given that available information indicates the blockchain runs via datacenters hosting standardized hardware and that those datacenters can only join the network with the permission of the “Network Nervous System”. You could say that the winner of the Gen. 3 Blockchain race needs to solve the blockchain trilemma of decentralization, security, and scalability. If that’s true, then it’s arguable that ICP is not even competing in the decentralization leg of the race. [https://youtu.be/zHl-oVPoX88?t=97](https://youtu.be/zHl-oVPoX88?t=97)

60. The Cardano Foundation is out to do something incredible with supply chains as described in the fireside chat! In his previous Cardano Live appearance, Frederik Gregaard, CF CEO, also expressed a very healthy and sustainable perspective on what DeFi should become.

61. The ISO model entering the capital formation toolbox in Cardano is going to make the stake pool game extremely interesting with SPOs scrambling to find the right balance between rewarding ADA and giving their delegators other things like tokens. Some stake pools could even become like portfolio funds with relationships with many different projects the tokens of which are given to delegators. Babel Fees could also play a role here for smart SPOs as they may allow access to a wide variety of tokens in the ecosystem that could be used to reward delegators with a sort of index fund exposure to a wide variety of Cardano projects.

64. The Cardano Foundation has released the full video of the Fireside Chat with Eva and Fred. Lots of questions answered on a variety of fronts. Very interesting remarks including that in discussions with financial institutions, Fred has found they are interested in exposure to the alpha provided by the asset class in general, tokenization of assets, and the yield provided by staking rewards.

personalfinance,"Uncle offers to help pay for college, should I accept it and plan accordingly?","I'm a rising high school senior, who's going to college next year in the US (I'm an international student). I go to an elite private school, have top grades, have pretty great extracurricular activities and also have a great SAT score (1540), and am looking to get into T-20 CS colleges in the US. One hurdle that I've been worrying about though, is high tuition. Most top colleges (Berkeley, Cornell, UIUC, etc) cost around $60K per year, while a few others cost about $40-45K (Georgia Tech, Purdue, Rutgers). My parents can only afford to pay around $25K per year (joint income of around $100k or so),  which really made me fear for the loans that I would have to take, along with the interest that follows.

However, a few days ago, my mother's uncle spoke to my mother and told her that he would be able to help pay for college: he is willing to pay up to $100k (which can be paid back anytime, without any worry). I am aware of the costs that could be saved from taking the money, instead of getting private loans (as interest rates start at 10% in my country). But do you guys think the financial benefits would be worth it, considering the fact that it might take me up to 5 years after college to pay back the money (assuming I get a standard CS job), and that I am essentially borrowing the money from a close family member?",finance

I pay a little over $500 a month and each payment hardly shaves a few dollars off the principle. I must have already paid about 2k and still owe nearly the same amount I borrowed.

I don’t really care much for the car I took the loan on, its a secondary car that spends more time parked than on the road. They can take it for all I care. The car is perfectly fine and drives  fine. Can I simply let them take the car and be done with it? I understand title loans don’t go on the credit report generally. What I want to know is if the lender can come after me for any remaining balance after taking and selling the car. I live in Phoenix Arizona.",finance

CryptoCurrency,So how exactly does staking work on Binance..?,"I've just made my first significant investment and I understand that staking is essentially a way to HODL and earn interest on your coin.

There's a few terms I don't understand though if anyone could help me with them..

1. What is annualised interest rate? I thought this would be how much of my coin I earn back, but it gets lower for longer term. Then I thought it might be binance's cut, but the amount increases again after 30 days which doesn't make sense.

2. Estimated interests.. is this my projected earnings over the course of the stake? This again though is higher for shorter stakes, which would seem strange if it is projected earnings.

3. Redemption date.. is this done automatically, or do I have to manually withdraw my interest? Can I then immediately re stake?

Thank you to anyone who can help clarify this for me.

P.s. I know staking on exchanges is frowned upon because it doesn't support decentralisation, but I'm new and just want to keep it simple for myself.",cryptocurrency

stocks,Lessons from an emotional investor/trader,"This is a reminder to all emotional investors/traders out there: Don't panic sell!

I made a bunch of stupid moves the week of May 10 when the market was taking its second downturn. If I just walked way from my computer for 2 weeks, most of the moves I made would have recovered. But unstead now I'm sitting on missed gains because I got too emotional.

Investing/trading is not about emotion. It's about having a plan and sticking to it.

I'm terrible at it because I still panic when macro factors test the strength of my plan.

Here are some of the lessons I'd like new traders/investors to really take to heart:

- When you buy a stock, have a VERY clear idea on why you bought, how long you're holding, and what your exit strategy is. I cannot stress this enough. There are many times where I bought a stock to flip, and I ended up holding it long term as a bag holder because I got greedy. And there are many times I bought stock I believed in, but ended up selling it on a correction because I panicked. Be incredibly regimented about this.

- Understand that corrections occur, and make a plan on how you'll deal with it. If you started buying high growth/beta stocks in January or February, you're account is probably down 20% from its peak. Thats okay, take a DEEP breath and think through your strategy. Did you leave any money to DCA your positions down? Ex. You bought ENPH at $220, its $140 right now. Do you still believe in ENPH? Why did you buy it at $220 and what has fundamentally changed about the company now that its at $140?

- Understand the power of averaging down.You can't time tops or bottoms. But you can make a strategy to mitigate risks. If any stocks you own have a beta higher than 2, seriously consider making an average down strategy. Averaging down is a very powerful tool, but you need to plan ahead for it. Stocks are great if they're only going up, but any high growth stock will come back down on small catalysts that throws into jeopardy their future growth. Those things can be macro factors as well such as interest rates and inflation fears. Here's a simple example using NIO. NIO was trading at $64 on January 20 after NIO day. There were definitely people who bought NIO at that price. Lets assume you bought 100 shares of NIO for $6400. NIO since then has been on a brutal slide. Its found its bottom at $31 twice now, but its still unclear what the real bottom is. At the same time, more analysts have reiterated that NIO is a buy with a price target of about $60. So your cost average is $64 with a 100 shares. NIO is sitting at $38 today. You know there's a 20% downside to $31, and maybe it goes lower. But you also know that it has a potential upside to $64. The reality is, if you believe in NIO, and were proactive enough to have $6400 stored in case of an event like this, if you bought 168 shares of NIO for $38, and averaged down your position you're cost average for NIO become a much more reasonable $47 rather than $64. That means NIO only has to gain 20% from its current price rather than 80%. I've seen this written in this subreddit before, but averaging down on a position is one the greatest opportunities. It lets you recommit to the original thesis you had for a stock, and it also creates a more advantageous position in the long term.

That said, be careful of ""buy the dip"". Understand why the dip is occurring. Compare the dip to macro factors like SPY and QQQ. Understand interest rates, inflation, international trade deals and other factors that could affect macro price movement. Use TA to understand support levels, and always be aware that things could drop more. April and May really tested the theory of ""it can't go any lower"". I was reading on this forum that April 27 was the end. That everything was going to recover since high flying stocks were on their bullish trajectory. Then we hit an inflation panic and the market corrected all high growth stocks by about 20%. OUCH.



Here's my big mistake. When I had no extra money to average down, and the stocks kept falling in May, I panicked. I managed to make it through February and March and most of April without panicking and selling. But May did me in. I ended up selling stocks to preserve capital, and most of those stocks are rebounding now and its making me realize that I wasn't as mentally strong as I thought.

Don't make these mistakes I did. Please make a strategy for yourself and stick with it! And don't keep changing strategies on a whim. That's another thing that will lead to compounding losses rather than tweaking and honing your strategy for what works for you!",finance
personalfinance,Looking for advice for mother (60 LCOL),"My mom is in pretty rough shape. She has always been highly irresponsible with money. Me and my 3 siblings grew up without much. Our parents made decent enough money, nothing to write home about, but they continuously overspent on ""keeping up with the Joneses"" and getting new cars, too big of a house, designer purses, big TVs, etc. Ironically it sounds like we had ""a lot"" but we frequently had to skip meals just to make what we had last. But hey, we had a big ass TV.

She has been clinically diagnosed with bipolar disorder and depression. She also gets severe, chronic migraines. If that's not enough, she also has diabetes and MS. Her spending habits and mental/health condition led her to work her way through three marriages over the years before now finding herself alone in a single bedroom apartment in southwest Florida. She does clerical work and makes \~$22/hr with raises that basically meet inflation. Her job is in a very stable sector and she's a good performer so I forsee her being able to hang onto it as long as necessary. However, MS typically only gets worse over time and eventually could render her unable to keep her job before she's actually ready to retire. For now she is fine.

She recently came into a windfall of $10k due to an insurance settlement (compensatory damages thus not taxable afaik) and I just want to make sure I'm using it to her best advantage, and also seek some more general advice from the hivemind of frugality and intelligent spending that is r/personalfinance. Some monthly budget info:

**Income:** $2,633.50 ($1,215.50 bi-weekly)

**Expenses:** $2,452

* Rent - $1,013
* Car payment - $400
* Groceries - $200
* Auto/renter's insurance - $150
* Utilities - $150
* Personal care - $110
* Medical - $84
* Storage - $60
* Gas - $50
* Internet - $50
* Vape supplies - $50
* Auto maintenance - $50
* Essential oils - $25
* Fun Money - $25
* Forgot/misc - $35

**Savings:** $181.50

Opportunities for savings that I immediately see are the car payment, personal care, vape garbage, and essential oils. Personal care includes a $52 manicure every 3 weeks - see says she *needs* it because of her depression and it makes her feel good. I have also been diagnosed with depression and feel like that (plus just trying to be an understanding son) biases me towards wanting to believe her and pass on the expense. But I'm still working with her to stop. Vape supplies are ridiculous, they need to go. Essential oils I could go either way on, she's one of those people who swears by them and says that they help immensely with her migraines. If true, it's a marginal expense with a significant upside imo.

The big one that I see is the car payment. Her last husband, a real gem of a man, also loves to live way outside of his means. So he surprised her one day by buying her a brand new Mazda6 with a bunch of unnecessary features (heated seats in Florida? Idiot.). I can't remember the exact interest rate, I think around 12%, but it means that of her $400 payment, almost $140 goes to interest. 

I have power of attorney over all of her bank accounts through USAA and immediately put the $10k into a savings account that she can't withdraw from without my authorization. We're setting aside \~$300 to buy a laptop so that she can do basic social media, internet browsing, etc. The MS affects her vision and it's hard to see things on her phone. With the rest, I want to see what we can do about the car. I don't have the details in front of me but I believe when I checked she owed around $16.5k while the car was only worth $11k. This was earlier on in the year before used car prices really started going up so I figure if we need to sell it, now is the time. Trouble is still being able to get into something else. So I figure my options are to see if we can roll the negative equity into a new car and use the $10k to pay down, or just pay down on the current car and refinance with myself as a co-signer. 

I know me offering to be a co-signer is a red flag for a lot of y'all. It is a bit for me, too. But like I said, I have power of attorney over all of her bank accounts and have her linked up to a budgeting app so that I can watch every single transaction. Risk of default is very low. Her credit is mid 500s while mine is \~770 so I think it's the best way to keep the payment as low as possible.

After this, it's just trimming the rest of the fat identified in the budget and stashing away what we can so that maybe she can retire when she's 90.

Sorry for the long post and rambling a bit. It has been an exhausting few months trying to get this all together for her. Appreciate any advice y'all are able to give.",finance

personalfinance,Smartest way to pay of portion of student loan?,"About to refinance to a 15 yr mortgage and we picked up a cash out option to nuke some of my student loans. I should be able to take out 66% of them or more with this so that is nice. The interest is extremely high(~6.97%)on some, so nuking them first is a no brainer. They are all federally held loans as well.

My question is when repayment starts back up in October would it be smarter to nuke all the ones I can with extreme prejudice or should I just hit one at a time monthly? Idk if one would look better over the other. Obviously with high interest it makes more sense to me pay them all off ASAP, but curious if that it the best option.

Bitcoin,What's REALLY behind this dip... (not china or elon),"Like many of you, I eat crayons,  so my analysis may not be worth much.

 Bicoin has traditionally moved opposite the economy. Right now many States in the US are opening up and economic sentiment is very positive.  Compared to last year things are looking way better. 

As these other areas are starting to Spring back traditional investments are reading the signals and moving around out of crypto and into growth areas. 

I don't think it's a big nefarious plot. Elon may have reminded people to look at their investments again but the big money is reading lots of charts and making decisions accordingly.

Now here is why I don't feel it will last. 

Many businesses were kept afloat with ppp loans.  At some point possibly this year we will see waves of businesses who took money out to stay afloat run out of that money and realise they're sinking. I think we'll see a few waves of that starting this year. 

We've also just starting to see the effects of the pandemic on some businesses who are now running out of materials because of the businesses that fell last year. Wood, pool parts, hvac parts,  Lots of things are getting more scarce and affecting other industries.

Those random shortages in unexpected places will creep up and affect the economy in a big way. 

The current euphoria of positivity in the economy that is driving people out of bitcoin and into the regular market is not going to last. 

I think most analysts agree that if interest rates go up things will just collapse in on themselves so they will be forced to keep them down...  The responses to that are likely to be stimulus upon stimulus upon rescue loans upon more and more government debt which will inevitably drive up…. as it always does…Crypto.

CryptoCurrency,A comprehensive guide to building up your nest egg and earn passive income from your crypto. (Weekly Update),"I have seen amazing responses on the last post which so now we getting weekly updates! Weekly updates will serve the purpose to update tables as new information comes in, onboard new users to the 8^(th) wonder of the world: **compound interest,** and also answer your important questions!

**The 3 methods mentioned below are by far the most popular ways to earn a yield on your cryptocurrency:**

**Question:  What is Cryptocurrency Staking?**

* Staking generally refers to the holding of your cryptocurrency funds in a wallet or an exchange and hence supporting the functionality of a blockchain system. The cryptos are being locked in their wallets by the stakeholders. They are then rewarded by the network in return. Staking provides a way of making an income.

**Question: What is Cryptocurrency Lending?**

* Crypto Lending is a transaction in which you can lend your crypto and earn interest rates that accrue over a period of time. The transaction is supported by Crypto Lending Platforms selling loans to various cryptocurrencies such as Ether, Bitcoin, and Stable Coins.

**Question: What is Liquidity Providing?**

* Liquidity Providing is a way of earning money on your coins in a decentralized manner which is managed by the smart contract. The pool is used for liquidity to power the swapping ability of a DEX. Investors are encouraged to deposit into liquidity pools because they earn revenue from the swaps that happen on the DEX platform.

**Question: How do I choose what is best for me?**

* Go through the pros and cons of each and you will get to know which is the best for you!

Pros:

|**Cryptocurrency Staking**|**Cryptocurrency Lending**|**Liquidity Providing**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Non-Custodial which means you are in control of all your coins at all times.|Easy to use and very low learning curve. It is just a deposit and you earning interest.|Non-Custodial which means you are in control of all your coins at all times.|
|Many options you can stake in the safety of your own wallet or stake on an exchange to get instant liquidity for selling|The reward we are compensated for FAR outweighs the non-custodial aspect of the services.|Potential to earn the governance coin just by participating which boosts yield.|
|High APY for certain coins|Low barrier to entry which means you can start with a small number of coins too|Highest APY out of all other options|

Cons:

|**Cryptocurrency Staking**|**Cryptocurrency Lending**|**Liquidity Providing**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|High barrier to entry for some coins. where you got to deposit a lot of coins if you want to stake non-custodial.|It is a custodial Service. So you are not in control of your coins at all times|Extremely High fees right now to deposit and withdraw liquidity from a pool.|
|Vulnerable to Exploits and Hacks in the smart contract|Vulnerable to bad decision making in the company or inside jobs|Vulnerable to Exploits and Hacks in the smart contract|
|The high learning curve for some coins like ETH2 where you have to set up validators|Withdrawals are usually not instant|You have to worry about slippage high gas fees and impermanent loss. So I would only suggest LPing if you are more experienced.|

**Note: Don't get scared by the cons as the hacks and inside jobs are virtually non-existent for good exchanges, services, and smart contracts. If you DYOR effectively this should not be a problem for you.**

**Question:** **How to earn a yield on Bitcoin?**

* You cant stake bitcoin so you have to rely on lending services for now
* Decentralized lending services exist but the APY is too low to consider (0.26%)
* Here are a few reputable services that provide a yield on Bitcoin

|Service|Blockfi|Crypto.com|Celsius Network/Voyager|Ledn.io|Nexo.io|Swissborg|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Annual interest rate|5%|1.5%|6%|6.1%|4%|3%|
|Lockup|No lockup|No lockup normally but Lock up is also available for boosted rewards|No lockup|No lockup|No lockup normally but Lock up is also available for boosted rewards|No lockup|
|Service has its own token for boosted rates?|No|Yes|Yes|No|Yes|Yes|

**Note:**

1. **Celsius and Voyager are together because Celsius has partner with Voyager to provide yield for Voyager customers.**
2. **Celsius yield is only 6% for US customers. Internationally it's 3.51%**

&amp;#x200B;

**Question:**  **How to earn a yield on Ethereum?**

* The best way right now is to partake in ETH2 staking APY is currently between 6-8%. If you have less than 32 ETH you should stake it on a reputable exchange like **Kraken** or **Binance**.
* **Important**: ETH 2 rewards will be locked till ETH2 hard launches. But you can still trade back your locked eth to normal eth by the respective pairs on the exchange
* Another way is to do it is via rocket pool when it launches.
* If you don't like the idea of locking up your coins here are some services and the yield they provide on Ethereum.

|Service|Blockfi|Crypto.com|Celsius Network/Voyager|Nexo.io|Swissborg|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Annual interest rate|4.55%|2.5%|5.05%|4%|3.5%|

&amp;#x200B;

**Question:**  **How to earn a yield on Stablecoin?**

* You could use the services mentioned below or you can dip your toes in DEFI lending like Anchor protocol (over 20% APY on UST !) or use the Compound protocol.
* Liquidity providing is also a good option but you have to worry about slippage high, gas fees, and impermanent loss. So I would only suggest LPing if you are more experienced.

|Service|Blockfi|Crypto.com|Celsius Network/Voyager|Ledn.io|Nexo.io|Swissborg|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Annual interest rate|9.3%|6%|10%|12.5%|8%|7.25%|

&amp;#x200B;

**Question:**  **How to earn a yield on other coins?**

* Some coins can be staked in your wallet in your custody. Some can be staked on exchanges like Kraken and Binance. Please do not miss out on these rewards, they compound and will help you reach financial freedom quicker.
* Note: some of the services I mentioned above are non-custodial. The ""not your keys not your crypto"" comes to mind. But I feel that the reward we are compensated for FAR outweighs the non-custodial aspect of the services.
* Good websites to learn more about rates and places to earn a yield on other coins are:
* [https://interest.coinmarketcap.com/](https://interest.coinmarketcap.com/)
* [https://www.stakingrewards.com/](https://www.stakingrewards.com/)

&amp;#x200B;

**Now for some questions that I got from the previous update.**

**Question: I only have a small amount in crypto should I still stake my coins?**

A:  credit to  u/AhwahneeBanff

1. Most people underestimate the power of compound interest, especially when being turbocharged by a rapidly appreciating asset.
2. Let's say you buy 5000 Cardano at $2 and 5 years later it becomes $20. Given a 5.5% APR (The most common number I see on the stake pools) you would be earning:
3. Year 1: 275 Cardano earned from staking, or $550 in fiat earning, 5.5% fiat return (550/10,000) Year 5: 275 Cardano earned from staking, or $5,500 in fiat earning, a 55% return! (5,500/10,000)
4. And this is not assuming compound interest, on year 5 I would actually have 6,534 Cardano which gives 359 Cardano given a 5.5% compounded return. This means $7,180 in fiat return (359x20), which is a 71.8% return on my initial $10,000 investment into Cardano, annually!
5. Even if you have a small portfolio you should definitely start. **Magic of compound interest + appreciating asset price will help you reach your own goal a lot quicker and with a lower amount of capital than if you were to ignore it.**

The best part is that you're usually earning it in kind, so even if the current USD value seems insignificant, I suppose you're not invested in anything you don't expect will increase in value, so every dollar this week will hopefully be worth way more. **Just a nice passive DCA basically.**

This means even if you think staking is insignificant right now you would be surprised if crypto adoption keeps rising a couple of years down the line.

**Question:  Where's the catch for the &gt;10% yields on stablecoins? It sounds a little too good to be true, so I'm skeptical...**

A: There are a few ways that service can offer rates like this when other savings accounts offer fractions of this return rate:

1. No FDIC Insurance. Without this restriction, these services can take larger risks on the assets that they hold, while traditional banks are required to hold a large amount of Treasury Bond/Cash. This also means that if these services go broke, the US Government will not step in, and reimburse our deposits.
2. They offer loans to other companies doing business in the crypto space. Since these companies have trouble getting loans through traditional banking, these services are able to charge premium interest rates on these companies.
3. It seems that they are also using their Crypto assets, and their novel position in the market to offer other products to consumers, like offering loans backed by your crypto, or a credit card. I would expect these offerings to expand over time.

**Question: What is the better way, staking through a wallet or through a DEX?**

A: Depends on what's easier for you personally. DEX has higher rates but more complicated to set up. CEFI is easier and just deposit and forget about it but fewer rates and centralized. It's up to you!

**Question: How much do you think you will need to have invested for a return of 4k a month?**

A: Depends on what coin you earning interest on. If it's a stable coin Around 400000 dollars If it is in Bitcoin it would be more like 1 million dollars worth of BTC.

**Question: What is binance savings?**

A: It is flexible savings on Binance, which supports a couple of dozens of coins, and takes seconds to activate.

personalfinance,Why would a bank ever want to enter a repurchase agreement with the fed?,"I heard that over night repo rates might go to zero percent soon and I don’t understand how that makes sense.

My understanding is this:
Banks that’s have too much liquidity sometimes use the fed (since 2013) to swap their cash for collateral (t securities). This is usually over night and provides some small kickback for the bank, idk why the fed would want it though. 

So doesn’t this all become pointless if rates go to zero or even negative? Why wouldn’t the banks just buy treasury securities outright instead of messing around with overnight repos? What’s the value of holding extra treasury securities if the yield isn’t there? Wouldn’t the overhead of this whole process be inefficient?

investing,Why do high earning multiples imply a likelihood of low or even negative returns?,"I quote [Burton Malkiel in his May 4 2020 dialogue with Robert Shiller](https://www.pairagraph.com/dialogue/c93c449006c344ce94e6e2e8fbe7aba3/4).

&gt; Some historical perspective is useful. Even during one of the most spectacular “bubbles” in stock market history (the dot.com bubble of the late 1990s, considered damning evidence against EMH), most investors who tried to time the market made egregious mistakes. In 1996, Bob (with John Campbell) presented an excellent paper to the Federal Reserve showing that earnings multiples possessed substantial ability to predict future rates of return. **Since these multiples were then at all-time highs, the work implied a likelihood of low or even negative returns.** This work influenced Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan to make a famous speech questioning whether the stock market was at bubble levels and whether investors were exhibiting “irrational exuberance” in view of the economic outlook. The stock market rallied strongly for four years thereafter, and long-term investors who bought stocks after the speech earned generous rates of return.",finance

personalfinance,Refinancing several debt types - help me help my girlfriend,"Hi internet people,

&amp;#x200B;

Can you please help me figure out how to help my girlfriend manage her debt? She has unfortunately in the past been financially illiterate and has ended up with too many loans/debts that she's only paid minimum payments on for several years. I am trying to help teach her how to refinance them, but I haven't actually ever had to do this for myself, so I want to run the numbers by you all for input. These are her debts:

&amp;#x200B;

Sallie Mae smart option career training loan - $10,331 at 11.625% variable interest

Federal school loan. - $6,862 at 0% interest (based on her income)

Auto loan - $9,253 at 8.8% interest

credit card - $3,145 at 21.15% variable interest

&amp;#x200B;

She has only 700-800 in savings. Her monthly take home pay is \~1700-1900. She consistently pays the minimum amounts $260/mo towards Sallie Mae, $260/mo towards auto loan, and $86/mo towards credit card. Hasn't paid anything towards the fed school loan since no interest. Thankfully she's never missed a payment so her credit score is good, around 720-740. Both the Sallie Mae and auto loan have repayment terms that are ending in the next year or two, so I think leaving them be is not an option just for time sake.

&amp;#x200B;

How to refinance?

&amp;#x200B;

I originally thought to refinance the Sallie Mae loan with a new school loan since I believe interest rates are low right now, however it seems that her particular loan isn't eligible? (she doesn't have a degree, went to makeup artist school)

&amp;#x200B;

I know she could find a credit card to do a balance transfer and have 0% interest for 18 mo. (which by my math would save $900 in interest payments) but I don't think she could pay that off in that time frame without lessening what she pays towards the other ones, and after that period would have a similar high interest rate. Still might be worth it..

&amp;#x200B;

Or would it make sense to get a personal loan large enough to pay everything off, and just have the one personal loan to repay? Or separate personal loan and auto loan refinancing? Or keep everything separate- personal loan refinancing for Sallie Mae, new auto loan refinancing, and CC balance transfer? I assume pay off the CC first? I'm not sure she can get an interest rate on a new personal loan that is much lower (could even be higher?) than the rates she has now....

&amp;#x200B;

Side notes:

&amp;#x200B;

While Im sure theres at least some room to work on her budget (we are working on it now), she's not really a big spender and she stopped using her CC so she can pay it off (she just never knew that for every $80 she puts towards it, her balance only drops $30 since she gets $50 interest charges..). She doesn't pay rent or bills (I pay 100% so she can work on her debts), but does pay for groceries, misc. house expenses and stuff for her daughter. She doesn't work full time but has hours (20hr/wk) that enable her to watch her kid without paying for child care, which is super expensive here (Los Angeles area). I still think if she could pick up even 1-2 more hr/wk that would make some difference, but she is hesitant. I have pretty good finances (well paying job, no debt, 120K in savings) and I have the savings to help her but am not sure how much or if she'd even accept it since Im already pay for rent as well as the 5-10K for her lawyer (unrelated issue). Plus, I mostly want her to learn how to become financially independent. But! On the other hand, I want to be with her for the long run, so in that sense me paying some of these things off might be better for the big picture.. ?

personalfinance,Should I Refinance my Loans or Open a credit card,"Hi everyone, 

This isn't going to be as bad as it sounds. So i am a 22 year old who is making ~$90k/year. I currently have $20k in private student loans and $25k in federal loans. I have already paid off $15k in loans since taking them out and working. Generally i put all my bonuses, extra money and refunds/gifts into student loan principal. I also have $6k in my savings account as a emergency fund. 

Since I am so young I do not really have a great credit history. I have my student debt in addition to 2 credit cards, one a secured card w a $300 limit and the other unsecured with a $1000 limit. I always pay these off in full every month. I know it's important to not do hard pulls on your credit, but i also do not have many accounts with ""good"" credit. According to fico my credit score is about 740 with too few accounts being the major impact on it. Currently i have no hard pulls on my credit. In the future the only thing i could think of me needing requiring my credit is to finance a car when my beater dies. So i was wondering if it is better for me to open a credit card to have more accounts OR should i refinance my private student loans. My current private loan rate averaged is about 6.9% while I'm being quoted a 3.8% rate from a refinancing company. The payments monthly would increase by $50 because it would be for a shorter loan term but that's in the budget. My hope is to pay off all my private loans by 2023. Or should I do both, where i refinance and open a credit card and hope that i don't need a 3rd hard inquiry for financing a vehicle.

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, May 28, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, May 28, 2021**

Stocks gained on Friday, with market participants encouraged by new economic data on consumer spending, income and inflation, and a strong Weekly unemployment report. The market has made a remarkable recovery, particularly in technology, after the market tumbled 4% following the April Consumer Price Index roughly two weeks ago. In my view, as I have said for weeks, the recovery in the market confirms that the initial sell-off driven by inflationary fears forcing the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected was overblown.

New government data on Friday showed personal income fell less than expected in April, but still pulled back after March's stimulus-fueled surge. Personal income fell by 13.1% in April compared to March, less than the 14.2% drop expected. This follows a 20.9% increase during March which had been buoyed by the distribution of $1,400 stimulus checks to most Americans. 

In another report, the Department of Commerce reported core personal consumption expenditures increased 3.1% in April from a year earlier, blowing past the Fed’s traditional 2% target. Federal Reserve members consider the core PCE to be the gauge of inflation. The strong inflation readings reported by the Commerce Department on Friday had been widely anticipated as the pandemic's grip eases, thanks to vaccinations, and will have no impact on monetary policy. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly stated that higher inflation will be transitory. Supply-chain constraints combined, labor shortages in certain industries, and rising demand as the US economy recovers from the coronavirus-induced recession have all contributed to higher inflationary readings. These are all factors that are widely considered transitory, meaning not permanent. In an April 28 statement, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said, “An episode of one-time price increases as the economy reopens is not likely to lead to persistent year-over-year inflation into the future. Clogged supply-chains won’t affect Federal Reserve policy because they’re temporary and expected to resolve themselves.” Moreover, he said “For inflation to move up in a persistent way that moves expectations up, that would take some time, and you would think it would be likely we would be in very strong employment for that to happen.” In other words, Powell is saying he expects issues driving inflation higher to resolve themselves moving forward and doesn’t expect inflationary pressures to materialize until the labor market further improves.

In remarks this week, members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), reiterated their stance that they were not yet concerned that new inflation data would force the Fed to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he believed increases in inflation would be “mostly temporary” and that the Fed was “not quite there yet” when it came to discussing tapering its asset purchase program. In separate comments, Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said she did not want the Fed to be “overly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judging the outlook for inflation.” 

Richard Clarida, Vice Chairman of the Fed, offered a slightly different view but one that is in-line with what the Federal Reserve has already said publicly in the past. Clarida said, “there will come a time in upcoming meetings” when the Fed would consider tapering the asset purchase program but that “it is going to depend on the flow of data”. The Fed is currently buying $120 billion a month in government-issued and government-backed securities, and has pledged to continue doing that until the economy is more fully recovered.

This reaffirms the market that the Fed is not on a set timeline when it comes to rolling back current accommodative policies and will, as they have said time and again, wait for concrete data before any considerations are made. This follows a similar statement from Jerome Powell back in April 14, which proves market participants shouldn’t worry about quantitative easing tapering, in my opinion. Powell said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.”

The Department of Labor’s Weekly Unemployment Report showed jobless claims fell for the fourth straight week to yet another pandemic-era low, an encouraging sign that the labor market is improving following the extremely disappointing April Jobs report, which showed 266,000 new jobs added in the month, far below estimated of more than 1 million and a sharp deceleration in job growth compared to March.

Litecoin was created as a fork (copy/clone) of Bitcoin with some minor changes. Despite its unoriginality it has stood the test of time and remains one of the most robust/usable cryptocurrency ""networks"" in existence. But since its inception not much has changed; it is still just a slightly modified Bitcoin. But what are these differences? Do they allow Litecoin to stand on its own? Or is Litecoin just a lackluster project that refuses to die? We'll take a look at a few different aspects to figure this out.

# 1. Technical/fundamental differences in its code/network

**SUPPLY CAP -** Bitcoin has a supply cap of 21 million whereas Litecoin has a cap of 84 million. Currently each coin is divisible to the hundred millionth place, ie 0.00000001, meaning that ""only"" a maximum of 2,100,000,000,000,000 units of Bitcoin and four times that of Litecoin can exist. Divisibility can be extended by modification of the protocol's code. The point is, there is certainly no need for a coin with a higher supply and this factor should only be considered in regard to its psychological ramifications. For example, a side effect from a higher supply is the increased ease to own more ""whole"" coins. Since Litecoin has a larger supply, it is generally going to be easier for people to own more whole Litecoins. A quick example of this is that a person is more psychologically inclined to be proud of saying they own 100 Litecoins than 0.5 Bitcoins, even though they are identical in market value (at the time of this writing). Ultimately, however, this means nothing outside of psychological nature since either coin is massively divisible. 

**BLOCKCHAIN EFFICIENCY -** Bitcoin targets a block time of 10 minutes whereas Litecoin targets 2.5 minute blocks. While shorter block times does at surface mean faster and more total transactions, it brings with it some drawbacks. Effectively, a 2.5 minute block is going to be 4 times easier to mine than a 10 minute one due to its block difficulty. Due to the problem of orphaned blocks and possible temporary blockchain forks, users of both Bitcoin and Litecoin typically wait for more than 1 block confirmation before a transaction is trusted as final and ""well confirmed"". More on orphaned blocks here: [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/orphan-block-cryptocurrency.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/orphan-block-cryptocurrency.asp)While fairly rare, because of this problem users Bitcoin typically wait 3+ blocks before considering a transaction well confirmed. As one would imagine, users of Litecoin typically wait for 4 times as many blocks, thus rendering its 4 times faster block times somewhat pointless. Of course, when two users who trust each other are using either network, they may be happy to trust fewer confirmations. In this regard, perhaps Litecoin has a slight edge when two totally trusting individuals are transacting with each other. Outside of this, the decreased block time confers no major benefit. Additionally, in each protocol, each block that is created has a ""base"" amount of data included in it outside of transaction data. It is a small amount, but more blocks means more total data in the blockchain (regardless of how full they are), which means greater total blockchain size over time. Luckily this amount of data is very small, but the point remains that Litecoin will always have four times the footprint of this data than Bitcoin which is strictly a drawback.

That said there is definitely a potential benefit to producing blocks four times faster. Each chain's blocks have the same size limit, but since Litecoin is producing them four times as fast, it means it has about four times the total throughput of Bitcoin, ie four times the number of transactions in the same period of time. Not only does this mean more total transactions, but it also means that blocks will not fill up as fast/often. This is great for users because when blocks are constantly filled users have to bid up the price of including their transaction in a block with higher and higher transaction fees. However, this does come with a downside. Producing four times as many transactions would mean that the blockchain would grow in size roughly four times as fast. Right now the Bitcoin blockchain is about 400GB in size. For example's sake, if we say it had processed four times the transactions since its debut, it would now be one and half terabytes in size. If a blockchain climbs into multi-terabyte territory it becomes very difficult for average users to run their own node, which is essential for robust decentralization of the network and also necessary for users to maintain optimal privacy and control of their transactions. The debate in how important keeping blockchain size as limited as possible rages on, but overall consensus is that, whenever possible, smaller is always better. For now, it is still very feasible for an average user to run a full node for either Bitcoin or Litecoin, and the goal should be to keep it that way.

**MINING ALGORITHM -** Litecoin uses a different mining algorithm (scrypt) than Bitcoin (SHA-256) This basically just means the type of math problem mining units are racing to solve is different. Initially this was implemented to prevent the use of ASIC miners on its network, but this has since been overcome by ASIC manufacturers and now the only viable way to mine Litecoin is with ASIC miners. However, this isn't the end of the story because the difference in algorithm still matters. Since each network has a unique algorithm, Bitcoin ASICs cannot be used to mine Litecoin nor vice versa. This is good, because Bitcoin miners cannot ""attack"" Litecoin. This is worth consideration because Bitcoin has way more hashpower and miners on its network and as such it might not only be profitable but also feasible for a group of Bitcoin miners to collude to attack the Litecoin network. However, this difference is also somewhat unfortunate, because Bitcoin miners can never decide to switch to (honestly) mining Litecoin. Thus, if Litecoin gained a massive amount of market value and attracted more miner interest, it would not be able to benefit from the already existing Bitcoin miners. New ASICs would need to be produced to accommodate the increased demand for mining. There is one more consideration which is not strictly good or bad. Because Litecoin uses a more niche algorithm, it exists outside the main ""game"" of mining. If there are ever hash wars or in fighting between the mining communities, of say Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV and Bitcoin, Litecoin would remain totally unaffected. Thus it doesn't have to worry about the downsides that might come from such conflict, nor the possible upsides.

# 2. Network Security

https://preview.redd.it/qkckh22wmx171.png?width=942&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=82a293e9df12c55b000832f836ef2ff3e84245ca

Both Litecoin and Bitcoin utilize Proof of Work (PoW) in order to secure their networks. The major vulnerability mining has is in the possibility of a 51% attack. It is difficult to calculate the exact cost of such an attack as it would most likely need to be sustained for at least a few blocks before serious harm could be done and just because you have 51% of the hash power on a network doesn't guarantee you will mine two blocks in a row. However, we can at least gauge how different a base ""starting"" cost might be between Bitcoin and Litecoin. [https://www.crypto51.app/](https://www.crypto51.app/) offers a pretty good look at the base cost of beginning a single block attack on many PoW networks (a real attack would cost a lot more than this). Information on how these figures are reached as well as an overview of what a 51% attack is can be found here: [https://www.crypto51.app/about.html](https://www.crypto51.app/about.html)

The main reason it is so much more expensive to attack Bitcoin than Litecoin is because there is a great deal more miners and total hashpower securing its network. However, there is another aspect that increases its resilience. All other factors aside, the base difficulty to solve a Bitcoin block is four times that of Litecoin (thus its four times larger block time). As such, it would require four times the base ""work"" to attack the Bitcoin network for a single block. The primary target of interest during a 51% attack would be exchanges. Most, if not all exchanges, do require more than a single block confirmation before considering a transaction ""settled"" or ""well confirmed"" and treating it as final. For example, CoinBase requires 3 blocks for Bitcoin and 12 blocks for Litecoin ([source](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/sending-or-receiving-cryptocurrency/why-is-my-transaction-pending)). However, should an exchange, an individual, or any other user of either network be willing to trust fewer confirmations, it becomes increasingly easy to perform an attack. If say a user is willing to trust a transaction after a single block confirmation, using Litecoin would be 1/4 as secure as using Bitcoin. Ultimately, few people base trust purely on number of confirmed blocks, but rather, total work put into producing blocks. That's why you will often see exchanges requiring exactly four times as many blocks for Litecoin than as for Bitcoin. So this is generally not a concern on the whole.

There is also the issue outside of 51% attacks that exists in orphaned blocks where a transaction may appear confirmed by the blockchain but it ultimately gets abandoned in the orphan chain and possibly not included in the real chain. Again, this is why users should always wait for more than a single confirmation. Orphaned blocks will always occur on any PoW blockchain regardless of if all miners are acting honestly or maliciously.

# 3. The DOGE Factor

[such merge](https://preview.redd.it/p0ukc441nx171.png?width=300&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=790819d605f2cbe1876b634aeb44b282dcf0089f)

One of the greatest boons to Litecoin is the fact that it has engaged in merged mining with Dogecoin. Without getting into the details of how merged mining works and its greater implications, it means that Litecoin gains additional security and that miners can also be rewarded in DOGE in addition to LTC for producing blocks. This is primarily great because DOGE, at least for now, is quite popular and highly valued. Not only does DOGE have a higher market capitalization than LTC, in the past month or so it has actually been more profitable to mine DOGE than LTC. Because of DOGE's popularity it means greater incentivization to mine on Litecoin (hence better security). An often overlooked perk, though, is that while Litecoin has a hard cap on its supply, Dogecoin is forever inflationary. This means that with every block reward there will always be a base level of DOGE awarded to miners regardless of baked in block rewards. So when all LTC ultimately becomes completely mined, miners will not have to subsist solely on transaction fees as they can always count on the small reward of DOGE as extra incentive. While there are some merge mined coins with Bitcoin, none of them are nearly as popular/valuable as DOGE. 

# 4. Public Interest / Popularity

There is no question that in the public eye Bitcoin is vastly more popular than Litecoin. 100% of people who know about cryptocurrency know what Bitcoin is. Heck, even your grandma might have heard of Bitcoin. The same cannot be said of Litecoin. Additionally, while virtually 100% of exchanges trade Bitcoin, Litecoin (while common) is not as ubiquitous. We can also observe that there is far less total trading volume/value of Litecoin than of Bitcoin on exchanges.

We can check on chain activity to see that again, Litecoin is dwarfed by Bitcoin. Despite being capable of processing 4 times the transactions of Bitcoin in the same time period, there have been twice as many transactions recorded on Bitcoin than on Litecoin. There is simply far less use of the Litecoin network. There are also nearly 4 times as many active addresses on Bitcoin than on Litecoin. Below is that data.

Bottom line: Bitcoin is far more popular than Litecoin. An interesting note is that a common critique of Bitcoin is that it would be more usable if it could process faster/more transactions. Despite Litecoin being capable of 4 times the transaction throughput of Bitcoin it simply isn't filling up its blocks because there isn't enough usage/users of its network. If users were concerned about throughput they could easily use Litecoin instead of Bitcoin, but we see that the majority do not, despite its underutilized block space.

# 5. Development Progress

Neither Litecoin or Bitcoin is perfect and further development of either core protocol is not only welcome but necessary for a stronger network and greater usability. It is very unfortunate then, for Litecoin, that development activity has nearly ceased for the project. Setting aside the fact that most changes to Litecoin over time were mostly copies of changes made to Bitcoin, even if we look at the raw numbers in regard to project development, Litecoin is virtually dead whereas Bitcoin is not only alive and well but trending upward over time. Pictured below is basically a convenient way to gauge development interest in each project.

# 6. Adaptability and future vision

For starters, since Litecoin is so similar to Bitcoin it is very easy for Bitcoin upgrades to be merged into Litecoin, meaning that nobody really ""needs"" to work on Litecoin, since they can just copy Bitcoin code. But perhaps more interestingly, because Litecoin *is not* Bitcoin, it means that the opportunity exists to do something entirely different. This may be happening for the first time ever as it seems there is an increasing interest in the utilization of Mimblewimble technology with Litecoin. Solid overview of Mimblewimble here: [https://academy.bit2me.com/en/what-is-the-mimblewimble-protocol/](https://academy.bit2me.com/en/what-is-the-mimblewimble-protocol/)

The tl;dr is that it possible perks include not only increasing Litecoin's privacy but also decreasing blockchain size while simultaneously increasing transaction throughput. Of course, Mimblewimble itself isn't without its own set of drawbacks, but that is beyond the scope of this article. A ""completed"" version of a Mimblewimble implementation is currently submitted on GitHub and is being reviewed. Should the code seem sound and favorable, it may end up being deployed on Litecoin. Should this happen, Litecoin may actually offer something truly unique that isn't brought to the table by Bitcoin.

Some old discussion about its possible implementation: [https://github.com/litecoin-project/lips/issues/10](https://github.com/litecoin-project/lips/issues/10)

## Wrapping Up

Litecoin's decreased block times may appear as an advantage at first glance, but it turns out to be more complicated. In short, it means a potential for 4 times the throughput and lower fees for users, but it would also mean a blockchain growing in size at 4 times the speed. If throughput and fees were the biggest concern, then users would probably benefit more by using Dogecoin rather than Litecoin or Bitcoin. Litecoin's security is dwarfed by the Bitcoin mining network as the mining power of Bitcoin towers over that of Litecoin as well as any other pure PoW protocol. Its difference in mining algorithm is also a potential benefit but is in as many ways a potential downside. While Litecoin does have the capability of producing four times as many transactions as Bitcoin, we see that due to its lack of usage it currently only processes half as many transactions as Bitcoin. It is far less popular than Bitcoin in the public eye, has far less network activity, far less total active address, and far less trading activity. On top of all of this, development of the core Litecoin protocol has come to a near standstill.

Litecoin does have some noteworthy traits. Its merge mining with Dogecoin means that miners will always have a base incentive in DOGE to continue mining regardless of LTC transaction fees (as long as DOGE remains somewhat valuable). And of course, because Litecoin isn't Bitcoin, it could potentially try something different that Bitcoin is unwilling to do. So far it hasn't, but it could. And it looks like the most probable route may be to include aspects of Mimblewimble. While this change is not certain and brings with it some challenges along with its benefits, it is certainly a possibility that we could look forward to. Should the speed that Litecoin's blockchain grows by not be an issue, it also does present the capability for four times the total transaction throughput.

Ultimately as things currently stand it is my opinion that there is very little reason to use Litecoin over Bitcoin. Currently its main benefits are also shared or even outclassed by Dogecoin, such as its ability for higher transaction throughput, lower transaction fees, and shorter wait times for trusting individuals. While the base emissions of DOGE for Litecoin miners is a nice bonus, I don't see it ever being the deciding factor between deciding between mining Bitcoin or Litecoin. The addition of Mimblewimble technology into Litecoin is attractive but is merely an idea and we have no timeline for its inclusion nor do we know if it would ever even end up being worthwhile to implement at all. For now it seems like Litecoin is just an alt coin with no incredibly useful unique benefits, but perhaps that will change in the future.

CryptoCurrency,Differences between APY &amp; APR (in Crypto),"APR and APY are used in many yield farming programs in DeFi protocols. However, they are not the same thing! We, the participants in the market, are not only investing but actively receiving yields by farming and staking DeFi tokens. So these basic terms are not only important, but they are also information that helps you to invest more effectively.

Both are related to returns. But how are they different? Why are they not interchangeable? We discuss that in today's newsletter.

Definition

APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate. It is the actual annual rate of return, **NOT** taking into account the effect of compound interest.

APY stands for Annual Percentage Yield. It is the actual annual rate of return, taking into account the effect of compound interest.

Who uses what? APY is better to calculate your returns on investment while APR is more common in lending.

&gt;Quick math: which do you think is higher? APY, the one that considers compounding.

What Are They Different?APR

For example, a yield farming program offers an APR  
of 100%/yr. You use $1000 to join this program. One year later you will receive $2,000, where $1000 is the initial capital and $1000 is APR  
.

Once you see the APR, it is possible to immediately calculate how much profit will be earned at the end of the period. This profit comes from your staking or farming, so just join at the beginning to get the result for APR interest.

Formular

APR = r x N

Where:

r: The interest rate of the year;

N: Interest period (N = 1, means 1 year).

APY

APY is another way of calculating the percentage of real profit you will receive.

&gt;What will you get if you receive profit every day from staking and you will add that to your principle and earn interest on that **every day**?

If you have an APR  
of 100%/yr with getting daily profit, you have to divide APR  
by 365 days to calculate the interest received daily (0.27%). Then reinvest this interest continuously every day. The amount you get is $2,714.57, where $1000 is the initial capital and $1714.57 is APY  
.

Assuming you participate in farming pairs on Solana's Raydium application, I also combine Step Finance to know the APR  
and APY  
of these farming pairs. Typically, I am staking $RAY on Raydium (current project APR is 35.33%), with $1,000 you farm at the beginning of the year to the end of the year, the total income will be $1,423.51.

Formular

APY = (1+r)\^n - 1

In which:

r: The interest rate of the period;

n: Interest period (n=1 means 1 day).

Awareness

As such, today's projects often offer 2 ratios of APR and APY to show users what the rate of return is currently available. However, some projects that give daily, 7-day interest rings directly provide APY. This has two implications:

* First, displaying APY  
will produce a larger percentage than APR  
, making brave people feel that they will receive more profit.
* Secondly, the APY  
interest is only true if the user reinvests (restake, refarm) continuously in the allowed period (e.g. when receiving rewards, immediately stake).

Today we see a lot of aggregator protocols already using this ability to increase profits, continuously reinvesting within the capacity of the original protocols. This is really good if the transaction costs are not significant. Hopefully, we can find those solutions in Layer 2.

personalfinance,Which financial path should I go down to finish my college degree?,"My classroom fees have not been added yet. So far my fruition is $4,467

From the Pell Grant I have $3,246.50

Without loans that means as of right now I owe the school $1220.50.

I am going into the Fall semester. During that time, I will be finishing my undergraduate degree. I will be doing a 10 week internship in which time I also cannot have a workforce job because the internship plus the extra course is extremely intensive. Therefore, I have been trying to maintain and build my savings to cover my bills and also an emergency if my car has trouble

(Because I am working on getting the transmission fixed but I know it can cost up too $2000 so I wanted to save $2000 for ""Car Emergency Budget"")

The financial aid is offering me this thing called the ""Scrbinar Loan/Scholarship"" worth $1000. It is technically a loan; however, it has pros:

- 6 months grace period
- if you maintain residence and employment in the state for 24 consecutive months then the loan is forgiven
- 1% interest rate which everyone tells me is real low 

Cons:
- what I pay in I don't get back which I think is true for all loans?
- I am worried about the current job environment and if BSW workers gets laid off

If I went that route with Pell Grant and Scribner Loan then I would be down to owing $220.50

The school also recommended that I should apply for the Federal Subsided Loan which would give me $6496 plus a refund check around $2,000. Idk if I wanna mess with the federal loans though.

As of this moment I have $4,310.44 in savings (still waiting on my federal tax return) and I can get a no consequence loan from my life insurance policy up to $526 (they don't do credit reporting so me paying it back or not does not affect my credit either way and it just means if I died my beneficiary would get $25,000 minus the $526 I borrowed. Payments are a minimum of $10 a month)

Again though I don't want to spend $1,220 + fees from my Internship/Emergency fund. I have set my budget to last 4 months just in case I don't get hired right after the 10 weeks. 

So what should I do? Pay the whole $1220.50+ out of pocket or just take out the Scribner Loan and pay $220.50 out of pocket? ($220.50 to say $500 I am okay with doing)

If need more info: I am a senior in BSW program with only internship and the extra course left (called ""Seminar"") and I have NEVER had student loans all throughout college. Scholarships and the Pell Grant covered everything except these last 2 semesters because I had to do an extra year for changing my major. A very close friend actually gave me the $1200 I needed last semester and did not want me to pay him back. I feel bad asking again, but he has always told me ""never take out student loans just let me know what you need."" Should I ask him for hald and I pay half then? I'd feel bad if I offend him by taking a loan.",finance

Backstory-Married, mid 30's with one child. Our mortgage is $1,900 but we do pay PMI. We have a fixed 3.8% interest rate with $287,000 left to pay on a 30 year mortgage. We purchased our house in early 2020 and did not have the 20% to put down to avoid PMI. My take home pay monthly is $4,000 after taxes. My vehicle is paid off and I have no cc debt or student loans. My wife has no debt either. We have yet to combine our checking accounts and she has $12,000 in her account. Her take home is $3,800 a month after taxes. Currently, my company offers a 401k plan, but does not match. I have $20,000 in my previous jobs 401k which I'm pleased with that growth and $9,000 in my current jobs 401k. I currently put in 10% bi-weekly. I love my job and don't plan on leaving anytime soon. Our profession is in healthcare, so job security is never a concern for us. My main question is, after I separate a 6 month emergency fund. What should i do with a large chunk in checking?",finance

dogecoin,Doge inflation vs The Fed,"Has anyone looked at the inflation rate of Doge vs the Fed’s targets?

I keep seeing people talk about the unlimited supply of Doge vs capped supply crypto and that’s why Doge will never grow in value.   To me that argument is actually completely backwards.  We’re basically talking inflationary vs deflationary.  Deflationary leads to hoarding, like gold... and when supply is too big attempts to control supply for deflationary purposes (think diamonds).    On the other hand, all the fiat currencies around the world that are actually worth using as day to day currencies are inflationary... and the central banks try to control the rate of inflation overall.  And they don’t exactly do a great job of being consistent across administrations.  

On the other hand, inflation rate of Doge is predictable.  So it seems it could become an everyday use currency... ergo, it actually could easily grow to a $1 to even $10 value against the dollar.  More importantly, if it were to actually be used as currency, it would stabilize the price more.   We’d still have fluctuations against other currencies because governments / central banks will continue to try and hit some theoretical target.  

So... any qualified economists have any thoughts on this? Set aside the trendiness, and just assume we have 60% or higher adoption across the globe. What’s that world look like?",cryptocurrency

Let's go...

Newly covered today: 

1. Charles is helping to bring the cryptographer who broke SHA-1 to the University of Wyoming. The Cardano funded blockchain lab there could be on the road to be a powerhouse. [https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong\_/status/1398290866419105802](https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong_/status/1398290866419105802) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yiqun\_Lisa\_Yin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yiqun_Lisa_Yin)

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. I don’t know if everyone watched the last few minutes of the Africa Special. But, I think a lot of people missed the section where John O’Connor said the goal of Cardano in Africa is to issue 100 MILLION digital identities in the next two years. To give you some idea of scale here, adapools.org shows a highest ever daily number of new wallets at around 71k. If we onboard 100 Million people via digital identity over two years that would be 136,986 people per day. ETH only has 150MM unique wallets to date. [https://youtu.be/yRjj662kJsk?t=8615](https://youtu.be/yRjj662kJsk?t=8615) [https://adapools.org/analysis-query/wallets](https://adapools.org/analysis-query/wallets) [https://etherscan.io/chart/address](https://etherscan.io/chart/address)
2. John also mentioned that all of the 100k subscribers to World Mobile in Zanzibar this year will have digital identities on Atala Prism. They will also be offering so-called “RealFi” loans by Q1 of next year that will be made via Cardano liquidity and will act as a bridge to real world value. [https://youtu.be/yRjj662kJsk?t=8628](https://youtu.be/yRjj662kJsk?t=8628)
3. Charlie Munger thinks crypto is “disgusting”. That’s a wonderful thing because it tells you how early you are. This is especially true in Cardano which is a project that leads with empathy for the developing world. Will he still call that disgusting if we’ve brought financial inclusiveness to an entire continent in five or ten years. Probably he won’t say anything because he won’t have lived that long. But, you get the point.

4. The state authorities in Wyoming are so far ahead of the curve it’s scary. Now they’re putting aside $4 million for staking. On the private side, Caitlin Long should be declared a state treasure for making a lot of this happen. [https://twitter.com/Cardanians\_io/status/1388756653311414272](https://twitter.com/Cardanians_io/status/1388756653311414272) [https://decrypt.co/69390/university-wyoming-generate-revenue-crypto-staking](https://decrypt.co/69390/university-wyoming-generate-revenue-crypto-staking)
5. I will be in a tent in a beautiful place where there will be very limited internet access. So, no text format Cardano Rumor Rundown until Saturday.

6. There is supposed to be some kind of mid-month update on Plutus. Charles hinted in a recent update that everything is going really well on that front. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=786mOp2Xq7s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=786mOp2Xq7s)
7. There will be an update on Mithril at the end of the month. You will remember from previous coverage that Mithril is a means to create trustless light wallets via recursive snarks similar to Mina. ZK-SNARK = zero knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=786mOp2Xq7s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=786mOp2Xq7s)

9. Doge Mania might be hitting a new peak (as a cultural artifact at least) tonight with Elon’s appearance on SNL. There are many different perspectives you can take on how this might impact ADA. I find the following two the most interesting: 1) if the Doge pump is followed by an inevitable crash it could sour a giant group of new adopters on crypto; or 2) it might be a gateway drug that will turn a large group of new adopters on to better projects.

14. ADA is the most crypto of all cryptos. George of CryptosRUs pointed out in a recent video that he couldn’t find any trace of a VC firm owning Cardano in its portfolio in his search of the categories section on CMC. This makes sense if you know Cardano. Would freedom and decentralization loving Satoshi not throw up a little in his mouth to find out that VC ownership of cryptos was a metric people would care about in 2021? The lack of VC stake in the very decentralized and freedom loving Cardano only adds to our already iron-clad claim on the mantle of the most crypto of all crypto projects. Our ecosystem never sought to attract VC money that would only centralize ownership in a smaller number of hands. This doesn’t even address the current extreme centralization of block validation in BTC and ETH.

15. IOHK has dropped a new article on the status of KEVM and IELE. Grigori Rosu of Runtime Verification says a proof-of-concept of IELE should be ready in six months.

16. Cardano saw a new challenger enter the scene with Internet Computer (ICP) debuting very high on the CoinMarketCap charts. However, a look into ICP makes one question whether they are really in the Gen. 3 Blockchain race at all given that available information indicates the blockchain runs via datacenters hosting standardized hardware and that those datacenters can only join the network with the permission of the “Network Nervous System”. You could say that the winner of the Gen. 3 Blockchain race needs to solve the blockchain trilemma of decentralization, security, and scalability. If that’s true, then it’s arguable that ICP is not even competing in the decentralization leg of the race. [https://youtu.be/zHl-oVPoX88?t=97](https://youtu.be/zHl-oVPoX88?t=97)

40. The ISO model entering the capital formation toolbox in Cardano is going to make the stake pool game extremely interesting with SPOs scrambling to find the right balance between rewarding ADA and giving their delegators other things like tokens. Some stake pools could even become like portfolio funds with relationships with many different projects the tokens of which are given to delegators. Babel Fees could also play a role here for smart SPOs as they may allow access to a wide variety of tokens in the ecosystem that could be used to reward delegators with a sort of index fund exposure to a wide variety of Cardano projects.

43. The Cardano Foundation has released the full video of the Fireside Chat with Eva and Fred. Lots of questions answered on a variety of fronts. Very interesting remarks including that in discussions with financial institutions, Fred has found they are interested in exposure to the alpha provided by the asset class in general, tokenization of assets, and the yield provided by staking rewards. Fred counters that they SHOULD be far more interested in the Cardano standard including the concepts of reference accounts, programmability of money, and transaction metadata.

68. The May Cardano 360 was yesterday and we had lots of updates including the Color Coding for the different stages of the testnet! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS33gRj9JYE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS33gRj9JYE)
69. Alonzo “Blue” Era Testnet (through mid June; &lt;50 user cohort) will include the basic functionality of the system for testing basic contracts . Initially the SPOs will be included, then some of the Plutus Pioneers will be allowed in, then a few of the outside development firms (Plutus Partners).  The Plutus Partners will be working on specific areas including oracles, DEXs, stablecoins, NFTs, and DeFi.  This will produce code and documentation that will be publicly available.  
70. Alonzo “White” Era Testnet (mid June to mid July; &lt;500 user cohort) will add more Plutus Pioneers and more functionality. They will develop various dApps and there will be interaction on the user side of these dApps.  They will do some benchmarking at this stage.
71. The Alonzo Hard Fork Combinator Event requires a lot of different pieces come together at the same time.  But, this is not their first rodeo and they have a lot of experience with this from the ITN, Shelley, and etc.
72. Alonzo “Purple” Era Tesnet (mid July to mid August; fully public) will involve a full public network with all of the Plutus pioneers, the Rosetta Api to the exchanges, Daedalus, hardware wallets, graphQL, and full functionality.  The purpose of this phase will be optimization.
73. Alonzo “Red” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will involve a new network where they can test scalability and stability. 
74. Alonzo “Black” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will be the final public testnet where they will ensure they have their candidate mainnet releases ready to launch on the mainnet.
75. They are committed to making sure there is a very large group of people who are familiar with using the Alonzo testnet by the time the mainnet launches.
76. Alonzo Mainnet (August-September). It’s looking like Alonzo mainnet launch was positioned in very late August  through September in the infographics. That makes me assume there is a chance of August, much better chance of September, and also some chance of October or later. This is blockchain development after all.  Also, we’ve waited years.  Why care about a few weeks?
77. There will be another Plutus Pioneers Cohort later this summer.
78. Marlowe Run will be a browser product that can run on mobile or desktop. It can be linked to your wallet and be used to run Cardano smart contracts simultaneously on a distributed basis across multiple user browsers. The user interface is light years ahead of anything we saw in Marlowe Meadow or the Marlowe Playground simulations. It will include a library of off-the-shelf contracts.
79. There will be a Marlowe Webinar on June 3.  Register here: [https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/](https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/)
80. The ERC-20 converter was looking very intuitive and seamless in the new demo. It should be on the testnet in June.
81. Manuel Chakravarty gave a big update on Hydra (layer 2 scaling). Hydra will not require that the base layer be modified since it will be implemented via Plutus smart contracts. Hydra is actually a collection of protocols including Hydra Head and Hydra Tail. Hydra Head is a symmetric protocol where multiple participants will be online simultaneously for the whole period of the head exchanging messages. Hydra Tail is an asymmetric protocol involving a high performance server and many clients that may be mobile and could be offline for large portions of the tail’s existence. There will also be “inter head &amp; tail networking” which will allow for a network of heads and tails. They have a published research paper on Hydra Head. They are currently writing the Hydra Tail paper. 
82. Hydra is distinguished from other layer 2 protocols by its isomorphic properties.  This means you will be able to run any smart contract that works on the base layer in a Hydra Head! This is very special.  We won’t need special purpose contracts built out just for layer 2.  There are some big implications to this. Since a Hydra Head is essentially just a Plutus smart contract, this means you can run a Hydra Head inside another Hydra Head.  It’s turtles all the way down, guys.  It sounds like they can do this iteratively as much as they want.  
83. Aggelos also gave a good presentation on the importance of “skin in the game” in resource based consensus protocols (both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake) and its effect on promotion or discouragement of centralization. He explained how Ouroboros has built-in safeguards to prevent centralization including the K parameter (currently at 500) which caps total rewards per pool and the alpha parameter (currently at 0.3) which splits rewards into a 77% piece and a 23% piece.  A pool can take its share of the 77% piece based on the pool’s total stake and its share of the 23% piece based on the pledge of the SPO.  A higher alpha parameter makes it less attractive for individual SPOs to proliferate multiple pools since they can’t be as leveraged on their available pledge and still get as big a share of the 23% piece. This also discourages Sybil Attacks.  As Cardano on-chain governance progresses, these parameters will be controlled by the community.  
84. There will be a Cardano Goguen Summit in September. It will be hybrid digital/in-person.

# **A big jobs report looms in the week ahead, as markets enter the often-weak month of June - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/28/jobs-report-looms-in-the-week-ahead-as-markets-enter-the-often-weak-month-of-june.html)**
*****
&gt; May’s employment report is the big event in the week ahead, as stocks enter the often weak month of June. Stocks are finishing May with a mixed performance. Big cap indexes like the S&amp;P 500 and Dow notched gains. The S&amp;P rose a half percent, and the Dow rose 1.9%. The small cap Russell 2000 was flat, up 0.1%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq declined 1.5%.
*****
&gt; June is not historically a strong month for stocks. Bespoke Investment Group points out that over the past 50 years, the Dow has gained just 0.12% in June and has been positive 52% of the time.
*****
&gt; But over the past 20 years, June was far weaker, gaining only 40% of the time. June’s performance is tied with September as the worst month of the year, with an average Dow decline of 0.7%, according to Bespoke.
*****
&gt; The economy is front and center in the coming week with the important ISM readings on manufacturing and services sector activity, but the most important measure will be Friday’s jobs report. According to Dow Jones, economists expect Friday’s employment report to show the creation of about 674,000 jobs in May, after the disappointing 266,000 jobs added in April. That was about a quarter of what economists had expected.
*****
&gt; “You know if we have two months in a row of not delivering on the jobs expectations, the market is going to get nervous,” said George Goncalves, head of U.S. macro strategy at MUFG. “Hopefully, we beat it and then that creates a positive buzz, and we go into the Fed meeting and then we’re, ‘Hey, the economy is still on track.’”
*****
&gt; # Big June event
&gt; The Fed meets June 15-16, and already market pros are anticipating it will be the most important event of the month. Fed officials have emphasized that they will keep policy easy as they watch to see signs that the economy is really healing. They also contend that higher inflation readings are temporary, since the data is being compared with a weak period last year.
*****
&gt; Key for the markets is whether the Fed begins to believe that inflation is higher than it expected or that the economy is strengthening enough to progress without so much monetary support. Fed officials have said they would consider discussing tapering back on their quantitative easing bond purchase program if they see signs of improvement, and that would be a first step toward interest rate hikes, not expected until at least 2023.
*****
&gt; If inflation runs too hot, the Fed’s main weapon to combat it is to raise interest rates.
*****
&gt; The prospect of higher interest rates makes the stock market nervous, since it would mean higher costs for companies and less liquidity. In theory, higher interest rates also means that investors could potentially choose higher-yielding bond investments over stocks.
*****
&gt; The next big read for the economy is Friday’s jobs report, and it looms large as recent inflation readings have come in much hotter than expected. The latest was the personal consumption expenditures price index Friday. It showed core inflation running at 3.1% year over year, the strongest reading for that measure since 1992.
*****
&gt; The Fed’s beige book on the economy is expected Wednesday. ISM manufacturing data is expected Tuesday, and ISM services is released Thursday. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell speaks on central banks and climate change at Green Swan 2021 global virtual conference Friday.
*****
&gt; # Inflation flare-up
&gt; The Fed has said it would tolerate an average range of inflation around its 2% target until it sees inflation sticking at a higher level. Inflation has been running mostly below 2%, prior to the latest numbers.
*****
&gt; “With the PCE number coming in like every other inflation number over the last six weeks, hotter than expected, the market is inching closer to calling the Fed out on its view that inflation is transitory,” said Julian Emanuel, head of equity and derivatives strategy at BTIG.
*****
&gt; Emanuel said the speculative activity around meme stocks this week is a sign of froth and shows a large amount of liquidity in the hands of investors. One of those stocks, AMC, closed off 1.5% on Friday after rallying 116% in the past week, giving it a 2021 gain of 1,200%.
*****
&gt; “The net net on the index level is basically it’s a stock market that’s moving sideways,” Emanuel said. “Our view continues to be that when you look at it longer term, the big picture is this is a bull market that started in March of last year that has further to run. When you look at it in the medium term, the market has every right to be concerned and we do believe they will amp up their concern that the Fed’s paying insufficient attention to price stability.”
*****
&gt; Emanuel said he studied what happened to stocks when core PCE was above the Fed’s 2% target. “The average monthly return for months where the core PCE has been over 2%, going back to 1989 is (a decline) of 1.6%, with a decided bias toward more defensive sectors like health care outperforming and a very pronounced bias for technology of all kinds to underperform,” he said.
*****
&gt; Technology stocks, as measured by the S&amp;P information technology sector, gained 1.6% in the past month, and are up 5.9% year to date. The sector is lagging the S&amp;P 500′s 12% gain.
*****
&gt; The top-performing sectors have been cyclical year to date, with energy up 36.2%, financials up 28.5%, materials up 20.1% and industrials up 18.3%. Communications services, which contains some internet growth names, gained 16% since the start of the year. Health care has been outperforming information technology, up 8.6% year to date.
*****
&gt; In the past week, the S&amp;P 500 gained 1.2% to 4,204 and is within 1% of its all-time high. The Dow rose 0.9% to 34,529, and the Nasdaq was up 2% at 13,748.
*****
&gt; # Red flag?
On the edges of the financial markets, market pros are paying attention to signs of a huge surge of liquidity in the financial system. In the past week, institutions have been placing unprecedented amounts of cash with the Fed, nearly a half trillion dollars Thursday.
*****
&gt; “There’s way too much liquidity in the system, and it’s happening as a result of the Fed’s ongoing QE, but also disbursements from the fiscal stimulus,” said Goncalves.
*****
&gt; He said the funds from trillions in stimulus, including to state and local governments, have not yet been spent but have found their way into the banking system. At the same time, institutions and individuals continue to move funds into money market funds, now holding about $4.6 trillion.
*****
&gt; Those funds also put pressure on the system, since they put funds in Treasury bills. Goncalves expects the Fed to raise rates on excess reserves if the situation gets worse.
*****
&gt; “There’s no precedent for this because it is totally a function of there being just too much money in the system,” he said.
*****
&gt; “Institutions are redepositing cash at the Fed because they don’t have enough bills or short-term commercial paper. There’s not enough fixed income assets to go around,” said Goncalves. He said banks also do not want to hold the excess cash since it counts against their leverage ratio, and they would prefer to find other higher-yielding investments.
*****
&gt; What it has done is sparked some speculation that the Fed would taper its QE program sooner than expected, he said.

&gt; # Days After Memorial Day Improving

&gt; Our office will be closed for observance of Memorial Day on Monday, May 31, 2021. U.S stock and bond markets will also be closed. As you spend some quality time off please consider taking time to commemorate those who have paid the ultimate price while serving in the U.S. military. Additionally, consider taking a moment to acknowledge first responders, nurses, doctors, law enforcement, firefighters, essential workers, scientists and everyone else that has tirelessly worked and sacrificed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

&gt; For decades the Stock Trader’s Almanac has been tracking and monitoring the market’s performance around holidays. The trading day after Memorial Day has a mixed record going back to 1971. Both S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have declined more often than risen on the day, but average performance is still modestly positive.

&gt; Since 1986, the frequency of gains has improved, and average performance has also risen however, but S&amp;P 500 declined five straight days after 2015-2019. The second trading day after Memorial Day has more advances than declines, but average performance is negative for NASDAQ. The third day after appears to have the best long- and short-term record combined with solid average performance.

&gt; # Post-Election-Year June: Third Worst S&amp;P 500 Month

&gt; June has shone brighter on NASDAQ stocks over the last 50 years as a rule ranking sixth with a 0.9% average gain, up 28 of 50 years. This contributes to NASDAQ’s “Best Eight Months” which ends in June. June ranks near the bottom on the Dow Jones Industrials just above September since 1950 with an average loss of 0.2%. S&amp;P 500 performs similarly poorly, ranking ninth, but essentially flat (0.1% average gain). Small caps also tend to fare well in June. Russell 2000 has averaged 0.8% in the month since 1979.

&gt; In post-election years since 1953, June still ranks poorly and its average loss for DJIA increases to –1.1% while S&amp;P 500′s modestly positive performance becomes a 0.6% loss. DJIA struggles the most, advancing in just four post-election year Junes (1977, 1985, 1997 and 2017). Russell 2000 fares best, up seven times in ten years with an average gain of 1.2%. NASDAQ lands in the middle, advancing 50% of the time with an average gain of 0.4%.

&gt; # Checking the Gauges: Economic Surprise Indexes

&gt; In terms of whether economic data is either beating or missing economists’ forecasts, it appears conditions may now be a bit better overseas. Driven by some improving COVID-19 trends, the economic backdrop has improved overseas, while high economic expectations have proved to be a more formidable hurdle here in the U.S. This improvement has helped to steady the foundation in many non-U.S. equity markets, and has caused us to improve our outlook for developed non-U.S. stocks. We believe the improving COVID-19 trends in Europe could be particularly sticky as vaccine distribution becomes more widespread.

&gt; For several years now, being underweight European equities, relative to the U.S., has been a winning trade. A sea-change in that thinking could be approaching as value-heavy European indices have gotten some attention with the improvement from value, but a firm, constructive view of European equities may still be some ways off.

&gt; The Citigroup Economic Surprise Index, or CESI, tracks how the economic data fare compared with expectations. The index rises when economic data exceeds Bloomberg consensus estimates and falls when data is below forecasts. As shown in the LPL Chart of the day, economically, global conditions remain rather strong, as evidenced by these indices, which remain above the zero line. This reflects economic data coming in better than expected in several geographic regions. The repair of global trade activity, as supply lines are reconnected, has been notably key in non-U.S. data outcomes.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/blog-chart-5.27.21.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Looking ahead, we expect now elevated economic expectations, particularly in the U.S., may prove a tougher target. As a result “economic surprises,” both in the U.S. and abroad, may fade as we move through the year. However, the overall global growth trajectory is expected to continue to be robust through 2021. Global real GDP contracted 3.3% in 2020, and it is expected to rise to +6.0% in 2021, according to Bloomberg’s consensus estimate, before ticking down to +3.4% in 2022.

&gt; “Although high U.S. economic expectations could be tough to beat for the remainder of 2021, we still believe U.S. stocks should make up a material portion of equity portfolios. And even though economic expectations are being more readily exceeded overseas, it is tough to overlook U.S. companies’ innovation and profitability advantages.” explained LPL Financial Director of Research Marc Zabicki.

&gt; # More and More Investors Are Looking For A Correction

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has been hovering around 0.5% below its record highs this week, but without a true test of those highs, sentiment has not moved very far. The American Association of Individual Investors' weekly reading on bullish sentiment fell from 37% last week down to 36.4%. While that is the second week in a row with an absolute move less than a full percentage point in size, the marginally lower reading does leave bullish sentiment at the lowest level since the end of October.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052721-AAII-Bull.png))**

&gt; Bearish sentiment moved by even less, only rising 0.1 percentage points. At 26.4%, it still is below the reading of 27% from the first week of the month. Outside of that reading, that is the highest level since February.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052721-AAII-Bear.png))**

&gt; This week's moves left the bull-bear spread little changed at 10. That's down 0.7 points from last week but still above the 9.5 reading from two weeks ago.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052721-AAII-BB-Spread.png))**

&gt; Once again, the highest percentage of investors are in the neutral camp at 37.1%. As was the case last week, that makes for the highest level in neutral sentiment since the first week of 2020 when it stood north of 40%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052721-AAII-Neut.png))**

&gt; Pivoting over to sentiment for equity newsletter writers measured in the Investors Intelligence survey, there were some more interesting moves. Bullish and bearish sentiments were not necessarily anything to gawk at similar to the AAII survey. Bullish sentiment has been on the decline with this week's survey showing a 3 percentage point drop to 51.5%, the lowest level since March 10th. Meanwhile, bearish sentiment moderated from 17.2 to 16.8%. That was the same level as the start of the month.

&gt; The percentage of respondents ""looking for a correction"" was more notable. Rather than simply asking whether or not respondents foresee a correction in the technical sense on the horizon (a 10% decline from a high), Investors Intelligence defines a newsletter writer as ""looking for a correction"" when they are bullish on a list of stocks but at a lower price point. Coming in at 31.7%, the reading is a few percentage points above the historical average of 27.6% and is in the top quartile of the historical range. In other words, it is an elevated reading albeit far from without precedence. What is more significant is that it has been over a year since this part of the survey has seen these levels.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052721-II-Correction.png))**

&gt; In the history of the survey dating back to 1963, there have only been eight other times that the percentage of newsletter writers looking for a correction has crossed above 30% for the first time in at least a year. The most recent of these was in April 2009. In the table below we show the S&amp;P 500's performance in the year following those occurrences. As shown, performance has been generally positive across those past instances with average gains over the following weeks and months and moves higher at least 75% of the time one month, three months, and one year out. Additionally, while there were two times, 1982 and 2009, in which the S&amp;P 500 rallied over the following year without looking back, there were another two times, 2001 and 2007, that at the following years' lows, the S&amp;P 500 would end up lower by double-digit percentage points.

&amp;#x200B;

Got fired on May 12th and went from earning $978 to being told I qualify for $378 a week for unemployment. I filed for **unemployment insurance** **on May 14th**, and haven't received payment yet. Have filed weekly, and still no update through Virginia's 3rd party website. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been applying to jobs nonstop and have a few leads, but other than that nothing is confirmed yet.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Discover Card Balance with a 24 percent interest rate - $2,990 
2. Federal Taxes - $177
3. Parking Ticket - $100 
4. Toll pass collections from 2020 - $100
5. City Taxes due in June - $267

Total debt balance - $3,664

***Why do you have so little in your bank account?*** 

&amp;#x200B;

Within this year alone, the last 6 months I managed to go from $11,506.05 in debts with crazy interest rates to lowering it to $2,990. I aggressively paid it off combined with handling other expenses within the last 3 months. Between February and April I put down $4,000.

&amp;#x200B;

With that said, which debts should I start tackling? I'm hesitant to pay anything right now because I have no idea how soon I'll get back to working and when unemployment insurance kicks in.

*Ten years ago, in April 2011, Satoshi Nakamoto sent his last known message to Mike Hearn, stating that he had ""moved on to other things"" and that Bitcoin was ""in good hands"". Satoshi left the development with Gavin Andresen and a group of contributors and left the Bitcoin community for good. Pete Rizzo wrote The Last Days of Satoshi to answer the fundamental questions about Bitcoin's early history and its creator. How did he run the project? And why did he have to leave? In this episode, we discuss Satoshi's final days, his contribution to Bitcoin, the project's transition to decentralisation, and why his disappearance was inevitable.*

*Vitalik Buterin is co-creator of Ethereum and ether, which is a cryptocurrency that is currently the second-largest digital currency after bitcoin. Ethereum has a lot of interesting technical ideas that are defining the future of blockchain technology, and Vitalik is one of the most brilliant people innovating this space today.*

*Vitalik Buterin (@VitalikButerin) is the creator of Ethereum. He first discovered blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies through Bitcoin in 2011, and was immediately excited by the technology and its potential. He co-founded Bitcoin magazine in September 2011, and after two and a half years looking at what the existing blockchain technology and applications had to offer, wrote the Ethereum white paper in November 2013. He now leads Ethereum’s research team, working on future versions of the Ethereum protocol. In 2014, Vitalik was a recipient of the two-year Thiel Fellowship, tech billionaire Peter Thiel’s project that awards $100,000 to 20 promising innovators under 20 so they can pursue their inventions in lieu of a post-secondary institution.*

*Vitalik Buterin comes to the Bankless to discuss a number of topics surrounding Proof of Stake. We begin discussing the Beacon Chain launch, and the Ethereum's road so far up to this point. We also discuss the theory and thought-process behind Proof of Stake. Vitalik recently wrote a blog piece 'Why Proof of Stake', and we walk through this piece with him.

*On today's episode, we have the expert, Charles Hoskinson, founder of Cardano and co-founder of Ethereum. We discuss the challenges of cryptocurrency and he shares an enlightening perspective on how blockchain technology fosters enfranchisement. I loved hearing about 'building something that makes sense for the little guy as much as the big guy' — as Charles would say. He pulls back the curtain on trust and transparency in the marketplace, and we get the origin stories behind Cardano and its ecosystem's namesakes.*

*In this episode, we talked to Charles Hoskinson from Cardano. Charles is the founder of IOHK, the company behind the product Cardano, which is one of the most highly advanced blockchains and actively developed crypto products in the space. Part of what makes Cardano so special is the peer-review process their development goes through. We learn why this is the best approach, even if it takes longer. And also, that there may be an advantage of being the last to market in your sector, as well. We discussed a whole variety of fascinating topics, from how to construct a company to work remotely yet efficiently, to the underlying problems in Ethereum 2.0, how the naming scheme for Cardano eras came to be, and so much more. He also revealed that the main use case Cardano hopes to address is the lack of reliable digital identity around the world. He’s been giving TED talks on this subject since 2013, and working hard to make headway on a solution. Charles gives us an update on the roadmap for Cardano going forward, as well as his thoughts on the political situation in Hong Kong, where IOHK is based out of.*

*There's an irony with crypto. While so much of it is ostensibly about circumventing legacy finance, many of the most important pieces of crypto infrastructure are centralized financial entities. For example, the newly public Coinbase holds fiat currency and is subject to numerous regulations. Enter decentralized exchanges. A new breed of trading venues has been built to enable trading directly upon a blockchain, allowing assets to be exchanged without any custodial requirements, permission, or even accounts. It's a totally different model of trading and market structure. On this episode, we speak with Hayden Adams, the creator of the Uniswap Protocol, which powers the world's largest decentralized exchange, to explain how it all works.*

On a recent episode, we spoke with one of the creators of the largest decentralized crypto exchange, UniSwap. But what's it like to trade this stuff? On this episode, we speak with Aaron Lammer — the host of the new podcast Exit Scam — who's recently been DeFi-pilled and now yield farms and trades on Uniswap and other blockchain-based exchanges.

*In this episode we speak with “Red”, Community Manager and local legend at Harvest Finance (FARM). Red is a yield farming expert, and he gives us a comprehensive 101 on the subject. He also talks about how Harvest Finance is the leading solution to maximizing yield in crypto. We attack the question of “what is DeFi and why does it matter” in a few different ways. We discuss the beginnings of DeFi with the birth of Andre Cronje’s Yearn Finance (YFI) and the philosophy behind “fair launches” (as opposed to the “pre-mines” and ICOs of the old days). We discuss the differences between DeFi projects and yield farms, while highlighting both red and green flags along the way. We address the topic of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), and what governance will look like in the future. We close the conversation with a discussion focused on crypto communities and what makes them unique.*

CryptoCurrency,Is It Time to Buy the Dip?,"# ""Cryptocurrencies have gone on sale, and investors may be wondering what comes next.

It's been a stress-filled month for cryptocurrency investors. Major sell-offs started after **Tesla** CEO Elon Musk stated that the company would no longer accept **Bitcoin** (CRYPTO:BTC) as payment for its vehicles, citing environmental concerns about the energy needed to mine tokens. News that China would take steps to discourage mining and prevent businesses in the country from adopting cryptocurrencies triggered additional sell-offs across the space.

With crypto prices recently seeing a substantial pullback, we put together a panel of three Motley Fool contributors and asked each member if now looks like the right time to buy. Read on for their takes on whether the recent crypto crash has presented a big buying opportunity. 

## What's prompting the big crypto swings, again? 

[**Keith Noonan**](https://www.fool.com/author/6956/)**:** Elon Musk is clearly an influential figure and has some incredible successes to his name, and it's possible his involvement in the cryptocurrency space provides indicators about long-term adoption trends. However, in my opinion, the market-moving power of Musk's tweets reflects a lack of soundness in crypto as an asset class. 

While most cryptocurrencies are decentralized in terms of who controls the individual coin, Musk's comments have apparently been enough to trigger big swings for Bitcoin and the overall crypto market. Many coins are also more ""centralized"" than some investors think. As Musk himself noted, flooding in China's Xinjiang region resulted in a dramatic reduction of the Bitcoin hash rate. As another example, roughly 100 accounts control the large majority of **Dogecoin**'s (CRYPTO:DOGE) total coin supply. 

There are already thousands of cryptocurrencies on the market, and new ones are entering the fray all the time. Many of these tokens are essentially indistinguishable in terms of utility, and there's not much to stop even the more specialized cryptocurrencies from being disrupted by new entrants in the space.  

Here's another issue: While the recent sell-offs are significant and surely painful for some investors, they're also not that big in the scheme of things. **Ethereum**'s (CRYPTO:ETH) price has climbed 1,150% over the last year, while Dogecoin has exploded 13,310% across the same stretch. Bitcoin is still up roughly 300% over the last year and stands as the single-best performing asset of the last decade. 

On the most basic level, value is subjective. If enough people believe in something and continue to attract new adherents to their way of thinking, that can drive the value of almost anything higher. However, when identifying potential investment candidates, I usually try to look for more objective metrics and trend indicators that paint a picture of *why* people will be likely to ascribe increasing value to an asset or equity. I struggle to find those characteristics in most cryptocurrencies, and dramatic volatility in the space stemming from seemingly minor catalysts makes me concerned that the overall asset class is still due for a much bigger pullback. 

## Currencies can't trade like growth investments forever

[**James Brumley**](https://www.fool.com/author/4549/)**:** I understand the logic. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Dogecoin have dished out incredible gains. Just when it looked like they couldn't go any higher, they went higher. Their recent sell-offs seem out of the ordinary.

The problem is, nobody can actually explain why these sell-offs took shape. They just happened without explanation, much the same way cryptos climbed for so long without explanation.

This unexplained volatility underscores the gaping, philosophical flaw of cryptos. That is, although they're being touted as an alternative to fiat (government-issued) currency, they're being treated -- and traded -- like growth investments. It's a recipe for the market turning into a proverbial Wild West, which it has.

Sure, non-fiat currencies are appealing in an environment where governments appear to be losing control of their piece of the global economy. I also recognize physical money is the past while secure, digital money is the future. But at least the world's central banks are able to maintain some semblance of price stability for their respective currencies. Nobody's attempting to hold the prices of cryptos steady; nobody's even in a position to do so. That's why they're not reliable stores of value, which is the whole point of holding a particular currency.

So, buy on this dip if you must; I'd certainly never say you can't make money with them. Just recognize you're only speculating on how other people will arbitrarily feel about cryptocurrencies at some point in the future. That's little more than a coin toss.

## No safety in these numbers

[**Eric Volkman**](https://www.fool.com/author/4067/)**:** I don't feel cryptocurrencies are attractive at current rates, no matter how many bargain hunters claim they're oversold (for the record, the crypto of all cryptos -- Bitcoin -- is down a queasy 34% from its mid-May peak; others have also plummeted).

One very good reason to continue staying away is a concern that continues to dog cryptocurrencies: safety and security. Take good old-fashioned hacking. While it's nearly impossible for a team of cyber pirates to raid the ever-lengthening distributed blockchain that undergirds any serious cryptocurrency, other facets of the system are vulnerable to attack.

Remember Mt. Gox? That was the Bitcoin exchange that hackers penetrated in 2014, stealing 850,000 Bitcoins. If the heist were to occur today, that pile would be worth a dizzying $33.5 billion. And at the time, Mt. Gox was the king of the world's Bitcoin exchanges, but that hack made it a future trivia question. Less than four years after its launch, Mt. Gox was a goner.

While security has advanced since then, the crypto exchanges remain vulnerable. Last August, researchers at the Black Hat security conference found not one, not two, but three methods through which hackers could make effective attacks against such platforms. This, despite the billions of dollars and immense brainpower and resources plowed into securing these sites.

Another classic means of separating assets from their owners, phishing, was responsible for the theft of roughly $200 million worth of crypto assets from various exchanges. That scam had been running for *two years* when it hit the headlines in mid-2020.

While any financial asset is vulnerable to a phishing attempt, the volatility and sky-high dollar prices for certain cryptos make their holders particularly juicy targets these days.

(Phishing, for those unfamiliar, is the method by which a scammer impersonates a person in a position of authority to ask for sensitive information from a victim. Once obtained, that information is used to access valuable property for theft.)

Another security concern is the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies. This is a key selling point for such assets, as governments, central banks, and other important policy makers can't tinker with them for political or economic advancement. 

But the flip side of that is they are subject to worryingly little regulation. The U.S. banking system, for instance, has a clutch of regulatory agencies watching and protecting it, from the federal level on down. To name one, traditional banking accounts held by an individual are automatically insured for up to $250,000 by the Federal Insurance Deposit Corporation (FDIC).

There's no U.S. public agency that insures $250,000 worth of Bitcoin.

So no, I don't think cryptos are a buy on weakness right now. In fact I'm not convinced they're a buy, period.""

I'm 22(M) and I'll be officially graduating from my undergrad university this August. Like most students, I had taken student loan at 6.9% interest rate to finish my college which covered 100% of my tuition,housing etc.   
I have to say I've been really luck and able to earn 100% of that amount in the past few months and my job starts this July so I think I'm at a good spot financially. Adding to that, I got accepted into a master's program at a university in the USA and I'll be moving there next year.   
Unfortunately I'll have to take a loan again and I'm confused whether I should pay off my existing student loan from the undergrad or use the savings for my masters which is going to cost me at least $60k. I would really appreciate any advice on this matter. Thank you.",finance
CryptoCurrency,Banks’ Own Private Currencies in 19th-Century America,"**""Before the Civil War local banks issued their own money. It was totally legit, too.**

The rise and fall in the price of Bitcoin based on Elon Musk’s tweets is a reminder that most people view the private digital currency more as an investment than usable money. But there was a time in the United States when private money was a very viable option. Before the Civil War and the printing of the first greenbacks, historian Stephen Mihm writes, hundreds of local banks issued “[thousands of different kinds of currency in a bewildering variety of denominations and designs](https://www.jstor.org/stable/25473238?mag=banks-own-private-currencies-in-19th-century-america),” which became the “de facto currency of the country.”

Before the American Revolution, economic historian Howard Bodenhorn explains, Britain didn’t send enough [small-denomination copper and silver coins](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2077808?mag=banks-own-private-currencies-in-19th-century-america) to the colonies to meet local needs. So colonial loan offices and land banks issued bills of credit for under 20 shillings. Minting of coins remained limited well into the nineteenth century, and local commercial banks picked up the slack. They took in gold and gave out bank notes in return, including some in very small denominations.

[If a bank went belly-up, its currency would become unredeemable and worthless.](https://daily.jstor.org/banks-own-private-currencies-in-19th-century-america/#)

Bodenhorn writes that people used this paper currency in everyday transactions. But it couldn’t circulate too far from the issuing bank, where the notes could be redeemed. Merchants located at a distance often only accepted them at a discount or wouldn’t take them at all. To make the notes more useful, some country banks made deals to get their counterparts in nearby cities to redeem them.

Buyers and sellers had to be careful about the bills they used, Bodenhorn writes. If a bank went belly-up, its currency would become unredeemable and worthless. So merchants and consumers often used brokers, who monitored the quality of banknotes.

Another danger was counterfeiting. Much as the federal government does today, banks went to a great deal of effort to make their bills hard to copy, using engraving, watermarking, and distinctive images.

Mihm writes that banks’ demand for distinctive note designs drove the creation of a new printing process called siderography, which allowed printers to mix and match design elements. A border, a picture, and the phrase “promise to pay” would each have its own steel plate. Designing a new note was just a matter of combining a number of such elements in a distinctive way.

Among the most common images banks chose were factories and workers (in the North) and enslaved farm workers (in the South). Some banks also came up with more unusual imagery, like scenes from classical mythology.

After the Civil War, Congress effectively ended the printing of bank notes in the North and, more gradually, the South. The government-created paper money that followed made up for its dull uniformity by being far simpler to use than the bank notes of the nineteenth century—or, as it would turn out, the cryptocurrencies of the twenty-first.""

CryptoCurrency,Crypto is not a Ponzi scheme. Here's why.,"**TLDR: I've been seeing many people calling the crypto-sphere a Ponzi Scheme. It's simply not true, and this is obvious if you look at what a Ponzi Scheme really is. They are scams disguised as low risk, high reward investments that rely on the trust of their ""investors"". This is contrary to the ideals of crypto. Don't get me wrong, there definitely are crypto scams out there, but it's wrong to right off the entire space because of a few bad apples.**

With the recent crypto boom (and subsequent correction), I've seen the ""crypto is a Ponzi Scheme"" narrative being pushed more and more across various platforms. I've even seen Redditors on this sub ""admitting"" that crypto is just a big Ponzi Scheme, and that they're simply taking advantage of it.

I wanted to put these claims/rumours to rest with this short (it turned out to be long, whoops!) write-up on what Ponzi schemes are, and why crypto is not one. So without further ado, let's get into it!

# What is a Ponzi Scheme?

Let's look at Investopedia's definition:

&gt;A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investing scam promising high rates of return with little risk to investors. A Ponzi scheme generates returns for earlier investors with money taken from later investors.

And here's an excerpt from Wikipedia's article on Ponzi Schemes:

&gt;The scheme leads victims to believe that profits are coming from legitimate business activity (e.g., product sales or successful investments), and they remain unaware that other investors are the source of funds.

So basically, a Ponzi Scheme is a scam where investors are made to believe that they are making a solid, reliable, low risk investment, but in reality their money isn't invested in anything. Instead, the operator of the scheme steals their money, and gives them fake statements. When an investor wants to take profits, the operator takes on more investors and uses their investment to cover those ""profits"".

# Why people call crypto a Ponzi Scheme:

Most of the claims and rumours I've seen seemed to be built around the fact that Ponzi Schemes work by paying off new investors with the money from old investors. People seem to equate this to the fact that crypto prices go up when new investors flood in, and go down when people cash out. **This does not make crypto a Ponzi Scheme. This is simply supply/demand at play in the market.** When there are more people selling that there are people buying (supply is greater than demand), the price goes down. When there are more people buying that there are people selling (demand is greater than supply), the price goes up.

Using this logic, we could also call the stock market (or any other market) a Ponzi Scheme. It just doesn't make sense.

# Why crypto is NOT a Ponzi Scheme:

Let's take a look at some key characteristics of a Ponzi Scheme (per Investopedia):

* **A guaranteed promise of high returns with little risk.** Anyone who's even remotely familiar with the crypto space knows that nothing is guaranteed, and we are about as far from low-risk as you can get. Even our household ""low-risk"" asset, Bitcoin, is extremely volatile compared to traditional investments. We all know that these are purely speculative ""investments"", and we assume the associated risk.
* **A consistent flow of returns regardless of market conditions.** It might seem like this is applicable when we're in the heart of the bull market, but I think the last few weeks have shown us that crypto can in fact go down.
* **Investments that have not been registered with the** **Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).** Alright, you got me there. In all seriousness, this space is a bit of a wild west that's in need of some regulation for exactly this reason. This adds to the risk associated with crypto, which brings us back to the first point.
* **Investment strategies that are secret or described as too complex to explain.** One of the main motivations in crypto was transparency, and not having to trust a central authority. A Ponzi Scheme relies on the fact that investors trust that the scheme operator has their best interests at heart. This is simply antithetical to what crypto was created for.
* **Clients not allowed to view official paperwork for their investment.** This one is less applicable to crypto as a whole, and more to individual exchanges. But again, this whole space highly values transparency and hates the word ""trust"", so any fishy business is quickly snuffed out by the community.
* **Clients facing difficulties removing their money.** Now this is an interesting one. While this doesn't really have anything to do with crypto itself, we definitely see this happening on exchanges every once in a while. So I guess you could make a case for certain exchanges being of questionable legitimacy (I'm looking at you, RH), but this isn't a reflection on crypto itself.

# A few important notes:

I think it's important to acknowledge that there definitely are crypto scams. Any emerging, unregulated space is a breeding ground for new types of schemes and scams. What I'm trying to get across in this post is that Satoshi Nakamoto was not some evil mastermind, and that most cryptocurrencies are not Ponzi Schemes. **There definitely are scams out there, so do your due diligence and don't invest in things you don't understand. Always remember: ""Not your keys, not your coins.""**

Also, Bitcoin (and by extension crypto) was not meant to be a speculative investment vehicle. It was created to be a *peer-to-peer, electronic cash system*. Most people that like to bash crypto's legitimacy as an investment tend to ignore the fact that **it was not designed to be an investment in the first place**.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,How Aggressively Should I Pay off Student Loans When Considering Opportunity Costs?,"Hi All,

I have a question about how aggressively I should pay off my loans when considering the opportunity costs of not putting that money towards investments.

Initially, I planned to refinance and then pay off my loans as aggressively as possible since I'm sitting at the fed gov student loans rate of 7%. But my school set us up with a student-loan expert, and he recommended that I don't refinance and make minimum payments on my loans. And then to put the rest of my money into investments/savings. I always planned to put money in 401k and market-tracking etfs, but I've also always assumed that I should be paying off my debt as quickly as possible. Is his advice right? If not, what percentage of my income should I be putting towards student loans.

Facts: I'm a recent law school graduate with roughly $80k in debt. I've put away about $25,000 in savings and will have an income of $190k once I start my job in a few months. But I do live in NYC so after-tax income is roughly $125k. And rent is about $2,200. I'm single and 24, so I have minimum fixed expenses.

personalfinance,What to do with 20k when I've done what's suggested in the Pf Wiki?,"Note: I had to change the title from ""Where should I put my cash when I've maxed out my 401(k) and Roth IRA, and paid off all my debts?"" because it kept getting auto-flagged as a success story. Those are the steps I'm referring to in this new title.

I have $20,000 in a ""high-yield"" savings account that I'd like to move, given the terrible interest rates. The Wiki and situation-specific advice (e.g. windfalls) recommend that I pay off all my debts, max out my 401(k) and Roth IRA etc. However, I've already done those things, so I'm not sure what to do with this extra cash. So far, I've had conflicting advice: some have suggested buying and holding individual stocks; others advised that I invest in an index fund. In addition to this, I have the following other assets:

* $10,000 for emergencies, in a ""high-yield"" savings account (not part of the $20,000).
* $22,430 in a Roth IRA, which I'll max out every year going forward. I have an 'aggressive' portfolio of 80% in FNILX and 20% in FZILX. I figure I'll switch to a more conservative, date-targeted fund as I age towards retirement.
* $14,000 in my 401(k). I make the maximum contribution every month.
* $8,400 in stock. I own one stock in each of about 70 different companies. I basically buy whatever Motley Fool's Stock Picker tells me to and I've had good returns so far. In these, I'm really just trying to earn a better rate than a high-yield savings account.
* I've also invested $5,500 across 37 cryptocurrencies over the years. Their current value is $14,000, but as it's crypto, it could be $0 tomorrow.

I'm 33 and make $54,000/year before tax. I donate 10% of my salary to charity, so my take-home income is a bit lower, but I'm still able to save about $1,000 a month. Right now I use that cash to buy individual stocks (the Motley recommendations) or more crypto (though I don't plan to invest much more in the latter). I'm not looking to buy a house for another few years, as I'll probably move cities at some point soon, and I often move every few years for work. So, while immediate-term liquidity isn't very important, I'd prefer to have at least short-term access to this $20,000 in case my circumstances change. That makes me anxious to put this in volatile assets like stock.

Any advice on what to do with the $20k, and the $1k that I'm able to save each month, would be very much appreciated. I'm at a bit of a loss here. Thanks.",finance

1. Cash out Account A, pay the penalty, pay off debt, rebuild savings
2. Roll Account A into Account B and take loan from Account B
3. Cash out Account A, pay penalty, pay off debt, roll remainder into Account B (is this even possible?)
4. Roll Account A into Account B, suck it up and pay off debt over time while accruing interest

[The US has already hit 130% in 2020](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GFDEGDQ188S). And it is only poised to grow over time, with more and more debt being taken on in 2021. In historical terms, we are presently flying in uncharted territory. Will USA become only the 2nd country out of 53 to come out of such a high debt/GDP ratio without defaulting? 

Its highly unlikely that the US will actually default on its debt repayments, because unlike most other countries in the list above, most of global debt is today denominated in USD, and the US govt can print more and more USD to fulfil all their debt obligations. 

So what happens is that the value of USD will continue falling off a cliff. It has already lost a huge % (&gt;90%) of its spending power over the years, and with government debt shooting up to uncontrollable levels, the value of USD will only weaken. And with that, the value of all your savings also goes down. The destruction of wealth. 

The only alternatives to escape this certainty i.e destruction of USD's buying power are real assets which are in demand, like gold, cryptocurrencies and real estate. While it is definitely possible that if the FED and US economy implodes, other markets including bullion and bitcoin/crypto crash together with it in the near term, but crypto markets are likely to see a very strong reversal because the fundamentals of crypto are the exact opposite of what the FED does.",cryptocurrency
Forex,Can someone help me understand something regarding interest rates and inflation?,"So my understanding is that raising interest rates makes a currency more valuable, but it also leads to inflation which makes a currency less valuable. So why do intrest rate increases attract foreign investment, when they can lead to inflation? Wouldn't lower interest rates be more desireable since it would be cheaper to borrow money?",finance

personalfinance,Student Loans W/O Cosigner,"Hey Y'all

I am an incoming freshman and I'm looking for private student loans to cover the $6000 outstanding COA after aid, grants, fed loans, scholarships, personal savings, and such. The issue is, though, that I do not have a cosigner because my family is in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy and can't legally sign onto any type of loan. 

I've tried to go through loan places that don't require a cosigner, but I've been denied by everyone. (My credit score is 680, but my AGI is only $5400 since I work a part time job as a high school senior.)

CryptoCurrency,Hidden Inflation,"The government here in America says that inflation is in check - the Fed says inflation is around 1-3%. It feels like this is purposefully misleading to the public.

While it’s true that consumer goods like TVs, electronics, flights, etc have gone down over time, things like housing, education, and medical care have sky rocketed the past several decades.

It seems like the government feels that as long as the average American can afford TV and food, then it will distract them from realizing that they will never be able to afford a house with their low wage job.

If you look at this chart - https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/exports/price-changes-in-consumer-goods-and-services-in-the-usa-1997-2017.svg

You can see that consumer goods have plummeted but housing and college have gone up massively.

The issue is that owning a house and going to college are some of the best ways of creating meaningful generational wealth, which compounds over time. If the things that matter are becoming significantly more expensive, then how can you believe that inflation isn’t happening?

It just so happens that TV, alcohol, and food are great for subduing the population while they get screwed. The longer you go without investing in a house or other nest eggs, then faster you will be en route to an even lower wealth bracket. 


TLDR:
I don’t think we’re in a housing or education bubble, I just think that the dollar is becoming worthless and global goods prices are following, which makes it seem like inflation isn’t happening. Crypto and hard assets seem to be the only way to fight it.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,"My Student Loan Situation, and my path through it (Just wanting some advice.)","Hey everybody.

   I guess I just wanna preface this by saying, I understand that I have not made the best financial decisions throughout my college term. But I am currently, where I am currently, and the best thing I can do is just plan for the future and do my best.

That being said:

Quick background on my situation. 21. Last semester of undergrad starting in August, and so I'll be graduating in December with a Bachelor in Business Management. Overall I'm at about $120,000 in **private** student loan debt. For most of my education I studied abroad in Europe, at schools that didn't participate in the federal loan program, and so private was the only way I could go minus scholarships and anything else. 

I have decent work experience, If I were to find a full time job straight out of my bachelor, I know that my student loan payment (probably refinanced to as long as god damned possible), combined with cost of living would stretch any salary I would get to it's absolute maximum. 

Knowing this, I've developed a plan to get a masters that will put me into the field that I actually want to be in, and also put myself into a situation where I have plenty of room to breathe and live on breadcrumbs to pay off these loans as fast as possible, and here's that plan in detail:

* I'm planning on getting a master's degree in the United Kingdom for Software Development (always have planned this after business). It's a conversion course (so designed for people not with a bachelor in the subject) and my thinking is combining software development masters with a business bachelors will put me in a good position to get some decent jobs in tech companies filling any variety of developer or business role. (This program also has a 2 year option over the standard 1 year, that comes with a work placement, and so that could be a very good way to get into a position to start earning income for the next part of the strategy) 
* I have $120,000 in private loan debt, IBR isn't available and that's...obviously a lot of money. My current plan is to pay for my graduate school with scholarships (obviously) and then take out the maximum amount of direct graduate loan and direct plus loan and use these amounts to pay off large chunks of my private loan debt. 
* While using graduate federal loans to pay off my debt. survive on as bare of rations as I can. Ramen noodles. Bottled creek water. etc. I plan to get a job ASAP in the U.K, but student visas are limited to 20 hours ( a week ) during term and 40 hours during break. Although this isn't monumental, any money I can use to survive on and to throw the rest at the private loan is the goal.
* Upon graduation with my masters. (Either 1 or 2 years depending on above.) I will seek employment within the U.K (Post-study work visa for an additional 2 years) and hopefully in this time either find a company to sponsor my skilled-worker visa or, reach the 5 years required to apply for settle there.
* After I graduate with my first masters, I will see the current balance of my private loans and decide what to do from there. If they're still really high (and there is a good chance they will be) I will seek out an additional part-time masters course while I work full time In the U.K. The goal being cheap tuition, and so more of those graduate loans can go to paying off my private loans (Essentially a conversion, of sorts.) An important thing to note is I have 4 year maximum from the start of grad school before payments begin, so I need to convert these as fast as possible.
* At the end of all of this, the goal is to have my private loans down to a level I feel comfortable being able to make the payments, and then a fulltime job in the U.K, hopefully in a field and situation where I can make decent money with my qualifications.
* When I get to that point, loan-taking will end, and payments will begin. Graduate loans will be put on IBR and private loans...are private loans. Obviously I will opt to pay off the remaining balance on the latter first. Regarding the graduate loans, IBR plans are based off of AGI to my knowledge, which thanks to my work abroad and the foreign earned income exclusion will be at zero while I make under $100,000 abroad. This means I will get the choice when and how much to pay on my graduate loans. (Yes interest still builds, I am aware of this and will begin paying as much as possible, as soon as possible.)
* Finally, regarding my post-graduate employment. Live like I have .05 cents in the bank account at all times. Even if i'm making decent money. The cheapest housing I can find (woo flatmates) The cheapest food I can eat. Just for a year or two. Every extra dollar and penny goes to these loans. Also the establishment of a fat emergency savings fund.
* At the end of this entire ordeal. I will hopefully be debt free. I will hopefully have settled residency in the U.K, and I will be in a position to where I can have a good job, and from there start building myself up. 

Note: (I mention the U.K as where I'll live and work post graduate. This isn't necessarily 100% the case, if I see an opportunity to work in the E.U or another country, with a solid visa path to keep me there. I will also consider / take it. But for my IBR payments to be $0 under $100,000, it needs to be earned foreign.)

Note 2: (If people ask me **why** the u.k specifically, it's because on top of having many, many good friends there. I've done a decent bit of volunteer work as well and really fell in love with the country. To each their own right?)

So. 

This is my current plan. I know after re-reading it, it sounds ridiculous and complex. But student loan debt and the system we're in is ridiculous. And it's complex all by itself. And while there is no guarantee I'll get that amazing job in the U.K. As long as I can get those private loans converted, and earn my income in a foreign country. My payments via IBR will be zero. 

I have always dealt with situations in my life in a ""plan"" format. Make a plan. Make 3 contingencies and go from there. I can't say that this will go 100% perfect and all of this will work out. But in my mind. I'm halfway through the tunnel, and the path behind me is blocked. I can't go back. So the only way is forward.

I'd love opinions, thoughts, comments, etc. Maybe I'm overlooking something simple, that will ruin this plan and f\*ck my whole sh\*t, but if that is the case I'd like to know it now to prepare. 

Thanks all.

personalfinance,Selecting a New Bank To Set Myself Up for the Best Rates on A Future Mortgage,"Long story short, my checking/savings accounts are at HSBC. Due to their recent decision to get out of the retail banking business in the U.S., I either have to allow my accounts to be transferred to the bank(s) they sold their business to in Q1 next year, or join up with a new bank. I'm planning on the latter.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also planning on moving to LA later this year, so I've been doing some basic research on local community banks and credit unions there. I don't really want to do business with big banks anymore, but I would be open to an online credit union like Alliant.

&amp;#x200B;

My current needs are just a basic checking and savings account. But I want to know more about selecting a bank/credit union that will help me best position myself to get a good interest rate on a mortgage a few years down the road. I know about all the personal things under my control like my credit score and things like that. But I've seen other factors mentioned online about getting a mortgage at the same place where you bank, have multiple accounts, maybe a credit card etc.  


Do those factors tend to make a big difference during the loan process and getting the best rate possible with banks/credit unions? Or do they tend to be overblown and it's best to just shop around for the best rates regardless of where you bank? Thanks for any advice/info you have.",finance

The name Vitalik Buterin speaks for itself, he's an icon. Envisioned Ethereum as a massive platform but he was roughly the same age when Misterliberty made that post.   Was Vitalik interested in, or pondering ideas about decentralization 3-4 years before he envisioned ETH? 


It's a tough call, surely Vitalik went out and made it happen but we are only comparing foresight, not motivation.

solar,[SF Bay Area] Going through Sunpower for a 9.0kW system at $38K net of tax credit and financing over 25 years. I have a couple of questions and would appreciate some advice!,"Hi All,

cardano,Cardano Rumor Rundown MAY 30 2021,"Hey Everyone!

Let's go...

Newly covered today: 

1. Professor Aggelos Kiayias recently dropped a video explaining exactly how Mithril (neckbeard dungeon master talk for elf armor) is going to allow for perfect Cardano (ADA) wallets that combine the ease of use and convenience of light wallets with the trustlessness of full node wallets. We also learned exactly how Mithril is going to work. [https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk](https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk)
2. In proof-of-work, bootstrapping can be done with blockheaders. This won’t do in proof-of-stake since we need information about stakeholder distribution to confirm block validity.
3. Mithril fixes this by being a cryptographic construction that enables a population of stakeholders to issue a signature consistent with certain constraints.
4. For Mithril to work in proof-of-stake, it needs three crucial properties: 1) it needs to enforce a threshold ratio of stakeholders before the signature is issued; 2) the pre-signature fragments must be independently verified and subject to public aggregation; and 3) it must be efficient in the sense that the final signature is of constant size and is logarithmically dependent on the # of stakeholders.
5. Stakeholders will issue special Mithril keys along with the normal cryptographic key material. Then at regular intervals, full nodes will test whether they can produce a pre-signature fragment. Only a random subset of stakeholders will be eligible to produce a pre-signature fragment.  When a sufficient # of pre-signature fragments have been issued by eligible stakeholders then it will be possible to aggregate the fragments into a final signature. 
6. This will be a checkpoint that will be verifiable with respect to previous check points all the way back to the genesis block. Such checkpoints will be cryptographic commitments of the relevant UTXOs.  
7. Since the checkpoints will be trustless, a light client (i.e. light wallet) will only need to verify the sequence of checkpoints up to the current time to trustlessly bootstrap.

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. I don’t know if everyone watched the last few minutes of the Africa Special. But, I think a lot of people missed the section where John O’Connor said the goal of Cardano in Africa is to issue 100 MILLION digital identities in the next two years. To give you some idea of scale here, adapools.org shows a highest ever daily number of new wallets at around 71k. If we onboard 100 Million people via digital identity over two years that would be 136,986 people per day. ETH only has 150MM unique wallets to date. [https://youtu.be/yRjj662kJsk?t=8615](https://youtu.be/yRjj662kJsk?t=8615) [https://adapools.org/analysis-query/wallets](https://adapools.org/analysis-query/wallets) [https://etherscan.io/chart/address](https://etherscan.io/chart/address)
2. John also mentioned that all of the 100k subscribers to World Mobile in Zanzibar this year will have digital identities on Atala Prism. They will also be offering so-called “RealFi” loans by Q1 of next year that will be made via Cardano liquidity and will act as a bridge to real world value.

3. Charlie Munger thinks crypto is “disgusting”. That’s a wonderful thing because it tells you how early you are. This is especially true in Cardano which is a project that leads with empathy for the developing world. Will he still call that disgusting if we’ve brought financial inclusiveness to an entire continent in five or ten years. Probably he won’t say anything because he won’t have lived that long. But, you get the point.

9. Doge Mania might be hitting a new peak (as a cultural artifact at least) tonight with Elon’s appearance on SNL. There are many different perspectives you can take on how this might impact ADA. I find the following two the most interesting: 1) if the Doge pump is followed by an inevitable crash it could sour a giant group of new adopters on crypto; or 2) it might be a gateway drug that will turn a large group of new adopters on to better projects.

14. ADA is the most crypto of all cryptos. George of CryptosRUs pointed out in a recent video that he couldn’t find any trace of a VC firm owning Cardano in its portfolio in his search of the categories section on CMC. This makes sense if you know Cardano. Would freedom and decentralization loving Satoshi not throw up a little in his mouth to find out that VC ownership of cryptos was a metric people would care about in 2021? The lack of VC stake in the very decentralized and freedom loving Cardano only adds to our already iron-clad claim on the mantle of the most crypto of all crypto projects. Our ecosystem never sought to attract VC money that would only centralize ownership in a smaller number of hands. This doesn’t even address the current extreme centralization of block validation in BTC and ETH.

16. Cardano saw a new challenger enter the scene with Internet Computer (ICP) debuting very high on the CoinMarketCap charts. However, a look into ICP makes one question whether they are really in the Gen. 3 Blockchain race at all given that available information indicates the blockchain runs via datacenters hosting standardized hardware and that those datacenters can only join the network with the permission of the “Network Nervous System”. You could say that the winner of the Gen. 3 Blockchain race needs to solve the blockchain trilemma of decentralization, security, and scalability. If that’s true, then it’s arguable that ICP is not even competing in the decentralization leg of the race. [https://youtu.be/zHl-oVPoX88?t=97](https://youtu.be/zHl-oVPoX88?t=97)

27. We are seeing some small pools retiring. We’ll obviously see more and more of this as time marches on. But, here’s a salute to the small pools that gave it a go! This SPO also brought us poolpeek.com which we have covered here before.

28. John O’Connor on CNBCAfrica! He gave a really good explanation of how Africa with it’s already very high adoption of mobile payment wallets can leapfrog the legacy payment systems currently in use in more developed countries. He also reiterated that Cardano will expand to five countries this year and 20 next year! [https://youtu.be/RET8hIQQLUA](https://youtu.be/RET8hIQQLUA)
29. This tweet by [u/TheADAApe](https://www.reddit.com/u/TheADAApe/) pretty much sums it all up. When people ask me how I knew, I’m going to point them to this post. [https://twitter.com/ArmySpies/status/1393606491110662146](https://twitter.com/ArmySpies/status/1393606491110662146)

39. The Cardano Foundation is out to do something incredible with supply chains as described in the fireside chat! In his previous Cardano Live appearance, Frederik Gregaard, CF CEO, also expressed a very healthy and sustainable perspective on what DeFi should become. He compared the current state of DeFi to just moving funds from your left pocket to your right pocket and taking profit. [https://youtu.be/d8uPMZplfeM](https://youtu.be/d8uPMZplfeM) [https://youtu.be/xbMSQUA1lss](https://youtu.be/xbMSQUA1lss)
40. The ISO model entering the capital formation toolbox in Cardano is going to make the stake pool game extremely interesting with SPOs scrambling to find the right balance between rewarding ADA and giving their delegators other things like tokens. Some stake pools could even become like portfolio funds with relationships with many different projects the tokens of which are given to delegators. Babel Fees could also play a role here for smart SPOs as they may allow access to a wide variety of tokens in the ecosystem that could be used to reward delegators with a sort of index fund exposure to a wide variety of Cardano projects.
41. May Cardano 360 coming one week from today (always the last Thursday of the month). [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1395117067960045569](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1395117067960045569)

43. The Cardano Foundation has released the full video of the Fireside Chat with Eva and Fred. Lots of questions answered on a variety of fronts. Very interesting remarks including that in discussions with financial institutions, Fred has found they are interested in exposure to the alpha provided by the asset class in general, tokenization of assets, and the yield provided by staking rewards. Fred counters that they SHOULD be far more interested in the Cardano standard including the concepts of reference accounts, programmability of money, and transaction metadata.

44. In a video press release yesterday, the Fed finally admitted that it’s moving toward a central bank digital currency (just like every other central bank). This will eventually be impactful on Cardano and every other crypto ecosystem. [https://youtu.be/WOAQxpG79Ag](https://youtu.be/WOAQxpG79Ag)
45. The Treasury is trying to figure out how to get cryptocurrency regulation in a headlock. This will probably go hand-in-hand with the Fed’s March toward a CBDC. Afterall, what good is all the tracking and monitoring afforded by a CBDC if it’s easier for everyone to just use a non-central bank digital currency? Tax evasion in crypto is also obviously a target problem since we know only about 800 people a year paid taxes on crypto in 2013-2015.

66. Charles is interviewed on Yahoo Finance where he explained: 1) how the lack of an obvious decentralized governance system in ETH and BTC will cripple their efforts as they attempt to scale and the founders/core developers start losing prominence, 2) the ADA EUTXO system is vastly more scaleable with it’s local state being so much more amenable to sharding than ETH’s global state system, 3) Cardano has a high willingness to bring on users in hypergrowth areas like Africa where ETH seems to have little interest, and 4) ETH does not seem to be as highly concerned with interoperability which might become highly valuable in the future.

68. The May Cardano 360 was yesterday and we had lots of updates including the Color Coding for the different stages of the testnet! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS33gRj9JYE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS33gRj9JYE)
69. Alonzo “Blue” Era Testnet (through mid June; &lt;50 user cohort) will include the basic functionality of the system for testing basic contracts . Initially the SPOs will be included, then some of the Plutus Pioneers will be allowed in, then a few of the outside development firms (Plutus Partners). The Plutus Partners will be working on specific areas including oracles, DEXs, stablecoins, NFTs, and DeFi. This will produce code and documentation that will be publicly available.
70. Alonzo “White” Era Testnet (mid June to mid July; &lt;500 user cohort) will add more Plutus Pioneers and more functionality. They will develop various dApps and there will be interaction on the user side of these dApps. They will do some benchmarking at this stage.
71. The Alonzo Hard Fork Combinator Event requires a lot of different pieces come together at the same time. But, this is not their first rodeo and they have a lot of experience with this from the ITN, Shelley, and etc.
72. Alonzo “Purple” Era Tesnet (mid July to mid August; fully public) will involve a full public network with all of the Plutus pioneers, the Rosetta Api to the exchanges, Daedalus, hardware wallets, graphQL, and full functionality. The purpose of this phase will be optimization.
73. Alonzo “Red” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will involve a new network where they can test scalability and stability.
74. Alonzo “Black” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will be the final public testnet where they will ensure they have their candidate mainnet releases ready to launch on the mainnet.
75. They are committed to making sure there is a very large group of people who are familiar with using the Alonzo testnet by the time the mainnet launches.
76. Alonzo Mainnet (August-September). It’s looking like Alonzo mainnet launch was positioned in very late August through September in the infographics. That makes me assume there is a chance of August, much better chance of September, and also some chance of October or later. This is blockchain development after all. Also, we’ve waited years. Why care about a few weeks?
77. There will be another Plutus Pioneers Cohort later this summer.
78. Marlowe Run will be a browser product that can run on mobile or desktop. It can be linked to your wallet and be used to run Cardano smart contracts simultaneously on a distributed basis across multiple user browsers. The user interface is light years ahead of anything we saw in Marlowe Meadow or the Marlowe Playground simulations. It will include a library of off-the-shelf contracts.
79. There will be a Marlowe Webinar on June 3. Register here: [https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/](https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/)
80. The ERC-20 converter was looking very intuitive and seamless in the new demo. It should be on the testnet in June.
81. Manuel Chakravarty gave a big update on Hydra (layer 2 scaling). Hydra will not require that the base layer be modified since it will be implemented via Plutus smart contracts. Hydra is actually a collection of protocols including Hydra Head and Hydra Tail. Hydra Head is a symmetric protocol where multiple participants will be online simultaneously for the whole period of the head exchanging messages. Hydra Tail is an asymmetric protocol involving a high performance server and many clients that may be mobile and could be offline for large portions of the tail’s existence. There will also be “inter head &amp; tail networking” which will allow for a network of heads and tails. They have a published research paper on Hydra Head. They are currently writing the Hydra Tail paper.
82. Hydra is distinguished from other layer 2 protocols by its isomorphic properties. This means you will be able to run any smart contract that works on the base layer in a Hydra Head! This is very special. We won’t need special purpose contracts built out just for layer 2. There are some big implications to this. Since a Hydra Head is essentially just a Plutus smart contract, this means you can run a Hydra Head inside another Hydra Head. It’s turtles all the way down, guys. It sounds like they can do this iteratively as much as they want.
83. Aggelos also gave a good presentation on the importance of “skin in the game” in resource based consensus protocols (both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake) and its effect on promotion or discouragement of centralization. He explained how Ouroboros has built-in safeguards to prevent centralization including the K parameter (currently at 500) which caps total rewards per pool and the alpha parameter (currently at 0.3) which splits rewards into a 77% piece and a 23% piece. A pool can take its share of the 77% piece based on the pool’s total stake and its share of the 23% piece based on the pledge of the SPO. A higher alpha parameter makes it less attractive for individual SPOs to proliferate multiple pools since they can’t be as leveraged on their available pledge and still get as big a share of the 23% piece. This also discourages Sybil Attacks. As Cardano on-chain governance progresses, these parameters will be controlled by the community.
84. There will be a Cardano Goguen Summit in September. It will be hybrid digital/in-person.
85. Charles is helping to bring the cryptographer who broke SHA-1 to the University of Wyoming. The Cardano funded blockchain lab there could be on the road to be a powerhouse.

CryptoCurrency,A comprehensive guide to building up your nest egg and earn passive income from your crypto. (Repost),"The last post died in new because it was stuck in a mod queue for 6 hours. So reposting it for more visibility. Would love suggestions for next week's update!

I have seen amazing responses on the last post which so now we getting weekly updates! Weekly updates will serve the purpose to update tables as new information comes in, onboard new users to the 8^(th) wonder of the world: **compound interest,** and also answer your important questions!

**The 3 methods mentioned below are by far the most popular ways to earn a yield on your cryptocurrency:**

**Question:  What is Cryptocurrency Staking?**

* Staking generally refers to the holding of your cryptocurrency funds in a wallet or an exchange and hence supporting the functionality of a blockchain system. The cryptos are being locked in their wallets by the stakeholders. They are then rewarded by the network in return. Staking provides a way of making an income.

**Question: What is Cryptocurrency Lending?**

* Crypto Lending is a transaction in which you can lend your crypto and earn interest rates that accrue over a period of time. The transaction is supported by Crypto Lending Platforms selling loans to various cryptocurrencies such as Ether, Bitcoin, and Stable Coins.

**Question: What is Liquidity Providing?**

* Liquidity Providing is a way of earning money on your coins in a decentralized manner which is managed by the smart contract. The pool is used for liquidity to power the swapping ability of a DEX. Investors are encouraged to deposit into liquidity pools because they earn revenue from the swaps that happen on the DEX platform.

**Question: How do I choose what is best for me?**

* Go through the pros and cons of each and you will get to know which is the best for you!

Pros:

|**Cryptocurrency Staking**|**Cryptocurrency Lending**|**Liquidity Providing**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Non-Custodial which means you are in control of all your coins at all times.|Easy to use and very low learning curve. It is just a deposit and you earning interest.|Non-Custodial which means you are in control of all your coins at all times.|
|Many options you can stake in the safety of your own wallet or stake on an exchange to get instant liquidity for selling|The reward we are compensated for FAR outweighs the non-custodial aspect of the services.|Potential to earn the governance coin just by participating which boosts yield.|
|High APY for certain coins|Low barrier to entry which means you can start with a small number of coins too|Highest APY out of all other options|

Cons:

|**Cryptocurrency Staking**|**Cryptocurrency Lending**|**Liquidity Providing**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|High barrier to entry for some coins. where you got to deposit a lot of coins if you want to stake non-custodial.|It is a custodial Service. So you are not in control of your coins at all times|Extremely High fees right now to deposit and withdraw liquidity from a pool.|
|Vulnerable to Exploits and Hacks in the smart contract|Vulnerable to bad decision making in the company or inside jobs|Vulnerable to Exploits and Hacks in the smart contract|
|The high learning curve for some coins like ETH2 where you have to set up validators|Withdrawals are usually not instant|You have to worry about slippage high gas fees and impermanent loss. So I would only suggest LPing if you are more experienced.|

**Note: Don't get scared by the cons as the hacks and inside jobs are virtually non-existent for good exchanges, services, and smart contracts. If you DYOR effectively this should not be a problem for you.**

**Question:** **How to earn a yield on Bitcoin?**

* You cant stake bitcoin so you have to rely on lending services for now
* Decentralized lending services exist but the APY is too low to consider (0.26%)
* Here are a few reputable services that provide a yield on Bitcoin

|Service|Blockfi|Crypto.com|Celsius Network/Voyager|Ledn.io|Nexo.io|Swissborg|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Annual interest rate|5%|1.5%|6%|6.1%|4%|3%|
|Lockup|No lockup|No lockup normally but Lock up is also available for boosted rewards|No lockup|No lockup|No lockup normally but Lock up is also available for boosted rewards|No lockup|
|Service has its own token for boosted rates?|No|Yes|Yes|No|Yes|Yes|

**Note:**

1. **Celsius and Voyager are together because Celsius has partner with Voyager to provide yield for Voyager customers.**

**Question:**  **How to earn a yield on Ethereum?**

* The best way right now is to partake in ETH2 staking APY is currently between 6-8%. If you have less than 32 ETH you should stake it on a reputable exchange like **Kraken** or **Binance**.
* **Important**: ETH 2 rewards will be locked till ETH2 hard launches. But you can still trade back your locked eth to normal eth by the respective pairs on the exchange
* Another way is to do it is via rocket pool when it launches.
* If you don't like the idea of locking up your coins here are some services and the yield they provide on Ethereum.

**Question:**  **How to earn a yield on Stablecoin?**

* You could use the services mentioned below or you can dip your toes in DEFI lending like Anchor protocol (over 20% APY on UST !) or use the Compound protocol.
* Liquidity providing is also a good option but you have to worry about slippage high, gas fees, and impermanent loss. So I would only suggest LPing if you are more experienced.

**Question:**  **How to earn a yield on other coins?**

* Some coins can be staked in your wallet in your custody. Some can be staked on exchanges like Kraken and Binance. Please do not miss out on these rewards, they compound and will help you reach financial freedom quicker.
* Note: some of the services I mentioned above are non-custodial. The ""not your keys not your crypto"" comes to mind. But I feel that the reward we are compensated for FAR outweighs the non-custodial aspect of the services.
* Good websites to learn more about rates and places to earn a yield on other coins are:

**Now for some questions that I got from the previous update.**

**Question: I only have a small amount in crypto should I still stake my coins?**

A:  credit to AhwahneeBanff

1. Most people underestimate the power of compound interest, especially when being turbocharged by a rapidly appreciating asset.
2. Let's say you buy 5000 Cardano at $2 and 5 years later it becomes $20. Given a 5.5% APR (The most common number I see on the stake pools) you would be earning:
3. Year 1: 275 Cardano earned from staking, or $550 in fiat earning, 5.5% fiat return (550/10,000) Year 5: 275 Cardano earned from staking, or $5,500 in fiat earning, a 55% return! (5,500/10,000)
4. And this is not assuming compound interest, on year 5 I would actually have 6,534 Cardano which gives 359 Cardano given a 5.5% compounded return. This means $7,180 in fiat return (359x20), which is a 71.8% return on my initial $10,000 investment into Cardano, annually!
5. Even if you have a small portfolio you should definitely start. **Magic of compound interest + appreciating asset price will help you reach your own goal a lot quicker and with a lower amount of capital than if you were to ignore it.**

The best part is that you're usually earning it in kind, so even if the current USD value seems insignificant, I suppose you're not invested in anything you don't expect will increase in value, so every dollar this week will hopefully be worth way more. **Just a nice passive DCA basically.**

This means even if you think staking is insignificant right now you would be surprised if crypto adoption keeps rising a couple of years down the line.

**Question:  Where's the catch for the &gt;10% yields on stablecoins? It sounds a little too good to be true, so I'm skeptical...**

A: There are a few ways that service can offer rates like this when other savings accounts offer fractions of this return rate:

1. No FDIC Insurance. Without this restriction, these services can take larger risks on the assets that they hold, while traditional banks are required to hold a large amount of Treasury Bond/Cash. This also means that if these services go broke, the US Government will not step in, and reimburse our deposits.
2. They offer loans to other companies doing business in the crypto space. Since these companies have trouble getting loans through traditional banking, these services are able to charge premium interest rates on these companies.
3. It seems that they are also using their Crypto assets, and their novel position in the market to offer other products to consumers, like offering loans backed by your crypto, or a credit card. I would expect these offerings to expand over time.

**Question: What is the better way, staking through a wallet or through a DEX?**

A: Depends on what's easier for you personally. DEX has higher rates but more complicated to set up. CEFI is easier and just deposit and forget about it but fewer rates and centralized. It's up to you!

**Question: How much do you think you will need to have invested for a return of 4k a month?**

A: Depends on what coin you earning interest on. If it's a stable coin Around 400000 dollars If it is in Bitcoin it would be more like 1 million dollars worth of BTC.

**Question: What is binance savings?**

A: It is flexible savings on Binance, which supports a couple of dozens of coins, and takes seconds to activate.

CryptoCurrency,Compound interest or how to earn money.,"A lot of you might noticed that you can earn an interest if you stake or lend your money. 

You might ask how long would it take to double your money since that's something we all want, am I right?

Let me introduce the Rule of 72 to you then. According to that rule, to get an approximate time it'll take to double your investment is to divide 72 by the annual interest rate.

Now some examples to see it more clearly:

If your interest rate is 5 percents, it will take 15 years to double your money.

With 8 percents, it would take app. 9 years.

Do you want to be faster and double your money in 5 years? The rate should be then 14.4 percents.

Should you use compound interest on your coins? Definitely! Should you expect to double your $100, $1000 or $10000 in few months just from compound? Definitely not.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,Bitcoin makes an appearance at the ISA World Surfing Games 2021 in El Salvador,"The World Surfing Games 2021 were inaugurated yesterday, are are being held for the first time in my home country. One of the sponsors of the local team is Bitcoin Beach. Bitcoin Beach is a pilot project that started a few years ago in a beach called El Zonte, which is popular with locals and tourists. The project involves educating the local population and merchants on the advantages of Bitcoin and providing them with the means of accepting Bitcoin as payment for their products. Most of these people are unbanked, and for years have been unable to accept payments in anything other than cash. Moreover, the only Crypto ATM in the country is located in this town. The project is still small but it is an interesting case study.

The local team is using surf boards with the Bitcoin logo on them (as well as the logos of other sponsors), which will definitely be noticed by surfers and people from all over the world who are watching the event. 

I can't post images or links on this post. If you wish to see photos of the event involving Bitcoin you may visit the official instagram page of the Salvadorean Surf Federation (@fesasurf).

Bitcoin,The Massive Societal Benefits of Bitcoin,"Here is a summary of benefits Bitcoin brings in various areas. Do correct me if needed and suggest additions.

**Benefits for people in developing nations**

* Bitcoin is permissionless, which means anyone with a used $50 smartphone can open an account and start participating in the global economy. Nobody will check your credit history or whether you have a valid address. For example, think of an oppressed woman without the chance to open a bank account in a poor developing country who wants to be self sufficient and live a decent life working online.
* Bitcoin allows people especially in unstable and highly corrupt countries save and thus survive hardships, because you can be your own bank, and you don't have to trust anyone. You can literally cross borders as a refugee if you had to without anything on you, yet carry your savings in your head. This is not a benefit for those living in the comfort of developed countries bombarded with credit card offers, but it's a huge benefit for hundreds of millions around the world who are not as fortunate.
* Bitcoin is independent from nation states, thus free of any misguided or corrupt monetary policy of a certain nation doesn't influence it.
* Legacy remittances services are a huge drain on people who are poor as is already. Such services can easily take 25%+ of people's hard earned little money just to send to their loved ones living in their home country, and the process is risky because people have to carry cash in unsafe areas. Bitcoin fixes this problem.

**Benefits for people in developed nations**

* Bitcoin has a planned and decreasing inflation built in, so your savings do not gradually lose value as they do in other liquid assets, especially cash. In fact, in the last 10 years it didn't just keep its value but appreciated greatly too. At the same time the USD lost more than half of its value (depending on how you calculate). The USD is the strongest currency in the world, everyone else fared much worse. No, you can't escape this by putting your savings into your house, which is by itself a privileged position to have. Even if your house price doubled in the last 10 years, it's still the same house, just older, and the money you would get for it would be the same or less in value. And if you look at the stock market performance against a reserve asset like gold (not to mention Bitcoin), then you are barely preserving the value of your savings, yet you're already sitting in an asset class that is considered risky.
* Bitcoin is a highly uncorrelated asset with other traditional investment assets like bonds, real estate, stocks and gold, so for long term investors it helps stabilize their savings. Bitcoin is also an international asset, so the pool of buyer and sellers is larger and more independent from the events within a single country than any given national currency. The risk is lower with Bitcoin on the long term. This means investors can afford to take bigger risks with their money which stimulates the economy.
* Bitcoin provides the world's first immutable ledger that can be used way beyond just money. The benefits are far reaching and nobody fully grasped it yet. To start off, think about all the partially corrupted centralized institutions that we have to fund and trust. They all became technically obsolete the minute Bitcoin was created. It's only a matter of time until a more just world will emerge thanks to Bitcoin.
* Bitcoin is the same in any country of the world. You don't have to spend on exchange fees to get various currencies to buy stuff. You don't end up with coins you can't do anything with at the end of your trip. Instead you can top up your phone (or whatever else you need to do) in virtually any country of the world with the same Satoshis (a small unit of Bitcoin).
* You can transfer any amount over to anyone else in the world faster than anything else. You can literally move 100M dollars worth of coins right now for 15 dollar cents. It will show up on the other side instantly, will confirm in about 10 minutes, and it's settled fully in about 30 minutes. No humans involved. Safer than banks. This a huge advantage for businesses. The same transaction with a wire transfer will cost you and takes at least a day or more depending on where you are sending. With credit card payments the full settlement takes weeks.
* You can build entire business models on top of Bitcoin, like for example the Lightning Network payment network, because it's programmable money that can execute instructions autonomously, fairly and safely. You can reduce the cost of middleman which is beneficial to all parties (except for the rent seekers).

**Benefits for the environment**

* Bitcoin with its second layer solutions like the Lightning Network that offers instant and super low fee transactions that scales to millions of transactions per second can reduce the reliance on legacy financial systems globally. Legacy systems generate about a magnitude more CO2 emissions so any reduction is a huge win for the environment. Remember, the petro-dollar has to be globally enforced by a large military, which is the single biggest oil consumer.
* Once the world transitions to a Bitcoin standard, governments will not be able to print money to start wars as they have done for millenia, thus Bitcoin potentially and likely reduces wars. Wars are the biggest polluting events in the world, way worse than any other human activity, not to mention the immense suffering living beings have to go through. Reducing wars by even just a fraction would offset any carbon footprint Bitcoin may have. This is far down the line though, but still an important end benefit.

**Benefits of Bitcoin for those who don't use Bitcoin**

* Bitcoin reduces fraud by at least a magnitude or more for merchants. If you ever ran an online store you are familiar with the chargebacks from credit cards, paypal, etc. Losses can be as high as 5-10% of the revenue. This cost is built into the price of products. When we use Bitcoin the losses disappear and thus the cost of goods will drop.
* Bitcoin keeps governments in check passively. Before Bitcoin there was no escape to an international permissionless asset. Now, governments will have to think twice to do something drastic because they know they will only accelerate Bitcoin adoption, as it happened in Venezuela, Turkey and in other nations. This passive force brings a benefit to everyone even those who don't participate in the Bitcoin economy without them realizing that the negative non-event is caused by Bitcoin and its supporters.
* Bitcoin ensures there is a plan B when/if the world's reserve currency the USD may stumble/fall due to uncontrolled hyperinflation, which now became a real possibility given the activity of the FED in the last 2 years. This means society globally will not collapse after the reserve currency collapses, it will just accelerate its transition to a new Bitcoin backed system even if sovereign fiat currencies remain in use. Significantly less people will be fired, go hungry, and be killed by desperate criminals.

In summary, Bitcoin overall and in a historical perspective will likely be seen as a game changer and will have a massive positive transformative effect on civilization creating a much more efficient, equal and just world. All this goodness for recycling \~0.25% of waste energy. I'll take that deal any day.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,Why Bitcoin?,"Bitcoin is inevitable.

For centuries we’ve been told by governments that fiat is the true currency. It has beaten into us, ingrained through the “education” system designed to make us know rather than to think. Enter Bitcoin. 

Bitcoin is unlike any invention before it. Like a lantern that illuminates that cave to show all that was unseen, Bitcoin cuts through the darkness exposing the shady underbelly. No longer can the powers that be print ad infinitum, they are now constrained to a true upper limit. That upper limit was chosen by The One (Satoshi Nakamoto) to be 21 million which just happens to be equal to exactly 6*24*365*4*100, the Beautiful Number (Il Bel Numero). 

As the milk that Mother Gaia feeds her children, suckling upon her teet, we grow and prosper having been fed the most nutritious asset to ever exist. Bitcoin is inevitable, Bitcoin is the driver of all life as we know it.

ethereum,"Nature and history of money, property rights, fraud and the potential of crypto: The context","Dear all,

it might be a good idea to introduce some basic concepts to the community – especially nowadays as most people are focused on prices and short-term gains. Even though this might have been written down multiple times, I believe that it is valuable to bring it together in a unique piece of information. I decided to post this text to multiple subreddits to reach more people - please refer to my profile to see which ones. The selection is based on the fact that they are the largest in the cryptocurrency space here on reddit. A lot of people in the subreddit here do not understand basic but important concepts of money and its history – a state of affairs that I am motivated to help change.

The topics covered are of **philosophical** and **economical** nature. Crypto is way more than just asking the question ‘When moon?’.

**What is money?**

Over time, gold and silver were used as money. Money is defined as a means of exchange, storage of value and a unit to calculate prices with. But how did it come that across continents, so many different cultures used these precious metals as money? Consider the natural situation where the economy is not well developed. If you want to exchange something, you need to use barter which is inefficient and time consuming. The detection of a good usable as money is crucial to benefit society as it allows participants to use their most sacred resource – their lifetime – to pursue other things with the time saved from barter exchange. But how does a good become money? There is one common evolution that can be observed and logically explained – Ludwig Edler von Mises termed it the **‘Regression Theory of Money’** in his habilitation ‘Theorie des Geldes und der Umlaufmittel’ (in English ‘The Theory of Money and Credit’) from 1912. This theorem states that money has value as of now because it had value yesterday; put into context nowadays, one might say that this is the network effect. But if you ‘regress’ this back in time, there has to be a starting point: **The first time a good becomes money is the transition of a valuable product into a mean of exchange, and this mean should be commonly accepted across market participants.** Gold and silver were valued as jewellery, so many people in a barter economy would be fine with accepting this. The transition of this value into a mean of exchange leads to a network effect were the good gets a **monetary value** as well, a so called **Tauschwert**. This is remarkable, as people who don’t value jewellery at all would start accepting this because of its **Tauschwert**. The same could be observed after World War II in Germany, were American cigarettes became a mean of exchange in the destroyed German economy. Even non-smokers accepted it after it had gotten a **Tauschwert**. Besides, there are exotic examples of monetary goods, such as the so-called ‘Rai stones’ in Micronesia that were small to very large round stones with a circle hole in the middle and not easily transportable but used as money. This is a nice example that a common belief can result in the emergence of money; but does the Micronesia example contradict Mises’ theorem? Not necessarily, as value is subjective and a very strong (also religious) belief might as well provide value in itself. Nevertheless, the more ‘classic’ transition of a valuable product resulting in money was clearly the norm.

But this is not enough. Money should also be hard to fake, it should ideally be dividable in smaller units and it should definitely be long lasting. All these reasons spoke for precious metals like gold and silver. In a nutshell, the fact that they are hard to fake and that their supply is not increasing ambiguously make them ideal money. Why is a solid and slow increasing supply important? If you aim at storing value in time, this characteristic follows from basic economic thinking of supply/demand. The demand is quite stable and will be increasing over time if societies and economies get more efficient. Trust in the fact that the gold or silver supply will not just double in two years make it ideal to store value over time. So, as people can’t be trusted easily, precious metals scarcity and their difficulty to counterfeit made them ideal for people to trade without trusting some specific entity. Unfortunately, there was one problem: States/ empires could monopolize the minting and this is what usually happened. The nominal value of a coin could be the same but the amount of precious metal inside could be reduced in order to mint more coins. The first quantitative easing was born! With these methods, empires could finance their expensive wars. The Roman Empire wars are a perfect example of this process.

As things went on, gold smiths (the first banks so to speak) started to accept gold, promised to deposit it in exchange for a paper certificate verifying the amount of gold; whoever claimed that certificate at the proto-bank was able to get the physical gold. This is where the ‘trust-layer’ comes in. Gold in itself is trust-less, one ounce of gold is one ounce of gold, period. But as human technology evolved over time making life more comfortable and easier, the need for convenient means of exchange representing money (the gold in deposits) like paper became clear. But you might guess the potential misuse of such a system. By issuing more certificates than what could be backed by gold, some proto-banks discovered the Cantillon effect / seigniorage: Whoever would make use of its newly created certificates first could accumulate wealth, while subsequent users would be faced with a decrease of the monetary value of their certificates. Indeed, after the new certificates find their way through the economy and aren’t hoarded somewhere, prices tend to go up, a phenomenon commonly referred to as ‘inflation’. Without going too much into detail, this process is not proportional by the amount of newly created certificates but generally in the long term, an effect on prices will occur. One could interpret this wealth transfer under the lens of the fundamental laws of thermodynamics (first and second law), which states (in very simplistic terms) that ‘nothing is for free’, no perpetuum mobile is possible. The very same scientific truth applied to the economy: Nothing is for free, someone always has to pay for it.

To speak it out clearly: This process is fraud and it is **not** compatible with property rights. By breaking the promise of gold depositing the bad actor clearly violates the underlying contract: most people would not voluntarily accept an ambiguously inflating certificate scheme. Also, it dilutes the purchasing power of old certificate holders. In a free-market system, these bad actors should get punished and be treated as criminals by the judicial system in place. But states/ empires began to monopolize and/or regulate the system and this is where the real drama begins. As states/ empires are **monopolies of force** with limited control mechanisms on how this force was and is used, it is clear that this institution has an interest in extracting purchasing power from the peasants (also called ‘taxpayer’ nowadays). Across history, war financing was the main incentive to expand the power even further. Nowadays, it is still war financing but also social welfare programmes, as the former also require large amounts of money (just check the government spending of the USA and you will be surprised by the fact that way more is spent on social programmes than on military even though the defence budget of the USA is more than insane).

**Free markets and capitalism are incompatible with fiat money**

As already stated, the dilution of purchasing power is fraud and incompatible with property rights. Of course, you might be free to found a bank that is issuing more certificates than gold deposits and tell your customers about this procedure from the very beginning orally and also via contracts. However, with other actors competing for this market this is not likely to be a sustainable business model. Why should anyone put his or her hard-earned money into such a bank?

This is why in today’s world, we do certainly **not** live in free markets as a lot of people think. We have elements of free markets for sure, certainly this is true and certainly comes in various flavours (take Australia for example and compare it to North Korea). But currently **all** states in the world have a fiat-money regime. Money in itself could be classified as an own type of good, neither consumption, nor production good. One might conclude that it constitutes a class of its own, a class of good that is so important that it represents one side of a trade for almost all trades in an economy. Free markets and capitalism **require** property rights as this is the very definition of it; if the means of production (land, labour, properties, machinery and so on) are private you have capitalism, period. Even the degree of ‘private property’ is controversial as the government owns large amounts of land; the government regulates a lot, so even if you are a private owner on paper, a state can regulate so much that it is de facto also an owner of your property (simply put, this is the model of fascism; instead of ‘collectivizing the means of production’, the government can ‘collectivize the individual’); your labour is taxed by the government and depending on where you live by quite a substantial amount and additionally a lot of people are paid directly by the government (local or federal) because they work as public officials and so on. But most importantly: Money as it is today is issued by central banks with no backing whatsoever; therefore a **central** bank perverts the concept of **free** markets and capitalism. Even if a central bank is partly ‘private’ as the Swiss National Bank (you can actually buy stocks from this central bank), central banks are a creation of law and **not** of free markets.

**Why the US gold standard was a fraud scheme**

**What is a gold standard?** In a strict and correct term, it means that **gold is money** and every paper certificate using as means of exchange is 100% backed by it. With this perspective, the USA actually gave it up with the founding of the First Bank of America in 1791. This central bank lasted until 1811 and was able to issue debt certificates in a higher amount than what could be backed by gold. The founding of the Second Bank of America in 1816 was again against the principle of a gold standard (or better: bimetallic standard, as written in the Constitution), this institution lasted until 1836. By the way: Andrew Jackson, President of the United States, fought against the Second Bank of America and vetoed its charter in 1833. In 1913, with the creation of the Federal Reserve Bank by the Federal Reserve Act, the concept of a national central bank became permanent compared to the former ones which only had licenses granted by congress. Officially, the USA still had a gold standard, but what is the motive behind a central bank under such a standard? Correct: Undermining it\*\*. I will come back to this point with the history of the Federal Reserve and the monetary supply during the 1920s.\*\*

In 1933, the fraud got its first large scale mark with the decision of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's Executive Order 6102 which came into effect the same year the Nazis gained power in Germany. With this Executive Order, it was forbidden for US citizens to own more than 100 USD in gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates within the continental United States. One ounce of gold was the equivalent of 35 USD. This means that the citizens had to bring the exceeding gold to the Federal Reserve System, there they got 35 USD in paper certificates for one ounce of gold. **This was an act of fraud and theft, because the Federal Reserve of course had the ability to increase the debt amount now as it could before, diluting paper certificate holders.**

The final act against the gold standard and its ultimate murder happened on August 15th 1971 by Richard Nixon, stating: ‘I have directed Secretary Connally to suspend **temporarily** the convertibility of the dollar into gold or other reserve assets, except in amounts and conditions determined to be in the interest of monetary stability and in the best interests of the United States.’ (source: [https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-the-nation-outlining-new-economic-policy-the-challenge-peace#axzz1UZnES7PMon](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-the-nation-outlining-new-economic-policy-the-challenge-peace#axzz1UZnES7PMon))

It took two world wars to get totally rid of a gold-standard; because of von Mises’ regression theorem people continued accepting fiat money; most of them did not even notice the difference after US President Richard Milhous Nixon ‘temporarily’ stopped the exchange of dollars to gold on August 15th 1971. Until now, this is still in effect; President Nixon probably understood the word ‘temporarily’ in cosmic orders of magnitude.

**Friedrich August von Hayek and the ‘Denationalisation of Money’**

Von Mises’ student Friedrich August von Hayek, the real opponent of John Maynard Keynes (and not Milton Friedman as commonly thought) proposed the ‘Denationalisation of Money’ published in 1976. This is a truly important work and it was published during the stagflation times in the USA (high price inflation rates, low economy growth and higher unemployment). Hayek understood one basic fact about gold standards: Even though gold is great in itself, the trust-layer with the government is flawed by design. **He proposed a free market for money to take away the power from the government.**

Do you want to know what kind of suffering has been imposed upon millions of people via fiat money? First: wars. The logic is relatively simple, you can’t finance large scale wars for a long time without fiat money; actually, the European nations abandoned the gold standard right at the outbreak of World War I (World War II was also financed by fiat money). Second, fiat money has been an instrument to steal people’s purchasing power with inflation. In its most extreme version, hyperinflation, the purchasing power has even been reduced to null. Inflating of the money supply has caused booms and busts (Mises’ and Hayek’s works on this topic is recommendable) as it also affects real interest rates, which then affect human behaviour and so on. Why is human behaviour affected? Well, if interest rates are lower than in a free market based on sound money, short-term borrowing becomes relatively easier and consumption is rewarded higher than long-term saving and wealth creation. Also, companies might start using cheaper debt to finance themselves which changes their capital structure. Economic ventures become ‘worth it’ with lower credit cost compared to the free market case. Furthermore, states also take more debt. Thus, in a system with artificially low interest rates, monetary funds, resources and human labour get allocated in a different way, usually less efficient way, than it would be in a sound money system. The day when central banks have to raise interest rates to avoid hyperinflation, the party ends: The debt costs increase and refinancing becomes more expensive. Without such a monetary system, the subprime mortgage crisis that lead to the financial crisis of 2007-2009 would have never been possible. These large risks wouldn’t have been taken by so many and actually, without huge additional money from the central banks and the business banks it would simply not be possible to drive a speculative frenzy of such epic proportions ruining a whole economy. There is more to this but this goes far beyond of the scope of a reddit post. The business banks’ contribution to the increase of money supply happens through the fractional reserve banking regime. What is fractional reserve banking you might ask? It means that a business bank can lend more money than it has in deposits; the minimum reserve is decided by the central bank. For example, if you have your deposits at a bank, you officially lend this money to the bank which in turn lends it to others; but by doing so, the business bank creates new virtual money, as the bank must not hold 100 % fiat reserves for all the claims; that is why bank-runs ruin banks, as they do not have enough funds to cover all claims if large amounts of customers want cash; maybe this makes you understand why central banks and governments are interested in introducing their own digital currencies, a real dystopic nightmare.

So, it is now clear that a free market for money would lead to more peace, more stable economies with lower, but steadier and more sustainable economic growth. And this is why private banking with solid money like gold and/ or silver is better than the current status quo. Hayek wanted government completely out of this; and that is for good reasons in regard to history and human nature. As already mentioned, even during the gold standard times in the USA, it was possible to issue more paper certificates than gold. The Federal Reserve actually did this during the roaring twenties, contributing to the frenzy during these times which lead to a catastrophe. Murray Newton Rothbard highlights this process in his work ‘America’s Great Depression’ from 1963. Rothbard was a student of Ludwig Edler von Mises and wrote besides economics also about financial history with focus on the USA. He teaches us that the Federal Reserve total Dollar claims on June 1921 were 44.7 billion USD with a total gold reserve of 2.6 billion USD. Then, on June 1929, the claimed Dollar amount rose to 71.8 billion USD, a **60.6% increase** while the gold reserves rose only to 3.0 billion USD, an **increase of 15.4%** (Table 2 on page 94, can freely be accessed via [https://cdn.mises.org/Americas%20Great%20Depression\_3.pdf](https://cdn.mises.org/Americas%20Great%20Depression_3.pdf); original source is \*\*Banking and Monetary Statistics (Washington, D.C.: Federal Reserve System, 1943), pp. 544–45, 409, and 346–48\*\*).

But there still is a problem: Even with a free market monetary system with a solid gold currency the trust-layer is still existent. At least it is not monopolized with the central bank and a cartel of business banks, but market participants still have to trust the depositing institution which usually is a bank, or used to be a bank as gold has been completely demonetized.

**The invention of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies**

This is where crypto comes in. I apologize for this long history travel, but it is important to understand cryptocurrencies’ significance. **With the invention of Bitcoin it was - for the first time in human history - possible to mimic gold and remove the trust-layer.** This is not an understatement.

Let this sink in. If you understand the motivation for sound money and the incompatibility of fiat money with property rights, its pivotal role in free markets and peace, then it becomes clear that Bitcoin is revolutionary. But you may wonder, how is it possible that even people supporting sound money, Peter Schiff being a prominent example, disagree with the concept of cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin? There might be multiple reasons to this, but one common argument is that it has no ‘inherent’ value. **However, by applying von Mises’ regression theorem, one can definitely conclude why Bitcoin has value:** First, we went from barter to primitive money until many cultures and societies discovered gold and silver which were widely used throughout history. Then governments introduced a purely fiat system; what gave fiat its value? It was not the government just stating ‘Here, accept it now!’, but a long-lasting connection to gold (even though not perfect, but still) the collective used Dollar certificates and other certificates in other countries for generations. It took two world wars to get to the current fiat regime: The change was quiet and did not really appear in people’s daily life until price inflation hit. Thus, the ‘regression’ went from gold, to gold certificates, to fiat. With fiat being flawed by design, Bitcoin was proposed to counter the problems that come with the trust-layer. This should certainly create a value for buyers, especially in countries where you see the purchasing power being molten. The historical perspective helps us understand why for Bitcoin and/ or other cryptocurrencies to be successful, a strong network effect is a prerequisite. Then the ‘regression’ pattern moves towards cryptocurrencies. This is commonly  named adoption. Which cryptocurrency or cryptocurrencies will succeed? Will it be Bitcoin? Ethereum? Another crypto? A mix of cryptos? Who knows? I certainly don’t; this decision has not been made by the market participants yet, as we are still in the early days. **So von Mises’ regression theorem tells us that the transition from a valuable good or a solid ground belief from the very beginning already happened and then regressed through time!**

Let’s note now that cryptocurrencies are also very powerful because governments will not be able to stop or control them. It is impossible to control every single machine connected to the internet. Even though we have nation states, at least we don’t have a world state with a world government; if one nation state decides to ban this technology - a ban that is already hard to enforce by itself - there will be incentives for other nation states to be even friendlier. A coordinated world-wide nation state attempt to destroy cryptocurrencies is practically impossible and even if, people will probably rise up as they understand that something has to be wrong.

This gives me hope. It is sad to see how governments and big corporations in bed with governments control people more and more and how the financial system gets sicker and sicker. Well, at least we do not have large scale totalitarianism as in the 20th century. But we witness the developments of more controls, more economic interventions, more money destruction through supply increase and this might lead us to more totalitarian states. But crypto is here to stay and evolve. And it is powerful. It is powerful because it is a means of disempowering nation states and the fiat money system. **Without fiat money, it is impossible to sustain and finance large states spending huge amounts of money in a way where the people making decisions did not earn the money by themselves**. It is especially impossible to finance large scale wars, a property that should by itself defeat the fiat money regime. The fiat regime is the core of statism and totalitarianism - without its core element, it can’t survive. Of course, disinformation is a crucial part of this, but it is not the core of statism and totalitarianism: Without fiat money but with disinformation, these political forces cannot achieve much. This an important point to understand, as modern large-scale wars and welfare states are impossible to finance with solid money. This is why you can’t logically promote Bitcoin or another serious crypto while being a collectivist, either a socialist or fascist. These ideologies are highly flawed in a practical and ethical sense; the argumentation about this statement (more from the practical side) has been done by Ludwig Edler von Mises himself in his masterpiece ‘Sozialismus: Eine ökonomische und soziologische Analyse’ (English: ‘Socialism: An Economic and Sociological Analysis’) from 1922. One of his main points is that under collectivized economies, the central planners can’t calculate on prices as there is no pricing mechanism telling participants what is worth pursuing and what isn’t. Indeed, with means of production that are not private, it makes rational decisions about pricing impossible because these very same means of productions have no price. Friedrich August von Hayek wrote a lot about the impossibility of collective economies, focusing on the information problem and the inherent decentralized dynamics of the market mechanism. But there are even more arguments against it, here is a simple one: Centralization of power in order to fulfill collective economies, be it on a local level with communities or on a large level across nation states, will always corrupt people, and notably more so in the latter case, as human nature is as it is (humans want the outputs without putting in the work and the energy). There would be no problem with socialistic/ communistic or fascist communities if they respected property rights of others, but they don’t by definition. This is the moral difference between collectivism and individualism: Under an individualistic, property rights centered order, you can try whatever you want unless you don’t violate the property rights of others. In this setup, if you want to start a collectivist paradise by yourself and find people who want to voluntarily join you, you are free to do this. Ironically, starting a business and/ or using sound money under a collectivist order would possibly result in penalties and in your death in the worst case. Interesting fact: Even when done voluntarily, collectivist models fail. This can be exemplified with the New Harmony project in Indiana (USA) during the 19th century or even the Kibbutzim in Israel, many of which failed and of the remaining ones, the large majority threw their hard-core collectivist ideals away. It is also interesting that internet devices and smart phones found their way to Kibbutzim nowadays. It should not be explained that under a total collectivized global economic regime, hard work and innovation leading to our daily life’s devices wouldn’t be possible, just by the nature of human incentives and behaviour.

**Smart contracts and beyond**

Even though Bitcoin started as being a ‘Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash-System’ and now seems to find its role as a store of value (with a lot of speculative elements as it is still early), the idea of smart contracts provides even more power to decentralization by allowing to participate in businesses and trades without the trust-layer. This is achievable by Decentralized-Finance or Non-Fungible-Tokens which could become a standard for property exchange. They could one day register governance via a hard-encoded trust-less protocol on a blockchain, or handle bond and stock exchanges that work with lower costs and higher efficiency without intermediaries. Way more applications could probably be enabled by a such a decentralized, trust-ensuring protocol. All of this is unstoppable and will transform the world for the better. I am so happy and proud that it all started with Bitcoin, with all its ups and downs and insane stories. The sector keeps evolving, attracting more and more visionaries and great minds contributing their part to this field.

Furthermore, the impact of these technologies on governance can truly be disruptive, allowing more transparency in public finances to prevent corruption when dealing with public money in a city, province or even nation state. There are many issues yet to be solved from a technical and also architecture point of view (surely, it is useful to have privacy in the sense that nobody can track where the tax money is coming from, but as soon as it is on the public side ready to be spent, an immutable blockchain could be quite helpful here). The decentralisation of cryptos might even lead to political decentralisation, solving problems on the local level where they arose in the first place. Who knows where this journey will bring us?

Before finishing, it shall be mentioned that the large banking sector needs the government and vice versa. Simplistic thinking might lead some to the conclusion that one single governmental bank and the abolition of interest rates will solve all problems, but if you made it until here, you probably understand why this is utopist and flawed. Governments are dangerous and as long as centralization of power exists, special interests (especially from the banking side) will always lobby and gain privileges, period. With sound money, the very core enabling large powerful states is removed. Besides, with the use of smart contracts for governance there will hopefully be some additional pressure towards political decentralization. Always remember: Special interests will always try to collude governments and the more centralization, the easier it gets. It is no surprise that Ancient Greece with its decentralized nature with hundreds of small city states flourished so much compared to other areas of the world which marked the beginning of a historic journey until we got modern civilization which was born and carried out in Europe. Also, it doesn’t come to any surprise that many small city states nowadays allow their citizens high levels of wealth without access to natural resources. Even the decentralized nature of Switzerland, advocated by many (especially by citizens from the surrounding European Union with its centralistic tendencies) as combining the current best political system in the world, doesn’t come to any surprise. In fact, when looking at economic and social freedom combined, Switzerland is the freest country in the world. By the way, the canton of Zug where you can find the so-called ‘crypto valley’ is also located in Switzerland.

**Conclusion**

Cryptocurrencies are here to stay. They will transform this world. Hayek’s dream will come true, as there are no means by which governments can stop this evolution. I am convinced that Hayek would be deeply happy about the evolution of this field. The failure of fiat will be the victory of crypto. Even though gold and silver are great for monetary purposes, especially when thinking about an intelligent alien in our galaxy that would probably rather accept gold than a cryptocurrency, **it is human nature and thus the trust-layer that make a monetary system prone to corruption, legal action and intervention by the government possible. This messes up things even more than single bad actors in the market in the long run.** This is why gold and silver, being valued not only for jewellery, but also electronics and industry nowadays will probably always be valuable and a good hedge against price inflation in the long term. Their physical properties (noteworthy that silver is the element with the highest electrical conductivity which make it unique) give them their own strengths and powers.

I believe that it is too early to say which cryptocurrency or cryptocurrencies will make it; let us see. Maximalism is a single-minded attitude in a fast evolving and relatively new field. Only time will tell what will succeed and what won’t. But I can assure you one thing: **The idea of decentralized cryptocurrencies will succeed and make this world a better place. Hayek’s idea is more powerful than ever before and it is gaining power and popularity. The failure of fiat will be the victory of crypto.**

Edit: Grammar and typos.",cryptocurrency
cardano,"Nature and history of money, property rights, fraud and the potential of crypto: The context","Dear all,

it might be a good idea to introduce some basic concepts to the community – especially nowadays as most people are focused on prices and short-term gains. Even though this might have been written down multiple times, I believe that it is valuable to bring it together in a unique piece of information. I decided to post this text to multiple subreddits to reach more people - please refer to my profile to see which ones. The selection is based on the fact that they are the largest in the cryptocurrency space here on reddit. A lot of people in the subreddit here do not understand basic but important concepts of money and its history – a state of affairs that I am motivated to help change.

The topics covered are of **philosophical** and **economical** nature. Crypto is way more than just asking the question ‘When moon?’.

**What is money?**

Over time, gold and silver were used as money. Money is defined as a means of exchange, storage of value and a unit to calculate prices with. But how did it come that across continents, so many different cultures used these precious metals as money? Consider the natural situation where the economy is not well developed. If you want to exchange something, you need to use barter which is inefficient and time consuming. The detection of a good usable as money is crucial to benefit society as it allows participants to use their most sacred resource – their lifetime – to pursue other things with the time saved from barter exchange. But how does a good become money? There is one common evolution that can be observed and logically explained – Ludwig Edler von Mises termed it the **‘Regression Theory of Money’** in his habilitation ‘Theorie des Geldes und der Umlaufmittel’ (in English ‘The Theory of Money and Credit’) from 1912. This theorem states that money has value as of now because it had value yesterday; put into context nowadays, one might say that this is the network effect. But if you ‘regress’ this back in time, there has to be a starting point: **The first time a good becomes money is the transition of a valuable product into a mean of exchange, and this mean should be commonly accepted across market participants.** Gold and silver were valued as jewellery, so many people in a barter economy would be fine with accepting this. The transition of this value into a mean of exchange leads to a network effect were the good gets a **monetary value** as well, a so called **Tauschwert**. This is remarkable, as people who don’t value jewellery at all would start accepting this because of its **Tauschwert**. The same could be observed after World War II in Germany, were American cigarettes became a mean of exchange in the destroyed German economy. Even non-smokers accepted it after it had gotten a **Tauschwert**. Besides, there are exotic examples of monetary goods, such as the so-called ‘Rai stones’ in Micronesia that were small to very large round stones with a circle hole in the middle and not easily transportable but used as money. This is a nice example that a common belief can result in the emergence of money; but does the Micronesia example contradict Mises’ theorem? Not necessarily, as value is subjective and a very strong (also religious) belief might as well provide value in itself. Nevertheless, the more ‘classic’ transition of a valuable product resulting in money was clearly the norm.

But this is not enough. Money should also be hard to fake, it should ideally be dividable in smaller units and it should definitely be long lasting. All these reasons spoke for precious metals like gold and silver. In a nutshell, the fact that they are hard to fake and that their supply is not increasing ambiguously make them ideal money. Why is a solid and slow increasing supply important? If you aim at storing value in time, this characteristic follows from basic economic thinking of supply/demand. The demand is quite stable and will be increasing over time if societies and economies get more efficient. Trust in the fact that the gold or silver supply will not just double in two years make it ideal to store value over time. So, as people can’t be trusted easily, precious metals scarcity and their difficulty to counterfeit made them ideal for people to trade without trusting some specific entity. Unfortunately, there was one problem: States/ empires could monopolize the minting and this is what usually happened. The nominal value of a coin could be the same but the amount of precious metal inside could be reduced in order to mint more coins. The first quantitative easing was born! With these methods, empires could finance their expensive wars. The Roman Empire wars are a perfect example of this process.

As things went on, gold smiths (the first banks so to speak) started to accept gold, promised to deposit it in exchange for a paper certificate verifying the amount of gold; whoever claimed that certificate at the proto-bank was able to get the physical gold. This is where the ‘trust-layer’ comes in. Gold in itself is trust-less, one ounce of gold is one ounce of gold, period. But as human technology evolved over time making life more comfortable and easier, the need for convenient means of exchange representing money (the gold in deposits) like paper became clear. But you might guess the potential misuse of such a system. By issuing more certificates than what could be backed by gold, some proto-banks discovered the Cantillon effect / seigniorage: Whoever would make use of its newly created certificates first could accumulate wealth, while subsequent users would be faced with a decrease of the monetary value of their certificates. Indeed, after the new certificates find their way through the economy and aren’t hoarded somewhere, prices tend to go up, a phenomenon commonly referred to as ‘inflation’. Without going too much into detail, this process is not proportional by the amount of newly created certificates but generally in the long term, an effect on prices will occur. One could interpret this wealth transfer under the lens of the fundamental laws of thermodynamics (first and second law), which states (in very simplistic terms) that ‘nothing is for free’, no perpetuum mobile is possible. The very same scientific truth applied to the economy: Nothing is for free, someone always has to pay for it.

To speak it out clearly: This process is fraud and it is **not** compatible with property rights. By breaking the promise of gold depositing the bad actor clearly violates the underlying contract: most people would not voluntarily accept an ambiguously inflating certificate scheme. Also, it dilutes the purchasing power of old certificate holders. In a free-market system, these bad actors should get punished and be treated as criminals by the judicial system in place. But states/ empires began to monopolize and/or regulate the system and this is where the real drama begins. As states/ empires are **monopolies of force** with limited control mechanisms on how this force was and is used, it is clear that this institution has an interest in extracting purchasing power from the peasants (also called ‘taxpayer’ nowadays). Across history, war financing was the main incentive to expand the power even further. Nowadays, it is still war financing but also social welfare programmes, as the former also require large amounts of money (just check the government spending of the USA and you will be surprised by the fact that way more is spent on social programmes than on military even though the defence budget of the USA is more than insane).

**Free markets and capitalism are incompatible with fiat money**

As already stated, the dilution of purchasing power is fraud and incompatible with property rights. Of course, you might be free to found a bank that is issuing more certificates than gold deposits and tell your customers about this procedure from the very beginning orally and also via contracts. However, with other actors competing for this market this is not likely to be a sustainable business model. Why should anyone put his or her hard-earned money into such a bank?

This is why in today’s world, we do certainly **not** live in free markets as a lot of people think. We have elements of free markets for sure, certainly this is true and certainly comes in various flavours (take Australia for example and compare it to North Korea). But currently **all** states in the world have a fiat-money regime. Money in itself could be classified as an own type of good, neither consumption, nor production good. One might conclude that it constitutes a class of its own, a class of good that is so important that it represents one side of a trade for almost all trades in an economy. Free markets and capitalism **require** property rights as this is the very definition of it; if the means of production (land, labour, properties, machinery and so on) are private you have capitalism, period. Even the degree of ‘private property’ is controversial as the government owns large amounts of land; the government regulates a lot, so even if you are a private owner on paper, a state can regulate so much that it is de facto also an owner of your property (simply put, this is the model of fascism; instead of ‘collectivizing the means of production’, the government can ‘collectivize the individual’); your labour is taxed by the government and depending on where you live by quite a substantial amount and additionally a lot of people are paid directly by the government (local or federal) because they work as public officials and so on. But most importantly: Money as it is today is issued by central banks with no backing whatsoever; therefore a **central** bank perverts the concept of **free** markets and capitalism. Even if a central bank is partly ‘private’ as the Swiss National Bank (you can actually buy stocks from this central bank), central banks are a creation of law and **not** of free markets.

**Why the US gold standard was a fraud scheme**

**What is a gold standard?** In a strict and correct term, it means that **gold is money** and every paper certificate using as means of exchange is 100% backed by it. With this perspective, the USA actually gave it up with the founding of the First Bank of America in 1791. This central bank lasted until 1811 and was able to issue debt certificates in a higher amount than what could be backed by gold. The founding of the Second Bank of America in 1816 was again against the principle of a gold standard (or better: bimetallic standard, as written in the Constitution), this institution lasted until 1836. By the way: Andrew Jackson, President of the United States, fought against the Second Bank of America and vetoed its charter in 1833. In 1913, with the creation of the Federal Reserve Bank by the Federal Reserve Act, the concept of a national central bank became permanent compared to the former ones which only had licenses granted by congress. Officially, the USA still had a gold standard, but what is the motive behind a central bank under such a standard? Correct: Undermining it\*\*. I will come back to this point with the history of the Federal Reserve and the monetary supply during the 1920s.\*\*

In 1933, the fraud got its first large scale mark with the decision of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's Executive Order 6102 which came into effect the same year the Nazis gained power in Germany. With this Executive Order, it was forbidden for US citizens to own more than 100 USD in gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates within the continental United States. One ounce of gold was the equivalent of 35 USD. This means that the citizens had to bring the exceeding gold to the Federal Reserve System, there they got 35 USD in paper certificates for one ounce of gold. **This was an act of fraud and theft, because the Federal Reserve of course had the ability to increase the debt amount now as it could before, diluting paper certificate holders.**

The final act against the gold standard and its ultimate murder happened on August 15th 1971 by Richard Nixon, stating: ‘I have directed Secretary Connally to suspend **temporarily** the convertibility of the dollar into gold or other reserve assets, except in amounts and conditions determined to be in the interest of monetary stability and in the best interests of the United States.’ (source: [https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-the-nation-outlining-new-economic-policy-the-challenge-peace#axzz1UZnES7PMon](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-the-nation-outlining-new-economic-policy-the-challenge-peace#axzz1UZnES7PMon))

It took two world wars to get totally rid of a gold-standard; because of von Mises’ regression theorem people continued accepting fiat money; most of them did not even notice the difference after US President Richard Milhous Nixon ‘temporarily’ stopped the exchange of dollars to gold on August 15th 1971. Until now, this is still in effect; President Nixon probably understood the word ‘temporarily’ in cosmic orders of magnitude.

**Friedrich August von Hayek and the ‘Denationalisation of Money’**

Von Mises’ student Friedrich August von Hayek, the real opponent of John Maynard Keynes (and not Milton Friedman as commonly thought) proposed the ‘Denationalisation of Money’ published in 1976. This is a truly important work and it was published during the stagflation times in the USA (high price inflation rates, low economy growth and higher unemployment). Hayek understood one basic fact about gold standards: Even though gold is great in itself, the trust-layer with the government is flawed by design. **He proposed a free market for money to take away the power from the government.**

Do you want to know what kind of suffering has been imposed upon millions of people via fiat money? First: wars. The logic is relatively simple, you can’t finance large scale wars for a long time without fiat money; actually, the European nations abandoned the gold standard right at the outbreak of World War I (World War II was also financed by fiat money). Second, fiat money has been an instrument to steal people’s purchasing power with inflation. In its most extreme version, hyperinflation, the purchasing power has even been reduced to null. Inflating of the money supply has caused booms and busts (Mises’ and Hayek’s works on this topic is recommendable) as it also affects real interest rates, which then affect human behaviour and so on. Why is human behaviour affected? Well, if interest rates are lower than in a free market based on sound money, short-term borrowing becomes relatively easier and consumption is rewarded higher than long-term saving and wealth creation. Also, companies might start using cheaper debt to finance themselves which changes their capital structure. Economic ventures become ‘worth it’ with lower credit cost compared to the free market case. Furthermore, states also take more debt. Thus, in a system with artificially low interest rates, monetary funds, resources and human labour get allocated in a different way, usually less efficient way, than it would be in a sound money system. The day when central banks have to raise interest rates to avoid hyperinflation, the party ends: The debt costs increase and refinancing becomes more expensive. Without such a monetary system, the subprime mortgage crisis that lead to the financial crisis of 2007-2009 would have never been possible. These large risks wouldn’t have been taken by so many and actually, without huge additional money from the central banks and the business banks it would simply not be possible to drive a speculative frenzy of such epic proportions ruining a whole economy. There is more to this but this goes far beyond of the scope of a reddit post. The business banks’ contribution to the increase of money supply happens through the fractional reserve banking regime. What is fractional reserve banking you might ask? It means that a business bank can lend more money than it has in deposits; the minimum reserve is decided by the central bank. For example, if you have your deposits at a bank, you officially lend this money to the bank which in turn lends it to others; but by doing so, the business bank creates new virtual money, as the bank must not hold 100 % fiat reserves for all the claims; that is why bank-runs ruin banks, as they do not have enough funds to cover all claims if large amounts of customers want cash; maybe this makes you understand why central banks and governments are interested in introducing their own digital currencies, a real dystopic nightmare.

So, it is now clear that a free market for money would lead to more peace, more stable economies with lower, but steadier and more sustainable economic growth. And this is why private banking with solid money like gold and/ or silver is better than the current status quo. Hayek wanted government completely out of this; and that is for good reasons in regard to history and human nature. As already mentioned, even during the gold standard times in the USA, it was possible to issue more paper certificates than gold. The Federal Reserve actually did this during the roaring twenties, contributing to the frenzy during these times which lead to a catastrophe. Murray Newton Rothbard highlights this process in his work ‘America’s Great Depression’ from 1963. Rothbard was a student of Ludwig Edler von Mises and wrote besides economics also about financial history with focus on the USA. He teaches us that the Federal Reserve total Dollar claims on June 1921 were 44.7 billion USD with a total gold reserve of 2.6 billion USD. Then, on June 1929, the claimed Dollar amount rose to 71.8 billion USD, a **60.6% increase** while the gold reserves rose only to 3.0 billion USD, an **increase of 15.4%** (Table 2 on page 94, can freely be accessed via [https://cdn.mises.org/Americas%20Great%20Depression\_3.pdf](https://cdn.mises.org/Americas%20Great%20Depression_3.pdf); original source is \*\*Banking and Monetary Statistics (Washington, D.C.: Federal Reserve System, 1943), pp. 544–45, 409, and 346–48\*\*).

But there still is a problem: Even with a free market monetary system with a solid gold currency the trust-layer is still existent. At least it is not monopolized with the central bank and a cartel of business banks, but market participants still have to trust the depositing institution which usually is a bank, or used to be a bank as gold has been completely demonetized.

**The invention of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies**

This is where crypto comes in. I apologize for this long history travel, but it is important to understand cryptocurrencies’ significance. **With the invention of Bitcoin it was - for the first time in human history - possible to mimic gold and remove the trust-layer.** This is not an understatement.

Let this sink in. If you understand the motivation for sound money and the incompatibility of fiat money with property rights, its pivotal role in free markets and peace, then it becomes clear that Bitcoin is revolutionary. But you may wonder, how is it possible that even people supporting sound money, Peter Schiff being a prominent example, disagree with the concept of cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin? There might be multiple reasons to this, but one common argument is that it has no ‘inherent’ value. **However, by applying von Mises’ regression theorem, one can definitely conclude why Bitcoin has value:** First, we went from barter to primitive money until many cultures and societies discovered gold and silver which were widely used throughout history. Then governments introduced a purely fiat system; what gave fiat its value? It was not the government just stating ‘Here, accept it now!’, but a long-lasting connection to gold (even though not perfect, but still) the collective used Dollar certificates and other certificates in other countries for generations. It took two world wars to get to the current fiat regime: The change was quiet and did not really appear in people’s daily life until price inflation hit. Thus, the ‘regression’ went from gold, to gold certificates, to fiat. With fiat being flawed by design, Bitcoin was proposed to counter the problems that come with the trust-layer. This should certainly create a value for buyers, especially in countries where you see the purchasing power being molten. The historical perspective helps us understand why for Bitcoin and/ or other cryptocurrencies to be successful, a strong network effect is a prerequisite. Then the ‘regression’ pattern moves towards cryptocurrencies. This is commonly  named adoption. Which cryptocurrency or cryptocurrencies will succeed? Will it be Bitcoin? Ethereum? Another crypto? A mix of cryptos? Who knows? I certainly don’t; this decision has not been made by the market participants yet, as we are still in the early days. **So von Mises’ regression theorem tells us that the transition from a valuable good or a solid ground belief from the very beginning already happened and then regressed through time!**

Let’s note now that cryptocurrencies are also very powerful because governments will not be able to stop or control them. It is impossible to control every single machine connected to the internet. Even though we have nation states, at least we don’t have a world state with a world government; if one nation state decides to ban this technology - a ban that is already hard to enforce by itself - there will be incentives for other nation states to be even friendlier. A coordinated world-wide nation state attempt to destroy cryptocurrencies is practically impossible and even if, people will probably rise up as they understand that something has to be wrong.

This gives me hope. It is sad to see how governments and big corporations in bed with governments control people more and more and how the financial system gets sicker and sicker. Well, at least we do not have large scale totalitarianism as in the 20th century. But we witness the developments of more controls, more economic interventions, more money destruction through supply increase and this might lead us to more totalitarian states. But crypto is here to stay and evolve. And it is powerful. It is powerful because it is a means of disempowering nation states and the fiat money system. **Without fiat money, it is impossible to sustain and finance large states spending huge amounts of money in a way where the people making decisions did not earn the money by themselves**. It is especially impossible to finance large scale wars, a property that should by itself defeat the fiat money regime. The fiat regime is the core of statism and totalitarianism - without its core element, it can’t survive. Of course, disinformation is a crucial part of this, but it is not the core of statism and totalitarianism: Without fiat money but with disinformation, these political forces cannot achieve much. This an important point to understand, as modern large-scale wars and welfare states are impossible to finance with solid money. This is why you can’t logically promote Bitcoin or another serious crypto while being a collectivist, either a socialist or fascist. These ideologies are highly flawed in a practical and ethical sense; the argumentation about this statement (more from the practical side) has been done by Ludwig Edler von Mises himself in his masterpiece ‘Sozialismus: Eine ökonomische und soziologische Analyse’ (English: ‘Socialism: An Economic and Sociological Analysis’) from 1922. One of his main points is that under collectivized economies, the central planners can’t calculate on prices as there is no pricing mechanism telling participants what is worth pursuing and what isn’t. Indeed, with means of production that are not private, it makes rational decisions about pricing impossible because these very same means of productions have no price. Friedrich August von Hayek wrote a lot about the impossibility of collective economies, focusing on the information problem and the inherent decentralized dynamics of the market mechanism. But there are even more arguments against it, here is a simple one: Centralization of power in order to fulfill collective economies, be it on a local level with communities or on a large level across nation states, will always corrupt people, and notably more so in the latter case, as human nature is as it is (humans want the outputs without putting in the work and the energy). There would be no problem with socialistic/ communistic or fascist communities if they respected property rights of others, but they don’t by definition. This is the moral difference between collectivism and individualism: Under an individualistic, property rights centered order, you can try whatever you want unless you don’t violate the property rights of others. In this setup, if you want to start a collectivist paradise by yourself and find people who want to voluntarily join you, you are free to do this. Ironically, starting a business and/ or using sound money under a collectivist order would possibly result in penalties and in your death in the worst case. Interesting fact: Even when done voluntarily, collectivist models fail. This can be exemplified with the New Harmony project in Indiana (USA) during the 19th century or even the Kibbutzim in Israel, many of which failed and of the remaining ones, the large majority threw their hard-core collectivist ideals away. It is also interesting that internet devices and smart phones found their way to Kibbutzim nowadays. It should not be explained that under a total collectivized global economic regime, hard work and innovation leading to our daily life’s devices wouldn’t be possible, just by the nature of human incentives and behaviour.

**Smart contracts and beyond**

Even though Bitcoin started as being a ‘Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash-System’ and now seems to find its role as a store of value (with a lot of speculative elements as it is still early), the idea of smart contracts provides even more power to decentralization by allowing to participate in businesses and trades without the trust-layer. This is achievable by Decentralized-Finance or Non-Fungible-Tokens which could become a standard for property exchange. They could one day register governance via a hard-encoded trust-less protocol on a blockchain, or handle bond and stock exchanges that work with lower costs and higher efficiency without intermediaries. Way more applications could probably be enabled by a such a decentralized, trust-ensuring protocol. All of this is unstoppable and will transform the world for the better. I am so happy and proud that it all started with Bitcoin, with all its ups and downs and insane stories. The sector keeps evolving, attracting more and more visionaries and great minds contributing their part to this field.

Furthermore, the impact of these technologies on governance can truly be disruptive, allowing more transparency in public finances to prevent corruption when dealing with public money in a city, province or even nation state. There are many issues yet to be solved from a technical and also architecture point of view (surely, it is useful to have privacy in the sense that nobody can track where the tax money is coming from, but as soon as it is on the public side ready to be spent, an immutable blockchain could be quite helpful here). The decentralisation of cryptos might even lead to political decentralisation, solving problems on the local level where they arose in the first place. Who knows where this journey will bring us?

Before finishing, it shall be mentioned that the large banking sector needs the government and vice versa. Simplistic thinking might lead some to the conclusion that one single governmental bank and the abolition of interest rates will solve all problems, but if you made it until here, you probably understand why this is utopist and flawed. Governments are dangerous and as long as centralization of power exists, special interests (especially from the banking side) will always lobby and gain privileges, period. With sound money, the very core enabling large powerful states is removed. Besides, with the use of smart contracts for governance there will hopefully be some additional pressure towards political decentralization. Always remember: Special interests will always try to collude governments and the more centralization, the easier it gets. It is no surprise that Ancient Greece with its decentralized nature with hundreds of small city states flourished so much compared to other areas of the world which marked the beginning of a historic journey until we got modern civilization which was born and carried out in Europe. Also, it doesn’t come to any surprise that many small city states nowadays allow their citizens high levels of wealth without access to natural resources. Even the decentralized nature of Switzerland, advocated by many (especially by citizens from the surrounding European Union with its centralistic tendencies) as combining the current best political system in the world, doesn’t come to any surprise. In fact, when looking at economic and social freedom combined, Switzerland is the freest country in the world. By the way, the canton of Zug where you can find the so-called ‘crypto valley’ is also located in Switzerland.

**Conclusion**

Cryptocurrencies are here to stay. They will transform this world. Hayek’s dream will come true, as there are no means by which governments can stop this evolution. I am convinced that Hayek would be deeply happy about the evolution of this field. The failure of fiat will be the victory of crypto. Even though gold and silver are great for monetary purposes, especially when thinking about an intelligent alien in our galaxy that would probably rather accept gold than a cryptocurrency, **it is human nature and thus the trust-layer that make a monetary system prone to corruption, legal action and intervention by the government possible. This messes up things even more than single bad actors in the market in the long run.** This is why gold and silver, being valued not only for jewellery, but also electronics and industry nowadays will probably always be valuable and a good hedge against price inflation in the long term. Their physical properties (noteworthy that silver is the element with the highest electrical conductivity which make it unique) give them their own strengths and powers.

I believe that it is too early to say which cryptocurrency or cryptocurrencies will make it; let us see. Maximalism is a single-minded attitude in a fast evolving and relatively new field. Only time will tell what will succeed and what won’t. But I can assure you one thing: **The idea of decentralized cryptocurrencies will succeed and make this world a better place. Hayek’s idea is more powerful than ever before and it is gaining power and popularity. The failure of fiat will be the victory of crypto.**

Edit: Grammar and typos.",cryptocurrency
Bitcoin,"Nature and history of money, property rights, fraud and the potential of crypto: The context","Dear all,

it might be a good idea to introduce some basic concepts to the community – especially nowadays as most people are focused on prices and short-term gains. Even though this might have been written down multiple times, I believe that it is valuable to bring it together in a unique piece of information. I decided to post this text to multiple subreddits to reach more people - please refer to my profile to see which ones. The selection is based on the fact that they are the largest in the cryptocurrency space here on reddit. A lot of people in the subreddit here do not understand basic but important concepts of money and its history – a state of affairs that I am motivated to help change.

The topics covered are of **philosophical** and **economical** nature. Crypto is way more than just asking the question ‘When moon?’.

**What is money?**

Over time, gold and silver were used as money. Money is defined as a means of exchange, storage of value and a unit to calculate prices with. But how did it come that across continents, so many different cultures used these precious metals as money? Consider the natural situation where the economy is not well developed. If you want to exchange something, you need to use barter which is inefficient and time consuming. The detection of a good usable as money is crucial to benefit society as it allows participants to use their most sacred resource – their lifetime – to pursue other things with the time saved from barter exchange. But how does a good become money? There is one common evolution that can be observed and logically explained – Ludwig Edler von Mises termed it the **‘Regression Theory of Money’** in his habilitation ‘Theorie des Geldes und der Umlaufmittel’ (in English ‘The Theory of Money and Credit’) from 1912. This theorem states that money has value as of now because it had value yesterday; put into context nowadays, one might say that this is the network effect. But if you ‘regress’ this back in time, there has to be a starting point: **The first time a good becomes money is the transition of a valuable product into a mean of exchange, and this mean should be commonly accepted across market participants.** Gold and silver were valued as jewellery, so many people in a barter economy would be fine with accepting this. The transition of this value into a mean of exchange leads to a network effect were the good gets a **monetary value** as well, a so called **Tauschwert**. This is remarkable, as people who don’t value jewellery at all would start accepting this because of its **Tauschwert**. The same could be observed after World War II in Germany, were American cigarettes became a mean of exchange in the destroyed German economy. Even non-smokers accepted it after it had gotten a **Tauschwert**. Besides, there are exotic examples of monetary goods, such as the so-called ‘Rai stones’ in Micronesia that were small to very large round stones with a circle hole in the middle and not easily transportable but used as money. This is a nice example that a common belief can result in the emergence of money; but does the Micronesia example contradict Mises’ theorem? Not necessarily, as value is subjective and a very strong (also religious) belief might as well provide value in itself. Nevertheless, the more ‘classic’ transition of a valuable product resulting in money was clearly the norm.

But this is not enough. Money should also be hard to fake, it should ideally be dividable in smaller units and it should definitely be long lasting. All these reasons spoke for precious metals like gold and silver. In a nutshell, the fact that they are hard to fake and that their supply is not increasing ambiguously make them ideal money. Why is a solid and slow increasing supply important? If you aim at storing value in time, this characteristic follows from basic economic thinking of supply/demand. The demand is quite stable and will be increasing over time if societies and economies get more efficient. Trust in the fact that the gold or silver supply will not just double in two years make it ideal to store value over time. So, as people can’t be trusted easily, precious metals scarcity and their difficulty to counterfeit made them ideal for people to trade without trusting some specific entity. Unfortunately, there was one problem: States/ empires could monopolize the minting and this is what usually happened. The nominal value of a coin could be the same but the amount of precious metal inside could be reduced in order to mint more coins. The first quantitative easing was born! With these methods, empires could finance their expensive wars. The Roman Empire wars are a perfect example of this process.

As things went on, gold smiths (the first banks so to speak) started to accept gold, promised to deposit it in exchange for a paper certificate verifying the amount of gold; whoever claimed that certificate at the proto-bank was able to get the physical gold. This is where the ‘trust-layer’ comes in. Gold in itself is trust-less, one ounce of gold is one ounce of gold, period. But as human technology evolved over time making life more comfortable and easier, the need for convenient means of exchange representing money (the gold in deposits) like paper became clear. But you might guess the potential misuse of such a system. By issuing more certificates than what could be backed by gold, some proto-banks discovered the Cantillon effect / seigniorage: Whoever would make use of its newly created certificates first could accumulate wealth, while subsequent users would be faced with a decrease of the monetary value of their certificates. Indeed, after the new certificates find their way through the economy and aren’t hoarded somewhere, prices tend to go up, a phenomenon commonly referred to as ‘inflation’. Without going too much into detail, this process is not proportional by the amount of newly created certificates but generally in the long term, an effect on prices will occur. One could interpret this wealth transfer under the lens of the fundamental laws of thermodynamics (first and second law), which states (in very simplistic terms) that ‘nothing is for free’, no perpetuum mobile is possible. The very same scientific truth applied to the economy: Nothing is for free, someone always has to pay for it.

To speak it out clearly: This process is fraud and it is **not** compatible with property rights. By breaking the promise of gold depositing the bad actor clearly violates the underlying contract: most people would not voluntarily accept an ambiguously inflating certificate scheme. Also, it dilutes the purchasing power of old certificate holders. In a free-market system, these bad actors should get punished and be treated as criminals by the judicial system in place. But states/ empires began to monopolize and/or regulate the system and this is where the real drama begins. As states/ empires are **monopolies of force** with limited control mechanisms on how this force was and is used, it is clear that this institution has an interest in extracting purchasing power from the peasants (also called ‘taxpayer’ nowadays). Across history, war financing was the main incentive to expand the power even further. Nowadays, it is still war financing but also social welfare programmes, as the former also require large amounts of money (just check the government spending of the USA and you will be surprised by the fact that way more is spent on social programmes than on military even though the defence budget of the USA is more than insane).

**Free markets and capitalism are incompatible with fiat money**

As already stated, the dilution of purchasing power is fraud and incompatible with property rights. Of course, you might be free to found a bank that is issuing more certificates than gold deposits and tell your customers about this procedure from the very beginning orally and also via contracts. However, with other actors competing for this market this is not likely to be a sustainable business model. Why should anyone put his or her hard-earned money into such a bank?

This is why in today’s world, we do certainly **not** live in free markets as a lot of people think. We have elements of free markets for sure, certainly this is true and certainly comes in various flavours (take Australia for example and compare it to North Korea). But currently **all** states in the world have a fiat-money regime. Money in itself could be classified as an own type of good, neither consumption, nor production good. One might conclude that it constitutes a class of its own, a class of good that is so important that it represents one side of a trade for almost all trades in an economy. Free markets and capitalism **require** property rights as this is the very definition of it; if the means of production (land, labour, properties, machinery and so on) are private you have capitalism, period. Even the degree of ‘private property’ is controversial as the government owns large amounts of land; the government regulates a lot, so even if you are a private owner on paper, a state can regulate so much that it is de facto also an owner of your property (simply put, this is the model of fascism; instead of ‘collectivizing the means of production’, the government can ‘collectivize the individual’); your labour is taxed by the government and depending on where you live by quite a substantial amount and additionally a lot of people are paid directly by the government (local or federal) because they work as public officials and so on. But most importantly: Money as it is today is issued by central banks with no backing whatsoever; therefore a **central** bank perverts the concept of **free** markets and capitalism. Even if a central bank is partly ‘private’ as the Swiss National Bank (you can actually buy stocks from this central bank), central banks are a creation of law and **not** of free markets.

**Why the US gold standard was a fraud scheme**

**What is a gold standard?** In a strict and correct term, it means that **gold is money** and every paper certificate using as means of exchange is 100% backed by it. With this perspective, the USA actually gave it up with the founding of the First Bank of America in 1791. This central bank lasted until 1811 and was able to issue debt certificates in a higher amount than what could be backed by gold. The founding of the Second Bank of America in 1816 was again against the principle of a gold standard (or better: bimetallic standard, as written in the Constitution), this institution lasted until 1836. By the way: Andrew Jackson, President of the United States, fought against the Second Bank of America and vetoed its charter in 1833. In 1913, with the creation of the Federal Reserve Bank by the Federal Reserve Act, the concept of a national central bank became permanent compared to the former ones which only had licenses granted by congress. Officially, the USA still had a gold standard, but what is the motive behind a central bank under such a standard? Correct: Undermining it\*\*. I will come back to this point with the history of the Federal Reserve and the monetary supply during the 1920s.\*\*

In 1933, the fraud got its first large scale mark with the decision of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's Executive Order 6102 which came into effect the same year the Nazis gained power in Germany. With this Executive Order, it was forbidden for US citizens to own more than 100 USD in gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates within the continental United States. One ounce of gold was the equivalent of 35 USD. This means that the citizens had to bring the exceeding gold to the Federal Reserve System, there they got 35 USD in paper certificates for one ounce of gold. **This was an act of fraud and theft, because the Federal Reserve of course had the ability to increase the debt amount now as it could before, diluting paper certificate holders.**

The final act against the gold standard and its ultimate murder happened on August 15th 1971 by Richard Nixon, stating: ‘I have directed Secretary Connally to suspend **temporarily** the convertibility of the dollar into gold or other reserve assets, except in amounts and conditions determined to be in the interest of monetary stability and in the best interests of the United States.’ (source: [https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-the-nation-outlining-new-economic-policy-the-challenge-peace#axzz1UZnES7PMon](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-the-nation-outlining-new-economic-policy-the-challenge-peace#axzz1UZnES7PMon))

It took two world wars to get totally rid of a gold-standard; because of von Mises’ regression theorem people continued accepting fiat money; most of them did not even notice the difference after US President Richard Milhous Nixon ‘temporarily’ stopped the exchange of dollars to gold on August 15th 1971. Until now, this is still in effect; President Nixon probably understood the word ‘temporarily’ in cosmic orders of magnitude.

**Friedrich August von Hayek and the ‘Denationalisation of Money’**

Von Mises’ student Friedrich August von Hayek, the real opponent of John Maynard Keynes (and not Milton Friedman as commonly thought) proposed the ‘Denationalisation of Money’ published in 1976. This is a truly important work and it was published during the stagflation times in the USA (high price inflation rates, low economy growth and higher unemployment). Hayek understood one basic fact about gold standards: Even though gold is great in itself, the trust-layer with the government is flawed by design. **He proposed a free market for money to take away the power from the government.**

Do you want to know what kind of suffering has been imposed upon millions of people via fiat money? First: wars. The logic is relatively simple, you can’t finance large scale wars for a long time without fiat money; actually, the European nations abandoned the gold standard right at the outbreak of World War I (World War II was also financed by fiat money). Second, fiat money has been an instrument to steal people’s purchasing power with inflation. In its most extreme version, hyperinflation, the purchasing power has even been reduced to null. Inflating of the money supply has caused booms and busts (Mises’ and Hayek’s works on this topic is recommendable) as it also affects real interest rates, which then affect human behaviour and so on. Why is human behaviour affected? Well, if interest rates are lower than in a free market based on sound money, short-term borrowing becomes relatively easier and consumption is rewarded higher than long-term saving and wealth creation. Also, companies might start using cheaper debt to finance themselves which changes their capital structure. Economic ventures become ‘worth it’ with lower credit cost compared to the free market case. Furthermore, states also take more debt. Thus, in a system with artificially low interest rates, monetary funds, resources and human labour get allocated in a different way, usually less efficient way, than it would be in a sound money system. The day when central banks have to raise interest rates to avoid hyperinflation, the party ends: The debt costs increase and refinancing becomes more expensive. Without such a monetary system, the subprime mortgage crisis that lead to the financial crisis of 2007-2009 would have never been possible. These large risks wouldn’t have been taken by so many and actually, without huge additional money from the central banks and the business banks it would simply not be possible to drive a speculative frenzy of such epic proportions ruining a whole economy. There is more to this but this goes far beyond of the scope of a reddit post. The business banks’ contribution to the increase of money supply happens through the fractional reserve banking regime. What is fractional reserve banking you might ask? It means that a business bank can lend more money than it has in deposits; the minimum reserve is decided by the central bank. For example, if you have your deposits at a bank, you officially lend this money to the bank which in turn lends it to others; but by doing so, the business bank creates new virtual money, as the bank must not hold 100 % fiat reserves for all the claims; that is why bank-runs ruin banks, as they do not have enough funds to cover all claims if large amounts of customers want cash; maybe this makes you understand why central banks and governments are interested in introducing their own digital currencies, a real dystopic nightmare.

So, it is now clear that a free market for money would lead to more peace, more stable economies with lower, but steadier and more sustainable economic growth. And this is why private banking with solid money like gold and/ or silver is better than the current status quo. Hayek wanted government completely out of this; and that is for good reasons in regard to history and human nature. As already mentioned, even during the gold standard times in the USA, it was possible to issue more paper certificates than gold. The Federal Reserve actually did this during the roaring twenties, contributing to the frenzy during these times which lead to a catastrophe. Murray Newton Rothbard highlights this process in his work ‘America’s Great Depression’ from 1963. Rothbard was a student of Ludwig Edler von Mises and wrote besides economics also about financial history with focus on the USA. He teaches us that the Federal Reserve total Dollar claims on June 1921 were 44.7 billion USD with a total gold reserve of 2.6 billion USD. Then, on June 1929, the claimed Dollar amount rose to 71.8 billion USD, a **60.6% increase** while the gold reserves rose only to 3.0 billion USD, an **increase of 15.4%** (Table 2 on page 94, can freely be accessed via [https://cdn.mises.org/Americas%20Great%20Depression\_3.pdf](https://cdn.mises.org/Americas%20Great%20Depression_3.pdf); original source is \*\*Banking and Monetary Statistics (Washington, D.C.: Federal Reserve System, 1943), pp. 544–45, 409, and 346–48\*\*).

But there still is a problem: Even with a free market monetary system with a solid gold currency the trust-layer is still existent. At least it is not monopolized with the central bank and a cartel of business banks, but market participants still have to trust the depositing institution which usually is a bank, or used to be a bank as gold has been completely demonetized.

**The invention of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies**

This is where crypto comes in. I apologize for this long history travel, but it is important to understand cryptocurrencies’ significance. **With the invention of Bitcoin it was - for the first time in human history - possible to mimic gold and remove the trust-layer.** This is not an understatement.

Let this sink in. If you understand the motivation for sound money and the incompatibility of fiat money with property rights, its pivotal role in free markets and peace, then it becomes clear that Bitcoin is revolutionary. But you may wonder, how is it possible that even people supporting sound money, Peter Schiff being a prominent example, disagree with the concept of cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin? There might be multiple reasons to this, but one common argument is that it has no ‘inherent’ value. **However, by applying von Mises’ regression theorem, one can definitely conclude why Bitcoin has value:** First, we went from barter to primitive money until many cultures and societies discovered gold and silver which were widely used throughout history. Then governments introduced a purely fiat system; what gave fiat its value? It was not the government just stating ‘Here, accept it now!’, but a long-lasting connection to gold (even though not perfect, but still) the collective used Dollar certificates and other certificates in other countries for generations. It took two world wars to get to the current fiat regime: The change was quiet and did not really appear in people’s daily life until price inflation hit. Thus, the ‘regression’ went from gold, to gold certificates, to fiat. With fiat being flawed by design, Bitcoin was proposed to counter the problems that come with the trust-layer. This should certainly create a value for buyers, especially in countries where you see the purchasing power being molten. The historical perspective helps us understand why for Bitcoin and/ or other cryptocurrencies to be successful, a strong network effect is a prerequisite. Then the ‘regression’ pattern moves towards cryptocurrencies. This is commonly  named adoption. Which cryptocurrency or cryptocurrencies will succeed? Will it be Bitcoin? Ethereum? Another crypto? A mix of cryptos? Who knows? I certainly don’t; this decision has not been made by the market participants yet, as we are still in the early days. **So von Mises’ regression theorem tells us that the transition from a valuable good or a solid ground belief from the very beginning already happened and then regressed through time!**

Let’s note now that cryptocurrencies are also very powerful because governments will not be able to stop or control them. It is impossible to control every single machine connected to the internet. Even though we have nation states, at least we don’t have a world state with a world government; if one nation state decides to ban this technology - a ban that is already hard to enforce by itself - there will be incentives for other nation states to be even friendlier. A coordinated world-wide nation state attempt to destroy cryptocurrencies is practically impossible and even if, people will probably rise up as they understand that something has to be wrong.

This gives me hope. It is sad to see how governments and big corporations in bed with governments control people more and more and how the financial system gets sicker and sicker. Well, at least we do not have large scale totalitarianism as in the 20th century. But we witness the developments of more controls, more economic interventions, more money destruction through supply increase and this might lead us to more totalitarian states. But crypto is here to stay and evolve. And it is powerful. It is powerful because it is a means of disempowering nation states and the fiat money system. **Without fiat money, it is impossible to sustain and finance large states spending huge amounts of money in a way where the people making decisions did not earn the money by themselves**. It is especially impossible to finance large scale wars, a property that should by itself defeat the fiat money regime. The fiat regime is the core of statism and totalitarianism - without its core element, it can’t survive. Of course, disinformation is a crucial part of this, but it is not the core of statism and totalitarianism: Without fiat money but with disinformation, these political forces cannot achieve much. This an important point to understand, as modern large-scale wars and welfare states are impossible to finance with solid money. This is why you can’t logically promote Bitcoin or another serious crypto while being a collectivist, either a socialist or fascist. These ideologies are highly flawed in a practical and ethical sense; the argumentation about this statement (more from the practical side) has been done by Ludwig Edler von Mises himself in his masterpiece ‘Sozialismus: Eine ökonomische und soziologische Analyse’ (English: ‘Socialism: An Economic and Sociological Analysis’) from 1922. One of his main points is that under collectivized economies, the central planners can’t calculate on prices as there is no pricing mechanism telling participants what is worth pursuing and what isn’t. Indeed, with means of production that are not private, it makes rational decisions about pricing impossible because these very same means of productions have no price. Friedrich August von Hayek wrote a lot about the impossibility of collective economies, focusing on the information problem and the inherent decentralized dynamics of the market mechanism. But there are even more arguments against it, here is a simple one: Centralization of power in order to fulfill collective economies, be it on a local level with communities or on a large level across nation states, will always corrupt people, and notably more so in the latter case, as human nature is as it is (humans want the outputs without putting in the work and the energy). There would be no problem with socialistic/ communistic or fascist communities if they respected property rights of others, but they don’t by definition. This is the moral difference between collectivism and individualism: Under an individualistic, property rights centered order, you can try whatever you want unless you don’t violate the property rights of others. In this setup, if you want to start a collectivist paradise by yourself and find people who want to voluntarily join you, you are free to do this. Ironically, starting a business and/ or using sound money under a collectivist order would possibly result in penalties and in your death in the worst case. Interesting fact: Even when done voluntarily, collectivist models fail. This can be exemplified with the New Harmony project in Indiana (USA) during the 19th century or even the Kibbutzim in Israel, many of which failed and of the remaining ones, the large majority threw their hard-core collectivist ideals away. It is also interesting that internet devices and smart phones found their way to Kibbutzim nowadays. It should not be explained that under a total collectivized global economic regime, hard work and innovation leading to our daily life’s devices wouldn’t be possible, just by the nature of human incentives and behaviour.

**Smart contracts and beyond**

Even though Bitcoin started as being a ‘Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash-System’ and now seems to find its role as a store of value (with a lot of speculative elements as it is still early), the idea of smart contracts provides even more power to decentralization by allowing to participate in businesses and trades without the trust-layer. This is achievable by Decentralized-Finance or Non-Fungible-Tokens which could become a standard for property exchange. They could one day register governance via a hard-encoded trust-less protocol on a blockchain, or handle bond and stock exchanges that work with lower costs and higher efficiency without intermediaries. Way more applications could probably be enabled by a such a decentralized, trust-ensuring protocol. All of this is unstoppable and will transform the world for the better. I am so happy and proud that it all started with Bitcoin, with all its ups and downs and insane stories. The sector keeps evolving, attracting more and more visionaries and great minds contributing their part to this field.

Furthermore, the impact of these technologies on governance can truly be disruptive, allowing more transparency in public finances to prevent corruption when dealing with public money in a city, province or even nation state. There are many issues yet to be solved from a technical and also architecture point of view (surely, it is useful to have privacy in the sense that nobody can track where the tax money is coming from, but as soon as it is on the public side ready to be spent, an immutable blockchain could be quite helpful here). The decentralisation of cryptos might even lead to political decentralisation, solving problems on the local level where they arose in the first place. Who knows where this journey will bring us?

Before finishing, it shall be mentioned that the large banking sector needs the government and vice versa. Simplistic thinking might lead some to the conclusion that one single governmental bank and the abolition of interest rates will solve all problems, but if you made it until here, you probably understand why this is utopist and flawed. Governments are dangerous and as long as centralization of power exists, special interests (especially from the banking side) will always lobby and gain privileges, period. With sound money, the very core enabling large powerful states is removed. Besides, with the use of smart contracts for governance there will hopefully be some additional pressure towards political decentralization. Always remember: Special interests will always try to collude governments and the more centralization, the easier it gets. It is no surprise that Ancient Greece with its decentralized nature with hundreds of small city states flourished so much compared to other areas of the world which marked the beginning of a historic journey until we got modern civilization which was born and carried out in Europe. Also, it doesn’t come to any surprise that many small city states nowadays allow their citizens high levels of wealth without access to natural resources. Even the decentralized nature of Switzerland, advocated by many (especially by citizens from the surrounding European Union with its centralistic tendencies) as combining the current best political system in the world, doesn’t come to any surprise. In fact, when looking at economic and social freedom combined, Switzerland is the freest country in the world. By the way, the canton of Zug where you can find the so-called ‘crypto valley’ is also located in Switzerland.

**Conclusion**

Cryptocurrencies are here to stay. They will transform this world. Hayek’s dream will come true, as there are no means by which governments can stop this evolution. I am convinced that Hayek would be deeply happy about the evolution of this field. The failure of fiat will be the victory of crypto. Even though gold and silver are great for monetary purposes, especially when thinking about an intelligent alien in our galaxy that would probably rather accept gold than a cryptocurrency, **it is human nature and thus the trust-layer that make a monetary system prone to corruption, legal action and intervention by the government possible. This messes up things even more than single bad actors in the market in the long run.** This is why gold and silver, being valued not only for jewellery, but also electronics and industry nowadays will probably always be valuable and a good hedge against price inflation in the long term. Their physical properties (noteworthy that silver is the element with the highest electrical conductivity which make it unique) give them their own strengths and powers.

I believe that it is too early to say which cryptocurrency or cryptocurrencies will make it; let us see. Maximalism is a single-minded attitude in a fast evolving and relatively new field. Only time will tell what will succeed and what won’t. But I can assure you one thing: **The idea of decentralized cryptocurrencies will succeed and make this world a better place. Hayek’s idea is more powerful than ever before and it is gaining power and popularity. The failure of fiat will be the victory of crypto.**

So about a month ago I made the smart decision to trade my $1300/mo BMW car payment down to a $300/mo payment on a Honda. I had about $15k in equity on the BMW which I took in a check vs putting it toward the Honda.

I currently owe about $17k on the Honda @ 1.9% for 60mo. Should I just pay the car off or keep paying the loan since the interest rate is so low?

personalfinance,Tackling student loans with property profit?,"I recently sold a property and made a little over $75k. Typically, I would look for another property but in this market, I’m less willing to sink the money into something vastly overpriced. I don’t need to do anything with this money. I have active retirement savings and a hefty emergency fund. My daily life expenses are minimal and my income covers them.

However, I have just about $50k in student loans. They’re federal so they haven’t been accruing interest and won’t begin again until 9/30 of this year. I’ve been paying double the monthly payment to use this interest freeze to my advantage. I’m on track for PSLF but I’m not holding my breath. To me, I’d rather be able to pay them off sooner instead of paying for 6 more years (out of 10 total) and hope that some is forgiven.

I don’t want to wipe the student loans away totally because they’re not negatively impacting my life. But I’d like to greatly reduce them if it’s wise.

I was thinking of paying $35k off now in one lump sum, leaving about $15k. I would continue making more than the minimum payment so the loans could be paid off in a year or so. Is this a good idea? Should I make this move while the interest freeze is still in place?  If this isn’t the move, what should I do differently?",finance
CryptoCurrency,Central Bank Digital Currencies,"I've been doing a lot of research lately around the Federal Reserve and other central banks, specifically as they interact on the bond markets with repos and reverse repo facilities being established. In that process, I've been finding a lot of talk around Central Bank Digital Currencies and the various uses and implementations that central banks are looking at. I just read the post at the top of this sub regarding Venezuela rolling out their own digital currency so I thought I'd share the big picture here. 

I'll try to keep it relatively top-line and objective, but feel free to ask any questions in the comments. 

Let's start with the basics, what is a [CBDC](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc.asp): A central bank digital currency (CBDC) uses an electronic record or digital token to represent the virtual form of a fiat currency of a particular nation (or region). A CBDC is centralized; it is issued and regulated by the competent monetary authority of the country.

There are a handful of countries looking at different options, most recently the US Federal Reserve announced they are also exploring one. This obviously has a plethora of ramifications across global financial markets, and it's a hot topic of discussion at the IMF (International Monetary Fund). 

Recently, they released a paper titled [Reserve Currencies in an International Monetary System](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/Departmental-Papers-Policy-Papers/Issues/2020/11/17/Reserve-Currencies-in-an-Evolving-International-Monetary-System-49864) \- I recommend reading through that if you want to better understand foreign currency reserves and how they factor in total monetary supply, currency valuations, market liquidity, and the overall global economy.   
Specifically, about 40 pages into it, they list out 3 potential outcomes for what they call **“Technology and Reserve Currency Configurations: Long-Term Scenarios”**

1.  **The Rise and Fall of the CBDC** \- basically, the concept of CBDCs comes and goes and we continue to utilize FIAT currencies or another solution is introduced
2. **A world of multiple private digital currencies -** This scenario starts off in a global setting wherein increased anxiety about governments’ capacity to deliver on their socioeconomic objectives erodes credibility of public institutions, including fiat currencies. In parallel, big technology companies continue to grow, offering more services and platform payment instruments. Their efforts to enhance privacy and corporate governance pay off, and people increasingly prefer private payment platforms to fiat currencies. Over time, as more people use the private payment instruments, these become digital currencies—full-fledged private currencies that fulfill all the roles of money. A few large digital currency areas emerge, on the basis of digital interconnected- ness. Governments retreat from most of their roles as technology corporations expand the scope of their services. National central banks lose relevance. AI is used to establish exchange parities between digital currencies by facilitating price finding. To maintain credibility of the system, a technology consortium is set up to supervise the digital networks and provide emergency liquidity financing by pooling digital currencies across currency areas. Traditional reserve assets thus cease to exist and are replaced by holdings of private digital currencies.
3. **A new form of money based on personal data that becomes a global currency -** In response to growing concerns about the misuse of personal data, privacy laws are tightened, giving individuals full control over their personal data. To access and use such data, companies begin to purchase data off individuals using “data tokens”—a payment instrument issued as a claim on their goods and services. Technological advances allow for enhanced methods of data collection and increase the supply of data, leading to AI-based processes and products, which in turn create a greater demand for data. Technology also makes it possible to privately value and monetize data and transfer it securely to willing buyers on a decentralized marketplace in exchange for data tokens. These tokens thus become a global digital currency widely used by both individuals, to supplement their traditional income, and product providers. The use of fiat monies is very limited, and the effectiveness of the monetary policy is significantly reduced. Instead, fiscal policy becomes the main tool for domestic macroeconomic stabilization, using data token-based fiscal instruments. Countries hold reserves in data tokens, along with real assets, particularly gold, to mitigate against the risks of cyberattacks or loss of credibility of the system.

I'll save the speculation around which option is most likely and/or the 'best' - but I thought the group here would find these potential scenarios interesting, and hopefully spark conversation as to what we think the future of currency might look like on a global scale.",cryptocurrency

NFT,Promoting a brand new BSC-based online strategy game : CryptoCity !,"Hello All !

Please let me introduce you the brand new NFT-based strategy game : r/CryptoCity_official.

It is a real-life-data game, where every city is represented by a NFT.

The main datas used are the population of the city, the population and area of the country, the HDI, the GDP; datas provided by the [United Nations development program](http://hdr.undp.org/en/home).

The goal is to build the strongest empire, and to battle with others emperors to be the master of the planet ! 

Every empire will compete according to these criteria : 

&amp;#x200B;

* **Attack:** Based on the population of the city and the technological bonus.  
 
* **Defense:** Based on the population of the city, the demographic data of its country (area &amp; population) and the cultural bonus.  
 
* **Technological Bonus:** Based on the population of the city and the demographic data of its country (GDP, area &amp; population).  
 
* **Cultural bonus:** Based on the population of the city and the demographic data of its country (HDI, area &amp; population).  
 

The first 50 cities have been minted and are already available via the website [https://cryptocity.games/#/home](https://cryptocity.games/#/home) ! 

At this occasion, the first 50 buyers will receive, in addition to the city's NFT, a **free coupon** exchangeable for a booster, when they will be available. 

**The boosters will reinforce your army when you will battle against another empire. For exemple, they will boost your defense when you are under attack, or boost your population when you start a battle.**

To obtain the cities you like and see how many coupons are left, **you need to visit our dApp using a browser connected to a wallet compatible with the Binance Smart Chain and the Web3 protocol.**

The stakes are not only to be the greatest emperor, but also to gain Crypto City Coins during the battles. 

Indeed the battles will be the occasion to put some coins on the table during each fight.

This cryptocurrency will be the force of the war, and the first emperors will receive as much coins as the size of the population when the CryptoCity battles will open !

This dAPP will also contain a market place where you can sell the cities and boosters you previously purchased.

If you want to know more details about where we stand and what will happen in the near future, please visit our FAQ and roadmap there : [https://cryptocity.games/#/roadmap](https://cryptocity.games/#/roadmap)

I'm not sure if assets factor into this but I could pay off 100% of my debt right now and I'm choosing not to because I have been making higher returns than the interest rates for 3 years now.

My credit report wasn't very helpful. It just said essentially there's not enough history and my oldest account was opened too recently. So nothing I can actually change.

A few things I could think would be affecting it:

About 2 years ago I stupidly didn't close out a credit card with a bank I'd moved funds out of and it ended up going 60 days past due before I noticed. The balance was nothing, like $80 or something. I paid it off and closed out the card. It did show up on my credit report though as a delinquent account. Should I dispute it? It's not technically inaccurate but it's not really indicative of me as a borrower, either.

In college I'd often only be able to pay 70-80% of the credit card balance and would slowly accrue debt. I paid that off and haven't gotten any interest charges for almost 5 years now.",finance
CryptoCurrency,Real Estate and Federal Reserve and why Crypto is the future.,"After 3 days of dealing with difficult sellers who have gotten very greedy.   I have came to the conclusion that Crypto is the future currency.  Please follow my logic.   The federal reserve has kept rates incredibly low and artificially inflating real estate prices and rent prices to incredible levels.   Sellers have gotten extremely greedy asking prices way above market value.    Home prices and rent are completely unaffordable.  Basically,  the Fed here has lost control of the plot and we can't rely on them to look for the benefit of everyday people.   When Jerome powell was asked what he thought about the situation.   He basically responded with ""Fuck off,  tell builders to build more houses, its not my problem""

They are here to protect corporations and the system in place.     This is why I think the whole thing gonna come crashing down with inflation going out of control.

Bitcoin,Inflation Letting the Air Out of My Dreams,"20 years ago, I decided my occupation. It seemed like the best way to make $100k a year, which is how much I thought I would need to get to upper-middle class. I went through the military to pay for school, took a long time to finish school, and took a long time to get my first career-level job. The job I got was a low-paying government job. After 5 years working for the government, I was able to get a 60% raise by doing the same job in the private sector. I finally made it to $100k per year!

I've been working that job for a couple years now, and I'm definitely not affording an upper-middle class lifestyle. I live in a 700 square foot condo that costs me about $2k/month. I don't even have a good view because I'm right at tree height, so I can just see a tree. I take wilderness-oriented vacations to avoid blowing a bunch of money on hotels. I do have a cool vehicle, but it's years old. I'm also putting up 15% of my income to retirement accounts because I didn't do that at all in my 20's.

To try to explain why I can't live a cushier lifestyle, I looked up how much inflation has ravaged the dollar in the past two decades. It's about 50%. So to get the buying power that I set out to get 20 years ago, I need to make about $150k/year. Not impossible in my field, but it'll be another 5 or 10 years, and maybe another job hop. At which point it'll be $160k/year. I might make my goal income for a few years before I retire-maybe.

personalfinance,Aggressively pay off student loans or start contributing to retirement (no match) when you probably won't ever be a high earner?,"Hi there!

I've searched and found a few posts discussing this topic but wanted to ask a little more uniquely. Ultimately in my career, I may be self-employed freelance full time one day (that is the goal) but for now I do work at a company as a W2 part time and freelance part time. My W2 job right now offers a 401k that I will be eligible for in just a few days, and previously I had been feeling certain that I would not participate until I've paid off my debt. Now I'm not as confident.

Basically though, in my field, I really *want* to be full time freelancer one day. That is the kind of work I enjoy, and also pays more (my top earning salary at my company with 0 opportunity to get a raise is $34.50/hr, and working over 25hrs/wk kills your soul so I am determined to remain only part time). So this weighs into my decision of where to park retirement money, right?

Stats:

~$5,000 in my emergency fund, working my way slowly up to $10k.

Federal student loans, mixed of unsub/sub: $8516.86, 4.66% interest rate once the freeze expires. $89/m minimum payment

Misc. Medical bill: ~$900 or so remaining, no interest, will be paid off in October ($177/m)

Mainly, my questions for your consideration are:

- Should I contribute to the 401k when I may or may not always have access to it through a company? Or should I take my funds to a Roth IRA instead on the chance that I do not always work as a W2?

- Since my medical bill will be paid off around the same time as the federal freeze, I was planning to just start throwing the same amount ($177) at it with the intention of getting that principal down.

altcoin,$Milk and $Butter token continue to persevere amidst market wide downturn with an upcoming special celebration on World Milk Day!,"June 1st is World Milk Day and there will be a special giveaway and video release. See the teaser on our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/milk_token/status/1399105881824894977?s=21)

We have our live video [AMA](https://www.twitch.tv/milkbuttertoken) tonight!

Last weekend a donation of nearly $70k went to helping feed those in need. $34,772 went to “Action Against Hunger” and $34,336 went to “Food For Life Global”. Our donation to [FFLG](https://twitter.com/fflglobal/status/1396473562249236481?s=21) fed 137,344 children during a market dip. While the value of crypto may be lower this week, the values of Milk and Butter LLC remain high!

News from this week:

• Over 40k $Milk holders and 7k $Butter holders

• Now listed on “Action Against Hunger’s” [website.](https://www.actionagainsthunger.org/about/partners)

• We released the new voting contract that includes tiered NFTs with official artwork on all!

• Currently in the process of forming a relationship with an independent marketing firm to assist us in the marketing of the Milk and Butter tokens.

• Working with a brand specialist for a yet to be announced product.

• Nearly $70k donated to “Action Against Hunger” and “Food For Life Global”

Milk and Butter tokens, for those that haven’t heard, are companion tokens in the Binance Smart Chain with an emphasis on charity giving. Milk is an RFI token that can be staked to generate Butter, which is used to power community voting for their favorite charities on a weekly basis. Those that merely wish to vote may purchase Butter tokens on the open market as well, which also drives rewards for those that stake Milk! 
https://www.milktoken.net/voting.html

5% of all Butter transactions are guaranteed to go to a charity wallet. In addition, Butter can be used to suggest new charities.
https://www.milktoken.net/suggest.html

$440k has been donated to charity so far, at a very low market cap. We made crypto history when Butter became the first BEP-20 token to partner with a major food charity: Food For Life Global  https://ffl.org/20077/cryptocurrency-butter-token/

The liquidity for both the Milk and Butter tokens is locked away until 2022, at which point both will be relocked. Our Market cap is still low with a solid base, we're building our community for healthy growth, and we’ll continue to develop this project with many exciting use cases plus a full array of features to be rolled out as development completes.

Each week the Milk and Butter token team hosts AMAs with the Developer on Twitch where the community can ask any questions they may have. Occasionally, we have guests, such as when the CEO of “Food For Life Global” joined us and explained the amazing genesis of “Food for Life Global” and took viewer questions. Our AMA’s stream every Sunday at 3am UTC [here.](https://www.twitch.tv/milkbuttertoken)

Roadmap: 
• Gamification of the tokens

• Expanding our number of partnerships

• The voting and staking processes will continue to be refined to make the experience as easy and accessible as possible.

• Planned instructional content to help those new to crypto learn about the space and how to purchase and use the Milk and Butter tokens.

• Additional exchange listings


Accomplishments so far: 
• Code built from the ground up to develop both tokens.

• Unique staking and voting systems implemented.
$440,000 donated to various charities in the first month.

• Official global charity partnership with “Food For Life Global” and “Action Against Hunger” (The first token to partner with two major food charities)

• Milk has been [audited](https://dessertswap.finance/audits/Milk%20Token%20BEP-20%20Audit%206361622.pdf)

• $Butter has been [audited](https://dessertswap.finance/idverified.html)

• The developer is [doxxed ](https://christianclaypool.wordpress.com/about/)

• Milk and Butter LLC is established with full team being doxxed [here.](https://www.milktoken.net/#team)

• First NFT developed for voting on the charity poll

• 3 separate tiers of voting NFTs with new voting contract

personalfinance,*help* student loans and credit!,"Hi Reddit!

Looking for some guidance on how to pay off my student loans and improve my credit score along with it. Here’s my current situation, I have 18k in federal student loans but would like to pay them off within the year. I haven’t been making payments since covid and have been in deferment prior to that. Would it be more advantageous to do smaller monthly payments or large installments? I have 3 loans that make up the 18k ( basically all around 6k each) and ideally I’d like to pay off one every 3 months starting in June. Is this a good approach or should I just make 2k payments monthly until it’s paid off? Does it even matter how I go about it? Could I just pay it all in one go? Honestly just want pay them off the quickest way possible since I finally have the means to do so but I’m confused as to which way would improve or harm my credit. Any advice is surely appreciated, thanks!!",finance
cardano,Cardano Rumor Rundown MAY 31 2021,"Hey Everyone!

Let's go...

Newly covered today: 

1. The ecosystem is growing so fast, it’s hard to keep up with all the projects without these infographics at this point. [https://twitter.com/Dr\_shwetaPHD/status/1398783893638103040](https://twitter.com/Dr_shwetaPHD/status/1398783893638103040)
2. The Cardano subreddit is at 487k users. Half a million isn’t far away. [https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/)
3. Epoch 268 is a wrap as of yesterday with 22.83 billion ADA staked. [https://adapools.org/epochs](https://adapools.org/epochs)

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. The Essential Cardano List is published by IOHK. (credit to [/u/cascading\_disruption](https://www.reddit.com/u/cascading_disruption/) for pointing this out) [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1390728385945550848](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1390728385945550848)
2. Cryptodoggies.org NFTs are now available. The website says 50% will go to a community voted animal charity. [https://www.cryptodoggies.org/](https://www.cryptodoggies.org/)
3. For those learning Haskell, Check out this new video on Type Theory. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7blCeETJo8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7blCeETJo8)
4. Also, Lars puts out a new Plutus Pioneers video on Native tokens. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VbhY162GQA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VbhY162GQA)
5. ADA is the most crypto of all cryptos. George of CryptosRUs pointed out in a recent video that he couldn’t find any trace of a VC firm owning Cardano in its portfolio in his search of the categories section on CMC. This makes sense if you know Cardano. Would freedom and decentralization loving Satoshi not throw up a little in his mouth to find out that VC ownership of cryptos was a metric people would care about in 2021? The lack of VC stake in the very decentralized and freedom loving Cardano only adds to our already iron-clad claim on the mantle of the most crypto of all crypto projects. Our ecosystem never sought to attract VC money that would only centralize ownership in a smaller number of hands. This doesn’t even address the current extreme centralization of block validation in BTC and ETH.

6. IOHK has dropped a new article on the status of KEVM and IELE. Grigori Rosu of Runtime Verification says a proof-of-concept of IELE should be ready in six months. This is a key component in how we get to the ocean of all developers as we grow beyond the pond.

7. Cardano saw a new challenger enter the scene with Internet Computer (ICP) debuting very high on the CoinMarketCap charts. However, a look into ICP makes one question whether they are really in the Gen. 3 Blockchain race at all given that available information indicates the blockchain runs via datacenters hosting standardized hardware and that those datacenters can only join the network with the permission of the “Network Nervous System”. You could say that the winner of the Gen. 3 Blockchain race needs to solve the blockchain trilemma of decentralization, security, and scalability. If that’s true, then it’s arguable that ICP is not even competing in the decentralization leg of the race. [https://youtu.be/zHl-oVPoX88?t=97](https://youtu.be/zHl-oVPoX88?t=97)

19. John O’Connor on CNBCAfrica! He gave a really good explanation of how Africa with it’s already very high adoption of mobile payment wallets can leapfrog the legacy payment systems currently in use in more developed countries.

22. What if these two got to talking about what Atala Prism could bring to the table for students in the city of Miami? [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1393574632305868805](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1393574632305868805)
23. The saga of BTC maximalists being angry at Elon continues with Elon implying that Tesla could sell its BTC while Cardano continues just doing its thing like normal. [https://twitter.com/elonmusk/with\_replies](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/with_replies)
24. Likewise, Marc Cuban tried to FUD real world use of Cardano only to be confronted with a giant infographic of use cases and partnerships along with an explanatory video just for him. [https://twitter.com/mcuban/status/1393646131708665858](https://twitter.com/mcuban/status/1393646131708665858) [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1393689887648272384](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1393689887648272384)
25. Initial Stakepool Offerings (“ISOs”) are here. Crypto is no stranger to novel means of capital formation and now the Cardano ecosystem is getting in on the action.

26. ICYMI, Manuel Chakravarty reminds us all that his Cardano Summit 2020 talk is publicly available for questions on native assets. Really interesting discussion of the asset identifier just being a hash of the policy script and how that helps create a super lightweight easy to use system.

30. The Cardano Foundation is out to do something incredible with supply chains as described in the fireside chat! In his previous Cardano Live appearance, Frederik Gregaard, CF CEO, also expressed a very healthy and sustainable perspective on what DeFi should become. He compared the current state of DeFi to just moving funds from your left pocket to your right pocket and taking profit. [https://youtu.be/d8uPMZplfeM](https://youtu.be/d8uPMZplfeM) [https://youtu.be/xbMSQUA1lss](https://youtu.be/xbMSQUA1lss)
31. The ISO model entering the capital formation toolbox in Cardano is going to make the stake pool game extremely interesting with SPOs scrambling to find the right balance between rewarding ADA and giving their delegators other things like tokens. Some stake pools could even become like portfolio funds with relationships with many different projects the tokens of which are given to delegators. Babel Fees could also play a role here for smart SPOs as they may allow access to a wide variety of tokens in the ecosystem that could be used to reward delegators with a sort of index fund exposure to a wide variety of Cardano projects.
32. May Cardano 360 coming one week from today (always the last Thursday of the month). [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1395117067960045569](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1395117067960045569)

34. The Cardano Foundation has released the full video of the Fireside Chat with Eva and Fred. Lots of questions answered on a variety of fronts. Very interesting remarks including that in discussions with financial institutions, Fred has found they are interested in exposure to the alpha provided by the asset class in general, tokenization of assets, and the yield provided by staking rewards. Fred counters that they SHOULD be far more interested in the Cardano standard including the concepts of reference accounts, programmability of money, and transaction metadata.

35. In a video press release yesterday, the Fed finally admitted that it’s moving toward a central bank digital currency (just like every other central bank). This will eventually be impactful on Cardano and every other crypto ecosystem. [https://youtu.be/WOAQxpG79Ag](https://youtu.be/WOAQxpG79Ag)
36. The Treasury is trying to figure out how to get cryptocurrency regulation in a headlock. This will probably go hand-in-hand with the Fed’s March toward a CBDC. Afterall, what good is all the tracking and monitoring afforded by a CBDC if it’s easier for everyone to just use a non-central bank digital currency? Tax evasion in crypto is also obviously a target problem since we know only about 800 people a year paid taxes on crypto in 2013-2015.

59. The May Cardano 360 was yesterday and we had lots of updates including the Color Coding for the different stages of the testnet! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS33gRj9JYE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS33gRj9JYE)
60. Alonzo “Blue” Era Testnet (through mid June; &lt;50 user cohort) will include the basic functionality of the system for testing basic contracts . Initially the SPOs will be included, then some of the Plutus Pioneers will be allowed in, then a few of the outside development firms (Plutus Partners). The Plutus Partners will be working on specific areas including oracles, DEXs, stablecoins, NFTs, and DeFi. This will produce code and documentation that will be publicly available.
61. Alonzo “White” Era Testnet (mid June to mid July; &lt;500 user cohort) will add more Plutus Pioneers and more functionality. They will develop various dApps and there will be interaction on the user side of these dApps. They will do some benchmarking at this stage.
62. The Alonzo Hard Fork Combinator Event requires a lot of different pieces come together at the same time. But, this is not their first rodeo and they have a lot of experience with this from the ITN, Shelley, and etc.
63. Alonzo “Purple” Era Tesnet (mid July to mid August; fully public) will involve a full public network with all of the Plutus pioneers, the Rosetta Api to the exchanges, Daedalus, hardware wallets, graphQL, and full functionality. The purpose of this phase will be optimization.
64. Alonzo “Red” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will involve a new network where they can test scalability and stability.
65. Alonzo “Black” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will be the final public testnet where they will ensure they have their candidate mainnet releases ready to launch on the mainnet.
66. They are committed to making sure there is a very large group of people who are familiar with using the Alonzo testnet by the time the mainnet launches.
67. Alonzo Mainnet (August-September). It’s looking like Alonzo mainnet launch was positioned in very late August through September in the infographics. That makes me assume there is a chance of August, much better chance of September, and also some chance of October or later. This is blockchain development after all. Also, we’ve waited years. Why care about a few weeks?
68. There will be another Plutus Pioneers Cohort later this summer.
69. Marlowe Run will be a browser product that can run on mobile or desktop. It can be linked to your wallet and be used to run Cardano smart contracts simultaneously on a distributed basis across multiple user browsers. The user interface is light years ahead of anything we saw in Marlowe Meadow or the Marlowe Playground simulations. It will include a library of off-the-shelf contracts.
70. There will be a Marlowe Webinar on June 3. Register here: [https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/](https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/)
71. The ERC-20 converter was looking very intuitive and seamless in the new demo. It should be on the testnet in June.
72. Manuel Chakravarty gave a big update on Hydra (layer 2 scaling). Hydra will not require that the base layer be modified since it will be implemented via Plutus smart contracts. Hydra is actually a collection of protocols including Hydra Head and Hydra Tail. Hydra Head is a symmetric protocol where multiple participants will be online simultaneously for the whole period of the head exchanging messages. Hydra Tail is an asymmetric protocol involving a high performance server and many clients that may be mobile and could be offline for large portions of the tail’s existence. There will also be “inter head &amp; tail networking” which will allow for a network of heads and tails. They have a published research paper on Hydra Head. They are currently writing the Hydra Tail paper.
73. Hydra is distinguished from other layer 2 protocols by its isomorphic properties. This means you will be able to run any smart contract that works on the base layer in a Hydra Head! This is very special. We won’t need special purpose contracts built out just for layer 2. There are some big implications to this. Since a Hydra Head is essentially just a Plutus smart contract, this means you can run a Hydra Head inside another Hydra Head. It’s turtles all the way down, guys. It sounds like they can do this iteratively as much as they want.
74. Aggelos also gave a good presentation on the importance of “skin in the game” in resource based consensus protocols (both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake) and its effect on promotion or discouragement of centralization. He explained how Ouroboros has built-in safeguards to prevent centralization including the K parameter (currently at 500) which caps total rewards per pool and the alpha parameter (currently at 0.3) which splits rewards into a 77% piece and a 23% piece. A pool can take its share of the 77% piece based on the pool’s total stake and its share of the 23% piece based on the pledge of the SPO. A higher alpha parameter makes it less attractive for individual SPOs to proliferate multiple pools since they can’t be as leveraged on their available pledge and still get as big a share of the 23% piece. This also discourages Sybil Attacks. As Cardano on-chain governance progresses, these parameters will be controlled by the community.
75. There will be a Cardano Goguen Summit in September. It will be hybrid digital/in-person.
76. Charles is helping to bring the cryptographer who broke SHA-1 to the University of Wyoming. The Cardano funded blockchain lab there could be on the road to be a powerhouse.

79. Professor Aggelos Kiayias recently dropped a video explaining exactly how Mithril (apparently neckbeard dungeon master talk for elf armor) is going to allow for Perfect Cardano (ADA) wallets that combine the ease of use and convenience of light wallets with the trustlessness of full node wallets. We also learned exactly how Mithril is going to work. [https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk](https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk)
80. In proof-of-work, bootstrapping can be done with blockheaders. This won’t do in proof-of-stake since we need information about stakeholder distribution to confirm block validity.
81. Mithril fixes this by being a cryptographic construction that enables a population of stakeholders to issue a signature consistent with certain constraints.
82. For Mithril to work in proof-of-stake, it needs three crucial properties: 1) it needs to enforce a threshold ratio of stakeholders before the signature is issued; 2) the pre-signature fragments must be independently verified and subject to public aggregation; and 3) it must be efficient in the sense that the final signature is of constant size and is logarithmically dependent on the # of stakeholders.
83. Stakeholders will issue special Mithril keys along with the normal cryptographic key material. Then at regular intervals, full nodes will test whether they can produce a pre-signature fragment. Only a random subset of stakeholders will be eligible to produce a pre-signature fragment.  When a sufficient # of pre-signature fragments have been issued by eligible stakeholders then it will be possible to aggregate the fragments into a final signature. 
84. This will be a checkpoint that will be verifiable with respect to previous check points all the way back to the genesis block. Such checkpoints will be cryptographic commitments of the relevant UTXOs.  
85. Since the checkpoints will be trustless, a light client (i.e. wallet) will only need to verify the sequence of checkpoints up to the current time to trustlessly bootstrap.

Bitcoin,The bitcoin standard,"I just read the book but I still have some questions.
Historically, devaluing the currency has failed to produce economic growth and has led to malinvestments that bring less value to society than the cost. This leads to a recession or correction of the market. But in newer times we still keep on devaluing the currency even though it's the root of the problem. How could we ever change this pattern when there is so much support in government for this monetary policy? It feels so far away if it ever  were to happen. Or do we even want this to happen? After all, a devaluation of the currency leads to higher values of bitcoin in fiat. Will bitcoin become the world's currency naturally as more people tend to the hardest currency? It all feels like a far away dream. Could someone shed some light on the time frame we are looking at?",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,Another US Regulator Wants Agencies to Join Hands to Regulate Crypto,"The Joe Biden administration seems to be filled with regulators distrustful of bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptoassets - as there are new signals that the US regulators are aiming to 'rein in' the crypto industry by establishing collaborations between agencies.

US financial authorities have set their eyes on the crypto market and are gearing up to regulate it more actively, given the increasing concern that a lack of proper oversight risks harming savers and investors. However, this may take time, as the country's regulators are yet to figure out who has the legal authority to oversee this market, per the Financial Times (FT).

Michael Hsu, the newly appointed Acting Comptroller of the Currency, wants the US officials to work together to set a ""regulatory perimeter"" for cryptoassets.

""It really comes down to coordinating across the agencies. [...] Just in talking to some of my peers, there is interest in co-ordinating a lot more of these things,"" Hsu told the FT.


Janet Yellen, the Treasury secretary - who said that bitcoin is ""a high-risk, speculative investment"" - already suggested there'd be a change in approach to crypto with the appointment of Hsu at this position.

Another sign that the US is readying for a new approach was the first meeting held earlier in May of ""an inter-agency sprint team,"" focused on crypto regulation. Three major federal bank regulators were involved: Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Reserve, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

According to Hsu, the goal of this team was to ""put some ideas in front of the agencies to consider"" as they try to catch up with the growth in crypto, but not to make policies.

""It's small and it's senior,"" he was quoted as saying. ""The idea is that time is of the essence and if it's too big that gets harder.""

This meeting followed Hsu's announcement of a staff review of specific actions by those previously in charge of the OCC, including those actions related to cryptoassets, as well as a decision to give national trust charters to companies that provide custody services for cryptoassets.

For Hsu, the blockchain technology is likely here to stay, but while different platforms are creating innovative and ""promising"" payment processing tools, these are also risky, potentially leading to a large shadow banking system. The enthusiasm surrounding the banking innovation is to him reminiscent of the financial crisis, per the FT.

As a reminder, Hsu took over the OCC from Blake Paulson, who had stepped into the role after the January step-down by Brian Brooks - a former executive at crypto exchange Coinbase and current Chief Executive Officer at Binance.US. Brooks was therefore crypto-friendly and had made major strides towards its adoption in the eight months he had spent as the comptroller.

But Yellen, Hsu, and their stances towards crypto are not the only changes in the regime that may signal tightening the regulatory belt around crypto.

As reported, last week Gary Gensler, Chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sworn into office last April, told US lawmakers that he wanted to work with other regulatory agencies and the Congress to ""fill in the gaps of investor protection in these crypto markets.""

He further argued that, as no crypto exchange has to date registered as an exchange with the SEC, the regulation has resulted in ""substantially less investor protection"" than in the traditional securities markets, as well as to ""correspondingly greater opportunities for fraud and manipulation.”

CryptoCurrency,"Swiss Bank Rates Turning Negative: You know what to do with that money, right?","At first, it was near-zero interest rates and now it's turning negative in most countries.   

As of 1st of June 2021, clients (individuals) of UBS Switzerland need to pay negative interest of -0.75% on accounts &gt; 200'000 CHF ($222k).

PostFinance, which is more like a government-owned bank, has -0.75% starting at CHF 100K ($111k).

To put this into context, Bitcoin would still be more efficient than the banking system **even if it losses -0.5% in a year.**  

However, Bitcoin is already up 20% YTD and has yielded an average 190%+ every year since its existence. 

Try to pay less attention to the current state of the market and understand that Bitcoin and crypto are the closest we've come to obliterating an otherwise inefficient banking system. This would be really huge if we could pull it off and y'all will be handsomely rewarded.

CryptoCurrency,"Nature and history of money, property rights, fraud and the potential of crypto: The context","Dear all,

it might be a good idea to introduce some basic concepts to the community – especially nowadays as most people are focused on prices and short-term gains. Even though this might have been written down multiple times, I believe that it is valuable to bring it together in a unique piece of information. I decided to post this text to multiple subreddits to reach more people - please refer to my profile to see which ones. The selection is based on the fact that they are the largest in the cryptocurrency space here on reddit. A lot of people in the subreddit here do not understand basic but important concepts of money and its history – a state of affairs that I am motivated to help change.

The topics covered are of **philosophical** and **economical** nature. Crypto is way more than just asking the question ‘When moon?’.

**What is money?**

Over time, gold and silver were used as money. Money is defined as a means of exchange, storage of value and a unit to calculate prices with. But how did it come that across continents, so many different cultures used these precious metals as money? Consider the natural situation where the economy is not well developed. If you want to exchange something, you need to use barter which is inefficient and time consuming. The detection of a good usable as money is crucial to benefit society as it allows participants to use their most sacred resource – their lifetime – to pursue other things with the time saved from barter exchange. But how does a good become money? There is one common evolution that can be observed and logically explained – Ludwig Edler von Mises termed it the **‘Regression Theory of Money’** in his habilitation ‘Theorie des Geldes und der Umlaufmittel’ (in English ‘The Theory of Money and Credit’) from 1912. This theorem states that money has value as of now because it had value yesterday; put into context nowadays, one might say that this is the network effect. But if you ‘regress’ this back in time, there has to be a starting point: **The first time a good becomes money is the transition of a valuable product into a mean of exchange, and this mean should be commonly accepted across market participants.** Gold and silver were valued as jewellery, so many people in a barter economy would be fine with accepting this. The transition of this value into a mean of exchange leads to a network effect were the good gets a **monetary value** as well, a so called **Tauschwert**. This is remarkable, as people who don’t value jewellery at all would start accepting this because of its **Tauschwert**. The same could be observed after World War II in Germany, were American cigarettes became a mean of exchange in the destroyed German economy. Even non-smokers accepted it after it had gotten a **Tauschwert**. Besides, there are exotic examples of monetary goods, such as the so-called ‘Rai stones’ in Micronesia that were small to very large round stones with a circle hole in the middle and not easily transportable but used as money. This is a nice example that a common belief can result in the emergence of money; but does the Micronesia example contradict Mises’ theorem? Not necessarily, as value is subjective and a very strong (also religious) belief might as well provide value in itself. Nevertheless, the more ‘classic’ transition of a valuable product resulting in money was clearly the norm.

But this is not enough. Money should also be hard to fake, it should ideally be dividable in smaller units and it should definitely be long lasting. All these reasons spoke for precious metals like gold and silver. In a nutshell, the fact that they are hard to fake and that their supply is not increasing ambiguously make them ideal money. Why is a solid and slow increasing supply important? If you aim at storing value in time, this characteristic follows from basic economic thinking of supply/demand. The demand is quite stable and will be increasing over time if societies and economies get more efficient. Trust in the fact that the gold or silver supply will not just double in two years make it ideal to store value over time. So, as people can’t be trusted easily, precious metals scarcity and their difficulty to counterfeit made them ideal for people to trade without trusting some specific entity. Unfortunately, there was one problem: States/ empires could monopolize the minting and this is what usually happened. The nominal value of a coin could be the same but the amount of precious metal inside could be reduced in order to mint more coins. The first quantitative easing was born! With these methods, empires could finance their expensive wars. The Roman Empire wars are a perfect example of this process.

As things went on, gold smiths (the first banks so to speak) started to accept gold, promised to deposit it in exchange for a paper certificate verifying the amount of gold; whoever claimed that certificate at the proto-bank was able to get the physical gold. This is where the ‘trust-layer’ comes in. Gold in itself is trust-less, one ounce of gold is one ounce of gold, period. But as human technology evolved over time making life more comfortable and easier, the need for convenient means of exchange representing money (the gold in deposits) like paper became clear. But you might guess the potential misuse of such a system. By issuing more certificates than what could be backed by gold, some proto-banks discovered the Cantillon effect / seigniorage: Whoever would make use of its newly created certificates first could accumulate wealth, while subsequent users would be faced with a decrease of the monetary value of their certificates. Indeed, after the new certificates find their way through the economy and aren’t hoarded somewhere, prices tend to go up, a phenomenon commonly referred to as ‘inflation’. Without going too much into detail, this process is not proportional by the amount of newly created certificates but generally in the long term, an effect on prices will occur. One could interpret this wealth transfer under the lens of the fundamental laws of thermodynamics (first and second law), which states (in very simplistic terms) that ‘nothing is for free’, no perpetuum mobile is possible. The very same scientific truth applied to the economy: Nothing is for free, someone always has to pay for it.

To speak it out clearly: This process is fraud and it is **not** compatible with property rights. By breaking the promise of gold depositing the bad actor clearly violates the underlying contract: most people would not voluntarily accept an ambiguously inflating certificate scheme. Also, it dilutes the purchasing power of old certificate holders. In a free-market system, these bad actors should get punished and be treated as criminals by the judicial system in place. But states/ empires began to monopolize and/or regulate the system and this is where the real drama begins. As states/ empires are **monopolies of force** with limited control mechanisms on how this force was and is used, it is clear that this institution has an interest in extracting purchasing power from the peasants (also called ‘taxpayer’ nowadays). Across history, war financing was the main incentive to expand the power even further. Nowadays, it is still war financing but also social welfare programmes, as the former also require large amounts of money (just check the government spending of the USA and you will be surprised by the fact that way more is spent on social programmes than on military even though the defence budget of the USA is more than insane).

**Free markets and capitalism are incompatible with fiat money**

As already stated, the dilution of purchasing power is fraud and incompatible with property rights. Of course, you might be free to found a bank that is issuing more certificates than gold deposits and tell your customers about this procedure from the very beginning orally and also via contracts. However, with other actors competing for this market this is not likely to be a sustainable business model. Why should anyone put his or her hard-earned money into such a bank?

This is why in today’s world, we do certainly **not** live in free markets as a lot of people think. We have elements of free markets for sure, certainly this is true and certainly comes in various flavours (take Australia for example and compare it to North Korea). But currently **all** states in the world have a fiat-money regime. Money in itself could be classified as an own type of good, neither consumption, nor production good. One might conclude that it constitutes a class of its own, a class of good that is so important that it represents one side of a trade for almost all trades in an economy. Free markets and capitalism **require** property rights as this is the very definition of it; if the means of production (land, labour, properties, machinery and so on) are private you have capitalism, period. Even the degree of ‘private property’ is controversial as the government owns large amounts of land; the government regulates a lot, so even if you are a private owner on paper, a state can regulate so much that it is de facto also an owner of your property (simply put, this is the model of fascism; instead of ‘collectivizing the means of production’, the government can ‘collectivize the individual’); your labour is taxed by the government and depending on where you live by quite a substantial amount and additionally a lot of people are paid directly by the government (local or federal) because they work as public officials and so on. But most importantly: Money as it is today is issued by central banks with no backing whatsoever; therefore a **central** bank perverts the concept of **free** markets and capitalism. Even if a central bank is partly ‘private’ as the Swiss National Bank (you can actually buy stocks from this central bank), central banks are a creation of law and **not** of free markets.

**Why the US gold standard was a fraud scheme**

**What is a gold standard?** In a strict and correct term, it means that **gold is money** and every paper certificate using as means of exchange is 100% backed by it. With this perspective, the USA actually gave it up with the founding of the First Bank of America in 1791. This central bank lasted until 1811 and was able to issue debt certificates in a higher amount than what could be backed by gold. The founding of the Second Bank of America in 1816 was again against the principle of a gold standard (or better: bimetallic standard, as written in the Constitution), this institution lasted until 1836. By the way: Andrew Jackson, President of the United States, fought against the Second Bank of America and vetoed its charter in 1833. In 1913, with the creation of the Federal Reserve Bank by the Federal Reserve Act, the concept of a national central bank became permanent compared to the former ones which only had licenses granted by congress. Officially, the USA still had a gold standard, but what is the motive behind a central bank under such a standard? Correct: Undermining it\*\*. I will come back to this point with the history of the Federal Reserve and the monetary supply during the 1920s.\*\*

In 1933, the fraud got its first large scale mark with the decision of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's Executive Order 6102 which came into effect the same year the Nazis gained power in Germany. With this Executive Order, it was forbidden for US citizens to own more than 100 USD in gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates within the continental United States. One ounce of gold was the equivalent of 35 USD. This means that the citizens had to bring the exceeding gold to the Federal Reserve System, there they got 35 USD in paper certificates for one ounce of gold. **This was an act of fraud and theft, because the Federal Reserve of course had the ability to increase the debt amount now as it could before, diluting paper certificate holders.**

The final act against the gold standard and its ultimate murder happened on August 15th 1971 by Richard Nixon, stating: ‘I have directed Secretary Connally to suspend **temporarily** the convertibility of the dollar into gold or other reserve assets, except in amounts and conditions determined to be in the interest of monetary stability and in the best interests of the United States.’ (source: [https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-the-nation-outlining-new-economic-policy-the-challenge-peace#axzz1UZnES7PMon](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-the-nation-outlining-new-economic-policy-the-challenge-peace#axzz1UZnES7PMon))

It took two world wars to get totally rid of a gold-standard; because of von Mises’ regression theorem people continued accepting fiat money; most of them did not even notice the difference after US President Richard Milhous Nixon ‘temporarily’ stopped the exchange of dollars to gold on August 15th 1971. Until now, this is still in effect; President Nixon probably understood the word ‘temporarily’ in cosmic orders of magnitude.

**Friedrich August von Hayek and the ‘Denationalisation of Money’**

Von Mises’ student Friedrich August von Hayek, the real opponent of John Maynard Keynes (and not Milton Friedman as commonly thought) proposed the ‘Denationalisation of Money’ published in 1976. This is a truly important work and it was published during the stagflation times in the USA (high price inflation rates, low economy growth and higher unemployment). Hayek understood one basic fact about gold standards: Even though gold is great in itself, the trust-layer with the government is flawed by design. **He proposed a free market for money to take away the power from the government.**

Do you want to know what kind of suffering has been imposed upon millions of people via fiat money? First: wars. The logic is relatively simple, you can’t finance large scale wars for a long time without fiat money; actually, the European nations abandoned the gold standard right at the outbreak of World War I (World War II was also financed by fiat money). Second, fiat money has been an instrument to steal people’s purchasing power with inflation. In its most extreme version, hyperinflation, the purchasing power has even been reduced to null. Inflating of the money supply has caused booms and busts (Mises’ and Hayek’s works on this topic is recommendable) as it also affects real interest rates, which then affect human behaviour and so on. Why is human behaviour affected? Well, if interest rates are lower than in a free market based on sound money, short-term borrowing becomes relatively easier and consumption is rewarded higher than long-term saving and wealth creation. Also, companies might start using cheaper debt to finance themselves which changes their capital structure. Economic ventures become ‘worth it’ with lower credit cost compared to the free market case. Furthermore, states also take more debt. Thus, in a system with artificially low interest rates, monetary funds, resources and human labour get allocated in a different way, usually less efficient way, than it would be in a sound money system. The day when central banks have to raise interest rates to avoid hyperinflation, the party ends: The debt costs increase and refinancing becomes more expensive. Without such a monetary system, the subprime mortgage crisis that lead to the financial crisis of 2007-2009 would have never been possible. These large risks wouldn’t have been taken by so many and actually, without huge additional money from the central banks and the business banks it would simply not be possible to drive a speculative frenzy of such epic proportions ruining a whole economy. There is more to this but this goes far beyond of the scope of a reddit post. The business banks’ contribution to the increase of money supply happens through the fractional reserve banking regime. What is fractional reserve banking you might ask? It means that a business bank can lend more money than it has in deposits; the minimum reserve is decided by the central bank. For example, if you have your deposits at a bank, you officially lend this money to the bank which in turn lends it to others; but by doing so, the business bank creates new virtual money, as the bank must not hold 100 % fiat reserves for all the claims; that is why bank-runs ruin banks, as they do not have enough funds to cover all claims if large amounts of customers want cash; maybe this makes you understand why central banks and governments are interested in introducing their own digital currencies, a real dystopic nightmare.

So, it is now clear that a free market for money would lead to more peace, more stable economies with lower, but steadier and more sustainable economic growth. And this is why private banking with solid money like gold and/ or silver is better than the current status quo. Hayek wanted government completely out of this; and that is for good reasons in regard to history and human nature. As already mentioned, even during the gold standard times in the USA, it was possible to issue more paper certificates than gold. The Federal Reserve actually did this during the roaring twenties, contributing to the frenzy during these times which lead to a catastrophe. Murray Newton Rothbard highlights this process in his work ‘America’s Great Depression’ from 1963. Rothbard was a student of Ludwig Edler von Mises and wrote besides economics also about financial history with focus on the USA. He teaches us that the Federal Reserve total Dollar claims on June 1921 were 44.7 billion USD with a total gold reserve of 2.6 billion USD. Then, on June 1929, the claimed Dollar amount rose to 71.8 billion USD, a **60.6% increase** while the gold reserves rose only to 3.0 billion USD, an **increase of 15.4%** (Table 2 on page 94, can freely be accessed via [https://cdn.mises.org/Americas%20Great%20Depression\_3.pdf](https://cdn.mises.org/Americas%20Great%20Depression_3.pdf); original source is \*\*Banking and Monetary Statistics (Washington, D.C.: Federal Reserve System, 1943), pp. 544–45, 409, and 346–48\*\*).

But there still is a problem: Even with a free market monetary system with a solid gold currency the trust-layer is still existent. At least it is not monopolized with the central bank and a cartel of business banks, but market participants still have to trust the depositing institution which usually is a bank, or used to be a bank as gold has been completely demonetized.

**The invention of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies**

This is where crypto comes in. I apologize for this long history travel, but it is important to understand cryptocurrencies’ significance. **With the invention of Bitcoin it was - for the first time in human history - possible to mimic gold and remove the trust-layer.** This is not an understatement.

Let this sink in. If you understand the motivation for sound money and the incompatibility of fiat money with property rights, its pivotal role in free markets and peace, then it becomes clear that Bitcoin is revolutionary. But you may wonder, how is it possible that even people supporting sound money, Peter Schiff being a prominent example, disagree with the concept of cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin? There might be multiple reasons to this, but one common argument is that it has no ‘inherent’ value. **However, by applying von Mises’ regression theorem, one can definitely conclude why Bitcoin has value:** First, we went from barter to primitive money until many cultures and societies discovered gold and silver which were widely used throughout history. Then governments introduced a purely fiat system; what gave fiat its value? It was not the government just stating ‘Here, accept it now!’, but a long-lasting connection to gold (even though not perfect, but still) the collective used Dollar certificates and other certificates in other countries for generations. It took two world wars to get to the current fiat regime: The change was quiet and did not really appear in people’s daily life until price inflation hit. Thus, the ‘regression’ went from gold, to gold certificates, to fiat. With fiat being flawed by design, Bitcoin was proposed to counter the problems that come with the trust-layer. This should certainly create a value for buyers, especially in countries where you see the purchasing power being molten. The historical perspective helps us understand why for Bitcoin and/ or other cryptocurrencies to be successful, a strong network effect is a prerequisite. Then the ‘regression’ pattern moves towards cryptocurrencies. This is commonly  named adoption. Which cryptocurrency or cryptocurrencies will succeed? Will it be Bitcoin? Ethereum? Another crypto? A mix of cryptos? Who knows? I certainly don’t; this decision has not been made by the market participants yet, as we are still in the early days. **So von Mises’ regression theorem tells us that the transition from a valuable good or a solid ground belief from the very beginning already happened and then regressed through time!**

Let’s note now that cryptocurrencies are also very powerful because governments will not be able to stop or control them. It is impossible to control every single machine connected to the internet. Even though we have nation states, at least we don’t have a world state with a world government; if one nation state decides to ban this technology - a ban that is already hard to enforce by itself - there will be incentives for other nation states to be even friendlier. A coordinated world-wide nation state attempt to destroy cryptocurrencies is practically impossible and even if, people will probably rise up as they understand that something has to be wrong.

This gives me hope. It is sad to see how governments and big corporations in bed with governments control people more and more and how the financial system gets sicker and sicker. Well, at least we do not have large scale totalitarianism as in the 20th century. But we witness the developments of more controls, more economic interventions, more money destruction through supply increase and this might lead us to more totalitarian states. But crypto is here to stay and evolve. And it is powerful. It is powerful because it is a means of disempowering nation states and the fiat money system. **Without fiat money, it is impossible to sustain and finance large states spending huge amounts of money in a way where the people making decisions did not earn the money by themselves**. It is especially impossible to finance large scale wars, a property that should by itself defeat the fiat money regime. The fiat regime is the core of statism and totalitarianism - without its core element, it can’t survive. Of course, disinformation is a crucial part of this, but it is not the core of statism and totalitarianism: Without fiat money but with disinformation, these political forces cannot achieve much. This an important point to understand, as modern large-scale wars and welfare states are impossible to finance with solid money. This is why you can’t logically promote Bitcoin or another serious crypto while being a collectivist, either a socialist or fascist. These ideologies are highly flawed in a practical and ethical sense; the argumentation about this statement (more from the practical side) has been done by Ludwig Edler von Mises himself in his masterpiece ‘Sozialismus: Eine ökonomische und soziologische Analyse’ (English: ‘Socialism: An Economic and Sociological Analysis’) from 1922. One of his main points is that under collectivized economies, the central planners can’t calculate on prices as there is no pricing mechanism telling participants what is worth pursuing and what isn’t. Indeed, with means of production that are not private, it makes rational decisions about pricing impossible because these very same means of productions have no price. Friedrich August von Hayek wrote a lot about the impossibility of collective economies, focusing on the information problem and the inherent decentralized dynamics of the market mechanism. But there are even more arguments against it, here is a simple one: Centralization of power in order to fulfill collective economies, be it on a local level with communities or on a large level across nation states, will always corrupt people, and notably more so in the latter case, as human nature is as it is (humans want the outputs without putting in the work and the energy). There would be no problem with socialistic/ communistic or fascist communities if they respected property rights of others, but they don’t by definition. This is the moral difference between collectivism and individualism: Under an individualistic, property rights centered order, you can try whatever you want unless you don’t violate the property rights of others. In this setup, if you want to start a collectivist paradise by yourself and find people who want to voluntarily join you, you are free to do this. Ironically, starting a business and/ or using sound money under a collectivist order would possibly result in penalties and in your death in the worst case. Interesting fact: Even when done voluntarily, collectivist models fail. This can be exemplified with the New Harmony project in Indiana (USA) during the 19th century or even the Kibbutzim in Israel, many of which failed and of the remaining ones, the large majority threw their hard-core collectivist ideals away. It is also interesting that internet devices and smart phones found their way to Kibbutzim nowadays. It should not be explained that under a total collectivized global economic regime, hard work and innovation leading to our daily life’s devices wouldn’t be possible, just by the nature of human incentives and behaviour.

**Smart contracts and beyond**

Even though Bitcoin started as being a ‘Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash-System’ and now seems to find its role as a store of value (with a lot of speculative elements as it is still early), the idea of smart contracts provides even more power to decentralization by allowing to participate in businesses and trades without the trust-layer. This is achievable by Decentralized-Finance or Non-Fungible-Tokens which could become a standard for property exchange. They could one day register governance via a hard-encoded trust-less protocol on a blockchain, or handle bond and stock exchanges that work with lower costs and higher efficiency without intermediaries. Way more applications could probably be enabled by a such a decentralized, trust-ensuring protocol. All of this is unstoppable and will transform the world for the better. I am so happy and proud that it all started with Bitcoin, with all its ups and downs and insane stories. The sector keeps evolving, attracting more and more visionaries and great minds contributing their part to this field.

Furthermore, the impact of these technologies on governance can truly be disruptive, allowing more transparency in public finances to prevent corruption when dealing with public money in a city, province or even nation state. There are many issues yet to be solved from a technical and also architecture point of view (surely, it is useful to have privacy in the sense that nobody can track where the tax money is coming from, but as soon as it is on the public side ready to be spent, an immutable blockchain could be quite helpful here). The decentralisation of cryptos might even lead to political decentralisation, solving problems on the local level where they arose in the first place. Who knows where this journey will bring us?

Before finishing, it shall be mentioned that the large banking sector needs the government and vice versa. Simplistic thinking might lead some to the conclusion that one single governmental bank and the abolition of interest rates will solve all problems, but if you made it until here, you probably understand why this is utopist and flawed. Governments are dangerous and as long as centralization of power exists, special interests (especially from the banking side) will always lobby and gain privileges, period. With sound money, the very core enabling large powerful states is removed. Besides, with the use of smart contracts for governance there will hopefully be some additional pressure towards political decentralization. Always remember: Special interests will always try to collude governments and the more centralization, the easier it gets. It is no surprise that Ancient Greece with its decentralized nature with hundreds of small city states flourished so much compared to other areas of the world which marked the beginning of a historic journey until we got modern civilization which was born and carried out in Europe. Also, it doesn’t come to any surprise that many small city states nowadays allow their citizens high levels of wealth without access to natural resources. Even the decentralized nature of Switzerland, advocated by many (especially by citizens from the surrounding European Union with its centralistic tendencies) as combining the current best political system in the world, doesn’t come to any surprise. In fact, when looking at economic and social freedom combined, Switzerland is the freest country in the world. By the way, the canton of Zug where you can find the so-called ‘crypto valley’ is also located in Switzerland.

**Conclusion**

Cryptocurrencies are here to stay. They will transform this world. Hayek’s dream will come true, as there are no means by which governments can stop this evolution. I am convinced that Hayek would be deeply happy about the evolution of this field. The failure of fiat will be the victory of crypto. Even though gold and silver are great for monetary purposes, especially when thinking about an intelligent alien in our galaxy that would probably rather accept gold than a cryptocurrency, **it is human nature and thus the trust-layer that make a monetary system prone to corruption, legal action and intervention by the government possible. This messes up things even more than single bad actors in the market in the long run.** This is why gold and silver, being valued not only for jewellery, but also electronics and industry nowadays will probably always be valuable and a good hedge against price inflation in the long term. Their physical properties (noteworthy that silver is the element with the highest electrical conductivity which make it unique) give them their own strengths and powers.

I believe that it is too early to say which cryptocurrency or cryptocurrencies will make it; let us see. Maximalism is a single-minded attitude in a fast evolving and relatively new field. Only time will tell what will succeed and what won’t. But I can assure you one thing: **The idea of decentralized cryptocurrencies will succeed and make this world a better place. Hayek’s idea is more powerful than ever before and it is gaining power and popularity. The failure of fiat will be the victory of crypto.**

dogecoin,So if a boat were to capsize the ones with the fullest pockets would sink the fastest. If we turn the system upside down who'd be the first to fall? I think we can do better than this.,"The majority of the wealth is in a minority of hands. The same wealth that they use to push everyone around can be the weight that forces them into the ground. They've been shaking us down for ages. Right now there are things that are clearly artificially deflated and things that are artificially inflated. Price doesn't equal value. Price signals are a shell game. For as long as we can freeze the game or play it against them they'll return fire but they have much more of a vested interest in maintaining the game than we do.


There is no middle class there are those on top those in bottom.

Were transitioning into a new economy. The people are who determine what is valuable. Every shake up of the economy is a chance to claim more and more of the world among more hands. Money may be fake but it's a means to secure value. What makes things difficult is finding true value from hype.

Right now the system is frozen, it's stable. It will likely be overridden once they figure out their next move. By then we'd figure out our next move and so on. It's not really even bots that are freezing the system right now, bots are just an extension of their makers and the bots are blinded by their own greed into eating themselves but eventually their makers will override them.

Typically they will cause a big dip in the entire economy to shake bots loose. We would use that as they would as well to buy at a discount the same way they use insider trading.

The economy has been digitized. Bots are a reality and are like the laws of nature with rules that are as mechanical as a clock.

We can use the bots to force them into small crashes that would be opportunities for us to buy back what should be ours. It doesn't have to be a prisoners dilemma. I think we all know what's truly important and what's truly valuable.

An economic crash is inevitable but a series of small controlled crashes that allow us to adapt and make the right decisions is preferable to a giant crash. The economic system we have now will soon be as dated as the pantheistic personifications of industry it's become. It's not anyone's doing its just an outdated model that's fundamentally incompatible with the future.

It's vulnerability is inherent to its obsolescence. I have no idea what a better system would be, there are too many details to consider but given time I'm pretty sure we'll figure it out.

First thing would be to eliminate the debt money system and replace it with a true value token, a token of gratitude that'd a + given and not a -1 owed.

For a time we're going to have multiple forms of money which is a chance to free ourselves from the negative sum game.

Money as we know it isn't real in the sense that it's not a thing that is valued for any other reason than legal tender laws. The fact that there needs to be a law to even force us to accept federal reserve notes tells us that it's not inherently valuable.

A form of money that is wanted and valued for its own sake for any reason at all is more reason than legal tender laws. Iraq was a nation that has already been forgotten sacrificed to keep the dollar alive. We can't just keep waging wars to force the dollar to have relevance. Blood money borrowed at interest set by the federal reserve seems pretty much like the worse concept for money imaginable. The very manner that money is even created in the United States since the federal reserve act is a zero sum game where every dollar printed is more than a dollar owed back.

If we begin to pay and accept payment with a monetary system that we decide is valuable we can free ourselves from the national debt we've illegally inherited. No one is supposed to be born into debt just like no one is born guilty of a crime.

We can right this wrong as simply as we escape from the dollar and encourage others to transition to something else.

Right now we can just agree that Doge is worth 50 cents and just go from there. The price signals are clearly fake and it really doesn't matter at all what the value on the internet says. What matters is what we decide in the real world.

Tldr

Doge can be more real than any other currency if we simply used it and encouraged its use. We can simply decide that a doge is equivalent to 50 cents to the dollar right now and will continue to appreciate from there. 1 doge = 1 doge = 50 cents.

If we all agree it becomes true. As for all other things it's really up to everyone to figure out because humans are the only things who can determine true value for all things.

Thoughts?",cryptocurrency
crypto,new idea for block cipher,"I'm posting this here for two reasons:

1. To get comment on the algorithm
2. To create a record of the idea, in case it is used in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

**A Modest Proposal for a New Block-Cipher Structure Based on Choices via the Key**

&amp;#x200B;

Substitutions and permutations are the basic building blocks of most ciphers. We suggest a cipher structure in which the input is not processed in a fixed manner. Rather, the bits of the key instruct the cipher whether to substitute or permute the elements of the data. In such a cipher, the block size is determined by the size of the permutation table. The key length is completely variable.

At the end of this document we provide a Python script for a demonstration cipher in which the substitution and permutation use the same box. Behold, ladies and gentlemen: There is nothing up my sleeve. The entries in the box are taken from the hexadecimal representation of π−3 by reading until we find each new value that is not already in the table. For each bit in the key, a 0 indicates that a substitution will be performed, while a 1 indicates a permutation. Since our table contains one of each possible value for a single byte, the block size of this demonstration cipher is 256 bits, or 32 bytes. The demo cipher encrypts or decrypts a single block, and can be incorporated into an encryption mode such as CBC or counter mode in order to handle data of other lengths.

Because of its simplicity, a cipher of this type should be easy and fast to implement in hardware. As it is processed in encryption or decryption, data is simply sent to one or the other function as the bits of the key are iterated.

We do not cryptanalyze the cipher ourselves for two important reasons. First, it is never a good idea to analyze one’s own work due to inherent biases. Second, we simply lack the competence to do so. We suspect that differential cryptanalysis would be powerless, since an attacker would not know a priori the actual encryption process, which depends on the key.

Bitcoin,"""India bans Bitcoin!"" Uh, NO. ""China bans Bitcoin"" Uh, NO. ""Nigeria bans Bitcoin"" Uh, NO. It's an endless shitstorm as moneyed interests close to the dollar spigot finally see Bitcoin for what it is: A direct threat to monetary expansion and Central bank authority. Put your shields up, and prepare.","I am amazed at how quickly the authorities have ""awoken"" to the Apex Predator in the room.  I have always known why I'm in Bitcoin.  For me, it has always been around the following core values:

Decentralized, with no controlling authority.  A finite supply.  Freedom from banks and debasement of what I've worked hard to acquire.

Saifedeen Ammous says without hesitation in ""The Bitcoin Standard"" that Bitcoin is a direct threat to Central Banks.  Many of us have danced around this issue, and tried to downplay where Bitcoin is going.  Even Saylor is careful to couch his answer to the repeated question, ""Is Bitcoin a threat to currencies and the Central Bank?""

I used to answer the same question with, ""The Central banks, and especially the FED, are too moribund and slow; hell, they can't even understand how--or the how important it is--to implement a CBDC.""

There is no doubt in my mind the authorities are fully awake now, and in attack mode.  Latest was Ms. Rowland with the Irish Central Bank just today attacking Bitcoin.  She is headed to the EU Central Bank to play a major oversight role.  Many here on Reddit have commented on the shitstorm of unprecedented proportions: crime, energy use, investors will lose all their money... .

All of us are going to have to get a lot tougher.  Right now, the Bitcoin community is under attack, and it is not going to let up as adoption and success increase.  After this huge correction, which I personally feel was manipulated by many interests, the only way to be successful in the long run with Bitcoin is to ""circle the wagons together, and hold the line.""

personalfinance,Should I put college savings into bonds? (Questions below),"Background:

I'm a 15 year old ending his freshman year. Over the summer, my family moved and my parents had a lot of equity in their home (bought in 2010 and sold during covid, though the value has gone up about 50k since then). They decided to put about 50k into a savings account for my college fund, something I am very grateful for. 

I don't know the rate the moneys getting in a savings account, but it can't be more than 0.5% APY. And looking through some bonds on Fidelity, I can get about 0.8 - 1% yield on a AA, call protected bond maturing in 3 years (when I will need the money to pay for college). 

Questions

1. Should I go through all this work for and extra .3%?
2. How much more risky is a non-call protected bond vs a call protected one and is it worth buying? (I am at the belief that bonds won't get called since interest rates can only go up)
3. Should I try and time the fed raising interest rates? (I would put some money into bonds maturing in mid-2023 in anticipation of better yields with rising interest rates.)

Thanks in advance!",finance
personalfinance,Is one scenario better (mortgage)?,"My wife and I are looking to purchase our first home.  We intend to keep it as long as possible. The home is roughly $270k and is new construction.  The gist of our options are currently:

A. Obtain a mortgage where we can get an extra $2k to cover closing costs at 3.15% (variable) with minimum out-of-pocket, at most $2k. 

B. Obtain a mortgage where we are required to put 3% down at 3.625% (fixed); however, they’re offering us a $7,500 grant.  With the grant we’d pay at most $4k out-of-pocket and have the option to buy points. 

We’re not concerned about paying less than 10k out-of-pocket.  However I’m going back and forth about if we should lock in the lower interest rate and capitalize on the grant or keep the money in our pockets and have a lower interest rate for at least the next 5 years.",finance

I’m currently a full time student (23) and I unfortunately don’t have family to lean on. I don’t really have any savings (currently only $2k), I make enough to cover all my bills but I don’t have much left over.

card 1: $3,000 with 15% interest rate
card 2: $4,000 with 23.74% interest rate

I never miss a payment on my cards and my credit is pretty good (around 700) but I feel like my debt never goes down. I don’t use my cards at all anymore (I don’t even keep them in my wallet). I looked into upstart and can get a personal loan for the balance of both cards with a 10% interest rate for 3 years. Is a personal loan a bad idea? What other things can I do to get rid of this debt?",finance
personalfinance,Math Checks Out But Getting Cold Feet Buying First House,"I need some sanity check from my Reddit family.



Our offer to buy the house was finally accepted. We're in the due diligence phase. Despite crunching numbers 100 times, addressing all scenarios I'm getting cold feet. 



Here are the facts:

Location: Atlanta GA

House price: 620K

HOA: $100 per month

Combined Income: 300K (pre tax)

House fund: 120K

Saving account: 50K

Retirement and HSA and Investment: 80K

Family: Me (mid 30s), Spouse(early 30s), Dog and maybe kids in next few years

Loan: 90K student loan

Immediate expense: House needs appliances around 10K, Roof and HVAC are 17-18 years old

Rent: 2K-2.5K month to month



Due to low interest rate my bank is recommending to only put around 10% down. With that, our mortgage will be around 3.5K per month which clearly looks affordable. We've never taken a loan this big size or commitment of this capacity. I'm getting really nervous. I'm looking for some confirmation, sanity check or truth bombs, please.",finance
gaming,Gaming Laptop Recommendation,"Hi Reddit! I’m about to go back to school for a masters in engineering and am looking to get a new laptop for schoolwork that will also double as a gaming / engineering computer.

Thinking is that I could use the computer for gaming in spare time (i.e. Resident Evil) and potentially running programs such as SolidWorks for assignments. 

I’m not hugely proficient with computer hardware and have gotten burned when assembling my own rigs in the past, so I’m wanting to stick to a prebuilt laptop for now. Will probably purchase from a BestBuy / other electronic retailer.

That being said, budget is not an issue here. What, in your opinion, are the best gaming laptops currently on the market?

Key considerations for me are portability and, of course, speed. Superior graphics and audio are “nice to have” for me, but definitely take a back seat to functionality, so to speak.

Also, if I whiffed and chose the wrong sub, what’s a better place to crowdsource recommendations?",technology
CryptoCurrency,Using wrapped Bitcoin as a US tax loss harvesting strategy,"There's been plenty of discussion lately on whether the SEC's ruling of crypto as property means it isn't subject to the IRS's wash sale rule for securities. A thorough write-up on the idea of using this to one's advantage via tax loss harvesting can be found here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/new5q6/tax\_loss\_harvesting\_one\_method\_to\_legally\_reduce/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/new5q6/tax_loss_harvesting_one_method_to_legally_reduce/)

The problem I have with this method is that it hinges on a technicality based on what two federal agencies didn't say, rather than what they explicitly laid out with regards to crypto. If you try to tax loss harvest today by selling and rebuying your crypto within 30 days, and later in the year the feds state that the wash sale rule does in fact apply to crypto, then you're SOL.

There's also been some debate on whether converting one's coins into their wrapped equivalents triggers a taxable event, as per the 2018 tax reform law. The general agreement seems to be that when swapping one distinct coin for another, say BTC to ETH, that this counts as a taxable event. But there hasn't been the same consensus on whether swapping ETH for WETH or any of its ERC20 equivalents follows suit.

Keeping in mind that this is not financial or tax advice and that we're all kind of feeling our way through this until we get clarity from the feds, I have to wonder: can we take advantage of sell-and-rebuy tax loss harvesting in a way that completely avoids the wash sale uncertainty, by leaning heavily into the letter of the law on swaps?

For example: Assuming you bought 1 BTC at the ATH of around $64K, go to Coinbase and trade it for roughly 1 WBTC at the current price of about $36K. This locks in the taxable event with a capital loss of $28K.

Because you converted your BTC to wrapped Bitcoin, you're not under any pressure to buy back instantly like you would if you'd converted to fiat or any other coin. If BTC drops even further after 30 days, you can double down and swap your WBTC back to BTC, incurring another capital loss on paper. Rinse and repeat.

If it goes up and never comes back to $36K, you can wait for the best time to convert back after a year to take advantage of long-term capital gains rates. Or you could just leave it as WBTC forever if you prefer.

BTC to wrapped BTC seems especially suited to following current tax guidelines, as there's no disputing that your capital went from one blockchain into another, for a completely different coin (just because it's backed by BTC and pegged to the price of BTC doesn't mean you're holding BTC). The argument that like-kind swaps of ETH to WETH aren't taxable events actually works against you here, since ETH is tokenized on its own chain.

Again, NFA/NTA/DYOR. But I'd love to get feedback on whether this strategy makes any sense at all.",cryptocurrency
stocks,The Investor's Skills and Knowledge Must-Haves,"Lately, I have been browsing the new sections of a few investing subreddits, and I came to the conclusion that a lot of us are in need of education on basic concepts that don't relate solely to stocks. 

I strongly believe that everyone that owns stocks should have at least a basic understanding of the following: 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Statistics 101 and optional Bayesian Statistics, Correlation vs Causality and Nicolas Cage

\- Macro and Microeconomics: most importantly Behavioral Economics, Biases, Preferences, Supply and Demand, Interest rates, Money supply, Monetary Policy, Market Cycles, a bit of Game Theory, Unemployment, Inflation

\- Financial Reporting / Accounting: Financial Statements and their most important elements, a bit about the IFRS and/or US GAAP frameworks

\- Financial History: Black Friday, 2008 housing crash

\- Financial Institutions: Hedge Funds, Mutual Funds, Investment Banks, Commercial Banks

\- Psychology: The Big 5 Traits of Personality, Freud's Iceberg model and the Id, Ego and Super-Ego

\- Stock Valuation: P/E Ratio, P/B Ratio, CAGR, Margins and Ratios, ROE, ROA, Liquidity, EY, and their interpretations

\- Optional: Learn from the greats: Buffett, Munger, Lynch, Simons, Fisher, Graham

&amp;#x200B;

You don't need to take any college courses for those. YouTube is your best friend for this. Fear is the product of not knowing what to expect and the respective odds. A basic understanding of these topics will most likely reduce FOMO, help you make more sound decisions, and maybe increase your returns in the long run. 

The best investment against inflation is in yourself. Happy learning!",finance
personalfinance,Payoff Student Loans OR Min. Payments w/ Investing the Rest,"Hello All,

My wife and I have 110k in SL to pay off.

If not, we would make minimum payments (we're expecting maybe up to $1k total/month (we make 130k/yr)) and invest the rest of our extra money.

Update: Interest rates are 4.5% to 6%. All are either Sub or Unsub fed. loans.

100% payment would be $3,100/month

OR

$1,000 to SL, $2,100/month to investing in low-cost, high return, dividend-paying index fund ETFs.

1. Which would you personally do in this situation and why
2. Which one would probably net the most money in the end (probably 30 years to retirement).",finance
CryptoCurrency,Kraken became the first digital asset company in U.S. history to receive bank charter recognized under federal and state law!,"# Kraken Bank is planning a phased launch in Q3 2021

# 

**Frequently** asked questions

1. **Wait, Kraken is becoming a bitcoin bank?**  
Kraken has always been on the frontier of finance. Now we’re blazing a new trail by opening a Wyoming-based crypto bank.  
We were calling it Kraken Financial, but due to overwhelming demand, it will be known as Kraken Bank. We’re the first (ever) crypto company to be awarded a U.S. state banking charter. It’s known as a Special Purpose Depository Institution or SPDI. 
2. **What is an SPDI?**  
It’s a bank focused on clients’ interest in a forward-facing regulatory framework with oversight from the Wyoming Division of Banking.
3. **Can I open a bank account with Kraken? When will it launch?**  
We are planning a phased launch in 2021, we’ll roll out to existing U.S. Kraken clients first and will provide more information as it becomes available.  
In the meantime, you can visit [**www.kraken.com/sign-up**](https://www.kraken.com/sign-up) to create your Kraken trading account if you don’t have one.
4. **What products will the crypto bank offer?**  
Our bank charter allows us to launch digital-first traditional and crypto banking products, with cryptocurrencies represented as a first-class citizen. We're looking into products like deposit accounts in USD and crypto assets (ex. Bitcoin), multiple funding and payments options, institutional custody products (qualified custody for advisors and broker dealers), IRAs and many more.
5. **Where will this be available and could I visit a branch?**  
We will initially focus in the U.S. roll out services to existing clients in the U.S., with potential international expansion in the future.  
Our plan is to serve our existing clients’ needs online and via mobile devices - we don’t anticipate servicing any in-person, customer-serving activities in our Cheyenne office. Customer support and service will be available 24/7/365.
6. **Will my investments be FDIC insured?**  
No. However, Kraken Bank will be fully reserved (i.e., no fractional reserve banking or associated re-hypothecation and lending activities). All assets will be kept on hand and available as cash or the least risky, most liquid cash equivalents. We will also maintain significant capital reserves and surpluses of our own capital to cover the full balance of all clients, even in the event of a “bank run.”  
We will operate in a safe and sound manner that prioritizes customer fund protection. Therefore, we will not have insolvency risk the FDIC is intended to safeguard. We will never need a bailout or any public-funded backstop, because our goal is to serve your needs and the needs of the community.

dogecoin,Project idea,"Concept - Crypto battle arena
goal 
Fun cryptocurrency three-dimensional Live market data battle arena
Based on Dodge coin in the meme’s and influential characters surrounding Dodge coin and cryptocurrency.
To bring life to our favourite characters And meme’s we aim to feed live market data technical signals Into the characters for their interactions with each other and the user.

We aim create a fun online platform,  and dapp Where users can watch their favourite cryptocurrency pairs battle it out in a three-dimensional boxing arena similar to the game UCF But instead crypto themed,  
And help Function as a fun PR system for dodge To aid in wider adoption of the currency and the cryptocurrency seen as a whole.
Each cryptocurrency will have its own design 3-D character. Which can be purchased utilising Dodge coin. Note : payment and funding design still yet to be decided and worked out properly, A good idea is one thing but funding it with my primary goal to have it sustainable, would be ideal.

Once a user has purchased their crypto 3-D character they will then have the option to select trading pairs  that Are matched with it in regards to exchanges they are listed with Using a api 

Upon viewing The trading pair it will load the 3-D characters into the arena where live data generated from the exchanges will be fed into the characters creating a live feed crypto battle between the currencies in animation
Our plan is to use the candlestick sentiment of the market within a certain time frame to program Pacific reactions and movements with form some kind of randomisation to keep it entertaining, with a special effects sounds and combos. 

The arena layout
 
Much like the UCF themed arena we wish to create the same atmosphere and vibe that utilising the cryptocurrency theme, with a centre arena containing referee Hmmm Bear with me with this one SEC 😁 For the referee we’re thinking utilising wick patterns like a failed candle for the referee , for a bit of fun I also want to have an input feed from elon musk Twitter account bit tricky as we wish to have it only react to crypto related tweets. As well as gauging sentiment of the tweet, four or against,

Coaches
Each cryptocurrency generally has a campaign leader Like doge with Elon Musk
Each cryptocurrency would have its own coach which would interact with its competing currency, and the referee and the crowd, inputs for their reactions would be linked to their social media accounts, market reactions, referee Calls,       

As with all arenas we need to have punters the crowd
At the moment considering working with the primary contenders with the highest public adoption, coins currently like Eth, Ada, btc, doge, link, most popular meme coins, Some wild bears a bull or 2, Wales, doge dogs of course too. 
as for the crowd and their interaction in regards to the competing Cryptocurrencies in the arena and the referee, In most games the crowd is static repeating the same actions, we want to go for something different And create more interaction
The input for the crowd will be based off the performance of their coin/token, for unique situations, like from whale alert, bull or bear markets, news, would also like the crowd have a reaction based off the public‘s reaction to tweets in regards to a pacific crypto , case example

When Elon musk tweeted against bitcoin and in support of dodge coin we could’ve had a pre-generated scenario to unfold where we just needed those two variables within a percentage to trigger it,  In regards that tweet when bitcoin took its fall we could’ve had doge supporter sneak out from the crowd, and pull the feet out under the bitcoin character,  trigger the referees reaction Sequence to end with him sending their supporter back to their stand. 
Many more fun and unique scenarios could be introduced.
As the goals to be able to be entertained while also keeping an eye on the market in the background semi sort of transparent like a big screen will be a live feed displaying the trading pair you’ve selected with an interactive option to change time frame and scale 

Upon success and growth of the platform it could incorporate various competitive events sporting utilising various characters that people could purchase, other considerations for growth and expanding beyond the original idea is to have the system compatible for integration of other
A more in-depth version of the NTF horses you can purchase and race   

Commentators
For a bit of fun, we can link to live audio streams that are available in regards to your trading pair


Utility and function
In order to keep the platform useful and not just entertaining to the traders.
With a similar layout to Coinigys trading platform, selecting your exchanges and pairs from a column on the right, other functions we wish to remain Are, market depth , order books, links to be displayed for updates, News, Twitter feeds, dev teams, white papers, order books, portfolio function, price alerts,  adding some function and utility as well as providing entertainment. 
You will not be able to place orders or sell orders through the platform but it will incorporate the ability to view orders placed on exchanges you’re linked with.   
Merchandise
Also looking at the idea of incorporating a shop where the Dodge community can market there dodge merchandise.

personalfinance,Paying student loans while in grad school?,"Hi everyone. I’m looking for a little advice on paying some of my loans while in graduate school. I’m a rising second year vet student, and am very fortunate that my dad had some extra income and wants to put it toward my student loans. We have paid some off in while I was in undergrad, and know that we should be paying the unsubsidized and highest interest rates first. 

Based on how we’ve paid some off before, here’s a breakdown of what I have:
Undergrad 
-4 subsidized - total $18,900 (3.76-5.05% range)
-1 Perkins loan - $850 (probably going to pay this to get it over with)
-0 unsubsidized - paid them already 
Grad
-1 grad plus - $5,776 (5.3%)
-1 unsubsidized - $40,500 (4.3%)

My main question is are there any repercussions to paying some of the grad plus and grad unsubsidized in terms of repayment plans and financial aid? I was assuming no but I wanted to ask input. My other question is how should I allot any money my dad is contributing while considering the 0% interest until September? Also wondering if it makes sense to leave the loans and use the money to take out less next year instead? (I’m not sure how much my dad is contributing but let’s say $6,000 for now)",finance
devops,Roles n Responsibilities between teams and working closer,"I work for a growing east coast fintech and we're trying to move towards devops.  We have the usual growing pains of a company finding its feet, having to produce more and more and also trying to migrate to a Devops culture.  There are many views on how the teams should be structured and what should be done by whom.  I'm trying to figure it out so we can work together in the most productive way possible and am keen to hear views please.  

We have a solutions architect, 3 systems engineers, a helpdesk and 3 development teams each with a team lead.  We have to build and support legacy IT EUC, maintain a legacy private cloud infra for the first version of our product suite as we migrate it to AWS.  Our main product is in AWS in a mix of server and serverless products with some legacy connectivity and B2B stuff and a few off the shelf products that provide services and data to our main product. 

There are some that believe that Devops is just 'Devs doing Ops' and want to do everything themselves.  These views are spread across the dev squads and the solutions architect.  The SA wants to do everything herself from design/architecture to proof of concepts to building out in prod and then supporting.  The Systems engineers are getting fed up because they don't get to do any of the interesting work and are just doing governance, monitoring and basic access stuff in the AWS space.  

As we need to allow the devs to spin up infrastructure in AWS to support the product and code as IaC, I see the governance around that and setting policies and restrictions around what they do as part of the systems engineers roles.  Also, as the systems engineers are the ones on-call during the day and night, they need to be able to support everything so need the experience of working on these environments and understanding them inside and out before being required to resolve issues in production. I see the architect doing it all as a risk as a single person has all the knowledge.  I think architecture should hand over to engineering to build including IaC stuff so there is a second pair of eyes as a sanity check, the production environment gets 'engineered' for production (rather than a POC that ends up in production as sometimes happens) and is supportable, monitorable, cost effective etc. 

The devops element for me would be the devs supporting their code releases and dealing with any issues that arise immediately.  They are also 3rd line for any prod issues that are escalated to them.

I am wondering though if I am a bit out of touch so want views on how we could structure the overall team and distribute the work to get the best outcomes.  I could go on about the current structure and way things work but I hope I've painted a picture enough to get some views!  What has worked for you?  Where does each role begin and end and where are the overlaps?  Are there any definite wrong ways of doing it?

Thanks in advance for any input or views.

Thoughts on putting cash toward down payment, lowering the rate by buying points, or hold onto the cash...","Just wondering if there’s any good rules of thumb for this. I locked in a decent interest rate, and have some extra cash to apply to the loan after meeting the 80% LTV with the down payment (I paid over list and appraisal to win the offer). I was wondering if it makes sense to apply more cash toward down payment or points, or nothing more? For reference, we plan to stick around in this house for about 10 years.",finance
